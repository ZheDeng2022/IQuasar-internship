      This study will assess the extent of postpartum smoking relapse among Romanian women, the&#xD;
      associated risk factors, and will develop, implement, and pilot-test a randomized trial&#xD;
      smoking relapse intervention incorporating innovative research concepts in a social and&#xD;
      cultural acceptable manner. The primary hypothesis is that the intervention will increase&#xD;
      mothers' smoking abstinence rates.&#xD;

      Overview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This four-year longitudinal project will enroll a total of 425 women who spontaneously quit&#xD;
      smoking during pregnancy. The recruitment will take place during the delivery hospital stay&#xD;
      in two of the largest obstetric-gynecology hospitals in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The&#xD;
      investigators will design, pre-test (Objective 1), apply, and evaluate a postpartum smoking&#xD;
      relapse preventive randomized intervention among the first 250 recruited women and their&#xD;
      husbands (Objective 2): 125 couples in the intervention group and 125 couples in the control&#xD;
      group, comparing the women's relapse rates at 6 months postpartum. The project will continue&#xD;
      to enroll and follow-up 175 additional women for a total of 300 not subjected to the&#xD;
      intervention (125+175) to assess the extent of postpartum smoking relapse and associated risk&#xD;
      factors in a prospective cohort study (Objective 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 6 months of the project consisted of a preparatory phase. Objective 1 was completed&#xD;
      in the first 9 months of the project, and milestones included focus groups, interviews with&#xD;
      women, their husbands, and medical staff, the design of the intervention and pre-testing its&#xD;
      acceptability. Objective 2 is completed between months 10-24 of the project. Milestones&#xD;
      include: recruiting 250 couples (months 10-30), applying the intervention (months 10-33), the&#xD;
      follow-up assessment (months 16-36), and preliminary analyses (months 13-36). Objective 3 is&#xD;
      completed between months 19-45 of the project. Milestones include: recruiting 175 additional&#xD;
      women (months 19-39), the follow-up assessment (months 25-45), and preliminary analyses&#xD;
      (months 22-45). The last 12 months (months 37-48) of the project will be used to conclude the&#xD;
      project, including finalizing the database and analyses, preparing a final report, and&#xD;
      preparing articles for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Design, pre-test, and refine an innovative intervention for preventing smoking&#xD;
      relapse after pregnancy to maximize feasibility and potential impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This objective represented the qualitative developmental phase of the postpartum relapse&#xD;
      intervention in order to tailor the intervention to the needs of the target population. The&#xD;
      focus-groups and interviews aimed to qualitatively explore the issues related to the women's&#xD;
      motivation and self-efficacy, the two key components of the planned intervention. To develop&#xD;
      the postpartum smoking relapse intervention strategy the Motivation and Problem Solving&#xD;
      (MAPS) strategy of Reitzel and colleagues was followed, the newest approach in the relapse&#xD;
      prevention field, incorporating both motivational and self-efficacy components into the&#xD;
      intervention, adapted to local attitudes and preferences. MAPS was successful in preventing&#xD;
      relapse. The intervention is based on Motivational Interviewing and the seminal relapse&#xD;
      prevention model, probably the most prominent theory of smoking cessation and relapse.&#xD;
      Self-efficacy is viewed as the principal causal determinant of successful abstinence, among&#xD;
      other individual and contextual factors, is hypothesized to increase. The model also&#xD;
      specifies that the individual needs to be sufficiently motivated to avoid relapse. Briefly,&#xD;
      the phone counseling sessions consist of information about the benefits of abstinence to&#xD;
      increase motivation, and helping women identify and manage high-risk relapse situations,&#xD;
      therefore enhancing their self-efficacy. The aim is to deliver consistent repeated advice by&#xD;
      a trained professional over the phone in the postpartum period. Following the newest&#xD;
      approaches in the field, the smoking husbands/partners are also targeted with brief&#xD;
      motivational advice using the birth as a teachable moment to quit. Two psychologists were&#xD;
      trained to deliver the phone motivational advice. Self help materials were also created and&#xD;
      are distributed to all 250 women participating in the trial. A randomization algorithm was&#xD;
      set up to assign patients into the intervention or control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Implement and evaluate an intervention to prevent maternal smoking relapse after&#xD;
      pregnancy in a randomized controlled trial setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. The aim is to recruit 250 pre-randomized (125 intervention vs. 125 control&#xD;
      group) mothers at birth who quit smoking in the 2 months before pregnancy or no later than&#xD;
      the end of 1st pregnancy trimester and remained abstinent until delivery, biochemically&#xD;
      confirmed through expired carbon monoxide. The mothers are approached during the delivery&#xD;
      hospital stay in two of the largest obstetrics-gynecology clinics in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.&#xD;
      Enrollment criteria include willingness and ability to participate in the study, age 18 or&#xD;
      older, married or living with a stable partner, with a mobile phone, and willing to provide&#xD;
      mobile phone contact for their husband or partner. Their husband or life partner is also&#xD;
      approached and invited into the study at recruitment, if present, or by phone in the first&#xD;
      weeks after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures. At enrollment, all 250 participants are given self-help materials and 5-10 min of&#xD;
      brief advice offered by the trained research personnel consisting of encouragement to remain&#xD;
      quit, and a review of the smoking risks and the benefits of abstinence. The mothers in the&#xD;
      intervention group additionally receive three telephone-based counseling sessions delivered&#xD;
      by trained professionals over the phone at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after birth. All&#xD;
      smoking husbands or partners of the mothers in the intervention group are contacted in the&#xD;
      first weeks after birth and are offered one phone motivational session to quit and support&#xD;
      their wife's abstinence. To incentivize the couples to remain in the study and to appreciate&#xD;
      their time and effort, gift certificates are mailed for baby-related merchandise around the&#xD;
      1-month and 6-month follow-up contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. The project follows-up with the couples at 6 months postpartum. Postpartum maternal&#xD;
      abstinence is the main outcome, defined as maintaining smoke-free status continuously until&#xD;
      the 6-month follow-up. The postpartum maternal abstinence is biochemically verified through&#xD;
      expired carbon monoxide (CO) at 6-months postpartum (CO) &lt;10 ppm. Secondary outcomes of&#xD;
      interest are the maternal number of cigarettes smoked, self-efficacy, and motivation. The&#xD;
      self-reported smoke status of the husband/partner is another outcome of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal characteristics. An extended prenatal questionnaire is used at recruitment and at&#xD;
      the 6-month follow-up. Based on the prior literature on the predictors of postpartum relapse,&#xD;
      the questionnaire includes demographics (such as age, education, and ethnicity), health&#xD;
      history (prior pregnancies history, contraception use and feelings about the pregnancy),&#xD;
      mental health (depressive symptoms, stress, anxiety), nicotine dependence before quitting, an&#xD;
      extensive section on smoking knowledge and attitudes, other substance use, breast feeding,&#xD;
      and having a life partner who smokes (as reported by the new mother).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical plan. The required sample (100 intervention vs. 100 control at final follow-up)&#xD;
      was calculated assuming abstinence rates of 0.3-0.4 (70% or 60% relapse) in the control group&#xD;
      compared to anticipated 0.5-0.6 in intervention group, in order to attain 80% statistical&#xD;
      power to detect the difference in two-tailed comparisons, alpha 0.05. Beginning with 125&#xD;
      couples in the intervention vs. 125 in the control group at enrollment, consistent with prior&#xD;
      projects in Romania, 20% attrition is assumed by the final follow-up at 6 months after birth&#xD;
      (100 vs. 100). To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, initially unadjusted&#xD;
      comparisons of the outcomes in intervention vs. the control groups will be performed.&#xD;
      Regression analyses will be used to adjust for group dissimilarities when differences have&#xD;
      p-values less than 0.10. A cost-benefit analysis of the intervention will also be performed.&#xD;
      The intervention costs will be compared to the health benefits derived from increased mother&#xD;
      abstinence rates, increased father quit rates, and reduced family exposure to tobacco smoke.&#xD;
      The health benefits will be monetized using estimates available in the research literature.&#xD;
      In addition, economic analyses will be presented for various scenarios in which the proposed&#xD;
      intervention can be integrated and sustained in the existing Romanian health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3. Assess the extent of postpartum smoking relapse and associated risk factors&#xD;
      among women who spontaneously quit smoking during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. To assemble a larger sample of women who quit smoking during pregnancy, 175&#xD;
      additional women are recruited during the delivery hospital stay, for a total of 300 (125&#xD;
      from Objective 2 + 175) women not subjected to the intervention. For consistency, they are&#xD;
      offered the same self-help materials, brief advice, and gift certificate incentives (see&#xD;
      Objective 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and maternal characteristics. Postpartum maternal abstinence at 6 months postpartum&#xD;
      are the main outcome of interest. A secondary outcome of interest is the maternal number of&#xD;
      cigarettes smoked postpartum. Associations with all the maternal characteristics described&#xD;
      above will be explored(see Objective 2), with a particular focus on the mental health, the&#xD;
      nicotine dependence before quitting, breast feeding, and having a partner who smokes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical plan. Descriptive and multivariate analyses will be used to compare the women who&#xD;
      relapse to the ones who remain abstinent. Descriptive analyses (counts and percentages) will&#xD;
      assess the extent of postpartum smoking relapse and explore unadjusted associations between&#xD;
      various characteristics and risk factors of the women and their postpartum smoking status:&#xD;
      abstinent vs. relapsed. Multivariate logistic analyses will uncover the independent,&#xD;
      adjusted, effects of individual and interacted factors, statistically adjusting for the&#xD;
      effects of all other variables included in the analysis.&#xD;
