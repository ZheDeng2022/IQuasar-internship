  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primaquine (PQ) is currently the only available drug that can clear the mature transmission&#xD;
      stages of P. falciparum parasites. PQ was previously shown to clear gametocytes that persist&#xD;
      after artemisinin-combination therapy. A major caveat to the use of primaquine in mass&#xD;
      adminsitrations for the reduction of malaria transmission is that metabolism of the drug in&#xD;
      individuals with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can lead to transient&#xD;
      haemolysis. The haemolytic side effect of PQ is dose-related. Haemolysis is more commonly&#xD;
      observed after prolonged PQ treatment but has also been observed in African populations&#xD;
      following a single dose of PQ. This haemolysis was self-limiting, largely restricted to G6PD&#xD;
      deficient individuals and did not lead to clinical symptoms. Nevertheless, any drug-induced&#xD;
      haemolysis is reason for concern and the World Health Organization has therefore reduced the&#xD;
      recommended dose of single low dose primaquine from 0.75mg/kg to 0.25mg/kg. This dosage is&#xD;
      deemed safe without prior G6PD or Hb screening. However, there is limited direct evidence on&#xD;
      the extent to which this dosage of PQ prevents malaria transmission to mosquitoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the investigators will assess the efficacy of DP in combination with&#xD;
      low-dose PQ to prevent onward malaria transmission. The investigators will perform the&#xD;
      investigators study in individuals aged 5-15 years who are carry microscopically detectable&#xD;
      densities of P. falciparum gametocytes. This age group is chosen because asexual parasite&#xD;
      carriage and gametocyte carriage are common in this age group. All enrolled individuals will&#xD;
      receive a full three-day course of DP, and will be randomized to receive a dose of primaquine&#xD;
      or placebo with their third dose. Efficacy will be determined based on gametocyte carriage&#xD;
      during follow-up, measured by molecular methods. For all individuals, the effect of treatment&#xD;
      on infectivity to mosquitoes will be assessed by membrane feeding assays at two time points.&#xD;
