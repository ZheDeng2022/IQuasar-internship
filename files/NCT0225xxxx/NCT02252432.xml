  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine the pain-reducing effects of ketamine (Ketalar,&#xD;
      an FDA-approved drug for anesthesia) and methadone (Dolophine, a long-acting narcotic) after&#xD;
      lumbar laminectomy. The investigators would like to evaluate whether intraoperative use of&#xD;
      both drugs may be able to provide better control of pain after lumbar surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During and after the surgery, patients undergoing surgery most likely need narcotics&#xD;
      (opioids) that can cause side effects such as drowsiness and constipation. This can delay&#xD;
      your recovery. The investigator would like to determine if the intraoperative use of ketamine&#xD;
      and methadone will provide better pain control and reduce the use of narcotic painkiller&#xD;
      medications (analgesics) after lumbar surgery as compared to either drug (ketamine or&#xD;
      methadone) alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is used to help to reduce the amount of the commonly used intravenous anesthetic&#xD;
      drugs, minimize heart rate and blood pressure instability during surgery, and to improve&#xD;
      outcomes after surgery (e.g. less pain, less constipation, less nausea and vomiting after&#xD;
      surgery, faster return of bowel function and shortened length of hospital stay).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used: as an&#xD;
      anesthetic and analgesic (painkiller). Ketamine is an &quot;adjuvant,&quot; which is a drug that may&#xD;
      increase the effectiveness or strength of other drugs when given at the same time. Ketamine&#xD;
      is administered as an adjuvant during anesthesia to produce anesthetic and analgesic-sparing&#xD;
      effects (reduce the amount of anesthetics and narcotics-painkiller drugs), hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability (to maintain the blood pressure and heart rate within normal rank) and side effect&#xD;
      reduction (e.g., constipation, nausea and vomiting, itching, and urinary retention). Ketamine&#xD;
      will be used as approved in this study. Ketamine is frequently used intraoperatively for pain&#xD;
      control in patients undergoing spine surgery at our institution and is within the standard of&#xD;
      care. The standard of care indicates that this is one possible method which has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be safe and effective for patient care. This may vary at different&#xD;
      institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methadone is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used: as an opioid&#xD;
      pain reliever, similar to morphine, and for narcotic detoxification to reduce withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms. The dose of methadone that will be used in this study may be slightly higher than&#xD;
      the approved dose depending on the subject's weight. However, this dose of methadone is&#xD;
      frequently used intraoperatively for pain control in patients undergoing spine surgery at our&#xD;
      institution and is within the standard of care. This may vary at different institutions.&#xD;
