    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single ascending&#xD;
      dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of oral&#xD;
      administration of HPN-07 in single doses to approximately 32 healthy male and female subjects&#xD;
      between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive single oral doses of the study drug. The primary endpoint of this trial&#xD;
      is to establish the safety and tolerability of HPN-07 and HPN-07 plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC).&#xD;

      This study is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single ascending&#xD;
      dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of oral&#xD;
      administration of HPN-07 in single doses to healthy male and female subjects between 18 and&#xD;
      55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled in a panel of 4 cohorts with approximately 8&#xD;
      subjects per cohort. There will be approximately 3 sequential ascending dosing levels of&#xD;
      HPN-07, with each cohort administered 1 dose of HPN-07 ranging from 500 mg to 1,500 mg and&#xD;
      the fourth cohort administered the highest tolerated dose of HPN-07 plus 1,200 mg NAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this trial is to establish the safety and tolerability of HPN-07 and&#xD;
      HPN-07 plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis of HPN-07 will enable a&#xD;
      preliminary determination of the relationship between dose and the time course of the drug&#xD;
      concentration in the body. Blood samples will be collected at regular intervals over the&#xD;
      predicted time of HPN-07 systemic exposure.&#xD;

             abnormality identified on the medical or laboratory evaluation, including 12-lead&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG). A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory&#xD;
             parameters outside the reference range for this age group may be included only if the&#xD;
             Investigator considers that the finding will not introduce additional risk factors and&#xD;
             will not interfere with the study procedures (as defined as the research site's&#xD;
             standard operating procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;

             subdermal implants, female condom, contraceptive patch, or contraceptive vaginal ring;&#xD;
             and/or 2) has had a tubal ligation or hysterectomy. These criteria must be followed&#xD;
             from the time of the first dose of study medication until 14 days after the last dose&#xD;
             of study medication. Men must also abstain from sperm donation from the time of the&#xD;

             for at least 2 months after the last study drug administration. Medically acceptable&#xD;
             forms of contraception include abstinence, hormonal contraceptives (oral, patch or&#xD;
             vaginal ring), intrauterine device, progestin implant or injection, bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, or double-barrier methods (i.e., male condom in addition to a diaphragm or a&#xD;
