      A phase I prospective, randomized study in healthy adult subjects at a single center. Adult&#xD;
      subjects age 18 to 47 years and meeting all enrollment criteria will choose to participate as&#xD;
      subjects who receive inactivated vaccine followed by a live vaccine boost at 4 weeks (Group&#xD;
      1), 12 weeks (Group 2), or 24 weeks (Group 3), or to be in an observational group (Group 4)&#xD;
      which will not be scheduled for a booster dose but may serve as a roll-over group for&#xD;
      subjects who withdraw prior to the second vaccination but agree to remain in follow-up. A&#xD;
      fifth group will receive two intramuscular doses of adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV separated by four&#xD;
      weeks. The primary objectives of this study are to (1) assess the safety of H7N9 pLAIV&#xD;
      administered to individuals who have previously received MF59-adjuvanted or unadjuvanted H7N9&#xD;
      pIIV, (2) evaluate the ability of a single dose of unadjuvanted H7N9 pIIV to prime for&#xD;
      enhanced immunogenicity (booster response) to subsequent administration of&#xD;
      antigenically-matched H7N9 pLAIV vaccine, and to (3) evaluate the ability of a single dose of&#xD;
      MF59-adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV to prime for enhanced immunogenicity (booster response) to&#xD;
      subsequent administration of antigenically-matched H7N9 pLAIV vaccine.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted as a Phase I prospective, randomized study in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects at a single center. Adult subjects age 18 to 47 years and meeting all enrollment&#xD;
      criteria will choose to participate as subjects who receive unadjuvanted or adjuvanted H7H9&#xD;
      pIIV vaccine followed by a live vaccine boost at 4 weeks (Group 1, n=24), 12 weeks (Group 2,&#xD;
      n=24), or 24 weeks (Group 3, n=24), or to be in an observational group (Group 4, n=16) which&#xD;
      will not be scheduled for a booster dose but may serve as a roll-over group for subjects who&#xD;
      withdraw prior to the second vaccination but agree to remain in follow-up. Within each group,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either unadjuvanted&#xD;
      H7N9 pIIV at 15 mcg (Subgroup A), or the same vaccine adjuvanted with the oil-in-water&#xD;
      emulsion, MF59, (Subgroup B) delivered intramuscularly. Finally, a fifth group (Group 5,&#xD;
      n=12) will receive two intramuscular doses of adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV separated by four weeks.&#xD;
      The total duration of study participation for all subjects will be approximately 13 months.&#xD;
      Recruitment, enrollment and administration of study product will be suspended when one of the&#xD;
      following occurs in the clinical or research laboratory at the clinical site: at least two&#xD;
      respiratory cultures or PCR assays are determined to be positive for influenza or at least&#xD;
      10% diagnostic tests (rapid tests, respiratory cultures or PCR assays) performed for&#xD;
      influenza as positive during two consecutive weeks in the clinical or research laboratory at&#xD;
      the clinical site. Recruitment, enrollment and administration of study product may be resumed&#xD;
      after 2 weeks without a signal that influenza is still circulating in the community, as&#xD;
      defined by the same measures that indicate the start of influenza season (i.e., less than 2&#xD;
      respiratory cultures or PCR assays are determined to positive for influenza or less than 10%&#xD;
      of diagnostic tests performed or influenza with positive results). The primary objectives of&#xD;
      this study are to (1) assess the safety of H7N9 pLAIV administered to individuals who have&#xD;
      previously received MF59-adjuvanted or unadjuvanted H7N9 pIIV, (2) evaluate the ability of a&#xD;
      single dose of unadjuvanted H7N9 pIIV to prime for enhanced immunogenicity (booster response)&#xD;
      to subsequent administration of antigenically-matched H7N9 pLAIV vaccine, and to (3) evaluate&#xD;
      the ability of a single dose of MF59-adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV to prime for enhanced&#xD;
      immunogenicity (booster response) to subsequent administration of antigenically-matched H7N9&#xD;
      pLAIV vaccine. The secondary objectives of this study are to (1) assess the safety of priming&#xD;
      with MF59-adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV or unadjuvanted H7N9 pIIV, (2) assess the immune response in&#xD;
      subjects vaccinated with a single dose of MF59-adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV or a single dose of&#xD;
      unadjuvanted H7N9 pIIV, and to (3) compare the booster effect seen after intervals of 4&#xD;
      weeks, 12 weeks, or 24 weeks within each priming group.&#xD;
