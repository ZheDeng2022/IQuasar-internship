&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients aged 18 years or above&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an acute onset of a focal neurological deficit secondary to a lesion&#xD;
             presumed to be ischemic in etiology involving the carotid and/or vertebrobasilar&#xD;
             artery territories&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Onset of symptoms within 24 hours prior to initiation of administration of study drug.&#xD;
             If the patient has awakened from sleep with the deficit, the time of onset will be&#xD;
             considered as the last time he/she was normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stroke symptoms are to be present for at least 1 hour and are still present at&#xD;
             randomisation. Symptoms must be distinguishable from an episode of generalised&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing to participate voluntarily and to sign a written patient informed&#xD;
             consent. Informed consent will be obtained from each Patient (or the subject's&#xD;
             representative or relatives, depending on local regulations) according to Good&#xD;
             Clinical Practice and regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country.&#xD;
             Patients who are unable to sign but who are able to understand the meaning of&#xD;
             participation in the study may give an oral witnessed informed consent. These patients&#xD;
             have to make clear undoubtfully that they are wiling to participate voluntarily and&#xD;
             must be able to understand an Explanation of the contents of the Information sheet&#xD;
