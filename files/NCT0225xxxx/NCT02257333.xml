      The retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common retinal disease after diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy, and is a common cause of unilateral visual loss. The risk factors that&#xD;
      predispose to RVO are many and are generally the same as those found in vascular alterations&#xD;
      involving other parts of the body, as in the case of stroke or coronary heart disease.&#xD;
      Several authors have attempted to determine whether the pathogenesis of RVO can be of&#xD;
      arterial type, considering the disease as consequent to atherosclerosis, rather than&#xD;
      resulting from venous disease. Although less frequent than the other diseases RVO affects&#xD;
      considerably on health care costs. Direct medical costs showed that in one year a patient&#xD;
      with this disease has a higher than average cost for a patient with hypertension or glaucoma.&#xD;
      Knowing the prevalence of the disease in Italy and identify modifiable risk factors,&#xD;
      recognizing additional risk factors related to gender, genetic predisposition and especially&#xD;
      the social-economic and cultural background in the pathogenesis of RVO, are the objectives&#xD;
      that led to the planning of this study. In order to assess the prevalence of the disease and&#xD;
      the current &quot;clinical practice&quot; we aim to create an online register between Italian&#xD;
      specialist centers (ophthalmic emergency care and thrombosis centers) with immediate&#xD;
      portability and usability of the data.&#xD;

      The retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common retinal disease after diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy, and is a common cause of unilateral visual loss. The occlusion of a branch of&#xD;
      the central retinal vein (BRVO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) are two topics&#xD;
      discussed and very deserving of further study, especially for the need of greater clarity&#xD;
      arising from the availability of new diagnostic and especially therapeutic opportunities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature on the prevalence of RVO is not particularly rich, and the results of the&#xD;
      available studies are very heterogeneous because such studies are conducted on a few cases,&#xD;
      using different methodologies and are mainly characterized by a different distribution of&#xD;
      risk factors among the different populations. In this regard, it was particularly interesting&#xD;
      a publication of 2010 which proposed a combined analysis of the main study population&#xD;
      (population based study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of the final analysis was of 49 869 subjects, and the results showed that the&#xD;
      retinal vein occlusion overall prevalence, standardized for age and sex, is 5.2 per 1000, of&#xD;
      which 4.42 and 0.80 to BRVO and CRVO respectively. Despite the slightly higher prevalence in&#xD;
      females, this difference wasn't statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, the prevalence of venous occlusion increases with increasing age in a&#xD;
      statistically significant manner, both in the overall analysis of the occlusions of branch&#xD;
      and central, that for the individual entities. This pattern is characteristic of chronic&#xD;
      degenerative diseases and in fact the RVO has a behavior very similar to that of these&#xD;
      diseases, probably because the risk factors (especially those such as atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      systemic hypertension) increases with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results provided by these systematic analysis are particularly important because they&#xD;
      provide a reliable estimate of RVO prevalence in general population; must be considered,&#xD;
      however, the inherent limitations mainly concerning potential sources of heterogeneity, such&#xD;
      as different methodologies used, the fact that most of the studies were carried out on a&#xD;
      single ethnic group, often with different distribution of risk factors and therefore were not&#xD;
      suitable to capture these differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk factors predisposing to RVO are many and are generally the same as those found in&#xD;
      vascular alterations involving other parts of the body as in the case of stroke or coronary&#xD;
      heart disease. Several authors have attempted to determine whether the disease can be&#xD;
      consequent to atherosclerosis and therefore caused by arterial disease rather than the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of venous disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a very variable delay between the onset of symptoms and initiation of treatment; the&#xD;
      excessive delay of treatment was considered an exclusion criterion in only a minority of the&#xD;
      studies considered. Although it is very difficult to estimate the age of the thrombotic&#xD;
      event, early identification is surely preferable and the treatment time is a critical factor&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic strategy. Because of the relatively small number of&#xD;
      patients is not possible to determine which therapy is more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently new experimental therapeutic approaches have been proposed, such as intravitreal&#xD;
      administration of various drugs (steroids, anti-VEGF). It is not yet clear whether these&#xD;
      approaches can eliminate the need for anticoagulant therapy during the acute phase of the&#xD;
      disease. Surely antithrombotic drugs may have a role in the treatment of the acute phase of&#xD;
      the RVO, at least in some categories of patients, and can be used in association with&#xD;
      intravitreal drugs. Future studies should also explore the possibility of combined&#xD;
      approaches. The retinal vein occlusion is a disease related to age and surely there will be&#xD;
      an increase in social-economic impact of this disease due to the increase in population of&#xD;
      the most advanced age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the social-economic impact should be considered in addition to visual impairment&#xD;
      related to the disease, the impact on quality of life of the patient and the direct medical&#xD;
      costs of retinal vein thrombosis have shown that in one year a patient with this disease has&#xD;
      an average cost 20% higher than a hypertensive patient (BRVO: + 16%; CRVO: + 22%) or glaucoma&#xD;
      ones (BRVO: + 18%; CRVO: + 24%); Therefore, although it is less frequent than the other&#xD;
      diseases RVO affects considerably on health care costs. The data available in the literature&#xD;
      show that in the overall one year management, direct costs that have the greatest impact, in&#xD;
      percentage terms, are the costs associated with ocular pathology caused by acute event&#xD;
      (thrombosis) and diagnostic tests. After three years, however, the cost is linked to systemic&#xD;
      disease (hospitalization) has a bigger impact in percentage terms, as if to indicate that&#xD;
      retinal vein thrombosis is nothing more than an epiphenomenon of systemic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating Modes The study will be divided into 4 phases: Step 1: establishment of the&#xD;
      network: identification of specialized facilities (ophthalmic emergency care and thrombosis&#xD;
      centers), which may accept patients with suspected RVO, which will participate in the&#xD;
      establishment of the register online; Step 2: Create the registry and recruitment of patients&#xD;
      cohort; Step 3: Follow-up planned (1 month) for instrumental tests to confirm the diagnosis&#xD;
      of RVO; Step 4: Observational follow-up supported by dedicated web platform for the&#xD;
      identification of major adverse cardiovascular events, in order to export in the context of&#xD;
      clinical acquisitions epidemiological and disease management in real time.&#xD;
