    <textblock>
      A recent province-wide survey (Alberta, Canada) suggests that clinicians' beliefs about soft&#xD;
      lumbar bracing for low back pain (LBP) vary substantially. Approximately 50% of clinicians&#xD;
      (MDs, DCs, PTs) find back braces &quot;useful&quot; for acute back pain while the remaining half report&#xD;
      that bracing causes muscle atrophy. While previous studies suggest bracing for acute low back&#xD;
      conditions can reduce pain and does not cause atrophy, no prior study has assessed back&#xD;
      function after bracing using self-reported and objective measures within the same cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess both self-reported and objective measures of spine function before, and after, use&#xD;
      of an inelastic lumbar brace over a two week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before-After Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-reported spine function, spinal stiffness and muscle endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups were studied: asymptomatics who did not wear a brace (-LBP/-Brace),&#xD;
      asymptomatics who were braced (-LBP/+Brace) and acute LBP subjects who were braced&#xD;
      (+LBP/+Brace). Both groups of braced subjects (-LBP/+Brace; +LBP/+Brace) were instructed to&#xD;
      wear the brace continually for 2 weeks with the exception of bedroom &amp; bathroom activities.&#xD;
      Before and after the 2 week period, 3 measures of spine function were performed: spinal&#xD;
      stiffness via motorized indentation of the L3 spinous process, a modified Sorensen test&#xD;
      (timed lumbar extension against gravity), and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Unbraced&#xD;
      (-LBP/-Brace) subjects were studied over the same time with the same measures. Repeated&#xD;
      measures analyses of variance were conducted for all three outcomes with a significance level&#xD;
      of 0.05.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: While various treatments for low back pain (LBP) are prescribed, one in&#xD;
      particular appears to be frequently self-prescribed: external lumbar bracing (i.e. elastic&#xD;
      corsets and other similar devices). Given that the mechanical function of the back is to bear&#xD;
      static and dynamic loads and that most LBP is thought to be mechanical in nature, there is a&#xD;
      biological plausibility that underlies bracing as a treatment for LBP Indeed, several reports&#xD;
      suggest lumbar bracing may be effective for some LBP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high frequency of self-prescribed bracing may be the result of the clinical community's&#xD;
      reluctance to prescribe these devices. Approximately half of Alberta spine clinicians believe&#xD;
      that spine bracing results in muscle atrophy and/or future dependency on braces. Conversely,&#xD;
      recent work from our laboratory has shown that after two weeks of brace wearing, the volume&#xD;
      of spinal muscles remains unchanged in asymptomatic subjects (i.e. no brace-induced atrophy&#xD;
      was caused)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and hypothesis: While bracing for 14 days does not result in decreased muscle&#xD;
      volume in asymptomatic subjects, there is a need to understand if bracing preserves muscle&#xD;
      volume while muscle function declines. This information would allow us to understand the&#xD;
      effects of bracing on spinal function independent of changes in muscle volume. Therefore, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that that brace-wearing will result in an insignificant alteration in spinal&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future Relevance: Results from this pilot study will allow us to construct future&#xD;
      investigations to reveal the underlying mechanisms of bracing with respect to the alleviation&#xD;
      of LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Subjects of both genders between the ages of 18 and 65 will be recruited from the&#xD;
      University of Alberta and surrounding area. The target recruitment populations are 1)&#xD;
      asymptomatic subjects and 2) those with low back pain. Subjects excluded from the study will&#xD;
      have a history of back pain with red flags, those who are pregnant (or believe they may be&#xD;
      pregnant) or other contraindications described in the full protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Potential subjects will complete a survey to obtain demographic data as well as a&#xD;
      focused medical history and physical examination performed by one of the research team. If a&#xD;
      subject meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria and provides written, informed consent, they&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. Those not able to be enrolled will be thanked and dismissed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asymptomatic subjects will be assigned randomly into a brace and non-brace cohort. From the&#xD;
      recruited subjects, three cohorts will be created: 1) Asymptomatic subjects who will wear a&#xD;
      brace (-LBP/Brace+), 2) asymptomatic subjects who will not wear a brace (-LBP/-Brace) and 3)&#xD;
      low back pain subjects who will wear a brace (+LBP/+Brace). Because this experiment is not&#xD;
      designed to assess brace efficacy, there is no need to include a cohort of symptomatic&#xD;
      subjects who do not wear a brace. Each subject who will wear a brace will be fitted and sized&#xD;
      for an elastic brace supplied at no charge to the subject. Subjects will be instructed on how&#xD;
      to don and remove the brace as well as the circumstances when they are permitted to remove&#xD;
      the brace (washroom, shower, sleep). The subject will also be informed that the brace has a&#xD;
      monitoring feature to determine brace compliance as well as their activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as possible after brace fitting, a battery of tests will be conducted to determine&#xD;
      each subject's spinal function. These tests are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Oswestry Disability Index (OWDI). The OWDI is a self-reported measure of function.&#xD;
           The OWDI has established reliability and validity and has been used extensively in low&#xD;
           back pain research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Spinal Stiffness testing. This test uses a blunt probe to push into the back of a&#xD;
           resting subject to measure the stiffness of the spine. It was developed in our lab and&#xD;
           has been used in many prior studies both at the Universities of Alberta, Hong Kong and&#xD;
           Utah.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rehabilitation Ultrasound Imaging (RUSI). This test uses ultrasound to image spine&#xD;
           muscles during simple tasks (e.g. arm raising) to quantify the ability of the back&#xD;
           muscles to contract with the desired magnitude and timing. This test is well-described&#xD;
           in the literature and has been approved for use previously in our laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Modified Sorensen test. This is a timed test of spine function where subjects are asked&#xD;
           to straighten their backs from a semi-inclined position until pain onset and/or failure&#xD;
           to maintain the target position. The test, and its variants, has been well-studied since&#xD;
           it was first described in 1984. The modified version of the test to be used here has&#xD;
           been shown to be safe to perform in acute back pain subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will now be released to their usual activities of daily living for a period of 14&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if there are any problems in subjects wearing braces, those subjects will be&#xD;
      contacted by the PI or research team within the first 24 hours following brace fitting and&#xD;
      then approximately every three days after that time. If a correction to the brace cannot be&#xD;
      made that is satisfactory to the research team and the subject, the subject will thanked and&#xD;
      dismissed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the two week experiment period, subjects will attend the laboratory. Usage data&#xD;
      will then be extracted from the data logger of those wearing braces. If the subject has worn&#xD;
      the brace for less than 75% of the requested time, the subject will be dismissed and thanked&#xD;
      for their participation. If subjects have worn the brace for more than 75% of the requested&#xD;
      time, the spinal function tests will be performed for a second time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change scores of each of the 5 spine function tests will be calculated and then compared&#xD;
      between the three cohort using an analysis of variance (alpha = 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: Given our prior data that muscle volume does not changes after 14 days of&#xD;
      bed rest, it is expected that brace-wearing will not reduce spinal function in symptomatic or&#xD;
      asymptomatic populations.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects enrolled in the study will be between the ages of 18 and 65 and include both&#xD;
        genders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Asymptomatic subjects will be asymptomatic for low back pain for a period of 3 months or&#xD;
        more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Symptomatic subjects will have non-specific low back pain that is of an acute or chronic&#xD;
        nature. Recruiting those with non-specific low back pain ensures that we are not enrolling&#xD;
        subjects with a specific cause for back pain (eg, spinal fracture) for which spinal&#xD;
        function testing is contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specific to the spinal function tests used here, excluded subjects will include those with&#xD;
        suspected or confirmed malignancy as the cause for back pain, spinal fracture (current or&#xD;
        within the last 5 years), previous non-day surgery to the abdomen, spine pelvis or hips,&#xD;
        presence of nerve root involvement (presence of at least 2 of the 3: myotomal weakness,&#xD;
        altered sensation in dermatomal patterns, and/or altered knee/ankle reflexes), ankylosing&#xD;
        spondylitis and current skin conditions that may be aggravated by bracing, These exclusion&#xD;
        criteria relate to back conditions for which spinal function testing is contraindicated&#xD;
        (eg, malignancy) or in which there is a greater chance of causing discomfort (eg, nerve&#xD;
        root involvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        General exclusion criteria include: osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis (or taking any&#xD;
        disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs), pregnancy or suspected pregnancy, known severe&#xD;
        spondylolisthesis, severe scoliosis, Type I diabetes mellitus, hyperparathyroidism,&#xD;
        hyperthyroidism, inability to lie prone for at least 40 minutes, inability to tolerate back&#xD;
        extension or spinal indentation (eg, indentations cause discomfort), inability to speak or&#xD;
        read English (to ensure that participants understand what is happening and can reliably&#xD;
        relay any discomfort). People currently taking muscle relaxants will also be excluded. In&#xD;
        addition, subjects who are hypertensive, or are prone to hypertension (smokers), will be&#xD;
        excluded from this study as will subjects who have a history of aortic aneurysm. Although&#xD;
        hypertension and aortic aneurysm are not contraindications to lumbar bracing, we will&#xD;
        exclude them from this trial. Finally, some persons with low or high body mass indexes may&#xD;
        not be eligible to participate if they are unable to be fitted properly with a brace.&#xD;
        Subjects will also be excluded if they feel they would be unable to lie prone (i.e.&#xD;
        face-down) for up to 1 hour during spinal stiffness and RUSI testing.&#xD;
