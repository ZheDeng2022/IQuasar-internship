      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Drinking grapefruit juice changes how long it takes some medicines to be broken down in the&#xD;
      body. Researchers have found that a substance in grapefruit juice called DHB contributes to&#xD;
      this effect. Some dietary supplements contain DHB and claim to increase the absorption of any&#xD;
      and all supplements, medicine or any other drug. But these usually contain a lot more DHB&#xD;
      than a glass of grapefruit juice. Researchers want to study the effects of grapefruit juice&#xD;
      and supplements with DHB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare how a certain dietary supplement (sold as DHB-300 ) versus grapefruit juice&#xD;
      affects how long it takes a person s body to break down medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers ages 18 - 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 3 treatment visits. Participants cannot drive themselves home&#xD;
           from the visits. Each visit lasts about 13.5 hours and includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about medications and participant s health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A finger probe to measure oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine sampling throughout the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An IV line inserted into an arm vein. It will stay there throughout the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Midazolam hydrochloride a syrup given to make people sleepy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loperamide a tablet for treating diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 glass of water, 1 glass of grapefruit juice, or 1 pill of DHB-300. A different one&#xD;
           will be given at each treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One week before each visit, participants cannot have certain fruits and juices. They&#xD;
           must fast the night before each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the 3 days after each visit, participants will return to the clinic 4 times. Their&#xD;
           vital signs will be checked and blood will be drawn.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      6 ,7 -dihydroxybergamottin (DHB) is one of the components of grapefruit juice and is a known&#xD;
      irreversible inhibitor of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). A single serving (240 mL) of&#xD;
      grapefruit juice (GFJ) contains less than or equal to 5 mg of DHB. The pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      boosting effect of GFJ has fueled the marketing of dietary supplements labeled to contain DHB&#xD;
      e.g. DHB 300 (TM) and Trisorbagen that enhance absorption naturally, While these supplements&#xD;
      have been found to inhibit CYP3A activity, the DHB content in these supplements is much lower&#xD;
      than that, of GFJ. Moreover, the effects of such supplements on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      CYP3A-metabolized drugs are largely unknown. This single-center, open-label, randomized,&#xD;
      3-period, single-dose, crossover study in healthy volunteers will compare the drug&#xD;
      interaction risk of a dietary supplement known to affect CYP3A with GFJ. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to compare the effects of a supplement known to affect CYP3A&#xD;
      (e.g.Trisorbagen) with those of GFJ and water on the pharmacokinetics of two model&#xD;
      substrates, the FDA-recommended CYP3A probe substrate midazolam, and the dual&#xD;
      CYP3A/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate loperamide. This dual-probe substrate approach to&#xD;
      assess drug interaction risk will provide mechanistic insight into any interaction observed.&#xD;
      Eligible volunteers (n=12) will undergo 3 phases, each comprising an exposure visit and 4&#xD;
      subsequent post-exposure visits to collect blood and urine over 72 or 12 hours, respectively.&#xD;
      Exposure visits will be scheduled at least 2 weeks apart to allow washout between the phases.&#xD;
      At each exposure visit, participants will be administered oral doses of midazolam&#xD;
      hydrochloride (2.5 mg) and loperamide (16 mg) concomitantly with water (240 mL), GFJ (240&#xD;
      mL), or Trisorbagen (with 240 mL water) according to a randomized treatment sequence. Blood&#xD;
      and urine will be collected pre-dose and post-dose over 72 (blood) or 12 (urine) hours for&#xD;
      subsequent analyses of relevant pharmacokinetic outcomes of each probe substrate, including&#xD;
      the primary endpoints area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to&#xD;
      infinity (AUC0-inf) and maximum observed concentration (Cmax). Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      geometric means, estimates of treatment differences, within-subject and between-subject&#xD;
      treatment variance, as well as the 95% confidence intervals around those estimates.&#xD;
