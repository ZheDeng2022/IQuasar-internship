             protocol preparation (review with clinical monitor if questionable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within one month prior to&#xD;
             administration or during the trial&#xD;

             during the trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any laboratory value outside the normal reference range that is of clinical relevance&#xD;
             at screening, according to the judgment of the investigator&#xD;
