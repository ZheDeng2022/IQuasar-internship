      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of everolimus when given&#xD;
      together with brentuximab vedotin in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma that has come&#xD;
      back (relapsed) or is not responding to treatment (refractory). Everolimus may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread by binding to a&#xD;
      protein on the surface of cancer cells and then releasing a cancer-killing substance to them.&#xD;
      Giving everolimus together with brentuximab vedotin may be a better treatment for Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and optimal dose of everolimus given in combination with&#xD;
      brentuximab vedotin in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of everolimus in combination with brentuximab vedotin in&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate duration of response, progression free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate response by positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      based response criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess cytokines and free light chain before and after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) or every other day (QOD) on days 1-21. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 15 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on day 1&#xD;
      and everolimus PO QD or every other day on days 1-84 for 1 course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning on course 17, patients receive everolimus PO QD, QOD, twice&#xD;
      weekly, or thrice weekly on days 1-84. Courses repeat every 84 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;
