      The investigators propose to examine both resting state activity and functional activity&#xD;
      during rumination and during self-processing to study the relationship between neural&#xD;
      correlates of rumination/self-focus and self-processing in major depression and bipolar&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Negative rumination, a specific form of self-focus, characterized by repetitively focusing on&#xD;
      one's symptoms of distress, and the possible causes and consequences of these symptoms, is a&#xD;
      hallmark of depression. Nearly a decade of research has culminated in evidence that the&#xD;
      tendency to engage in negative rumination is highly correlated with depressive symptoms.&#xD;
      Rumination also plays a critical role in the etiology and maintenance of depressed states and&#xD;
      predicts risk for mania in bipolar disorder. Despite the central role of rumination in major&#xD;
      depression and bipolar disorder, there have been few studies to date investigating the&#xD;
      functional neuroanatomy of negative rumination, and no studies of positive rumination. The&#xD;
      few neuroimaging studies that have utilized measures of the tendency to engage in negative&#xD;
      rumination have focused on brain functioning when performing tasks that involve processing&#xD;
      emotional or self-referential stimuli, but they have not studied resting state activity or&#xD;
      functional activity during negative and positive rumination. We are examining both resting&#xD;
      state activity and functional activity during negative and positive rumination and during&#xD;
      self-processing to study the relationship between the neural correlates of&#xD;
      rumination/self-focus and self-processing in major depression and bipolar disorder.&#xD;
