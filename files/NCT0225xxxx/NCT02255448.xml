      Cardiac output (CO) is the volume of blood ejected from the heart and is a product of stroke&#xD;
      volume (SV) vs heart rate (HR). It is closely related to Blood Pressure (BP) by the formula&#xD;
      CO = Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) / Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR). Cardiac output&#xD;
      monitoring is well established and validated for guiding fluid administration and&#xD;
      resuscitation in intensive care and perioperatively in the non-pregnant population. Available&#xD;
      CO monitoring methods may risk maternal health or fetal wellbeing or are unvalidated in the&#xD;
      pregnant population. Invasive and semi-invasive methods of measuring CO such as the pulmonary&#xD;
      artery catheter, the 'gold standard' require invasive arterial or central access negating&#xD;
      their use in all but a select group of labouring women and have potentially serious risks&#xD;
      attached to their usage. Echocardiography is a well-established and validated technique&#xD;
      requiring no invasive access but the requirement for an experienced operator limits routine&#xD;
      usage. It uses an external ultrasound probe to scan the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several novel non-invasive cardiac output monitors have recently come to the market including&#xD;
      the estimated cardiac output esCCO monitor (Nihon Kohden) which uses Pulse Wave Transit Time&#xD;
      (PWTT) to estimate cardiac output. It requires 3-lead Electrocardiography and pulse oximetry&#xD;
      alone which is part of the routine monitoring for high risk patients on the labour ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators research aims to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the esCCO in&#xD;
      pregnant women and subsequently assess its utility during medical interventions such as&#xD;
      epidural analgesia or caesarean section. The initial validation will take place in an&#xD;
      antenatal clinic where women are assessed using Doppler echocardiography. The investigators&#xD;
      will then compare the echocardiography results vs the esCCO results.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The cardiac output (CO) is the volume of blood ejected by the heart each time it beats. It is&#xD;
      the product of stroke volume (SV) and heart rate (HR) and is expressed in litres per minute.&#xD;
      It gives a measure of the performance of the heart as a pump. The normal resting CO of a 70kg&#xD;
      person is approximately 5 to 6 litres/min, due to a resting HR of 70-80 bpm multiplied by an&#xD;
      average SV of 70-80ml. Different organs in the body receive differing proportions of the CO&#xD;
      according to their demand. CO increases significantly in pregnancy due to the growing uterus,&#xD;
      fetus and placenta, and its actual value can be affected by patient position and medical&#xD;
      interventions, such as epidural analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular changes in pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      During pregnancy, the cardiovascular system changes to adapt to the demands of the&#xD;
      uteroplacental unit. CO starts to increase from the first trimester by 35-40%, to a 50% rise&#xD;
      by the end of the second trimester. It remains at this level during the third trimester 1.&#xD;
      The increase in CO occurs due to an increase in HR by up to 25% and SV by up to 30%. There is&#xD;
      a further rise in CO during labour and delivery, which is transient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CO also depends upon patient position, with a 13.5% increase in the left lateral position&#xD;
      from supine. The increase in CO in the left lateral position is the basis for the left&#xD;
      lateral tilt or wedge applied to the pregnant patient when supine. This reduces compression&#xD;
      of the large abdominal blood vessels (aortocaval compression) by the gravid (pregnant) uterus&#xD;
      and allows the CO to be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of the CO distributed to the uterus, kidneys and skin is greater in pregnancy&#xD;
      compared to the non-pregnant state. Uterine blood flow is approximately 500 to 700 ml/min,&#xD;
      which corresponds to 10-12% of the CO 1. More than 80% of this CO perfuses the placenta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar epidurals in labour&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar epidurals are used commonly for analgesia in labour, as well as for anaesthesia for&#xD;
      operative interventions, such as lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS) and instrumental&#xD;
      delivery. It is well known that epidural anaesthesia can cause haemodynamic changes, namely&#xD;
      peripheral vasodilatation and a reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) due to&#xD;
      blockade of the sympathetic nervous system which controls many autonomic functions including&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate 1. This can lead to a reduction in blood pressure if the CO is&#xD;
      maintained, since the three are related by the formula; mean arterial pressure (MAP) = CO x&#xD;
      SVR. If the CO drops, for example due to hypovolaemia (decreased amount of fluid in the&#xD;
      circulation) or postural changes, then there will be a greater decrease in the blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valsalva manoeuvre Originally described in the 17th century, the Valsalva manoeuvre is&#xD;
      performed by attempted exhalation against resistance, usually a closed airway. It is used&#xD;
      routinely to equalize ambient pressure in the inner ear and sinuses ie during air travel or&#xD;
      scuba diving. Medically it is used as a test of cardiac function and the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system which controls the hearts response to stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standardised Valsalva manoeuvre requires a subject to be placed in a semirecumbent&#xD;
      position and produce an expiratory pressure of 40mmHg for 10 seconds2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for measuring cardiac output There are several methods for measuring cardiac output,&#xD;
      but their use in pregnancy may be limited by risks to mother or the effects of the technique&#xD;
      on the developing fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive methods - The &quot;gold standard&quot; CO monitor is the pulmonary artery catheter. This&#xD;
      measures CO using the temperature change of an injectate (the thermodilution principle) as&#xD;
      blood is passing through the cardiac chambers. It is accurate and allows measurement of&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressures, but the obvious drawback is the invasive nature of the device,&#xD;
      coupled with the risks of injury to the heart and pulmonary vessels. Due to its invasive&#xD;
      nature, this is used almost exclusively in patients who are severely unwell, necessitating&#xD;
      central catheterisation. Even so, there is currently no evidence from randomised controlled&#xD;
      trials supporting the use of the pulmonary artery catheters 2. Its use is not possible in&#xD;
      normal pregnancies, as it would be unacceptable to subject patients to the risks of central&#xD;
      catheterisation. Other invasive techniques such as angiography or conductance catheters cause&#xD;
      radiation exposure to the developing fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-invasive methods include LiDCO and PiCCO. The LiDCO monitor uses transpulmonary lithium&#xD;
      dilution via a central line catheter and arterial sampling line for calibration. It then uses&#xD;
      arterial waveform analysis to provide continuous CO measurements. PiCCO uses transpulmonary&#xD;
      thermodilution, again via a central line and arterial sampling line. The disadvantages of&#xD;
      these are that lithium dilution should be avoided in the first trimester and normal&#xD;
      pregnancies do not require central or arterial lines. This negates their use in the normal&#xD;
      pregnant population. However, newer LiDCO products such as the LiDCOrapid have been used in&#xD;
      the literature 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive methods for cardiac output measurement have been the cornerstone of studying&#xD;
      maternal cardiac physiology in normal and pathological pregnancies in the last 20 years,&#xD;
      since the introduction of Doppler echocardiography, around 1985 4. Echocardiographic&#xD;
      techniques aim to estimate the SV, which can then be multiplied by the HR to obtain a CO&#xD;
      value. This can be done using 2D, 3D or Doppler echocardiography 5. The obvious advantage is&#xD;
      that no vascular access or calibration is needed, but an experienced operator is required,&#xD;
      making routine use difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel non-invasive cardiac output monitors have since appeared on the market, such as the&#xD;
      noninvasive cardiac output monitor (NICOM), the ultrasonic cardiac output monitor (USCOM) and&#xD;
      the estimated continuous cardiac output (esCCO) monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The esCCO monitor The esCCO monitor is manufactured by Nihon Kohden6 and uses 3 lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and a pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation probe) to estimate CO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method of measuring CO was shown to correlate well with the trend of CO measured using&#xD;
      the pulmonary artery catheterisation method7, 8. It has also been shown to correlate well&#xD;
      with the echo Doppler during exercise9. Bataille et al (2012) compared the esCCO monitor with&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography for CO measurement in intensive care patients10. The authors&#xD;
      deemed the esCCO to be clinically unacceptable in critically ill patients, although there&#xD;
      were questions about the validity of this study11, 12. This is primarily because of extensive&#xD;
      vasoconstriction and peripheral shut down with the critically ill septic patients. Use of&#xD;
      this device in obstetrics is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The esCCO monitor uses non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), three-lead ECG and pulse oximetry&#xD;
      (SpO2). These modalities are part of routine clinical monitoring, which makes this monitor&#xD;
      ideal for measuring CO in the normal pregnant population. Patients admitted to the labour&#xD;
      ward often require monitoring with at least NIBP and SpO2, hence only the three-lead ECG is&#xD;
      'extra'. By validating this monitor, CO measurement across a variety of clinical scenarios in&#xD;
      the pregnant population will be possible.&#xD;
