      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center post-marketing Study. The Study will commence&#xD;
      as a single phase, with an optional second phase to follow at the discretion of the sponsor.&#xD;
      Up to 300 eligible Subjects with small (&lt; 4.9 mm) intracranial aneurysms, who consent to&#xD;
      Study participation, will be treated in Phase 1 with MicroVention HyperSoft® 3D and&#xD;
      HyperSoft® Helical coils with or without balloon remodeling or stent assistance at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician. The operator, at his/her discretion, may choose to&#xD;
      frame the aneurysm with HyperSoft® 3D or any other bare metal coil but must finish the&#xD;
      remainder of the aneurysm with HyperSoft® 3D and/or HyperSoft® Helical coils. At the&#xD;
      discretion of the sponsor, additional patients, up to 300 patients total for the overall&#xD;
      Study, with eligible aneurysms will be enrolled into Phase 2. In Phase 2, the aneurysm must&#xD;
      be framed with a HydroFrame® or HydroSoft® 3D coil and filled/finished primarily with&#xD;
      hydrogel coils. The intent to treat is to frame, fill and finish with all hydrogel coils.&#xD;
      However, at the discretion of the treating physician, a bare platinum coil may be used to&#xD;
      fill or finish, as long as a minimum of 50% (in total coil length) of hydrogel coils are&#xD;
      used. Data will be collected on immediate and post-treatment angiographic occlusion rates&#xD;
      (RRGS), new peri-procedural imaging-confirmed hemorrhage or ischemic stroke, neurological&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality rates, recurrence rates, bleeding rates, retreatment rates, serious&#xD;
      adverse events, &gt;150 day angiographic occlusion rates (RRGS) and occlusion status. This will&#xD;
      serve to establish the acute and sustained efficacy of EVT of small intracranial aneurysms&#xD;
      with the specified microcoils, aided by balloon and/or stent remodeling where appropriate.&#xD;

      1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are common cerebrovascular&#xD;
      abnormalities. The prevalence of IAs has been reported to be 0.8-2.0% of the population.&#xD;
      [1-3] The most common presentation of IAs is subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the annual&#xD;
      incidence of which varies by geographic region from 10 to 20 per 100,000. [4 5] SAH is a&#xD;
      devastating injury with a case-fatality rate of 51% [5]. Nearly half of its survivors are&#xD;
      functionally incapacitated [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited data on the natural history of small intracranial aneurysms. According to&#xD;
      the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms, the risk of spontaneous&#xD;
      aneurysm rupture is related to aneurysm size and location. ISUIA found aneurysms &lt; 10 mm in&#xD;
      diameter, as opposed to aneurysms 10-24 mm and &gt;25 mm, had relative risks of rupture of 11.6&#xD;
      and 59, respectively. Further follow-up from this cohort showed 5-year bleeding risks of 0%,&#xD;
      2.6%, 14.5%, and 40% for aneurysms less than 7 mm, 7--12 mm, 13--24 mm, and 25 mm or greater,&#xD;
      respectively. Many other authors (Juvela 2000 and Weir 2002) also suggest the risk of small&#xD;
      aneurysm rupture is relatively low. The Sapporo SAH Study group suggests that while the&#xD;
      overall rupture risk of small aneurysms is low, the aneurysm size ratio is a strong predictor&#xD;
      of aneurysm rupture in small (&lt;5mm) intracranial aneurysms [7]. However, some authors and&#xD;
      unpublished data (MUSC) demonstrate that approximately one-third of all ruptured aneurysms&#xD;
      are less than 4 mm in size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular coiling of intracranial aneurysms has been shown to be safe and efficacious in&#xD;
      the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT)&#xD;
      has shown that endovascular coiling can reduce morbidity and mortality compared to clipping&#xD;
      of aneurysms in the setting of SAH. [8]. The goal of endovascular coiling is to prevent&#xD;
      rupture or rebleeding by isolating an aneurysm from the normal blood circulation without&#xD;
      narrowing the parent vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A main concern of endovascular treatment is the long-term durability of treatment, that is to&#xD;
      say that it is possible for the aneurysm to recanalize (recur) after it has been treated with&#xD;
      coils [9]. Some factors in recanalization are incomplete initial occlusion, large aneurysm&#xD;
      size, ruptured aneurysm, partially thrombosed aneurysm, and compaction of the coil mass&#xD;
      within the aneurysm [9 10]. In a Study by Nguyen [11], incomplete initial aneurysm occlusion,&#xD;
      rupture and large aneurysm size were all associated with significant recanalization. Johnston&#xD;
      [12] concluded the degree of occlusion after initial treatment to be a strong predictor of&#xD;
      the risk of subsequent rupture, which justified attempts to completely occlude aneurysms. Two&#xD;
      series of small unruptured intracranial aneurysms [13 14] found recurrence rates between 5.9%&#xD;
      and 16.9% with retreatment rates of 1.7% and 2.9%. The majority of retreatments were in small&#xD;
      wide necked aneurysms. However, the recurrence rates of small aneurysms is much less than&#xD;
      those of large aneurysms (71% vs 35%) [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other main concern with the treatment of small aneurysms (less than 4 mm) is safety,&#xD;
      namely the concern of intraprocedural rupture or thromboembolic events. The ATENA Study&#xD;
      showed that the risk of intraprocedural aneurysm rupture was significantly higher in small&#xD;
      aneurysms (3.7% for 1-6 mm vs 7% for 7-15 mm; p= 0.008). The rate of failure of EVT was&#xD;
      significantly higher in very small unruptured aneurysms compared to larger aneurysms (13.7%&#xD;
      vs 3.3% respectively). This is likely related to several factors. Microcatheterization of the&#xD;
      aneurysm sac may be challenging due to aneurysm size and placing even the smallest coils,&#xD;
      maybe challenging in small aneurysms. In the same series as above [13 14], a 10.4% overall&#xD;
      procedural complication rate was found. There were 24 embolic events, 11 coil protrusions and&#xD;
      4 aneurysm ruptures, while Oishi found a 3.8% thromboembolic event rate and a 1.4% risk of&#xD;
      aneurysm rupture. Nguyen et al reported an intraprocedural rupture rate of 11.7% in aneurysms&#xD;
      less than 3 mm in diameter [16]. In a meta-analysis, Brinjikji et al found a procedural&#xD;
      rupture rate of 8.3% in small aneurysms while Spiotta et al demonstrated a 13.5% rate of&#xD;
      intraprocedural rupture in ruptured aneurysms less than 4 mm [17] Other studies have found&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality rates that range from 0.8%-7% and 0-1.4% [13 14 18]. The introduction&#xD;
      of the Microvention HyperSoft® 3D line of coils with sizes from 1 to 5mm may help reduce&#xD;
      these historical risks of failure to treat and intraprocedural rupture. The complex shape of&#xD;
      the coils may allow for stable framing of the aneurysms followed by dense packing of the&#xD;
      aneurysm sac and neck, therefore preventing recurrence. The softness of the coils may allow&#xD;
      for increased confidence and safety when treating these aneurysms, which may be expressed as&#xD;
      a reduction of intraprocedural complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Pathophysiology and Prevalence of Aneurysms A cerebral or intracranial aneurysm is a&#xD;
      focal dilation of an artery in the brain that results from a weakening of the inner muscular&#xD;
      layer (the intima) of a blood vessel wall. The pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms remains&#xD;
      incompletely understood. Most aneurysms arise sporadically but occasionally they may be:&#xD;
      dissecting (resulting from a luminal endothelial tear), traumatic (usually within 2-3 weeks&#xD;
      after severe head injury) or mycotic (as a result of embolism of infected material). Aneurysm&#xD;
      etiology is multifactorial, including congenital medial arterial wall defects, degenerative&#xD;
      changes, and accruing hemodynamic stress, particularly at sites of turbulent blood flow.&#xD;
      Contributing factors include connective tissue disorders, hypertension, anatomy variations,&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, trauma, mycosis, and tumors. Epidemiological studies have already identified&#xD;
      aneurysm-specific risk factors such as size and location, as well as patient-specific risk&#xD;
      factors, such as age (higher in adults), sex (higher in females), and presence of medical&#xD;
      comorbidities, such as hypertension. In addition, exposure to certain environmental factors&#xD;
      such as smoking has been shown to be important in the formation of IA. Furthermore,&#xD;
      substantial evidence proves that certain loci contribute genetically to IA pathogenesis.&#xD;
      Genome-wide linkage studies using relative pairs or rare families that are affected with the&#xD;
      Mendelian forms of IA have already shown genetic heterogeneity of IA, suggesting that&#xD;
      multiple genes, alone or in combination, are important in the disease pathophysiology [19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aneurysm wall thickness varies throughout the sac. The thickness is greatest at the neck and&#xD;
      least at the fundus. Compared to small aneurysms, calcification and atheromas are more&#xD;
      commonly seen in large aneurysms. Macrophages, present in all stages of atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      secrete lytic enzymes (e.g., elastases, collagenases, metalloproteases), lead to the&#xD;
      destruction of connective tissue and erosion of the arterial wall. Smooth muscle cell&#xD;
      apoptosis and elastin/collagen fiber reconstruction mechanisms contribute to vessel wall&#xD;
      weakening [20]. The weakening of aneurysm walls has been demonstrated in histological studies&#xD;
      that found degeneration of endothelial cells and internal elastic lamina and thinning of the&#xD;
      medial layer [21]. Aneurysm wall tensions and stressors have been noted to be an important&#xD;
      contributor to growth, remodeling and rupture in aneurysms. Focal turbulence and&#xD;
      discontinuity of the normal architecture at vessel bifurcations may account for the&#xD;
      propensity of saccular aneurysm formation [22].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of cerebral aneurysms is difficult to ascertain because of variation in the&#xD;
      definitions of the size of aneurysm and modes of detection. Autopsy series cite prevalences&#xD;
      of 0.2-7.9%. Prevalence ranges from 5-10%, with unruptured aneurysms accounting for 50% of&#xD;
      all aneurysms. Pediatric aneurysms account for only 2% of all cerebral aneurysms. In the&#xD;
      United States, the incidence of ruptured aneurysms is approximately 12 per 100,000&#xD;
      individuals or 30,000 annual cases of aneurysmal SAH. The frequency of cerebral aneurysms has&#xD;
      not declined in recent years. [22] Saccular (berry) aneurysms constitute 90% of all cerebral&#xD;
      aneurysms and are usually located at the major branch points of large arteries. Saccular&#xD;
      aneurysms frequently rupture into the subarachnoid space, accounting for 70-80% of&#xD;
      spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. Annually, 15,000 American patients have SAH from&#xD;
      aneurysms with a maximum diameter &lt;7 mm and consequently experience irreparable morbidity and&#xD;
      severe mortality. The majority of their aneurysms were unruptured, single, asymptomatic, and&#xD;
      even smaller at some point before rupture [23]. Fusiform or arteriosclerotic aneurysms are&#xD;
      elongated outpouchings of proximal arteries that account for 7% of all cerebral aneurysms and&#xD;
      infectious or mycotic aneurysms usually situated peripherally comprise 0.5% of all cerebral&#xD;
      aneurysms. Small aneurysms are less than 10 mm in diameter. Larger aneurysms are 10-25 mm and&#xD;
      giant aneurysms are greater than 25 mm in diameter [24]. About 80-90% of the aneurysms are&#xD;
      small and only 10-20% are large and giant [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms are candidates for endovascular therapy. The natural&#xD;
      history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms is still unclear and is influenced by many&#xD;
      factors such as previous subarachnoid hemorrhage from another aneurysm, history of cigarette&#xD;
      smoking, coexisting medical conditions, and aneurysm characteristics such as size, location,&#xD;
      and morphology [25]. In a Study of the natural history of aneurysms to determine the risk of&#xD;
      rupture, Juvela [26] followed 142 patients with 181 unruptured aneurysms for a mean of 13.9&#xD;
      years (range 0.8 - 30 years) to death or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The annual rupture rate was&#xD;
      1.4%. The median diameter of the aneurysm followed was 4 mm at diagnosis. Fourteen of the&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhages (ICH) were fatal; the authors concluded that unruptured aneurysms&#xD;
      should be treated if technically feasible irrespective of size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Treatment options for intracranial aneurysms The wide availability and use of noninvasive&#xD;
      imaging has increased the frequency of incidental discovery of intracranial aneurysms. There&#xD;
      are two broad categories of intracranial aneurysms: those that have ruptured, creating&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage and those that are unruptured. Subarachnoid hemorrhage from aneurysm&#xD;
      rupture is a devastating event. It is estimated that about 40% of individuals whose aneurysm&#xD;
      has ruptured do not survive the first 24 hours: up to another 25% die from complications&#xD;
      within 6 months. Early diagnosis and treatment are important. [27] Aneurysm treatments&#xD;
      include medical, surgical and endovascular therapies. Medical therapy involves general&#xD;
      supportive measures and prevention of complications for individuals who are in the&#xD;
      periprocedural period or are poor surgical candidates and includes: control of hypertension,&#xD;
      calcium channel blockers, prevention of seizures and antibiotic therapy for those presenting&#xD;
      with infectious aneurysms. In the microsurgical approach, a section of the skull is removed.&#xD;
      The brain tissue is then spread apart to reveal the aneurysm and a small metal clip is placed&#xD;
      at the base of the aneurysm to block the flow of blood. Alternative microsurgical techniques&#xD;
      involve proximal or Hunterian ligation, wrapping of the aneurysm or trapping (i.e., a&#xD;
      combination of proximal and distal vessel occlusion). [22] Endovascular therapy (EVT)&#xD;
      involves insertion of a catheter into the femoral artery in the patient's leg and navigating&#xD;
      it though the vascular system into the head and aneurysm. Once there, several treatment&#xD;
      options are available: detachable coils may be deployed within the aneurysm to occlude it&#xD;
      from the parent artery blood flow, this may be done alone or by using an adjunctive technique&#xD;
      such as balloon remodeling or intracranial stenting of the parent artery. In balloon&#xD;
      remodeling, a temporary occlusion balloon is inflated across the neck of the aneurysm while&#xD;
      the coils are introduced. The balloon functions to prevent the prolapse of coils into the&#xD;
      parent vessel. Although the temporary occlusion balloons provide support for the coils during&#xD;
      their introduction, sometimes the coil can prolapse into the parent artery immediately after&#xD;
      balloon deflation [28]. Also very wide-necked or irregular shaped aneurysms may lack a neck&#xD;
      structure making coil placement difficult or impossible. These aneurysms may have an&#xD;
      intracranial stent placed in the parent artery crossing the neck of the aneurysm. The coils&#xD;
      are then introduced through the stent in order to help jail them within the aneurysm. Parent&#xD;
      vessel occlusion, although not as common as aneurysm coiling is performed mostly on fusiform&#xD;
      and acute dissecting arteries and involves the complete occlusion of the parent vessel with&#xD;
      coils and sometimes embolic liquid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embolization with detachable coils is a safe and effective treatment of brain aneurysms. The&#xD;
      1-year results of the ISAT Study [29] of endovascular coiling of aneurysms (considered&#xD;
      suitable for both neurosurgical clipping and endovascular coiling) yielded a significant&#xD;
      advantage over neurosurgical clipping in terms of death and severe disability. Of patients&#xD;
      allocated to endovascular treatment, 250 of 1063 (23.5%) were dead or dependent at 1 year&#xD;
      compared with 326 of 1055 (30.9%) patients allocated to neurosurgical clipping. As such, the&#xD;
      absolute risk reduction was calculated as 7.4% (95% CI: 3.6-11.2; P = .0001) in favor of&#xD;
      endovascular treatment. Because of this significant difference between coiling and clipping,&#xD;
      treatment of patients with a ruptured intracranial aneurysm changed significantly over the&#xD;
      past years, particularly in Europe. In many centers, coiling has become the method of choice&#xD;
      when both coiling and clipping are considered suitable in the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 5 years, 11% (112 of 1046) of the patients in the endovascular group and 14% (144 of 1041)&#xD;
      of the patients in the neurosurgical group had died. The risk of death at 5 years was&#xD;
      significantly lower in the coiling group than in the clipping group [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although endovascular coiling has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment, some of&#xD;
      these same patients require repeat treatment for recurrence of an aneurysm [30 31]. Published&#xD;
      series regarding mid and long-term clinical outcome and follow up angiographic findings&#xD;
      confirm that recanalization may occur in up to 33% of treated patients, which also tends to&#xD;
      increase in the aneurysms with wider necks and larger sizes [2 30 32 33]. In the case of&#xD;
      coiled aneurysms, large aneurysms are more likely to recur than smaller ones and ruptured&#xD;
      aneurysms are more likely to recur than unruptured ones [11 30].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decade, there have been significant improvements of the endovascular techniques&#xD;
      and the development of a wide range of devices including 3-D coils, spherical coils, and&#xD;
      complex coils. The introduction of balloon and stent remodeling techniques resulted in&#xD;
      further expansion of the devices and techniques available to neurointerventionalists, and&#xD;
      made EVT possible for greater percentage of patients. Enhancement of platinum coil&#xD;
      thrombogenicity has been attempted by surface modifications using Dacron® fibers,&#xD;
      bioabsorbable polymers (Cerecyte® coil, Codman/Micrus Endovascular; Matrix®coil, Boston&#xD;
      Scientific) or hydrogel coatings (HydroCoil®, MicroVention). The use of non adhesive embolic&#xD;
      agents such as Onyx® (ev3) for aneurysm embolization has proven to be an occlusive method&#xD;
      that, in some patients, completely fills and conforms to the unique geometry of the aneurysm&#xD;
      cavity, resulting in complete aneurysm obliteration. A relatively new technique being used is&#xD;
      Parent Vessel Reconstruction using stents (Neuroform® microstent Boston Scientific,&#xD;
      Enterprise™ Codman®, Pipeline Embolization Device, Covidien) not just to coil the aneurysm&#xD;
      but to change the parent vessel configuration, redirect the flow of blood to help reduce the&#xD;
      wall shear stress on the aneurysm and to promote tissue growth over the neck of the aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this post-marketing Study is to assess the&#xD;
      clinical and imaging outcomes in the endovascular treatment of small (≤ 4.9 mm) intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms utilizing the HyperSoft® 3D and HyperSoft® Helical coils (or HydroFrame®,&#xD;
      HydroFill® and HydroSoft® (3D and Helical) coils in Phase 2) specifically designed for the&#xD;
      treatment of small aneurysms. The neck of the aneurysm may be protected during coiling with a&#xD;
      balloon or stent indicated for use in the neurovasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that framing, filling and neck finishing using HyperSoft® 3D, HydroFrame®,&#xD;
      HydroSoft® 3D and HyperSoft® Helical coils, aided by balloon remodeling or stent assistance&#xD;
      where appropriate, will yield better occlusion rates, may lower recanalization and&#xD;
      retreatment rates and be safer (reduce intraprocedural aneurysm rupture rates) compared to&#xD;
      historical data using earlier generation technology.&#xD;
&#xD;

          2. Aneurysm size [largest measurement from the cross sectional images to determine&#xD;
             overall aneurysm size, not just the lumen, and including any thrombosed portions] ≤&#xD;
             4.9 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If ruptured aneurysm: Hunt and Hess 0-3&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If unruptured aneurysm: Subject grade Modified Rankin Scale mRS 0 - 2 The investigator&#xD;
             believes the aneurysm is appropriate for the designated Phase coiling paradigm. (Phase&#xD;
             1: Frame, fill and finish with MicroVention HyperSoft® 3D and/or HyperSoft® Helical&#xD;
             coils). The operator at his discretion may frame with any bare metal framing coil but&#xD;
             the remainder of the coils must be HyperSoft® 3D or HyperSoft® Helical coils. Phase 2:&#xD;
             Frame with MicroVention HydroFrame® or HydroSoft® 3D coils and fill/finish with&#xD;
             sufficient hydrogel coils to ensure 50% hydrogel by length. The intent to treat is to&#xD;
             frame, fill and finish with all hydrogel coils. However, at the discretion of the&#xD;
             treating physician, a bare platinum coil may be used to fill or finish, as long as a&#xD;
             minimum of 50% (in total coil length) of hydrogel coils are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates will be ineligible for enrollment in the Study if any of the following&#xD;
        conditions apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has more than one aneurysm requiring treatment in the current treatment&#xD;
             session, and only one of those to be treated aneurysms fits the current Study&#xD;
             inclusion criteria (i.e. if either (1) a patient has multiple aneurysms, but only one&#xD;
             will be treated at enrollment; or (2) if two or more aneurysms are treated during the&#xD;
             current treatment session and BOTH are able to be enrolled, then they remain eligible&#xD;
             for the Study). Non-treated additional aneurysms may be treated after 30 days from the&#xD;
             incident procedure with any coil type that the operator chooses, and, if eligible,&#xD;
             those aneurysms may also be enrolled as an additional enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior treatment (surgical or endovascular) of the target aneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject with social, medical, or psychological conditions that interfere with&#xD;
             treatment and follow-up evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Use of other modified coils (Matrix, HydroCoil® or fibered coils) - except Phase 2 as&#xD;
             noted above in the inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use (current or prior) of liquid embolic material in the treatment of the target&#xD;
             aneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Life expectancy less than 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Presence of arteriovenous malformation or fistula&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Presence of fusiform, mycotic, traumatic, dissecting or tumoral aneurysms in any&#xD;
             location 10. Intended or planned aneurysm treatment by parent vessel occlusion&#xD;
