    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a prospective, single-center, open-label, single-arm study comparing&#xD;
      tolerability of Acthar versus oral prednisone in the treatment of MS relapses. Potential&#xD;
      subjects will be identified during routine clinical evaluations. If patient is determined to&#xD;
      be having a study-defined MS relapse, they will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
      After consent is obtained, the patient will complete the first page of the ARMS survey. If&#xD;
      prior steroid use was deemed tolerable then only the first page of the ARMS will be collected&#xD;
      and analyzed and these patients will complete their participation in the trial. Their data&#xD;
      from the ARMS will provide an estimate as to the number of patients who self-report&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy issues with steroids. However, if patients self-report prior&#xD;
      steroid intolerability, then they will advance into the Acthar treatment arm of the trial.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline visit &amp; follow-up after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient history of prior corticosteroid tolerability for the treatment of MS relapses. This will be determined based on patient completion of the ARMS survey at the baseline visit. Also, history of patients from the survey after treatment for the new relapse will be collected.&#xD;
The ARMS questionnaire (assessing relapses in multiple sclerosis) was developed by a panel of expert MS nurses. Part one consists of 7 questions designed to assess relapse symptoms, impact on activities of daily living, and response to past treatment for MS relapses. Part two consists of 7 questions to evaluate treatment response in terms of relief from symptoms, functioning and tolerability.&#xD;
ADL scores were calculated from Part 1 (new relapse), question 3 and Part 2 (after treatment of relapse), question 5 both specifically refer to ADL;&#xD;
Scale: ADL (Activities of Daily Living) Minimum value: 0 Maximum value: 9 Higher scores indicated better functioning/ improvement.</description>

    <description>Patients completed the ARMS survey after treatment for the new relapse.The ARMS questionnaire (assessing relapses in multiple sclerosis) was developed by a panel of expert MS nurses. Part one consists of 7 questions designed to assess relapse symptoms, impact on activities of daily living, and response to past treatment for MS relapses. Part two consists of 7 questions to evaluate treatment response in terms of relief from symptoms, functioning and tolerability.&#xD;
The TCS score was calculated only for the time point after treatment of relapse. It was a sum of questions 4 (symptom improvement), 5 (ADL), and 6 (return to previous state of health (RSH)) were evaluated. Scores range from 0 to 30 units, with higher scores representing greater improvement/better functioning.</description>

Part two consists of 7 questions to evaluate treatment response in terms of relief from symptoms, functioning and tolerability.&#xD;
PCS was computed based on the sum of the ADL and RSH questions. The PCS was computed separately for Part 1 (new relapse) and Part 2 (after relapse treatment) and summarized descriptively; Higher scores indicating better functioning/greater improvement. The PCS scores were on a scale of 0 to 20 units.</description>

    <measure>MSIS (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale) -29 Physical Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline visit &amp; follow-up after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The MSIS-29 is a self-reported questionnaire in which MS patients answer a series of 29 questions designed to capture the impact of multiple sclerosis on their life over the past 2 weeks (11). Twenty of the 29 questions assess the physical impact of MS.&#xD;
The physical impact of MS was compared between pre and post phase using paired t-tests. Each question is answered with points ranging from 1 to 5. Higher score indicates worse outcome. The total MSIS physical score ranges from 20 to 100 points with lower points indicating better impact.</description>

Twenty of the 29 questions assess the physical impact of MS and 9 questions assess the psychological impact of MS.&#xD;
The psychological impact of MS was compared between pre and post phase using paired t-tests.&#xD;
The psychological impact of MS was compared between pre and post phase using paired t-tests.&#xD;

    <measure>EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) Scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and at follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This scaling score is obtained by performing a neurologic exam with specific attention to eight different neurologic functional systems: visual, pyramidal, cerebellar, bowel and bladder, cerebral, brainstem, sensory and other (10). The score is rated from zero (normal neurologic examination) to ten (death due to MS). This is the standard neurologic disability scale used in clinical trials for the evaluation of disability in patients with MS.&#xD;
These scores were compared between pre and post phase using paired t-tests.</description>

    <measure>SAGE (Self-administered Gerocognitive Exam) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Administered Gerocognitive Exam (SAGE) is designed to detect early signs of cognitive, memory or thinking impairments. It evaluates your thinking abilities and helps physicians to know how well your brain is working.&#xD;
It consists of 12 questions which are scored at different scales. The final SAGE score is calculated as a sum of these 12 questions and it ranges from 0 to 22.&#xD;
Higher score indicates better outcome.</description>

This will be determined based on patient completion of the ARMS survey at the baseline visit. Also, history of patients from the survey after treatment for the new relapse will be collected.&#xD;
The ARMS questionnaire (assessing relapses in multiple sclerosis) was developed by a panel of expert MS nurses. Part one consists of 7 questions designed to assess relapse symptoms, impact on activities of daily living, and response to past treatment for MS relapses. Part two consists of 7 questions to evaluate treatment response in terms of relief from symptoms, functioning and tolerability.&#xD;
ADL scores were calculated from Part 1 (new relapse), question 3 and Part 2 (after treatment of relapse), question 5 both specifically refer to ADL;&#xD;

        <title>MSIS (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale) -29 Physical Score</title>
        <description>The MSIS-29 is a self-reported questionnaire in which MS patients answer a series of 29 questions designed to capture the impact of multiple sclerosis on their life over the past 2 weeks (11). Twenty of the 29 questions assess the physical impact of MS.&#xD;
The physical impact of MS was compared between pre and post phase using paired t-tests. Each question is answered with points ranging from 1 to 5. Higher score indicates worse outcome. The total MSIS physical score ranges from 20 to 100 points with lower points indicating better impact.</description>
