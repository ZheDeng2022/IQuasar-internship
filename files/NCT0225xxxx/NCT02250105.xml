      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ARI-3037MO 3g BID compared to placebo in&#xD;
      reducing triglyceride (TG) levels of subjects with severe (≥500 mg/dL and &lt;2,000 mg/dL)&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia. Eligible patients will enter a 4- to 6-week lead-in period (6-week&#xD;
      washout for subjects on non-statin lipid-lowering therapy [subjects may remain on statins&#xD;
      during this period], 4 weeks for patients on statins only or not receiving any type of&#xD;
      lipid-lowering therapy), followed by qualifying fasting TG measurements at visits 2 and 3, at&#xD;
      least 7 days apart. If the baseline TG value is &gt; 500 mg/dL and &lt; 2,000 mg/dL, the qualified&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized at visit 4 and enter the double-blind, 12-week efficacy and&#xD;
      safety assessment phase. End-of-study lipid levels will be assessed on visits 6 and 7 (weeks&#xD;
      11 and 12 average). A final closeout and safety assessment visit will be done 14 weeks post&#xD;
      randomization&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria 1. Age ≥ 18 years. 2. Subjects willing to comply with lifestyle&#xD;
        intervention modifications (diet and exercise) 3. TG levels: At randomization, mean level &gt;&#xD;
        500 mg/dL and &lt; 2,000 mg/dL. 4. Understands the trial requirements and the treatment&#xD;
        procedures, is willing to comply with all protocol-required follow-up evaluation and&#xD;
        provides written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients already taking statin therapy must be on a stable dose, defined as no changes&#xD;
        in the dose of statin in the 3 months prior to enrollment, and must be willing and able to&#xD;
        remain on that dose for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
