  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pain of the elderly is even often unrecognized or trivialized and ignored in spite of its&#xD;
      big frequency: the chronic pain affects 50 % of the elderly living at home, 49 to 83 % of&#xD;
      those living in institution and 80 % of this population at the end of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So in the elderly, the noxious character of the pain is more pregnant than at the young&#xD;
      adult. The echo on the acts of the everyday life is fast, the activities decrease, coming to&#xD;
      deteriorate the isolation and the dependence: the echo on the psychic state is frequent and&#xD;
      the pain is a part of the cause of a confusional state. Finally, the presence of a pain&#xD;
      distorts considerably the quality of life and can modify the state general as the desire of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the pain appeals to the same strategy as to the younger subject but with&#xD;
      some specificities, related more to the pathologies associated with the ageing than with the&#xD;
      real age. For that purpose, the investigators have first of all scale of self-assessment as&#xD;
      the numerical scale which is adapted to estimate the acute and chronic pains but this scale&#xD;
      presents a bias because, certain patients do not express spontaneously their pain and this&#xD;
      one must be attentively looked for in case of modification of behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So scales of hetero-evaluation were elaborated to solve the difficulties of detection and to&#xD;
      care the pain of the elderly. One of these is the scale Algoplus® (5 items which allow within&#xD;
      one minute a good quality evaluation whatever is the place of care) whose objective is the&#xD;
      observation of the behavioral changes caused by the acute pain in elderly having&#xD;
      communication disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the demographic evolution, emergency departments are more and more frequently a place&#xD;
      of consultation of the elderly. Indeed, the elderly represent approximately 10 to 20 % of all&#xD;
      the passages in emergency department and 50 % of the patients hospitalized during the passage&#xD;
      in the reception of Emergency department are elderly. Elderly care is difficult for a certain&#xD;
      number of reasons (vulnerability, accumulation of pathologies and treatments). So, in this&#xD;
      context, the evaluation of the presence of pain and its care are difficult in particular at&#xD;
      the elderly with communication disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary study in the emergency department of the Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand, on&#xD;
      700 patients of more than 75 years old admitted in April 2012, 32 % had a prescription of&#xD;
      analgesic while 13 % only had a real quotation of the pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the investigators study is to analyze if the systematic introduction of the scale&#xD;
      Algoplus® in the evaluation of elderly during its entrance to emergency department could&#xD;
      modify the prescription of analgesic.&#xD;

      First period of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the pain of elderly patient admitted in the emergency department by numerical&#xD;
      scale and then taken care according to the usual practice of the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Clinical Research Associate will collect the quotation of pain by numerical scale and the&#xD;
      analgesics treatments prescribed and their posology and route of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data collection must be realized for 100 elderly patients of 75 or more years old&#xD;
      admitted the Emergency department during one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training period :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training of the emergency physicians in the use of the Algoplus® scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second period of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the pain of elderly patient admitted in the emergency department by numerical&#xD;
      scale and by Algoplus® scale then taken care according to the usual practice of the emergency&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Clinical Research Associate will collect the quotation of pain by numerical scale and by&#xD;
      Algoplus® scale and the analgesics treatments prescribed and their posology and route of&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data collection must be realized for 100 elderly patients of 75 or more years old&#xD;
      admitted the Emergency department during one month.&#xD;
