  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of consumption of sugar sweetened and&#xD;
      diet beverages on overall fat mass and the fat mass of various tissues implicated in the&#xD;
      dysregulation of glucose metabolism. In addition, hypothalamic activity will also be&#xD;
      investigated after acute exposure to sugar sweetened and diet beverages, and again after 6&#xD;
      months of daily consumption.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excess fat deposition in skeletal muscle and the liver have both been implicated in the&#xD;
      metabolic dysregulation that leads to type II diabetes. It has been shown that daily&#xD;
      consumption of sugar sweetened beverages can lead to increases in the fat mass of these&#xD;
      organs. However, little appreciation was given for the effect of overall changes in weight&#xD;
      and fat mass or how applicable the doses provided may be for how sugar sweetened beverages&#xD;
      are typically consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it has recently been shown that sugars can suppress hypothalamic activity and&#xD;
      alter patterns of brain connectivity in regions known to be involved in homeostasis and&#xD;
      reward aspects of food intake. However, these observations were made after large doses or&#xD;
      sugars not commonly consumed in isolation from other sugars or other macronutrients. Foods&#xD;
      containing non-caloric sweeteners have also been suggested to suppress hypothalamic activity&#xD;
      due to the disconnect between perceived sweetness and calories consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To investigate the response to six months of daily consumption of sugar sweetened or&#xD;
      diet beverages as part of a weight-stable structured diet on whole body fat content, but also&#xD;
      specifically fat content of the liver, skeletal muscles the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To investigate hypothalamic activity after acute exposure to sugar sweetened and or&#xD;
      diet beverages, and whether chronic exposure for 6 months induces any changes in hypothalamic&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
