    <textblock>
      Additional treatments with long-term benefit for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder&#xD;
      (ADHD) are needed; one of the more promising is neurofeedback (EEG biofeedback), which has&#xD;
      several randomized controlled trials showing significant benefit, but which are inconclusive&#xD;
      because they were not double-blinded; the benefit could have been nonspecific (placebo&#xD;
      response). Because of neurofeedback's labor-intensive cost (1 treatment costing as much as a&#xD;
      month's medication), It is important to know how much specific benefit it yields. This 2-&#xD;
      site placebo-controlled double-blind randomized clinical trial is the first to test for a&#xD;
      specific benefit of neurofeedback with adequate power, the first designed and implemented&#xD;
      collaboratively by experts in neurofeedback, ADHD, and clinical trials, the first to&#xD;
      rigorously monitor quality not only of treatment, but also of placebo and blinding, and the&#xD;
      first to follow up for 2 years to examine enduring effect; the results, whether positive or&#xD;
      negative, will provide evidence for clinical practice and public policy regarding ADHD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current established, evidence-based treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder&#xD;
      (ADHD) are incompletely effective and not universally acceptable, and appear to wane in&#xD;
      effect over time despite significant immediate benefit. E.g., FDA-approved medication, which&#xD;
      shows large acute benefit, leaves a third of children only partially treated even when&#xD;
      combined with behavioral treatment, and has not been demonstrated effective beyond 2 years.&#xD;
      Additional treatments are needed that are effective with persisting benefit, preferably&#xD;
      related to a biomarker predicting treatment response. A good candidate is&#xD;
      electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback, called neurofeedback (NF). It is based on 1)&#xD;
      observations that patients with ADHD often have excessive theta band (4-8 Hz) quantitative&#xD;
      EEG power, low beta band (13-21 Hz) power, and excessive theta beta ratio (TBR), and 2)&#xD;
      theoretical application of operant conditioning to correct this EEG imbalance. Metaanalysis&#xD;
      of 6 randomized clinical trials found a large benefit for inattentive symptoms and medium&#xD;
      benefit for hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Unfortunately, none of these were blinded. Three&#xD;
      of 4 small blinded studies found no advantage for NF over sham, but used suboptimal NF,&#xD;
      leaving the situation inconclusive. Because of the expense and time required by NF, there is&#xD;
      a public health need to determine whether it has a specific effect beyond the obvious&#xD;
      nonspecific benefit of doing a focused activity several times a week with a&#xD;
      friendly,encouraging adult who reinforces for attending to the task. Experts in NF, ADHD,&#xD;
      clinical trials, statistics, and data management have joined to design a double-blind&#xD;
      sham-controlled randomized clinical trial to answer several pressing scientific and clinical&#xD;
      questions in a way that will be credible to all. At each of 2 sites (1 university &amp; 1 NF&#xD;
      clinic) 70 children (total N=140) age 7 through 10 with rigorously diagnosed moderate to&#xD;
      severe ADHD and TBR&gt;5 will be randomized in a 3:2 ratio to active TBR downtraining by NF vs.&#xD;
      a sham training of equal duration, intensity, and appearance. To keep both participants and&#xD;
      study staff blind, the sham will utilize pre-recorded EEGs with the participant's artifacts&#xD;
      superimposed. The sham will be programmed into the equipment via internet by an off-site&#xD;
      statistician-guided person who has no contact with participants. Treatment fidelity will be&#xD;
      trained and monitored by 2 acknowledged NF leaders in a manner that protects blinding.&#xD;
      Multi-domain assessments at baseline, mid-treatment, treatment end, and follow-ups at 6&#xD;
      months, 1 year, and 2 years will include parent and teacher ratings of symptoms &amp; impairment,&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests,clinician ratings, and quantitative EEG as well as tests of blinding&#xD;
      and of sham inertness. Hypotheses include that NF will improve parent- and teacher-rated&#xD;
      inattentive symptoms (primary outcome) and other outcomes more than sham,that benefit will&#xD;
      persist for 2 years after training, that initial TBR will moderate treatment response, and&#xD;
      that change in TBR will mediate response. Research Domain Criteria and EEG brain changes will&#xD;
      be explored, including relationship of TBR to clinical symptoms, executive-function&#xD;
      impairment, and sleep.&#xD;

    <description>Participants assigned to sham and their trainers will be fed EEG data from pre-recorded files (recorded during live clinical NF) rather than from the participant's live signal. In order to prevent unblinding of experienced NF trainers/technicians, artifacts from the participant's EMG and EOG are blended into the pre-recorded EEG so that the trainer controlling the feedback cannot differentiate between live and simulated data. To insure trainer/technician blindness, the pre-recorded EEG will be 38 consecutive EEGs from the same age-matched clinical case so that EEGs of the sham group will also show &quot;training progress&quot; over successive sessions, like real NF.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Of 329 children screened, 305 passed categorical and parent-rated dimensional criteria for ADHD. Of these, 235 passed the TBR screen. Of the149 completely eligible,144 were randomized, and of the 144, 2 withdrew consent for logistical reasons before any post-treatment assessment. Thus,142 subjects comprised the population for the primary analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Composite Conner's Subscale (Parent and Teacher)</title>
          <description>The composited (averaged) scores of teacher and parent-rated subscales on the Conners-3 range from a scale of 0-3. Lower scores represent a better outcome.&#xD;
The impression indices range from 0-6. A higher score on these indices shows a measure of positive or negative bias on the parent/teacher report forms. For example, a higher score on the positive index shows a more positive bias in the ratings.</description>

            <description>Participants assigned to sham and their trainers will be fed EEG data from pre-recorded files (recorded during live clinical NF) rather than from the participant's live signal. In order to prevent unblinding of experienced NF trainers/technicians, artifacts from the participant's EMG and EOG are blended into the pre-recorded EEG so that the trainer controlling the feedback cannot differentiate between live and simulated data. To insure trainer/technician blindness, the pre-recorded EEG will be 38 consecutive EEGs from the same age-matched clinical case so that EEGs of the sham group will also show &quot;training progress&quot; over successive sessions, like real NF.&#xD;
