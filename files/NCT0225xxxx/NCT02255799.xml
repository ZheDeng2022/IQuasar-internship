      This is a four-site, randomized, parallel design, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 10-week&#xD;
      trial of donepezil 10 mg daily for verbal memory problems among adults with TBI in the&#xD;
      subacute or chronic recovery period. The study will recruit 160 persons with TBI and&#xD;
      functionally important memory problems during a four-year period of open recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effects of treatment with donepezil on verbal memory as assessed by the&#xD;
           Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised Total Trial 1-3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effects of treatment with donepezil on memory-related activities as&#xD;
           measured by the Everyday Memory Questionnaire;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effects of donepezil on attention, processing speed, neuropsychiatric&#xD;
           symptoms, community participation, quality of life, and caregiver experiences.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Memory deficits are among the most common chronic and functionally important&#xD;
      consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Basic and clinical research studies suggest&#xD;
      that persistent deficits in verbal memory are associated with chronically reduced levels of&#xD;
      acetylcholine in the brain. Medicines that increase levels of acetylcholine in the brain&#xD;
      appear to improve memory and other cognitive problems experienced by persons with TBI.&#xD;
      However, the studies performed thus far do not provide the level of evidence needed to&#xD;
      establish best practices. This study will definitively establish whether, and to what extent,&#xD;
      donepezil is an effective treatment for functionally important TBI-related memory deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: The study begins with a Screening visit. After consent to participate in&#xD;
      research is obtained from the participant or his or her legally-authorized representative,&#xD;
      screening assessments are performed. Over the two weeks following that visit, study&#xD;
      eligibility is determined. Participants meeting study inclusion/exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      randomly assigned (1:1) to 1 of 2 drug groups: donepezil or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants then are evaluated at the Baseline (pre-treatment) Visit using assessments of&#xD;
      physical health, cognition, neuropsychiatric status, everyday functioning, community&#xD;
      participation, quality of life, and caregiver appraisal. At the conclusion of this visit,&#xD;
      participants begin a ten week treatment period with either donepezil 5 mg daily or matching&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone contact occurs at the end of study week 1 and 2. Calls will assess and support&#xD;
      participants' adherence to the study protocol, obtain information on treatment-related side&#xD;
      effects, and address any other safety or tolerability concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the week 2 telephone contact, participants tolerating the starting dose of study&#xD;
      medication are advanced to donepezil 10 mg daily or matching placebo. Telephone contacts&#xD;
      occur every 2 weeks until the Interim Assessment Visit at study week 6, at which time&#xD;
      assessments of physical health, cognition, neuropsychiatric status, everyday functioning,&#xD;
      community participation, quality of life, and caregiver appraisal are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit is followed by a telephone contact at study week 8 and the Outcome Assessment&#xD;
      Visit at study week 10. At that visit participants and caregivers complete assessments of&#xD;
      physical health, cognition, neuropsychiatric status, everyday functioning, community&#xD;
      participation, quality of life, and caregiver appraisal. After completion of all week 10&#xD;
      assessments, the extent to which participants and their caregivers remained blinded to study&#xD;
      condition (allocation concealment) will be evaluated by inquiring whether they believe they&#xD;
      received donepezil or placebo. Study staff also will offer a written opinion on the study&#xD;
      condition to which each participant was assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Discontinuation period (termination of study medication) begins upon conclusion of the&#xD;
      final visit. Study teams at each site will remain available to receive questions and/or&#xD;
      concerns from participants and/or caregivers during the 4-week Discontinuation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYTIC PLAN: All analyses will be conducted using SAS v.9.4 assuming a significance level&#xD;
      of 0.05 unless otherwise stated. Descriptive characteristics of the participants in each&#xD;
      group will be summarized using frequency counts/percentages for nominal variables and&#xD;
      means/standard deviations (SDs) or medians/interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous&#xD;
      variables. Comparisons of subject characteristics between groups will be performed using&#xD;
      chi-square tests and t-tests to identify significant differences between the treatment&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Primary Outcome (Aim 1): For the primary aim, an ANCOVA approach will be used to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis with a General Linear Mixed Effects Model (GLMM); the difference in the&#xD;
      outcome variable (HVLT-R Total Trials 1-3) at week 10 will be modeled as a function of&#xD;
      treatment group assignment (donepezil vs. placebo), controlled for baseline HVLT-R Total&#xD;
      Trials 1-3 score. A random center effect will also be included to account for between center&#xD;
      variations. If the random effect is not significant it will be removed and a general linear&#xD;
      model (GLM) will be fit. Using this model, a test of the treatment effect will be conducted&#xD;
      at a significance level of 5%. A significant treatment effect (p-value &lt; 0.05) indicates that&#xD;
      outcome HVLT-R Total Trials 1-3 at week 10 differ significantly between the treatment groups,&#xD;
      after controlling for baseline HVLT-R Total Trials 1-3 score. The adjusted mean score at week&#xD;
      10 for each group and the mean difference in outcome scores at week 10 will be estimated and&#xD;
      quantified with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Intent to Treat versus Secondary Per-Protocol Analyses: Two analysis study&#xD;
      populations will be considered in this study: a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population&#xD;
      and a clinically evaluable population. The analysis on the mITT sample will be considered the&#xD;
      primary analysis and will include every person who was randomized according to the randomized&#xD;
      group assignment and completed HVLT-R Form 1 at the Baseline Visit (Study Week 0), and took&#xD;
      at least one dose of study medication, and will ignore protocol deviations, withdrawal, and&#xD;
      treatment non-adherence. The clinically evaluable population will be a secondary analysis and&#xD;
      called the per-protocol population. Inclusion in the per-protocol population will require at&#xD;
      least 8 weeks of double-blind study treatment, data on primary outcomes at the Outcome Visit,&#xD;
      at least 80% treatment adherence as determined by capsule counts on returned blister packs,&#xD;
      and no major protocol violations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Secondary Outcomes (Aims 2 and 3): The secondary outcomes relevant to study aims&#xD;
      2 and 3 are organized into 5 sets: Physical, Cognitive, Neuropsychiatric, Functional, and&#xD;
      Caregiver. The same ANCOVA modeling strategy used for the primary outcome will be utilized to&#xD;
      test for treatment effects on each secondary outcome at week 10, adjusted for the associated&#xD;
      baseline measure. A multiple hypothesis testing strategy will be utilized to maximize power&#xD;
      while controlling for the Type I error rate. Specifically, within the categories composed of&#xD;
      more than one outcome (Cognitive, Neuropsychiatric, and Functional) hypothesis-wise error&#xD;
      rates will be adjusted using the Tukey, Ciminera, and Heyse (TCH) method of adjustment for&#xD;
      multiple outcomes. If power does not reach 80% using the TCH adjustment, data reduction&#xD;
      methods (e.g., battery reduction) will be employed. If battery reduction does not yield a&#xD;
      desired reduced number of outcomes to reach 80% power, a composite outcome will be developed&#xD;
      using either principle components analysis or the rank-sum-global test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Analyses of Primary and Secondary Outcomes Adjusted for Covariates: There are a&#xD;
      number of additional covariates of interest including age, TBI severity, time since injury,&#xD;
      emotional distress, comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms, substance use disorder history,&#xD;
      current substance use, and current medications. Secondary analyses of all outcomes (primary&#xD;
      and secondary) will be conducted including these covariates in the models to assess the&#xD;
      sensitivity of the treatment effects; &quot;unadjusted&quot; treatment effects estimated from the&#xD;
      primary analyses (i.e., adjusted only for baseline scores of the outcome) will be compared to&#xD;
      the &quot;adjusted&quot; treatment effects from these secondary analyses (adjusted for these additional&#xD;
      covariates of interest).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Analyses using all Measured Time Points: A secondary repeated measures analysis&#xD;
      using a GLMM will be conducted to further assess and compare how outcome variables change&#xD;
      over time both within and between groups in greater detail over time from baseline to weeks 6&#xD;
      and 10. The outcome variables will be the change from baseline to either week 6 or 10. Fixed&#xD;
      effects will include baseline (Week 0) score, treatment group, time (week 6 and week 10), and&#xD;
      the treatment group by time interaction effect. A random center effect will be included to&#xD;
      account for variability across centers. Subject specific random intercepts and slopes will be&#xD;
      used to account for correlations in repeated measures over time. Post-hoc comparison using a&#xD;
      Bonferroni adjustment will be used to determine if the change in outcome from baseline&#xD;
      differs between the groups at either 6 weeks or 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to Treatment Analysis: Responders are defined as individuals demonstrating at least&#xD;
      a 4-unit increase in the primary outcome measure, HVLT-R Total Trials 1-3, between baseline&#xD;
      and week 10. As a secondary analysis, responders will be defined by a 5-unit change if there&#xD;
      are no significant differences between the groups based on a 4-unit change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analysis: The investigators will perform an interim analysis for the primary outcome&#xD;
      using the above-described data analytic methods on the data set comprising study participants&#xD;
      randomized as of September 30, 2018. The investigators will compute the conditional power&#xD;
      using: the current study sample; the maximum attainable sample; a significance level of α =&#xD;
      0.05 for testing a one-sided null hypothesis (H0: treatment mean &gt; control mean HLVT-R Total&#xD;
      Trials score at week 10 after controlling for baseline HVLT-R Total Trials scores); and the&#xD;
      observed treatment effect and associated t-statistic (using the data obtained thus far).&#xD;
      Using the data available as of September 30, 2018, the difference in adjusted means, the&#xD;
      means square error, and the t-statistic for the test of the treatment effect will estimated&#xD;
      based on an ANCOVA model fit using PROC GLM in SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PASS v.14 will be used to determine the conditional power of the one-sided test for a&#xD;
      treatment effect using the estimates from the ANCOVA model and a decision to either stop or&#xD;
      continue recruitment the target enrollment (reset from N=160 to N=80 based on recruitment as&#xD;
      of September 30, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the ANCOVA model using the present sample yields a t-statistic that is significant at&#xD;
           a 5% level of significance using a one-sided hypothesis test, then enrollment will be&#xD;
           halted due to efficacy and the study will enter the analytic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the ANCOVA model using the present sample yields a t-statistics that is not&#xD;
           significant at the 5% level of significance then the conditional power of identifying a&#xD;
           significant treatment effect after completing the enrollment target will be computed&#xD;
           based on the observed t-statistic, the difference in adjusted means, and the mean square&#xD;
           error.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If the conditional power is 80% or higher (corresponding to a futility index ≤ 0.2)&#xD;
                given the data that have emerged so far then recruitment will proceed until the&#xD;
                target sample size is reached, or the end of study year 5, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If the conditional power is less than 80% (futility index &gt; 0.2) given the data&#xD;
                that have emerged then enrollment will halt due to failed recruitment at the&#xD;
                conclusion of this interim analysis. The observed treatment effect and associated&#xD;
                t-statistic will be reported as a guide to future investigations of donepezil for&#xD;
                persistent memory problems after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conditional power analysis will be conducted using both HVLT-R Total Trials Raw scores&#xD;
      and T-scores. Preference will be given to the conditional power analysis based on the&#xD;
      T-scores if conclusions differ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLICATIONS, TRANSLATION, AND DISSEMINATION: Findings from this study will influence the&#xD;
      practices of prescribing healthcare providers and contribute information that will improve&#xD;
      lives of persons with TBI and their families. In addition to dissemination of final study&#xD;
      results, the MEMRI-TBI-D Study team will disseminate information on evidence-based treatments&#xD;
      for memory impairment to consumer and professional audiences throughout the funding period.&#xD;
      Through these knowledge translation activities, consumers and health care providers will be&#xD;
      provided with information regarding the effectiveness of this intervention for persistent&#xD;
      posttraumatic memory impairments.&#xD;
