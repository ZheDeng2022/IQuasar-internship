&#xD;
         20. Acute diarrhea, or constipation in the 14 days before the predicted first study day.&#xD;
             If screening occurs &gt;14 days before first study day, this criterion is to be&#xD;
             determined on first study day. Diarrhea will be defined as the passage of liquid&#xD;
             faeces and/or a stool frequency of greater than three times per day. Constipation will&#xD;
             be defined as a failure to open the bowels more frequently than every other day&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Presence of non-removable metal objects such as metal plates, screws etc. in abdominal&#xD;
             region of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Subjects will be excluded from the study if they are considered by the investigator to&#xD;
             be at risk of transmitting through blood and other body fluids the agents responsible&#xD;
             for AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) or other sexually transmitted disease or&#xD;
             hepatitis. This will be achieved by the use of a card (similar to that used by the&#xD;
             National Blood Transfusion Service) which asks a potential subject if they have reason&#xD;
             to believe that they may fall into any category included on the card. If the verbal&#xD;
             answer is in the affirmative then they will be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Positive hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus or HIV results&#xD;
