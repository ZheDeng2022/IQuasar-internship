      Consenting adults will be interviewed for demographic and medical information, and then will&#xD;
      be asked to provide two expectorated sputum specimens. In the study laboratory, sputa will be&#xD;
      tested using conventional and investigational diagnostic tests for tuberculosis.&#xD;
