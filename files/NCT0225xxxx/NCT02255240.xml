    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an intervention that uses home console video games to&#xD;
      encourage increased physical activity among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.&#xD;

      This research project includes qualitative and quantitative formative research leading to a&#xD;
      randomized controlled feasibility trial of a video game-based physical activity intervention.&#xD;
      First, we will investigate exercise protocols implemented over 6 weeks in 20 breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors. We will choose a console and six games for inclusion in the trial, based on&#xD;
      measured energy expenditure and enjoyment. We will create refined exercise protocols using&#xD;
      these games and insights from participants. Second, we will test an intervention that uses&#xD;
      active video games for implementation of motivating exercise and provision of behavioral&#xD;
      tools (e.g., tracking of progress towards goals). Participants in a pre-pilot trial (N = 10)&#xD;
      will receive weekly brief telephone counseling over 6 weeks. Feasibility measurement will&#xD;
      include attrition, self-reported acceptability, and objective measures of video game play&#xD;
      taken from game console data.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive counseling on self-regulatory skill building that has been adapted to complement the video games used. We anticipate that the games used will consist of fitness, sports, and dance games and will be played on a Wii U console.
