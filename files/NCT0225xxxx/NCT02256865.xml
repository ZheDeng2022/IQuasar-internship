  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effects of sleep restriction on the production of&#xD;
      two hormones, cortisol and testosterone. The investigators aim to show that changing these&#xD;
      hormones leads to insulin resistance, which is an important cause of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. The investigators may also study the effect of sleep restriction on your food&#xD;
      intake and cravings, mood, inflammation, metabolism (including bone), and other hormones.&#xD;
      Inflammation is your body's response to stress and injury. Bone metabolism is a process of&#xD;
      how your body regenerates (renews) new bone cells and removes old bone cells. Hormones are&#xD;
      natural substances (materials) that are produced in the body and that influences (effects)&#xD;
      the way the body grows or develops.&#xD;

      Screening Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see if you are able to take part in this study, you will first have an outpatient&#xD;
           visit at the CTRC (Clinical and Translational Research Center). This visit will take&#xD;
           about 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following tests/procedures will be done at this visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will ask you about your medical history and past health&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will give you a physical examination (including digital rectal examination of&#xD;
                the prostate gland if you are over the age of 40)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will ask you to answer sleep, mood and general health screening questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will ask you to complete a questionnaire to help us understand how testosterone&#xD;
                and other hormones control sexual function and drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will draw about 1 tablespoon of blood from a needle placed in a vein in your arm&#xD;
                for routine safety tests and to check to see if you have any hormonal problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will give you an ECG (recording of heartbeat). For this test we will attach&#xD;
                12-lead sensors to your chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will collect urine sample from you for a drug screening test.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A dietitian will review meal plans for the inpatient stay (Study Visit 1 and 3&#xD;
                only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the first screening visit shows that you are able to continue to take part in this study,&#xD;
      you will continue the screening part of the study at home. The following will be done at&#xD;
      home: We will ask you to undergo an at-home actigraphy and keep a daily sleep diary for two&#xD;
      weeks to document your sleeping habits. For the actigraphy you will be asked to wear a small&#xD;
      wrist-watch like device. This device will monitor and record your motion, and will also test&#xD;
      your sleep and wake periods. It may be worn for up to 2 weeks, 24 hours per day (except while&#xD;
      taking a shower).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results of the at-home actigraphy show that you are still able to take part in this&#xD;
      study, you will continue the final part of the screening procedure which is an inpatient&#xD;
      visit to conduct a sleep study. The following tests/procedures will be done for this final&#xD;
      screening visit: We will ask you to come into the sleep laboratory to sleep overnight (sleep&#xD;
      study). A technician will attach the leads (wires) to your body and you will need to keep&#xD;
      these leads on during the night. The attached wires will be connected to a machine to measure&#xD;
      chest and abdominal (stomach area) movements, airflow at your mouth and lips, blood oxygen&#xD;
      level, muscle tone, eye movements, heart rate and electrical activity of the brain. In the&#xD;
      morning, the technician will remove the attached wires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the exams, tests and procedures during the screening visits show that you can continue to&#xD;
      be in the study, you will have 2 inpatient visits and 2 outpatient clinical visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning the study, we will assign you to one of the two study groups described&#xD;
      below. Which one you are assigned to will be decided by chance (like tossing a coin) and you&#xD;
      will have a one in two chance of being in any one group. A computer program will place you in&#xD;
      one of the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1: If you are assigned to group 1, then you will receive active drug during visit 1&#xD;
      (first inpatient visit) and placebo (inactive drug which is same as receiving no drug) during&#xD;
      visit 3 (second inpatient visit). GROUP 2: If you are assigned to group 2, then you will&#xD;
      receive placebo (inactive drug which is same as receiving no drug) during visit 1 (first&#xD;
      inpatient visit) and active drug for visit 3 (second inpatient visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither you nor your study doctor can choose the group you will be in. Neither your study&#xD;
      doctor or his staff nor you will know which study group or medicine you will be receiving.&#xD;
      However should a medical emergency occur, this information will be made immediately available&#xD;
      to your study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the inpatient visit when you receive active drug, you will receive: Ketoconazole&#xD;
      pills. You will swallow these pills every 6 hours (4 times per day). Testosterone gel. You&#xD;
      will rub this gel into your skin once a day in the morning. Hydrocortisone pills. You will&#xD;
      swallow these pills 3 times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the inpatient visit when you receive placebo (inactive drug), you will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inactive placebo pills (looks like ketoconazole). You will swallow these pills every 6&#xD;
           hours (4 times per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inactive placebo gel (looks like testosterone gel). You will rub this gel into your skin&#xD;
           once a day in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inactive placebo pills (looks like hydrocortisone). You will swallow these pills 3 times&#xD;
           a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Night before First Inpatient Visit Before coming to the CTRC for your first inpatient visit,&#xD;
      you will be asked to sleep 10 hours for two consecutive nights (from 10 PM to 8 AM) at home.&#xD;
      During your sleep, you will be wearing an actiwatch to monitor your sleep at home. You cannot&#xD;
      drink any alcohol during this 2 day period. We will send you a text message or telephone you&#xD;
      to remind you to sleep during these times and not to drink alcohol. The inpatient study visit&#xD;
      will be cancelled if you didn't have enough sleep at home or if you consumed alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 1 (First Inpatient) For this visit we will ask you to arrive at the CTRC no later&#xD;
      than 5 PM on the first day. We will allow you to go home sometime after lunch after the 5th&#xD;
      night. We will give you breakfast, lunch and dinner at set times while you are in the CTRC.&#xD;
      The meals are standard, so that what you may have eaten before will not interfere with the&#xD;
      study results. The following tests/procedures will be done at this visit: We will download&#xD;
      the information from your actiwatch to verify your sleep at home. We will be putting external&#xD;
      leads on your body, as occurred during the sleep study, so that we can continuously check&#xD;
      your sleep EEG, actiwatch activity and heart rate. We will expose you to dim light (this is&#xD;
      so we can measure your &quot;body clock&quot;). From 7 PM until your bedtime every night, saliva will&#xD;
      be collected hourly so we can measure your &quot;body clock&quot;. We will ask you to fill out a short&#xD;
      questionnaire to measure how sleepy you are, how hungry you are and do a computerized test of&#xD;
      cognitive function every 2 hours (on odd, not even, hours). This will take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
      Starting at 8PM on your first night, urine will collected until 8AM of the following day.&#xD;
      This will be repeated every 12-hour period whilst in-lab for measurements of components of in&#xD;
      the urine. We will give you an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) in the morning of the first&#xD;
      and last days (on two occasions) while you are in the CTRC. The OGTT is the test that&#xD;
      measures the body's ability to use a type of sugar, called glucose, which is the body's main&#xD;
      source of energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the test begins, we will insert a cannula into a vein in your arm and a sample of&#xD;
           blood will be taken. The cannula is a small plastic tube through which we will sample&#xD;
           your blood. It is inserted over a metal needle into your vein. The metal needle is&#xD;
           removed once the cannula is in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will ask you to drink a liquid that is high in glucose (75 grams).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the first hour, we will draw about 5ml (1 teaspoon) of blood will be taken from the&#xD;
           cannula every 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the second hour, about 5ml (1 teaspoon) of blood will be taken from the cannula every&#xD;
           10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the third hour, about 5ml (1teaspoon) of blood will be taken from the cannula every&#xD;
           20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will draw an additional 10ml (2 teaspoons) of blood to measure inflammation,&#xD;
           hormones, gene expression, and bone metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The entire test will take about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will give you an opportunity to sleep before we discharge you and we will test you for&#xD;
      sleepiness. Arrangements will be made for you to be driven home if necessary. During this&#xD;
      time you cannot drink caffeinated drinks, or use nicotine products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 2 (First Outpatient) This visit will take place one week after you are discharged&#xD;
      from your first inpatient visit. At this visit we will ask you about any side effects and&#xD;
      draw about 1 tablespoon of blood for complete blood count and routine chemistry check,&#xD;
      including liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 3 (Second Inpatient) This visit will take place one week after your first&#xD;
      outpatient visit (about 2 weeks after your first inpatient visit). This visit is identical&#xD;
      the first inpatient study Visit 1. For this visit, if you received active study drug during&#xD;
      your first inpatient visit, you will receive a placebo. If you received the placebo during&#xD;
      the first inpatient study Visit 1, then you will receive active study drug during this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 4 (Second Outpatient) This visit will take place one week after you are&#xD;
      discharged from your second inpatient visit. At this visit we will ask you about any side&#xD;
      effects and draw about 1 tablespoon of blood for complete blood count and routine chemistry&#xD;
      check, including liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All visits A total of about half a pint (16 tablespoons) of blood will be collected for this&#xD;
      study. We will collect less than what you would donate to the blood bank.&#xD;
