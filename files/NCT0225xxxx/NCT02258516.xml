      Purpose of the study - The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a&#xD;
      new, theoretically based intervention to improve medication adherence in persons with HF. The&#xD;
      hypotheses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis I. Poorly adherent patients with symptomatic HF who receive the intervention&#xD;
      (n=40) will be more adherent to medicines during the12-month intervention than a control&#xD;
      group (n=40) of poorly adherent patients with symptomatic HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis II. Poorly adherent patients with symptomatic HF who receive the intervention&#xD;
      (n=40) will have fewer hospital readmissions (HR) and emergency department (ED) visits during&#xD;
      the 12-month intervention than a control group of poorly adherent patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Activities and population - A prospective, randomized controlled design will be used to&#xD;
      pilot test the efficacy of a new intervention to promote adherence to the medication regimen&#xD;
      in chronic heart failure in the clinical setting. The initial development and feasibility&#xD;
      testing of the intervention is complete (Preliminary Work, Section 4.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HF symptom exacerbation (n = 80) who exhibit high likelihood of poor adherence,&#xD;
      as determined by a validated screening measure, the Medication Adherence Scale (MAS)89 at&#xD;
      baseline assessment, will be recruited and randomized to receive the intervention or usual&#xD;
      care with attention control. Medication adherence, symptom frequency and intensity, hospital&#xD;
      readmissions (HR) and emergency department (ED) visits will be assessed in both groups at 3,&#xD;
      6 and 12-month clinic visits. The intervals between visits are considered sufficient to&#xD;
      minimize sensitization bias to psychometric measures. Longitudinal measurement is required to&#xD;
      evaluate the magnitude of change in adherence and symptom-related events occurring over time.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be measured as improved adherence (primary outcome) and decreased HR and ED&#xD;
      visits (secondary outcomes) in the intervention group as compared to the attention control&#xD;
      group at 12 months. The study will close when all patients have had a 12-month&#xD;
      post-enrollment clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis &amp; Safety/Risk Considerations - The investigators will use generalized linear&#xD;
      models to test the primary and secondary hypotheses (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989). Logistic&#xD;
      generalizations of the traditional, multivariate GLM are appropriate when the dependent&#xD;
      variable is binary and the probability of an event is modeled, as is the case with adherence&#xD;
      in this study. When the dependent variable is a count, a commonly used generalized model uses&#xD;
      the natural logarithm of the count, as with re-hospitalizations and ED visits in this study.&#xD;
      In compliance with NIH guidelines for data safety and monitoring activities, a number of&#xD;
      quality control steps will be used to ensure the on-going safety of participants and the&#xD;
      scientific integrity of this feasibility intervention study. The proposed study poses only&#xD;
      very minimal risks to participants. All participants will receive usual care. Participation&#xD;
      in the study will not replace patients' regular health care attention. Data safety will be&#xD;
      monitored by the PI, the Data Safety Officer (Dr. Karl Swedberg), and the study&#xD;
      co-investigators. Any adverse events will be reported immediately to the Duke IRB and the&#xD;
      NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety. First, a project database will be constructed, using participant ID numbers and&#xD;
      including all demographic, pre- and post-intervention history and all assessment materials. A&#xD;
      separate file, cross-referencing participant identification with project ID numbers, will be&#xD;
      maintained with access limited to the PI or a designated member of the investigative team.&#xD;
