  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical success of AttraX Putty as a bone&#xD;
      graft substitute for autograft in XLIF procedures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized study. Subjects will be recruited from&#xD;
      patients already under the Investigator's care who are indicated for XLIF with iliac crest&#xD;
      bone graft (ICBG) autograft or AttraX Putty. To minimize bias, all consecutive patients at a&#xD;
      given investigational site who meet eligibility requirements will be asked to consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study whereby the biologic (ICBG autograft or AttraX Putty) will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned. All subjects will be followed for 24 months following surgery to quantify&#xD;
      the clinical and radiographic improvements of each biologic compared to baseline and in&#xD;
      comparison with each other.&#xD;
