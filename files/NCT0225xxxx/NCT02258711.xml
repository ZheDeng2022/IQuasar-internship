  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a frequent condition in the general population with a high&#xD;
      morbimortality, which consists in dysfunctional temporal fluctuations between different mood&#xD;
      phases ranging from depression to manic episodes with frequent subsyndromal symptoms between&#xD;
      them. Usually during these phases, the subjects have a lack of insight about the diagnosis&#xD;
      and symptoms. Besides the pharmacological treatment, additional psychological interventions&#xD;
      have shown to improve the long-term outcome of the disorder, yet taking into account the&#xD;
      limited resources currently available, its general implementation is still difficult and&#xD;
      costly. Among these interventions, group psychoeducational programs have proved to be&#xD;
      cost-effective in helping patients recognize early signs and symptoms in order to prevent&#xD;
      full blown episodes which very usually are associated with a high morbidity and hospital&#xD;
      admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, numerous projects have tested the potential benefits of new technologies&#xD;
      such internet in the treatment of bipolar and psychotic disorders patients using either&#xD;
      online signs and symptoms monitoring or web-based psychoeducational programs, yet to the&#xD;
      investigators knowledge, none of them have integrated both approaches in one single&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis that, combining both interventions (signs and symptoms monitoring along with&#xD;
      psychoeducational contents) in a single smart-phone application will prove to be at least&#xD;
      equal or superior in terms of efficacy comparing to the standard treatment, seems promising,&#xD;
      given the fact that both approaches have independently demonstrated their efficacy in the&#xD;
      same population. This could extend the range of the patients in whom this kind of additional&#xD;
      interventions could be implemented; preventing relapses, suicide attempts, consultations and&#xD;
      hospitalizations at a much lower cost.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to develop and clinically validate a smart-phone application to&#xD;
      monitor symptoms and signs in stable bipolar patients, offering also customized embedded&#xD;
      psycho-education contents and empower the self-management of their disorder to avoid relapses&#xD;
      and hospitalizations. Secondary objectives will be to explore other clinical benefits among&#xD;
      the smart-phone application users such as biological rhythms, manic/hypomanic and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, quality of life, suicide attempts, pharmacological treatment changes as well as&#xD;
      healthcare resource consumption (outpatient and emergency room consultations) in order to&#xD;
      evaluate its cost-efficiency compared to current standard interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include stable bipolar patients (YMRS ≤ 8, HDRS ≤ 6 for at least one month&#xD;
      prior to study entry) who have experienced at least one hypomanic, manic or depressive&#xD;
      relapse during the 12 months prior to study entry. This will be carried out in three&#xD;
      different but complementary phases in order to fully include patients and therapist's&#xD;
      preferences. Along the process, confidential information and data handling will be tested to&#xD;
      ensure privacy and confidentiality are warranted. In this regard, an anonymized user name and&#xD;
      password will be given to the patients who will never have to reveal their real identity to&#xD;
      access the application during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First phase: During the first three months a feasibility study will be conducted&#xD;
           evaluating the use, reliability and satisfaction monitoring symptoms (subjective&#xD;
           information) using a smart-phone with the SIMPLe 1.0 application installed. The&#xD;
           intervention will be consecutively offered to 30 stable adults (&gt;18 years) fulfilling&#xD;
           inclusion criteria. The patient will have to read and agree with the terms and sign an&#xD;
           informed consent in order to participate. Sociodemographic data and standardized&#xD;
           clinical as well as functional assessments will be administered at baseline, at the&#xD;
           first, second and third month of the study. The assessments will include present manic&#xD;
           symptoms using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), depressive symptoms using the&#xD;
           Hamilton depression Rating Scale (HDRS), biological rhythms using the biological rhythms&#xD;
           interview of assessment in neuropsychiatry (BRIAN), quality of life measured by World&#xD;
           Health Organization quality of life assessment (WHOQOL-BREF) and treatment adherence&#xD;
           using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). A smart-phone device with the SIMPLe&#xD;
           1.0 application pre-installed, will be given to the participants for free during the&#xD;
           study with the mandatory condition that it has to be their main mobile-phone during the&#xD;
           next 3 months. In the case the patient accepts to participate but doesn´t want to switch&#xD;
           from his/her current smart-phone, he/she will be offered the possibility to download the&#xD;
           SIMPLe 1.0 application from the App Store and a username and password will be given to&#xD;
           use it. The SIMPLe 1.0 application will ask the user by customizable automatic reminder&#xD;
           notifications to answer daily and weekly questionnaires based on DSM-5 (Diagnostic and&#xD;
           Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) criteria for a manic, hypomanic,&#xD;
           mixed or depressive episode. The use frequency will be measured by the daily and weekly&#xD;
           questionnaires answered which will be registered online. At the same time they will&#xD;
           receive through the application daily customized psychoeducative messages based on the&#xD;
           information collected by the application. Feasibility and satisfaction will be assessed&#xD;
           with the application usage log data and an electronic survey, while the app reliability&#xD;
           to correctly asses the patients mood states will be analyzed comparing the clinical&#xD;
           assessments and the information collected by the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second phase: Individual personal interviews with each SIMPLe 1.0 user will also collect&#xD;
           qualitative information about the application and suggestions. Taking into consideration&#xD;
           the information collected from participants in the first phase, the application will be&#xD;
           adapted and improved with the addition of objective information (signs) monitoring&#xD;
           modules using mobile usage parameters and the built-in sensors. Focus groups will be&#xD;
           held with participants, psychiatrists and psychologists to better fit their needs and&#xD;
           incorporate suggestions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Third phase: A randomized controlled trial taking into consideration a significance&#xD;
           level of 0.05, power of 0.8 and a minimal detectable difference of 0.5 and an expected&#xD;
           drop-out of 15%, will be carried out with two arms of 74 patients each, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention group (SIMPLe 2.0 + TAU): The experimental group will use the&#xD;
                application SIMPLe 2.0 and simultaneously will receive their usual treatment which&#xD;
                includes pharmacological and psychological interventions. A smart-phone device with&#xD;
                the SIMPLe 2.0 application pre-installed, will be given to the participants for&#xD;
                free during the study with the mandatory condition that it has to be their main&#xD;
                mobile-phone during the next 3 months. In the case the patient accept to&#xD;
                participate but don´t want to switch from their current smart-phone, they will be&#xD;
                offered the possibility to download the SIMPLe 2.0 application from the App Store&#xD;
                and a username and password will be given to use it. The patient will be asked by&#xD;
                customizable automatic reminder notifications to answer daily and weekly&#xD;
                questionnaires based on DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
                Disorders, 5th edition) criteria for a manic, hypomanic or depressive episode.&#xD;
                Additionally, the signs will be automatically recorded based on the smart-phone&#xD;
                usage measured by the smart-phone screen on time, texts messages sent, telephone&#xD;
                calls made and social networking apps activity, in addition to the physical&#xD;
                activity monitored by the built-in actimeter. At the same time, they will receive&#xD;
                through the application daily psychoeducative customized messages based on the data&#xD;
                recollected by the application. Relapse risk will be fixed by means of a logarithm&#xD;
                including both subjective and objective data. If the logarithm points at a moderate&#xD;
                or high risk, the clinical team will be immediately contacted and the patient will&#xD;
                be offered to call emergency services for assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment as usual group (TAU): The treatment as usual (TAU) only group will be&#xD;
                followed-up with their usual treatment including pharmacological and psychological&#xD;
                interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial evaluation in both groups will be carried out recollecting sociodemographic data&#xD;
      and using standardized clinical as well as functional assessments which will be administered&#xD;
      again in three follow-up evaluations, at three, six and twelve months. The assessments will&#xD;
      include present manic symptoms using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), depressive symptoms&#xD;
      using the Hamilton depression Rating Scale (HDRS), functional impairment using the&#xD;
      Functioning assessment short test (FAST), biological rhythms using the biological rhythms&#xD;
      interview of assessment in neuropsychiatry (BRIAN), quality of life measured by World Health&#xD;
      Organization quality of life assessment (WHOQOL-BREF) and treatment adherence using the&#xD;
      Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). During the follow-up the number of relapses,&#xD;
      inpatient admissions, outpatient consultations, emergency rooms consultations and suicide&#xD;
      attempts will be registered. All participants in both groups must read and agree with the&#xD;
      terms and sign an informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. Psychiatrists and&#xD;
      psychologists conducting the evaluations will be blinded to which participant belongs to each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome to evaluate between both groups during this period will be number of&#xD;
      relapses (Manic, Hypomanic or Depressive Episodes) during the 6-month treatment phase.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include the number of relapses during 6-month post-intervention&#xD;
      follow-up (Manic, hypomanic and depressive episodes according to DSM-5 criteria). In addition&#xD;
      differences in biological rhythms (BRIAN), differences in manic symptoms using the Young&#xD;
      Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and depressive symptoms using the Hamilton depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      (HDRS) during the 6-month treatment phase and 6-month post-intervention follow-up.&#xD;
      Additionally the quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), functional Impairment (FAST) and treatment&#xD;
      adherence (Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS)) will be assessed each follow-up&#xD;
      assessment. Other outcomes include differences in healthcare resource consumption measured in&#xD;
      number and duration of hospitalizations, outpatient and emergency room consultations related&#xD;
      to their psychiatric disorder and pharmacological treatment changes (doses and agents&#xD;
      prescribed) over the 12 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of positive results, the tested app will allow a user-friendly, non-costly and&#xD;
      efficacious way to monitor and train stable bipolar patients avoiding recurrences, as an&#xD;
      add-on to usual pharmacological care. The implementation of this technology will also improve&#xD;
      associated healthcare costs.&#xD;
