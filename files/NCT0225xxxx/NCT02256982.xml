      This research study is evaluating the use of radiation therapy in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy as a possible treatment for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a rare form of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the possibility of using radiation therapy to treat intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma. Radiation therapy is used for many other types of malignancies, but its&#xD;
      use for the treatment of this form of gastrointestinal cancer has been limited. This&#xD;
      treatment is still being studied as research doctors are trying to find out more about its&#xD;
      use in the treatment of your form of gastrointestinal cancer. Short course photon radiation&#xD;
      and short course proton beam radiation therapies are FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration)&#xD;
      approved radiation delivery systems. This study will also test the safety of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy versus adjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant therapy is treatment given as a first&#xD;
      step to shrink a tumor before the main treatment, which is usually surgery, is given.&#xD;
      Adjuvant therapy is additional cancer treatment given after the primary treatment to lower&#xD;
      the risk that the cancer will come back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is to offer&#xD;
      surgical resection to all patients who have resectable disease and are able to tolerate a&#xD;
      major surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study interventions involved this trial may include one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy (Gemcitabine and Cisplatin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical Resection and Lymphadenectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation Therapy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible&#xD;
             to participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (IHC)&#xD;
             without evidence of extrahepatic metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥&#xD;
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with resectable disease must have a single tumor (with no satellite&#xD;
             lesions) with a total diameter or longest dimension of ≤ 20cm. Patients with&#xD;
             unresectable disease must have a total tumor diameter of &lt;20cm and ≤ 3 lesions.&#xD;
             Satellite lesions defined as lesions ≤ 2cm from the dominant lesion are permitted for&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  If patient has underlying cirrhosis, only Child-Pugh classification Group A patients&#xD;
             may be included in the resectable cohort of this study. For patients with unresectable&#xD;
             disease, Child-Pugh classification Groups A and B are allowed. Clinical assessment of&#xD;
             ascites and encephalopathy is required. Child-Pugh classification must be determined&#xD;
             for all study participants at the time of eligibility analysis. Note albumin and&#xD;
             PT/INR are required for Child-Pugh classification; these labs should be drawn with the&#xD;
             other labs required for eligibility analysis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of gemcitabine+cisplatin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Female patients of child bearing potential must&#xD;
             indicate to their physician that they are not pregnant at the time of enrollment or&#xD;
             have a negative serum pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be&#xD;
             eligible for admission into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy for intrahepatic&#xD;
             cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any other anti-cancer or investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to gemcitabine or cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with evidence of non-hepatic metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Local conditions or systemic illnesses which would reduce the local tolerance to&#xD;
             radiation treatment, such as serious local injuries, active collagen vascular disease,&#xD;
             etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a serious medical illness which may limit expected survival to less&#xD;
             than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with serious psychiatric illness or social situations which would limit&#xD;
             adherence to study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of&#xD;
             gemcitabine+cisplatin in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require anticoagulation should receive low-molecular weight or standard&#xD;
             heparin and not warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gemcitabine is a class D agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment&#xD;
             of the mother with gemcitabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with gemcitabine. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer&#xD;
             in situ, DCIS, stage I prostate cancer, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
             the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with gemcitabine+cisplatin. In&#xD;
             addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated&#xD;
             with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in&#xD;
             participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. HIV-positive&#xD;
             individuals on HAART will be considered eligible of they have demonstrated good&#xD;
             compliance and have a CD4 count &gt; 500.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior liver directed radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2.&#xD;
