        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed melanoma unresectable Stage III or Stage&#xD;
             IV positive for BRAF V600E, V600K, V600R or V600D by a CLIA approved assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate baseline organ function as determined by table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Table 2. Definitions for adequate baseline organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
        Laboratory Values&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hematologic:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ANC (absolute neutrophil count) ≥1.2 × 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PT/INR and PTT ≤ 1.3 x ULN (PT = prothrombin time; INR = international normalized&#xD;
             ratio; PTT = partial thromboplastin time; ULN = upper limit of normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hepatic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine transaminase) ≤ 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        Renal -- Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cardiac&#xD;
&#xD;
        -- Left Ventricular Ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ LLN (lower limit of normal) by ECHO&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects receiving anticoagulation treatment may be allowed to participate with INR&#xD;
        established within the therapeutic range prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If serum creatinine is &gt; 1.5 mg/dL, calculate creatinine clearance using standard&#xD;
        Cockcroft-Gault formula. Creatinine clearance must be ≥ 50 mL/min to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Except subjects with known Gilbert's syndrome. ECHO scans must be used throughout the study&#xD;
        when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to commencement of dosing in&#xD;
             premenopausal women. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included without serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥&#xD;
             1 year. Women must use an effective method of contraception from 14 days prior to&#xD;
             randomization, throughout the treatment period, and for at least 6 months after the&#xD;
             last dose of study treatment as directed by their physician. Effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than&#xD;
             1% per year) when used consistently and correctly (for example implants, injectables,&#xD;
             or intra-uterine devices). At the discretion of the investigator, acceptable methods&#xD;
             of contraception may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the&#xD;
             patient ensures compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception.) Hormonal-based methods (e.g., oral contraceptives) are NOT permitted&#xD;
             as contraception due to potential drug-drug interactions with dabrafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain metastases treated with whole brain radiation that have been&#xD;
             stable for 2 months are eligible; patients with brain metastases treated with gamma&#xD;

             procedure. Subjects are excluded if they have leptomeningeal or metastases causing&#xD;
             spinal cord compression that are symptomatic or untreated or not stable for ≥3 months&#xD;
             (must be documented by imaging) or requiring corticosteroids. Subjects on a stable&#xD;
             dose of corticosteroids &gt;1 month or who have been off of corticosteroids for at least&#xD;
             1 week can be enrolled with approval of the medical monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any number and type of prior anticancer therapies are allowed except BRAF or MEK&#xD;
             inhibitors .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have discontinued active immunotherapy (IL-2, interferon, CTLA-4, etc.)&#xD;
             or chemotherapy at least 4 weeks prior to entering the study and oral targeted therapy&#xD;
             at least 2 weeks prior to entering the study. Patients must not receive any other&#xD;
             investigational anticancer therapy during the period on study or the four weeks prior&#xD;
             to entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All prior anti-cancer treatment-related toxicities (except alopecia and laboratory&#xD;
             values as listed in Eligibility Criteria #4) must be Grade 1 according to the Common&#xD;
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE version 4.03, 2009) at the&#xD;
             time of starting treatment. Patients that are asymptomatic on low dose maintenance&#xD;
             hormone replacement delivered at a stable dose for prior toxicities are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient much have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medication and must not have any&#xD;
             clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such&#xD;
             as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known serious concurrent infection or medical illness, including&#xD;
             psychiatric disorders, which would jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive&#xD;
