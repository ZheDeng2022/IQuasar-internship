    <textblock>
      TAP block performed under ultrasound guidance is used as part of multimodal analgesia to&#xD;
      relieve pain after abdominal surgery in our hospital. Choices of local anaesthetic used&#xD;
      include bupivacaine and ropivacaine. Local anaesthetic works by inhibiting nerve transmission&#xD;
      of pain from the site of tissue injury. An important component of the pain experienced by&#xD;
      patients after abdominal surgery derives from the abdominal wall incision. The abdominal wall&#xD;
      sensory afferents course through the transversus abdominis (neurofascial) plane superficial&#xD;
      to the transversus abdominis muscle. Single shot TAP block has been shown to provide pain&#xD;
      relief of up to 24h in surgeries involving pfannenstiel incisions, hence a study period of&#xD;
      24h is chosen in patients undergoing hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the TAP block, as part of a multimodal&#xD;
      analgesic regimen, even at a lower concentration, would provide effective analgesia in the&#xD;
      first 24 h after hysterectomy, in comparison to a higher concentration of 0.4% ropivacaine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our study hypothesis is that TAP block performed with 0.2% ropivacaine is not inferior to&#xD;
      that using 0.4% ropivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure in this study was 24 h morphine consumption. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures included time to first request for morphine, VAS scores, and side effects associated&#xD;
      with morphine consumption which include nausea, vomiting, sedation, pruritus, as well as&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study hypothesis is that TAP block performed with 0.2% ropivacaine 40ml is not inferior&#xD;
      to that using 0.4% ropivacaine 40ml, in terms of analgesia in the first 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives Morphine consumption in the first 24h should not differ between the 2&#xD;
      groups by more than 10mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives Secondary objectives are to show that morphine side effects are similar&#xD;
      in the two groups if a lower ropivacaine provides similar pain relief as higher&#xD;
      concentration. Patient satisfaction is also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      54 patients undergoing hysterectomy will be recruited from SGH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Recruitment and Recruitment Process Patients will be shortlisted from the&#xD;
      surgical list the week prior to surgery. Patients seen in the pre anaesthetic assessment&#xD;
      clinic will also be invited to take part in the study. A simple history and physical&#xD;
      assessment will determine eligibility. Patients fitting the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      approached for the study with the emphasis that participation is voluntary and refusal to&#xD;
      participate will not affect subsequent conduct of anaesthesia or care. Patient's wishes will&#xD;
      be respected should she request not to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Double blind randomise control trial. Study design is non-inferiority trial&#xD;
      testing 0.2% ropivacaine vs 0.4% ropivacaine. Expected 1 year to complete recruitment of 54&#xD;
      patients. All patients are expected to participate in the study for a period of 24h and will&#xD;
      be followup during their convalescence in the hospital. There will be no change in scheduling&#xD;
      of operation or additional visits for the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound images of the block may be stored in the thumb drive. However, the images will not&#xD;
      be linked to patient identifiers. It will be stored in password protected thumb drive and&#xD;
      kept in the department under lock and key.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may be used for illustration if the research is published in a scientific journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and Blinding Patients will be randomised into of the 2 groups - 0.2% or 0.4%&#xD;
      ropivacaine group. The allocation sequence will be generated by a random number table, and&#xD;
      group allocation will be concealed in sealed, opaque envelopes, which will not be opened&#xD;
      until just prior to block performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaesthesiologist performing the block and anaesthesia will not be blinded. However, the&#xD;
      patient, surgeon and researcher collecting subsequent patient data will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation code will be broken after the final analysis of the study results. As both&#xD;
      study groups involve the use of ropivacaine at concentration below the maximum recommended&#xD;
      dose, the likelihood of needing to break the randomisation code is low. However, should that&#xD;
      become necessary, the study PI can break the code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits and Procedures Study visit 1: recruitment during pre-anaesthesia visit a day&#xD;
      before surgery Procedure: Bilateral TAP block after surgery, before reversal of anaesthesia.&#xD;
      Followup for 24h, which includes 1 study visit to elicit pain scores and side effects of&#xD;
      opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visits and Procedures History and physical examination are required to evaluate&#xD;
      recruitment criteria. Patients will be invited to participate in the study after meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 visit in the post operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be seen once after operation in the first post operative day to assess for VAS&#xD;
      scores, and side effects associated with morphine consumption which include nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      sedation, pruritus, as well as patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Study Follow up and Procedures Patient will be seen once after operation in the first&#xD;
      post operative day to assess for VAS scores, and side effects associated with morphine&#xD;
      consumption which include nausea, vomiting, sedation, pruritus, as well as patient&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
