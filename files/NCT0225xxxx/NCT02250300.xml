  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study of MLN9708 for the prophylaxis of chronic&#xD;
      graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the phase I portion, patients undergoing both sibling and unrelated donor&#xD;
      transplantation will be enrolled on the same arm to determine the dose-limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the phase II portion of the trial, patients will be enrolled into two separate and&#xD;
      independent cohorts: a) Matched sibling transplants and b) Unrelated donors transplants. Both&#xD;
      cohorts will be enrolled and analyzed separately.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  For potential candidates for this trial, the recommended acute GVHD prophylaxis is a&#xD;
           tacrolimus, methotrexate and atorvastatin combination. However, any acute GVHD&#xD;
           prophylaxis regimen at the discretion of treating physician (not involving in vivo or ex&#xD;
           vivo T-cell depletion, cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) + cell selection, or&#xD;
           post-HCT cyclophosphamide) will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the phase I portion for chronic GVHD prophylaxis, four doses of MLN9708 will be&#xD;
           administered orally (to patients undergoing either matched sibling or unrelated donor&#xD;
           transplantation) on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, starting on day +60 to +74 post allogeneic&#xD;
           HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If zero of three patients experienced DLT at dose level 2, then it would be considered a MTD.&#xD;
      If two or more patients experienced a DLT, dose escalation would halt and the dose level&#xD;
      would be expanded to six patients to determine the MTD. If the dose level below already has&#xD;
      six patients, enrolled, then it will be considered the MTD. If two or more patients&#xD;
      experience DLT on first dose level (i.e., dose level 1), then, patients will be enrolled on&#xD;
      dose level -1. No intrapatient dose escalation will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MTD is defined at maximum dose level with fewer than two of six patients experiencing&#xD;
           DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The phase II portion will utilize the MTD for MLN9708, determined from phase I portion&#xD;
           of the study. In phase II, patients will be enrolled in two independent cohorts of&#xD;
           matched sibling and matched unrelated donor transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the phase II portion, for chronic GVHD prophylaxis, four doses of MLN9708 will be&#xD;
           administered orally on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, starting on day +60 to +90 post allogeneic&#xD;
           HCT.&#xD;

             globulin, and/or campath, one receiving post-HCT planned cyclophosphamide will not be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Method of stem-cell collection from the donor will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
             treating physician. Although it is anticipated that majority of patients will receive&#xD;
             allograft mobilized with Granulocyte- colony stimulating factor (CSF) alone; however&#xD;
             donors receiving allografts mobilized with experimental agents (e.g. plerixafor) will&#xD;

             HCT) or progression (for those in partial remission, stable or refractory disease at&#xD;
             the time of HCT) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Donor lymphocyte infusions between day zero of HCT and first dose of MLN9708 are not&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Patients with steroid refractory (defined as no improvement of symptoms after 7 days&#xD;
             of systemic corticosteroids at a dose of ≥1mg/kg/day) grade II-IV acute GVHD, that is&#xD;
             active at the time of enrollment will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with grade III-IV acute GVHD (even if it is not meeting criteria for steroid&#xD;
             refractory acute GVHD), that is active at the time of enrollment will be excluded.&#xD;
             Patients with controlled grade I-II acute GVHD can be enrolled after discussing with&#xD;
             study PI. Topical or systemic corticosteroids therapy, as per standard of care for&#xD;
             such grade I-II acute GVHD patients is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;

         14. No major surgery within 14 days before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. No radiotherapy within 14 days before enrollment. If the involved field is small, 7&#xD;

             the MLN9708.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. No evidence of current uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months. Cardiac enzyme&#xD;
             elevations for reasons other than document myocardial infarction is not an exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. No systemic treatment, within 14 days before the first dose of MLN9708, with strong&#xD;
             inhibitors of CYP1A2 (fluvoxamine, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin), strong inhibitors of&#xD;
             cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) (clarithromycin, telithromycin,&#xD;
             itraconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole) or strong CYP3A&#xD;
             inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital),&#xD;
             or use of Ginkgo biloba or St. John's wort.&#xD;
&#xD;

             potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. No participation in other clinical trials, including those with other investigational&#xD;
             agents within 21days of the start of this trial and throughout the duration of this&#xD;
             trial. However co-enrollment on trials evaluating conditioning regimens, institutional&#xD;
             protocols evaluating atorvastatin for acute GVHD prophylaxis, and stem cell collection&#xD;
             protocols in transplant donors will be permitted. In addition patients randomized to&#xD;
             standard-of-care (non experimental) arms of available phase II/III trials will be&#xD;
             eligible for this study.&#xD;
