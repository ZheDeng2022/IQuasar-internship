      Rationale: The live attenuated Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine protects against&#xD;
      extrapulmonary infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and leprosy. It has been shown that&#xD;
      vaccination with BCG also leads to nonspecific protective effects, e.g. reduced infant&#xD;
      mortality as a result of less severe infections, stimulation of the immune system in patients&#xD;
      with bladder cancer and higher cytokine production upon restimulation of macrophages with&#xD;
      non-related infectious pathogens in vitro. However, because the live attenuated BCG vaccine&#xD;
      cannot be used in immune compromised hosts, the investigators would like to determine whether&#xD;
      similar protective non-specific effects can be induced by γ-irradiated BCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine whether vaccination with γ-irradiated BCG results in a higher&#xD;
      cytokine response by monocytes upon restimulation in vitro with infectious pathogens,&#xD;
      compared to monocytes before the vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Explorative intervention trial. Study population: Healthy volunteers, 18 - 55&#xD;
      years old. Intervention: Healthy volunteers will be vaccinated with γ-irradiated BCG vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Blood will be drawn before and at two different time points&#xD;
      after vaccination with BCG to perform restimulation of isolated cells in vitro and compare&#xD;
      cytokine production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: There is no known direct benefit for the volunteers to participate in the trial.&#xD;
      The risks are negligible. BCG vaccination can cause pain and scarring at the site of&#xD;
      injection, just as fever and headache. Local hematoma formation can occur at the site of the&#xD;
      blood drawing. This will be minimized by the blood collection by experienced persons.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           The live attenuated Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine protects against&#xD;
           extrapulmonary infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and against leprosy [1, 2]. It&#xD;
           has been shown that vaccination with BCG also leads to non-specific protective effects:&#xD;
           early administration of BCG vaccination could lead to reduced child mortality, mainly as&#xD;
           a result of reduced neonatal sepsis, respiratory infection, and fever. [3-5]&#xD;
           Furthermore, BCG has also been used in patients with bladder cancer, to induce an&#xD;
           improved reaction of the immune system, which prevents tumor progression and dead. [6]&#xD;
           Recently, it was shown that BCG vaccination can induce epigenetic changes in human&#xD;
           monocytes, which result in higher pro-inflammatory cytokines response upon restimulation&#xD;
           with non-related pathogens in vitro. [7] The observed effects are proposed to be due to&#xD;
           modulation of the human innate immune system, in a process called 'trained immunity'.&#xD;
           Upon stimulation with a pathogen, the innate immune system becomes primed and is able to&#xD;
           react faster and more efficient to a secondary (and non-related) stimulus. [7, 8]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Considering these beneficial effects of BCG on innate host defense, it is reasonable to&#xD;
           hypothesize that it would be helpful to generate a 'trained immunity status' in hosts&#xD;
           defective in T- and B-cell immunity, as they are more vulnerable to infections. However,&#xD;
           because of their immune compromised status, these patients cannot be vaccinated with&#xD;
           live attenuated vaccines (e.g. BCG). [9] Vaccination with y-irradiated BCG would be&#xD;
           possible, but it is not known whether the γ-irradiated vaccine has the same protective&#xD;
           non-specific effects on innate host defense. In recent in-vitro experiments, the&#xD;
           investigators have demonstrated that y-irradiated BCG can train monocytes in vitro (not&#xD;
           published). Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine whether γ-irradiated BCG is&#xD;
           able to train the human innate immune system of healthy volunteers in-vivo, just as&#xD;
           shown before with the live attenuated BCG vaccine [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective: To determine whether γ-irradiated BCG can train the innate immune&#xD;
           system in vivo, by comparing cytokine production upon ex-vivo restimulation with&#xD;
           pathogens before, 2 weeks and 3 months after vaccination with y-irradiated BCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           An explorative intervention study with a duration of three months will be performed. 15&#xD;
           Healthy volunteers will be recruited to receive a vaccination with γ-irradiated BCG.&#xD;
           After informed consent, 40ml of blood will be drawn before vaccination and at 2 weeks&#xD;
           and 3 months post-vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY POPULATION 4.1 Population Healthy volunteers, 18 - 55 yr old. 4.2 Inclusion&#xD;
           criteria The subjects must be healthy adults, aged 18 - 55 years old. 4.3 Exclusion&#xD;
           criteria Subjects are excluded when they are from tuberculosis endemic countries, if&#xD;
           they have been in contact with tuberculosis patients or if they already have been&#xD;
           vaccinated with BCG. The subjects are excluded from the study if they suffer for any&#xD;
           disease, including intercurrent infections. Subjects are not allowed to use any&#xD;
           medication except oral anticonceptive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Sample size calculation This is an explorative trial, for which sample size&#xD;
           calculation is not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 5.1 Investigational product/treatment Subjects will be vaccinated&#xD;
           with a y-irradiated BCG vaccine (BCG-Vaccin SSI [Nederlands Vaccin Instituut]), which is&#xD;
           purchased from Radboud Apotheek B.V.&#xD;
&#xD;
           γ-Irradiation of the BCG vaccine will be performed by Synergy Health Ede B.V., Ede, The&#xD;
           Netherlands (registered by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs). The BCG vaccine was&#xD;
           radiated in the original packaging with an average dose of 32.2kGy in a JS6500 Tote Box&#xD;
           Irradiator. This dose is based on an in the literature accepted minimal dose of 25kGy,&#xD;
           which has been proven to be sufficient to kill M. tuberculosis [10, 11] . After&#xD;
           irradiation the vaccine will be returned unopened in the original packaging. During the&#xD;
           irradiation a dosimeter is included, so each irradiated batch will come along with a&#xD;
           certificate with the exact irradiation dose used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Use of co-intervention Subjects are not allowed to use any medication, except for&#xD;
           oral anticonception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 6.1 Name and description of investigational product(s)&#xD;
           y-Irradiated BCG vaccine (BCG-Vaccin SSI [Nederlands Vaccin Instituut]) Danish strain&#xD;
           1331.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2 Summary of findings from non-clinical studies The efficacy of killing by&#xD;
           γ-irradiating of the BCG vaccine was verified by culturing the y-irradiated BCG in&#xD;
           special tuberculosis culture medium. No growth was detected after six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.3 Summary of findings from clinical studies A related study with a comparable study&#xD;
           setup, in which 20 healthy volunteers were vaccinated with live attenuated BCG vaccine&#xD;
           has already been accomplished. [7] The investigators study will use the same study&#xD;
           protocol. The only difference is that instead of the live attenuated BCG vaccine a&#xD;
           y-irradiated BCG vaccine will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.4 Summary of known and potential risks and benefits There are no clear benefits for&#xD;
           the volunteers. Potential risks are very small, as BCG is considered a safe vaccine. BCG&#xD;
           vaccination can cause pain and scarring at the site of injection just as fever and&#xD;
           headache, and very sporadic occurring side effects as syncope, convulsions and allergic&#xD;
           reaction. Local hematoma formation can occur at the site of the blood drawing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.5 Description and justification of route of administration and dosage Administer at&#xD;
           the upper arm slowly, in about 10 seconds, intracutaneous 0.1ml of the suspended&#xD;
           vaccine, which accounts for 0.075mg of Mycobacterium bovis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. METHODS 7.1 Study parameters/endpoints Before the vaccination and at two different time&#xD;
           points after vaccination with γ-irradiated BCG (2 weeks and 3 months) blood will be&#xD;
           drawn, from which PBMCs will be isolated by density centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque.&#xD;
           Monocytes will be restimulated ex-vivo with different pathogens (M. tuberculosis&#xD;
           (1µg/ml), S. aureus, C. albicans (both 1 x 10^6 microorganisms/ml), and E. coli LPS&#xD;
           (10ng/ml). Cytokine production will be assessed after 24h (TNFa, IL 1b and IL-6), 48h&#xD;
           (IFN, IL-10) and 7 days (IL-17, IL-22) stimulation, and compared with cytokine&#xD;
           production before vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Study procedures Subjects will be vaccinated with y-irradiated BCG vaccine. Before and&#xD;
      twice after vaccination, 40ml of blood will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3 Withdrawal of individual subjects Subjects can leave the study at any time for any reason&#xD;
      if they wish to do so without any consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.4 Replacement of individual subjects after withdrawal Each withdrawn subject will be&#xD;
      replaced, in order that in total 15 subjects will complete the follow-up.&#xD;
