    <textblock>
      This will be an open, prospective pilot study with pharmacological analysis. This study is&#xD;
      designed to assess the efficacity and safety of dexmedetomidine-based sedation in two&#xD;
      subgroups of neurocritically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 48&#xD;
      hours. Those with or at risk for intracranial hypertension requiring deep sedation and those&#xD;
      requiring a light to moderate sedation for early neurological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the feasability of dexmedetomidine infusion in terms of&#xD;
      efficacy and safety (especially cardiovascular tolerance) in brain-injured patients admitted&#xD;
      to intensive care unit and requiring sedation and mechanical ventilation for a predictable&#xD;
      duration greater than or equal to 48 hours. Secondary objectives include the study of&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters evolution, dose-response relationship, blood (+/- cerebrospinal fluid)&#xD;
      drug concentration, opioates and co-hypnotic consumption.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A written informed consent will be obtained from patients next-of-kin, before study&#xD;
      enrollment according to inclusion and exclusion criterias. All consecutive brain-injured&#xD;
      patients (traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage, postoperative&#xD;
      neurosurgical procedure) admitted to our neurocritical care unit, older than 18 years and&#xD;
      requiring sedation and analgesia for mechanical ventilation longer than 48 hours, will be&#xD;
      eligible for the study. Depending on the absence or presence of lesion which may increase&#xD;
      intracranial pressure, patients will be included in the &quot;light to moderate&quot; sedation subgroup&#xD;
      (MLS) or in the &quot;deep&quot; sedation subgroup (DS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MLS subgroup (RASS 0/-3), sedation and analgesia will be drived by propofol and&#xD;
      opiates. Once the goals of sedation achieved with usual hypnotic, dexmedetomidine will be&#xD;
      initiated at a dose of 0.5 μg/kg/h, and then gradually increased or decreased by increments&#xD;
      of 0.1 μ g / kg / h all hours to a maximum dose of 1.4 μg/kg/h, depending on the target&#xD;
      sedation achievement. Propofol will be discontinued at study drug initiation. Dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      infusion will bemaintained at least during 48 hours, evaluation of the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      will be continuous during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After these first 48 hours, in the absence of neurological worsening requiring a deep&#xD;
      sedation and if sedation's levels will are achieved with dexmedetomidine alone (ie without&#xD;
      requirement of propofol continuous administration) , it will be maintained untill withdrawal&#xD;
      of mechanical ventilation. Otherwise, study drug will discontinued and propofol will be&#xD;
      restarted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the DS subgroup, &quot;deep&quot; sedation (RASS -4/-5) will be achieved by propofol infusion. If&#xD;
      sedation level are not achieved with the maximum recommended propofol dose (5mg/kg/h),&#xD;
      midazolam will be started to reach target sedation level with a maximum dose of 0.15mg/kg/h.&#xD;
      Once the goals of sedation will be achieved a dexmedetomidine infusion will be initiated at a&#xD;
      dose of 0.5 μg/kg/h and then gradually titrated by increase of 0.1 μg/kg/h every hour up to&#xD;
      the maximum patient-tolerated dose (maximum dose of 1.4 μg/kg/h). Conventional hypnotic doses&#xD;
      will be adjusted according to the sedation target. In parallel to dexmedetomidine titration,&#xD;
      midazolam first and then propofol will be decreased. The study drug will be maintained at the&#xD;
      maximum patient-tolerated dose for a total of 48 hours during which the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      will be assessed continuously. After this period, dexmedetomidine will be discontinued.&#xD;
      According to the patient's neurological evolution, either sedation objectives will remain&#xD;
      identical (RASS -4/-5), or sedation will be decreased. Conventional hypnotic will be used&#xD;
      again to achieve these objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected result of this study is to confirm that the administration of dexmedetomidine is&#xD;
      effective and safe for &quot;light to moderate&quot; and &quot;deep&quot; sedation of brain-injured patients&#xD;
      admitted to intensive care unit. In addition, this feasibility study could provide legitimacy&#xD;
      if the results are conclusive, to conduct a prospective multicenter randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial on the potential benefits of dexmedetomidine in neurocritical ill patients.&#xD;
