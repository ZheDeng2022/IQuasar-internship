  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After myopia, the second etiology of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in young adults (&lt;50&#xD;
      years old) is idiopathic choroidal neovascularization (ICNV) whose etiology remains unknown.&#xD;
      This is a rare and severe disease, which can lead to blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICNV is treated at the moment with off-label anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)&#xD;
      therapy and could also benefit from aflibercept (EYLEA), a new anti-VEGF currently indicated&#xD;
      in Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Case reports suggest that such patients would not&#xD;
      need as many injections as in AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTUITION is an open-label, single arm, prospective, multicenter, phase II study. The main&#xD;
      objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness in clinical terms after 52 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      with aflibercept on the visual acuity of patients affected by ICNV. A specific dosage regimen&#xD;
      is designed to achieve maximum efficiency. The patients are followed on a monthly basis until&#xD;
      52 weeks. Intravitreal injections of aflibercept are initiated with a Treat &amp; Extend (TAE)&#xD;
      regimen until 20 weeks (3 mandatory injections with reinjection only in case of CNV&#xD;
      activity). Then, a pro re nata (PRN) regimen is considered until 52 weeks (reinjection in&#xD;
      case of CNV activity).&#xD;

    <description>The patients are followed on a monthly basis until 52 weeks. Intravitreal injections of aflibercept at a dosage of 2 mg are initiated with a TAE regimen until 20 weeks (3 mandatory injections at inclusion, week 8 and 20 with reinjection at week 4, 12 and 16 only in case of CNV activity). Then, a PRN regimen is considered until 52 weeks (reinjection in case of CNV activity). Therefore, each patient receives between 3 and 13 injections in the whole study.</description>
