      BACKGROUND: Surgical injury and inflammation provoke a stereotypical stress response. Insulin&#xD;
      resistance plays an intriguing role in these metabolic alterations and depends on the&#xD;
      intensity of injury. Metabolic derangements resulting from peripheral insulin resistance are&#xD;
      unambiguously related to adverse outcomes and higher perioperative complication rates.&#xD;
      Therefore, insulin resistance offers to act as a marker for stress and is potentially&#xD;
      relevant in predicting clinical outcome. Plasma-glycosylated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) is an&#xD;
      established indicator for blood glucose control and has a prognostic value regarding outcomes&#xD;
      after major surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose tissue holds a key function in endocrine metabolism by releasing multiple substances,&#xD;
      so-called adipose-derived secreted factors or adipokines. Recent studies have linked several&#xD;
      adipokines to overall insulin sensitivity in metabolic syndrome-related conditions as well as&#xD;
      in critical illness. Irisin, a recently identified myokine acts on white adipose tissue and&#xD;
      plays a role in the prevention of insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to assess the level and the effects of&#xD;
      perioperative insulin resistance on clinical outcome in cardiac surgery patients. Based on&#xD;
      previous studies suggesting glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance are associated with&#xD;
      severity of illness and outcome in critically ill patients,it is proposed that patients with&#xD;
      marked insulin resistance suffer from worse clinical outcome. This study protocol evaluates&#xD;
      the ability of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), quantitative insulin sensitivity check&#xD;
      index (QUICKI), HbA1c, the adipokines Angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2), C-X-C motif&#xD;
      chemokine 5 (CXCL5), and visfatin, and the myokine irisin to indicate perioperative insulin&#xD;
      resistance and explores for correlation with adverse clinical outcomes after 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL &amp; METHODS: 325 patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit after elective&#xD;
      on-pump cardiac surgery will be consecutively enrolled. Baseline characteristics and routine&#xD;
      blood samples will be assessed the day before surgery. Study blood samples will be drawn&#xD;
      preoperatively in the induction bay of anesthesia to measure the insulin resistance indices&#xD;
      HOMA and QUICKI, HbA1c, ANGPTL2, CXCL5, visfatin, and irisin. Blood glucose, irisin,&#xD;
      adipokines, and routine biochemical tests will be assessed upon admission to the intensive&#xD;
      care unit and on postoperative days 1 and 3. Adverse outcomes will be assessed 30 days after&#xD;
      surgery. Sample size is set to ensure at least 80% power at a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;

        A total of 325 patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit after elective on-pump&#xD;
        cardiac surgery (Table 1) will be consecutively enrolled. This study population has been&#xD;
        chosen not only because of the clinically relevant stress response to cardiac surgery but&#xD;
        also because of the opportunity to differentiate between the different impacts of the&#xD;
        cardiovascular system and the metabolic state on insulin resistance.&#xD;
