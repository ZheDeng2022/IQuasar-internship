  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least one fifth of patients in European hospitals are malnourished. Malnutrition is&#xD;
      associated with negative consequences, including higher rates of complications, longer&#xD;
      hospital stay, impaired wound healing and increased mortality with consequent effects on&#xD;
      costs of healthcare. Evidence suggests that there may be benefits to some malnourished&#xD;
      patients from receiving oral nutrition supplements in the short-term but it is not known&#xD;
      whether these benefits can be sustained and indeed whether similar benefits may be achieved&#xD;
      using food-based interventions of lower cost. The overall objective of the study is to&#xD;
      compare two nutritional interventions among malnourished patients with COPD (n=200); oral&#xD;
      nutrition supplement (ONS) vs. energy and protein dense in-between meals snack during&#xD;
      hospitalisation and at home. Subjects will be followed for one year. The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      weight change. Secondary endpoints include forced expiratory volume in one second, forced&#xD;
      vital capacity, six-minute walk distance, hand-grip strength, health related quality of life,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, energy- and protein intake, readmissions to the hospital and acute&#xD;
      exacerbation. No studies are available comparing the supply of ONS to malnourished patients&#xD;
      with COPD compared with the provision of regular food (in-between meals snacks). The results&#xD;
      of the study will provide important information that might improve nutrition care in the&#xD;
      hospital setting as well as after discharge from the hospital&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with established COPD admitted to the Department of Pulmonary Medicine at&#xD;
      Landspitali National University Hospital from September 2014-September 2016 will be screened&#xD;
      for malnutrition using the NRS2002 screening tool, recommended by ESPEN. Those identified at&#xD;
      risk of malnutrition and are able to give informed consent will be recruited. According to&#xD;
      the Hospital statistics and previous studies on the frequency of malnutrition in this patient&#xD;
      group, the time frame for recruitment is long enough to recruit 200 subjects who will be&#xD;
      randomised into the two study groups (~ 3 subjects per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following baseline data will be collected in order to identify possible confounders. This&#xD;
      will include; socio-demographic data (age, gender, civil status, household size, family and&#xD;
      social network); major medical diagnosis; use of medication; GOLD score (Global Initiative&#xD;
      for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease), depressive symptoms, cognition), additional discharge&#xD;
      interventions (e.g. outgoing hospital teams, day care with exercise); and use of oral&#xD;
      nutritional supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newly admitted patients &gt; 18 years old who were at nutritional risk according to the&#xD;
           validated nutritional risk screening tool (NRS-2002, score 3+)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to eat orally&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An anticipated length of hospitalization of &gt; 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sufficient language proficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dysphagia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food allergy or intolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anatomical obstructions preventing oral food intake Exclusion during follow-up: Subjects&#xD;
           who withdraw their consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is weight changes up to one year from admission to the hospital.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital&#xD;
      capacity (FVC), six-minute walk distance, hand-grip strength, health related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQoL), length of hospital stay, nutritional status, energy- and protein intake,&#xD;
      readmissions to the hospital in within 30 days, as well as the total number of readmissions&#xD;
      to the hospital and acute exacerbation during follow-up. Functional outcome measurements will&#xD;
      be conducted by trained research assistant in collaboration with the PhD student. Information&#xD;
      about background diets, HRQoL as well as compliance to the intervention diets will be&#xD;
      gathered by the PhD and MS students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be conducted at admission to the hospital (baseline measurements) and&#xD;
      before discharge from the hospital. Clinical examinations at Landspitali National University&#xD;
      Hospital are planned 3, 6 and 12 months after discharge from the hospital. All together we&#xD;
      aim at having five measurement points for each subject. Each examination will take ~ 80&#xD;
      minutes (30 min for the FEV1 and FVC tests, 20 min for the walking test and measurement of&#xD;
      hand-grip strength, and 30 min for the 24-hour recalls and HRQoL questionnaires).&#xD;
      Additionally, the subjects will be contacted on at least two other occasions by phone, in&#xD;
      weeks 2 and 6 (each interview ~20 min).&#xD;

    <description>Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score (SGRQ) This validated questionnaire is based on 76 items used to calculate three component scores: symptoms, activity and impact, and a total score. A score of 100 represents worst possible health status and a score of 0 represents best possible health status. A change of 4 points in the SGRQ total score is considered the minimum clinically relevant difference.</description>

A change of 4 points in the SGRQ total score is considered the minimum clinically relevant difference.</description>
