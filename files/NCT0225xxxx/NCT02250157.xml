      This study a nonrandomized, open-label, uncontrolled, single group assignment, safety and&#xD;
      activity study in subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor that is&#xD;
      metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not&#xD;
      exist or are no longer effective.&#xD;

      This study consists of Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 of this study is a &quot;3+3&quot; design to define&#xD;
      the MTD of Oratecan in up to 60 evaluable subjects. It will be conducted in 2 parts; 1A will&#xD;
      test the oral liquid formulation and 1B will test the oral tablet formulation of irinotecan.&#xD;
      Part 2 will enroll an additional 10 subjects at the Part 1 MTD to further characterize the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and activity of Oratecan at that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a potent anticancer drug under the class of camptothecins that is&#xD;
      marketed under the trade name Camptosar. Irinotecan is a prodrug that is activated via&#xD;
      carboxylesterase in liver and intestines to its active form, SN38 which is approximately 1000&#xD;
      times more cytotoxic than irinotecan itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product (IP) Oratecan is comprised of the approved drug irinotecan with&#xD;
      HM30181 methanesulfonate monohydrate (HM30181), a novel p-glycoprotein (P-gp) pump inhibitor.&#xD;
      Oratecan is intended for the treatment of irinotecan-responsive cancers. The antitumor&#xD;
      activity of Oratecan is due to the action of irinotecan. Combining HM30181 with irinotecan&#xD;
      allows intestinal absorption and systemic exposure of irinotecan and its active metabolite,&#xD;
      SN38, at therapeutic levels after oral administration.&#xD;
