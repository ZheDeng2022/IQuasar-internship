  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose in this project to determine the effect of 3 days of frequent&#xD;
      interruption of prolonged sitting on metabolic health in healthy overweight sedentary adults&#xD;
      (n=24), as compared to 3 days including a single long bout of isocaloric exercise or a&#xD;
      control condition where subjects do not exercise but are subjected to prolonged sitting. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that this proposed project will provide an initial evidence base for&#xD;
      the health benefits of breaking up prolonged sitting with short bursts of moderate-intensity&#xD;
      activity, like walking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although public-health recommendations to engage in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity&#xD;
      (at least 30min, 5 days / week) have been widely promulgated by the government, most people&#xD;
      are physically inactive. Sedentary behaviors, like time spent sitting, are associated with&#xD;
      serious implications on metabolic health, indicating that even in individuals who regularly&#xD;
      exercise a reduction in time spent sitting can confer health benefits. Encouraging recent&#xD;
      evidence shows that walking breaks throughout the day are an effective strategy to offset the&#xD;
      deleterious effects of prolonged uninterrupted sitting. Further data however are needed to&#xD;
      better understand the effect of these microbursts of activity along the day. The&#xD;
      investigators propose in this project to determine the effect of 3 days of frequent&#xD;
      interruption of prolonged sitting on metabolic health in healthy overweight sedentary adults&#xD;
      (n=24), as compared to 3 days including a single long bout of isocaloric exercise or a&#xD;
      control condition where subjects do not exercise but are subjected to prolonged sitting.&#xD;
      Plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides and free fatty acids concentrations and the use of&#xD;
      substrate (glucose, fat or protein) to provide energy to the body in response to meals&#xD;
      consumption will be measured on day 3 of each of these three conditions. The investigators&#xD;
      will furthermore assess the ability of the participants to perform the interventions on&#xD;
      physical activity at the end of each day over the three days of intervention (2 days in&#xD;
      free-living conditions and one day in a controlled environment). The investigators believe&#xD;
      that this proposed project will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of&#xD;
      breaking up prolonged sitting with short bursts of moderate-intensity activity, like walking.&#xD;
      This innovative strategy may be more effective at combating the adverse effects of sedentary&#xD;
      behaviors than more traditional approaches like structured exercise.&#xD;

    <description>Total fat oxidation during the test day will be determined using whole-room indirect calorimetry. O2 consumption and CO2 production will be determined from the flow rates and differences in gas concentrations between air entering and air exiting the calorimeter as previously described</description>

    <measure>Postprandial plasma insulin and glucose response</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma glucose and insulin will be measured in fasting conditions and hourly during 12hrs following a standard meal consumption. The area under the curve will be calculated for both plasma glucose and insulin. This area will represent the postprandial response to a meal for both insulin and glucose.</description>

    <description>Subjects will collect their own hourly breath sampling for 13CO2 by blowing through a straw into two 15ml Vacutainer after the investigators will have shown them the procedure. Breath CO2 will be sampled directly from the Vacutainer with a syringe, and 13CO2 /12CO2 measured with Isotopic Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS).</description>

    <description>The patient will be asked to perform the 45 minutes of moderate-exercise intervention in the morning once per day for two days in their daily life. This bout of exercise will be supervised by study staff on one of the treadmills On day 3 the patient will report at the Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) of the University Hospital of Colorado and will spend 24hr in the room calorimeter. During the day, you will be asked to sit quietly in a chair, except to rise from the chair to void, and to perform one bout of 45-min moderate-intensity walking on a treadmill.</description>
