  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even in individuals treated for HIV, chronic immune activation persists and is associated&#xD;
      with increased cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and mortality. HIV-infected individuals&#xD;
      have imbalances in the community of intestinal microbes which is thought to contribute to&#xD;
      increased and persistent inflammation. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and&#xD;
      durability of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), the transfer of the bacterial community in&#xD;
      stool from a healthy donor, in HIV+ individuals on anti-retroviral therapy. The study will&#xD;
      also measure the effects of FMT on immune activation and inflammatory biomarkers in&#xD;
      anti-retroviral treated HIV+ individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), chronic immune activation persists and is a major&#xD;
      driver of HIV disease progression and mortality among HIV-infected individuals. Importantly,&#xD;
      persistent inflammation is strongly associated with increased cardiovascular events,&#xD;
      accelerated liver disease, impaired immunologic recovery (e.g. low CD4 count, low CD4 to CD8&#xD;
      ratio), and mortality. Therefore, addressing persistent inflammation remains a major goal to&#xD;
      restoring health in HIV-infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel therapeutic strategies to decrease immune activation in treated HIV infection are&#xD;
      needed. Marked disruption of the gut microbial composition, or dysbiosis, is characteristic&#xD;
      of HIV-infected individuals and persists despite long-term ART. Recent studies demonstrate&#xD;
      that the relative degree of gut microbiome disruption positively correlates with inflammatory&#xD;
      markers (IL-6, kynurenine to tryptophan ratio). Microbial dysbiosis and its inflammatory&#xD;
      consequences may be an attractive target for interventions to decrease immune activation in&#xD;
      HIV+ individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) has proven durable and successful as a therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy against gut dysbiosis, such as in the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile&#xD;
      infection, by restructuring the composition of the gut microbiome to resemble that of the&#xD;
      healthy donor. FMT has an established record of safety with limited adverse effects, even in&#xD;
      the context of immunocompromised and HIV-infected subjects. Donor selection and screening&#xD;
      will be conducted by OpenBiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this phase I clinical trial is to establish the safety and durability of FMT&#xD;
      in HIV+ individuals. The microbiome of recipients will be analyzed up to 8 weeks post FMT for&#xD;
      evidence of engraftment from the donor microbiome. We will further examine the effect of FMT&#xD;
      on markers of immune activation and inflammation in ART treated HIV-infected individuals.&#xD;

    <description>Determine the proportion of individuals with AE/SAE. Record AE/SAE during FMT and post-FMT and determine if related to study procedure and graded for severity.
