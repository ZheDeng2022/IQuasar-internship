  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which the efficacy between SPIES&#xD;
      assisted and WLI assisted TURB are compared. Subjects in the experimental arm (Arm A) will&#xD;
      undergo SPIES assisted TURB, whereas subjects in the control arm (Arm B) will receive&#xD;
      treatment with WLI assisted TURB only. Baseline characteristics will be recorded, as well as&#xD;
      short and long-term follow up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which the recurrence rates of&#xD;
      cancer between SPIES assisted and WLI assisted TURB are compared. Randomization is stratified&#xD;
      by tumor multiplicity (single or multiple), tumor status (primary or recurrent) and&#xD;
      macroscopic findings (papillary or flat, where CIS is scored as flat lesion). Patients&#xD;
      randomized into the experimental arm (Arm A) will undergo SPIES and WLI assisted TURB,&#xD;
      whereas the patients in the control arm (Arm B) will undergo WLI only assisted TURB. WLI is&#xD;
      chosen as control, since it is considered the gold standard for detecting bladder tumors.&#xD;
      Short and long term follow up will be recorded in order to evaluate the health gains for&#xD;
      patients over a longer period. Perioperative (30 days) complications will be compared between&#xD;
      the two treatment arms to evaluate the safety of SPIES.&#xD;
