      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of Oral ONC201 in treating patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors. Oral ONC201 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of single agent ONC201 orally once every three&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize pharmacokinetics of ONC201. II. To assess serum biomarkers of therapeutic&#xD;
      response to ONC201. III. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of ONC201 as a single agent&#xD;
      in advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ONC201 orally (PO) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for a total of 2&#xD;
      courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
