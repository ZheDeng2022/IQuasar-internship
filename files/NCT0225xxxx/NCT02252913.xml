      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of volitinib in&#xD;
      combination with docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer and&#xD;
      to determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      volitinib in combination with docetaxel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib, open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two stages to this study: a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage.&#xD;
      Approximately 40-50 patients will be enrolled in this two-stage study, about 12-18 patients&#xD;
      in the dose-escalation stage and approximately 30 patients in the dose-expansion stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation stage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric cancer patients who failed the first line therapy (no matter the cMet status) who&#xD;
      meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Volitinib 600mg QD + docetaxel 75mg/m2 Cohort 2: Volitinib 800mg QD+ docetaxel&#xD;
      75mg/m2 The conventional 3+3 design (3 patients per dose cohort, with the potential to add&#xD;
      additional 3 patients to the same cohort to further evaluate toxicity) will be applied for&#xD;
      dose escalation and MTD or RP2D determination. Each treatment cycle will be composed of 3&#xD;
      weeks or 21 days. Dose escalation and entry of the next cohort will occur only after&#xD;
      acceptable tolerance has been demonstrated throughout the entire Cycle1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose expansion Stage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD or RP2D to further refine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, and efficacy at this dose. Patients will be limited to the metastatic /&#xD;
      locally advanced gastric cancer patients who failed the first therapy and with positive cMet&#xD;
      test results. Patients will be divided into two treatment groups according their c-Met test&#xD;
      results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: FISH + , IHC -/+(about 15 patients) Group B: IHC+ and FISH- (about 15 patients)&#xD;

If the dose of docetaxel 75mg/m2 is not tolerable, docetaxel dose will be reduced to 60mg/m2 while keep volitinib at 600mg QD as the initial dose. Volitinib dose escalation will be re-started and end at the dose of 800mg QD.&#xD;
