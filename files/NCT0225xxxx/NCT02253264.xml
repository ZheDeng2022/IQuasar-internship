  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the central nervous&#xD;
      system that is characterized pathologically by focal demyelinating lesions in the brain&#xD;
      parenchyma. Meningeal inflammation in MS was first noted in 2004. Ectopic lymphoid follicles&#xD;
      were described in the meninges of patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and were&#xD;
      thought to correlate with cortical lesions and atrophy (a surrogate marker for disability).&#xD;
      Subsequently, inflammation in the meninges has been described in primary progressive MS&#xD;
      (PPMS) as well as early relapsing MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ectopic lymphoid follicles are composed of B-cells, T follicular helper cells and&#xD;
      follicular dendritic cells. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against CD-20 (a B-cell&#xD;
      marker) that is FDA approved for the treatment of various lymphomas. Intrathecal (IT)&#xD;
      rituximab administration has been used in central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma to achieve&#xD;
      greater cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of rituximab. In MS, IT administration of&#xD;
      rituximab could lead to higher CSF rituximab levels resulting in the disruption of meningeal&#xD;
      ectopic lymphoid follicles, ultimately reducing cortical lesions and possibly disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that IT rituximab therapy in patients with progressive forms of&#xD;
      MS could disrupt ectopic lymphoid follicles in the meninges and thus slow progression of the&#xD;
      disease, which is particularly important because there exist no FDA-approved therapies for&#xD;
      progressive MS. The investigators hypothesize that using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to&#xD;
      identify those with enhancing meningeal lesions will provide a biomarker to select patients&#xD;
      who might be most likely to respond to IT rituximab and to use these lesions to monitor&#xD;
      therapeutic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the safety of intrathecal administration of&#xD;
      rituximab in patients with progressive MS. The secondary aims are to evaluate if IT rituximab&#xD;
      leads to a decrease in the quantity of meningeal lesions on MRI or to changes in biomarkers&#xD;
      of inflammatory activity or neuronal injury in the CSF.&#xD;

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the central nervous&#xD;
      system that is characterized pathologically by focal demyelinating lesions in the brain&#xD;
      parenchyma. Meningeal inflammation in MS was first noted in 2004. Ectopic lymphoid follicles&#xD;
      were described in the meninges of patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and were&#xD;
      thought to correlate with cortical lesions and atrophy (a surrogate marker for disability).&#xD;
      Subsequently, inflammation in the meninges has been described in primary progressive MS&#xD;
      (PPMS) as well as early relapsing MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ectopic lymphoid follicles are composed of B-cells, T follicular helper cells and&#xD;
      follicular dendritic cells. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against CD-20 (a B-cell&#xD;
      marker) that is FDA approved for the treatment of various lymphomas. It has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective when given intravenously in trials of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
      (RRMS). However, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetrance of rituximab is minimal, such that&#xD;
      CSF levels are &lt; 1% of serum levels after the administration of intravenous (IV) rituximab.&#xD;
      Indeed, IV rituximab failed to significantly slow disability in a clinical trial in&#xD;
      progressive MS. Intrathecal (IT) rituximab administration has been used in CNS lymphoma to&#xD;
      achieve greater CSF concentrations of rituximab. In MS, IT administration of rituximab could&#xD;
      lead to higher CSF rituximab levels resulting in the disruption of meningeal ectopic lymphoid&#xD;
      follicles, ultimately reducing cortical lesions and possibly disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently described finding is the presence of enhancing meningeal lesions on post-contrast&#xD;
      FLAIR imaging in MS patients. These could possibly represent ectopic lymphoid follicles. This&#xD;
      finding could serve as a biomarker to identify patients with ectopic meningeal lymphoid&#xD;
      follicles who might be most likely to derive benefit from IT rituximab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that IT rituximab therapy in patients with progressive forms of&#xD;
      MS could disrupt ectopic lymphoid follicles in the meninges and thus slow progression of the&#xD;
      disease, which is particularly important because there exist no FDA-approved therapies for&#xD;
      progressive MS. The investigators hypothesize that using post-contrast FLAIR imaging to&#xD;
      identify those with enhancing meningeal lesions will provide a biomarker to select patients&#xD;
      who might be most likely to respond to IT rituximab and to use these lesions to monitor&#xD;
      therapeutic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the safety of intrathecal administration of&#xD;
      rituximab in patients with progressive MS. The secondary aims are to evaluate if IT rituximab&#xD;
      leads to a decrease in the quantity of meningeal lesions on post-contrast FLAIR imaging or to&#xD;
      changes in biomarkers of inflammatory activity or neuronal injury in the CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive MS currently has no FDA approved treatments. There is a great need for new&#xD;
      therapeutic modalities for patients with progressive forms of MS. The identification of a&#xD;
      novel treatment for progressive MS would have a beneficial impact on tens of thousands of&#xD;
      patients with progressive MS.&#xD;
