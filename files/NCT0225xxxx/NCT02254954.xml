  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, open-label, 3+3 dose escalation Phase 1 safety study.&#xD;
      Adults with newly diagnosed GBM or gliosarcoma will receive macitentan in addition to the&#xD;
      standard of care treatment for GBM. The study consists of a screening period, a treatment&#xD;
      period, and a 30-day safety follow up period. The treatment period includes 6 weeks of&#xD;
      concurrent therapy (macitentan+RT+TMZ), 4 weeks of monotherapy (macitentan) and 12 cycles of&#xD;
      maintenance therapy (macitentan+TMZ). The study will end when the last treated subject has&#xD;
      completed study treatment and the 30-day safety follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned duration of the study is approximately 34-38 months depending on the number of&#xD;
      dose levels and cohorts of subjects enrolled. Subject participation in the study will be for&#xD;
      approximately 16 months.&#xD;
