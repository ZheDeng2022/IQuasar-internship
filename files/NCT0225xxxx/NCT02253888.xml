    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial was to establish the bioequivalence of Tipranavir (TPV) 250 mg&#xD;
      self emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) capsules that had been stored at a controlled&#xD;
      temperature of 30°C and controlled relative humidity (RH) of 70% in comparison with TPV 250&#xD;
      mg SEDDS capsules stored at controlled refrigerated conditions between 2°C and 8°C&#xD;
