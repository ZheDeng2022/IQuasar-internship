  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the High Frequency Digit Triplet test can be&#xD;
      used to screen patients with cystic fibrosis for hearing loss in conditions of health and&#xD;
      pulmonary exacerbation. It is also designed to find out the youngest age at which a child can&#xD;
      perform the test, the prevalence of hearing loss in a CF population and the prevalence of&#xD;
      genetic mutations known to be associated with hearing loss in the same population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be identified from the clinic list of four Cystic Fibrosis centres (Nottingham&#xD;
      University Hospitals NHS (National Health Service) Trust, adults and children, West Midlands&#xD;
      Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre and Birmingham Children's Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first work stream patients 11 years old and over will answer some hearing screening&#xD;
      questions and an ear examination and tympanogram. They will then have the new test (the High&#xD;
      Frequency Digit Triplet, HFDT, test), the standard tests (Pure tone audiogram (PTA) including&#xD;
      high frequencies, Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions) and then repeat the new test to&#xD;
      look for order effect. These will be compared to validate the HFDT as a screening tool for&#xD;
      hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second work stream the investigators are looking to see if the test is feasible when a&#xD;
      patient is unwell and about to start a course of IV antibiotics. The patients will have the&#xD;
      same tests as in work stream 1 (though the high-frequency PTA may be modified if they are too&#xD;
      unwell to complete it). They will then have the tests repeated at the next clinic visit&#xD;
      (approximately 6-8 weeks later).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third work stream children aged 5-10 years will have the same tests. This is to&#xD;
      discover the youngest age at which the HFDT test can reliably be performed. To ensure that&#xD;
      the CF condition does not itself affect the ability to perform the test the investigators&#xD;
      will compare CF children to healthy control children the same age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will take blood and saliva samples from CF patients to look for mutations&#xD;
      in mitochondrial genes which are known to be associated with aminoglycoside induced hearing&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
