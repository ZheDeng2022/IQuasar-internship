    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies regorafenib in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumors that&#xD;
      have spread from the primary site (place where it started) to other places in the body.&#xD;
      Regorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced/metastatic in patients with&#xD;
      carcinoid or pancreatic islet cell tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall survival and response rate in advanced/metastatic poor prognosis in&#xD;
      patients with carcinoid or pancreatic islet cell tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the toxicity of patients treated with regorafenib. III. To explore markers of&#xD;
      angiogenesis as they relate to outcome in carcinoid and pancreatic islet cell tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>Two parallel Simon's 2-stage phase II trials will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of regorafenib in patients with advanced carcinoid (cohort A) or pancreatic islet cell tumors (cohort B). Will be summarized as a proportion of patients who are alive and progression-free among all patients in the primary data analysis set. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated using the Wilson method. Will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves. The median PFS and 95% CIs will be calculated. The probability of 6-month PFS will be estimated from the KM curve too.</description>

    <description>Toxicity profile will be summarized by attribution: regorafenib-related and all reported, course: course 1 and all courses, type, and grade: grade 1-2, 3-4, and 5.</description>

    <measure>Biomarkers such as messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels or germline variations of genes related to angiogenesis</measure>

    <description>The associations between biomarkers and clinical outcomes (6-month PFS, response, PFS, and overall survival) will be analyzed in univariate analysis first using appropriate methods. Multivariable analyses will be conducted to evaluate the independent effect of a marker on clinical outcome. All tests will be two-sided at a significance level of 0.05. P values will be adjusted for multiple comparisons.</description>
