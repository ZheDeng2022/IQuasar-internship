  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase I, 4-period, randomized, active-and placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover,&#xD;
      single-dose study to evaluate the effects of a therapeutic (1000 milligram [mg]) and&#xD;
      supratherapeutic (1800 mg) dose of GSK2140944 with a positive control (moxifloxacin 400 mg)&#xD;
      and placebo on the corrected QT interval (QTc) as assessed by continuous 12-lead Holter&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) in approximately 55 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive single doses of GSK2140944 1000 mg, GSK2140944 1800 mg,&#xD;
      moxifloxacin 400 mg, and placebo in a randomized sequence. A double-dummy approach will be&#xD;
      used to maintain blinding. Thus, on each dosing day, moxifloxacin or moxifloxacin placebo and&#xD;
      GSK2140944 or placebo will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to entry to the clinic. Subjects will report&#xD;
      to the clinical unit on Day -2 of Period 1 and on Day -1 in subsequent periods. Subjects will&#xD;
      remain confined until check out procedures have been completed on Day 3 (5 days confinement&#xD;
      in Period 1 and 4 days in the following 3 periods). There will be a washout of at least 7&#xD;
      days between doses. The follow-up visit will occur 7-10 days after the final dose. Total&#xD;
      duration of the study (from screening to the follow-up visit) will be approximately 60 days.&#xD;

             performed on Day -2, which in the view of the investigator would compromise subject&#xD;
             safety or interfere with study procedures or assessments will be excluded from the&#xD;
             study. Full disclosures will be reviewed in detail and the review maintained as part&#xD;
             of the subject's source documents. Analysis of the Holter recordings will consider the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart rate (significant brady- or tachycardia, based on investigator's judgment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reports of symptomatic arrhythmia (except isolated extrasystoles)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal and aberrant beats&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Number of supraventricular contractions, premature atrial contractions, premature&#xD;
             ventricular contractions, couplets, triplets, and ventricular tachycardias&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Atrioventricular conduction defects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Atrial fibrillation and flutter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in the study would result in a donation of blood or blood products in&#xD;
             excess of 500 mL within a 56-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical trial in which the subject has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than 4 new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
             dosing day.&#xD;
