  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with metastatic or locally advanced/unresectable urothelial cancer that has&#xD;
      recurred or progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive Investigator's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine (Control), or&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab will prolong Overall&#xD;
      Survival (OS) and Progression-free Survival (PFS) compared to paclitaxel, docetaxel, or&#xD;
      vinflunine.&#xD;

      For the purposes of this study, participants with a programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)&#xD;
      combined positive score (CPS) ≥10% were considered to have a strongly PD-L1 positive tumor&#xD;
      status and participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥1% were considered to have a PD-L1 positive tumor&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective with Amendment 15, eligible participants who are allocated to the Control arm&#xD;
      (Investigator's Choice) and experience disease progression will be provided with the&#xD;
      opportunity to switch over to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg one time every three weeks (Q3W)&#xD;
      for up to two years of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Per protocol, 13 participants randomized to receive Control were switched over to receive Pembrolizumab. Per protocol, response/progression or adverse events that occurred during a non-randomized switch-over or second course of pembrolizumab were not counted towards efficacy or safety outcome measures, respectively. These results are for randomized treatment only.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.

        <title>DOR Per RECIST 1.1 - Participants With PD-L1 Positive Tumors</title>
        <description>For participants who demonstrated a confirmed response (CR or PR) per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death. Per protocol, the DOR was to be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment for participants who had progressed or died after 2 or more missed visits, who had started a new anti-cancer treatment, who were lost to follow-up, or who had an ongoing response. DOR was assessed in all participants who had PD-L1 positive tumors (CPS ≥1%) based on BICR and was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
