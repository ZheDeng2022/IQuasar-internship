  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial medicinal product (Lcr Regenerans®) is obtained from the culture of a strain of&#xD;
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35®. By virtue of the freeze-drying technique, Lactobacillus&#xD;
      rhamnosus Lcr35® is a live bacterium administered with its culture medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that Lcr Regenerans® is already marketed as a medical device (EC marking:&#xD;
      0499). It helps to regenerate the vaginal flora thanks to its physical and chemical effects&#xD;
      (lowering the vaginal pH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the ability of Lactobacillus&#xD;
      rhamnosus Lcr35®:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to establish itself in the vaginal epithelium, along with the durability of this&#xD;
           establishment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and to inhibit the growth of pathogenic organisms responsible for causing bacterial&#xD;
           vaginosis (Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia) but also for mycoses (Candida&#xD;
           albicans), by synthesising various microbicidal substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research follows on from the Candiflore observational study in which 514 patients were&#xD;
      monitored and which demonstrated a clearly positive result in favour of the use of vaginal&#xD;
      Lcr Regenerans® for preventing recurrences of VVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this new research is thus to demonstrate the efficacy of Lcr Regenerans®, in&#xD;
      the prevention of vulvovaginal candidiasis recurrences in patients with a history of VVC with&#xD;
      recurrent episodes, in view of obtaining a marketing authorisation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of RVVC is difficult due to the multi-factor nature of recurrences and of the&#xD;
      poorly understood local immune dysfunctions that may arise. The oral or topical antifungal&#xD;
      maintenance treatment usually recommended is for a period of 6 months, though the VVC relapse&#xD;
      rate is high, with 60 to 70% of women presenting with a recurrence within 2 months following&#xD;
      termination of treatment. Moreover, antifungal agent-related adverse events are frequent and&#xD;
      their long-term use can be conducive to the onset of bacterial vaginosis (BV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaginal administration of probiotic strains (Lactobacillus) capable of regenerating the&#xD;
      vaginal flora and of inhibiting the development of Candida albicans and/or its adhesion to&#xD;
      the vaginal epithelium, would appear to be an interesting therapeutic alternative for&#xD;
      preventing VVC recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35®. By virtue of the freeze-drying technique, Lactobacillus&#xD;
