  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if FMT can reverse Hepatic Encephlopathy (HE) in&#xD;
      cirrhotic patients who continue to have breakthrough episodes of HE despite maintenance&#xD;
      therapy with lactulose and/or rifaximin or metronidazole.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects receive FMT from a single donor by colonoscopy at Week 0 and by enema at Weeks 1-4.&#xD;
      HE is measured by Inhibitory Control Test and Stroop as well as serum ammonia levels.&#xD;

    <description>All serious adverse events up to and including week 8. A serious adverse event is any event which results in any of the following:&#xD;
i) Death ii) Colonic perforation iii) Proven infections as defined by the presence of i) spontaneous bacteremia: positive blood cultures in the absence of any other potential source of infection; ii) spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: ascetic fluid PMN equal to or greater than 250/mm3; iii) UTI: urinary leukocyte count greater than 15 cells per HPF and positive urine culture; vi) other infections identified by clinical, radiologic and bacteriologic results.&#xD;
iv) Possible infections as defined by i) fever (temp &gt; 37.80 C), ii) leukocytosis (&gt;15,000 mm3) or increased immature neutrophils in blood (&gt;500 mm3), negative cultures and no other signs of infection.</description>
