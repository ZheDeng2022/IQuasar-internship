      Current practice in orthopedics is to recommend TKA implantation with the femoral and tibial&#xD;
      components perpendicular to their mechanical axis. Therefore, current surgical technique does&#xD;
      not replicate natural knee anatomy and biomechanics. An alternative alignment method that&#xD;
      attempts to replicate the kinematics of the knee is &quot; kinematic alignment &quot;. The principle&#xD;
      behind kinematic alignment is placement of the TKA components so that the orthogonal 3-D&#xD;
      orientation of the 3 axes that describe normal knee kinematics is restored to that of the&#xD;
      prearthritic knee. Theoretical benefits of kinematic alignment include less ligamentous&#xD;
      release to balance the knee intra-operatively, more rapid recovery, better range of motion&#xD;
      (ROM), less post-operative pain, better knee biomechanics, and improved patient satisfaction.&#xD;
      However, a major concern is that there are no mid- or long-term data on implant survivorship&#xD;
      (absence of loosening) in TKA based on &quot;anatomical&quot; implantation. The investigators propose&#xD;
      to compare the clinical results of TKA implanted with mechanical alignment (standard&#xD;
      practice) to kinematic alignment, in a double-blind, randomized trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Problem to be addressed Knee osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that is very&#xD;
      prevalent in the general population and can cause significant functional impairment. Total&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the definitive treatment of choice, but rarely accomplishes&#xD;
      complete restoration of natural knee biomechanics. Various factors may influence&#xD;
      post-operative function: pre-operative state of the knee, patient age, implant position, and&#xD;
      design. The natural lower limb anatomy presents a femoral joint surface that is slightly&#xD;
      valgus according to its mechanical axis (1-5 degrees) and a tibial joint surface that is&#xD;
      slightly varus (1-4 degrees). This combination results in an oblique joint line orientation&#xD;
      (1-3 degrees) and a mechanical axis passing near the centre of the knee joint (line between&#xD;
      the centre of the femoral head and the centre of the ankle). Natural lower limb alignment&#xD;
      helps balancing load between the internal and external knee compartments at heel strike.&#xD;
      Current practice in orthopedics is to recommend TKA implantation with the femoral and tibial&#xD;
      components perpendicular to their mechanical axis (0 degrees). In addition, in order to&#xD;
      maintain ligament balance (a rectangular space) in flexion, external rotation of the femoral&#xD;
      implant is suggested (2-5 degrees according to posterior femoral condyle surfaces).&#xD;
      Therefore, current surgical technique does not replicate natural knee anatomy and&#xD;
      biomechanics. An alternative alignment method that attempts to replicate the kinematics of&#xD;
      the knee is &quot; kinematic alignment &quot;. The principle behind kinematic alignment is placement of&#xD;
      the TKA components so that the orthogonal 3-D orientation of the 3 axes that describe normal&#xD;
      knee kinematics is restored to that of the prearthritic knee. Theoretical benefits of&#xD;
      kinematic alignment include less ligamentous release to balance the knee intra-operatively,&#xD;
      more rapid recovery, better range of motion (ROM), less post-operative pain, better knee&#xD;
      biomechanics, and improved patient satisfaction. However, a major concern is that there are&#xD;
      no mid- or long-term data on implant survivorship (absence of loosening) in TKA based on&#xD;
      &quot;anatomical&quot; implantation. Because the anatomical alignment differs from the classic&#xD;
      mechanical alignment, some authors raised concerns regarding mid-term implant stability with&#xD;
      the anatomical implantation technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to compare the clinical results of TKA implanted with mechanical alignment&#xD;
      (standard practice) to kinematic alignment, in a double-blind, randomized trial. To&#xD;
      standardize surgical technique and minimize potential bias, both procedures will be&#xD;
      undertaken with personalized instruments built by Medacta, based on each patient's CT-scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 primary objectives of this research. First, implant stability with respect to&#xD;
      bone will be measured over time by RSA, and long-term survivorship will be estimated. Second,&#xD;
      we will determine if anatomical implantation provides clinical advantages, with respect to&#xD;
      knee kinematic analysis, functional performance tests and validated self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaires on pain, function and stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) RSA, first developed in Lund, Sweden, is a radiographic&#xD;
      technique for accurately assessing implant position relative to host bone. RSA is the gold&#xD;
      standard for measuring implant stability in the short-term and predicting implant&#xD;
      survivorship in the long-term. It has been implemented for several decades and its safety is&#xD;
      well documented. RSA is 10 times more accurate than conventional radiography in analyzing&#xD;
      implant migration patterns. Patterns of micromigration exhibited by various prostheses and&#xD;
      fixation techniques within the first post-operative year has been shown to predict long-term&#xD;
      component fixation to bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee biomechanical evaluation Estimating the therapeutic efficacy of knee TKA is subjective&#xD;
      in current clinical practice because methods of functional biomechanics assessment are&#xD;
      complex and difficult to apply. It was suggested that gait measurements should be monitored&#xD;
      after surgery for patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) to evaluate treatment outcome and&#xD;
      recovery. KneeKGTM (Emovi Inc., Laval, Quebec, Canada), a simple and minimally-invasive&#xD;
      method of measuring 3D knee kinematics, has been developed and is now available commercially.&#xD;
      In this system, motion sensors are quasi-rigidly attached to the leg with a non-invasive&#xD;
      ancillary system, which reduces errors in skin movement in relation to bone. This measurement&#xD;
      tool has been validated by satisfactory assessment of its accuracy and the reproducibility of&#xD;
      femoro-tibial 3D kinematics during gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the migration between anatomically- and mechanically-aligned implants at 2 years&#xD;
           and predict the long-term survivorship of total knee prostheses inserted with these two&#xD;
           techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the clinical results of anatomical and mechanical total knee alignment with self&#xD;
           reported pain, function and stiffness questionnaire scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare knee kinematics between the 2 groups and identify biomechanical markers that&#xD;
           explain subjective differences (if found with clinical scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare kinematics measured with the 2 techniques to those of asymptomatic knees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if anatomical alignment offers some technical benefits (reduced&#xD;
           intra-operative ligament balance and ligaments releases) compared to a mechanical&#xD;
           alignment technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare post-operative rehabilitation in both groups (flexion, extension, straight leg&#xD;
           raising, walking without assistance, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis TKA implanted with with anatomical alignment will provide better clinical outcomes&#xD;
      and knee kinematics closer to normal than TKA implanted with a mechanical alignment&#xD;
      technique, Implant longevity will show similar micro migration patterns between the two&#xD;
      groups as measured by RSA up to 2 years after implantation thereby predicting that long-term&#xD;
      implant survivorship will be similar in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is this trial needed now? Current technological advances in knee arthroplasty surgery&#xD;
      have allowed surgeons to implant TKA with considerable accuracy. We however are not sure if&#xD;
      the position we are placing the knee in is the &quot;correct&quot; position for most patients. It is&#xD;
      thought that the relatively high percentage of patients that are not completely satisfied&#xD;
      with the outcome of their knee replacement may have the implants in a suboptimal position for&#xD;
      that individual patient. The traditional mechanical alignment may not be the optimal position&#xD;
      for these patients. The anatomical alignment technique may reduce the percentage of&#xD;
      dissatisfied patients. Implant companies with this technology are currently marketing this to&#xD;
      surgeons and patients without clinical data to support this claim. There is also the&#xD;
      possibility that placing an artificial knee joint in an anatomic position may impart a&#xD;
      negative impact on longevity of the implant, thus increasing early revision rates and the&#xD;
      significant health costs associated with this. Thus it becomes mandatory to evaluate this new&#xD;
      technology before its widespread adoption in clinical practice to determine the real benefits&#xD;
      or disadvantages of changing from a successful clinical practice (mechanical alignment) used&#xD;
      over the last 40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial results This proposed clinical trial will have a direct impact on patient care if it&#xD;
      demonstrates that anatomical alignment TKA provides better clinical results than mechanical&#xD;
      alignment TKA and similar migration patterns measured by RSA. Then the use of anatomic&#xD;
      alignment may become the gold standard for TKA procedures. Lacking accurate investigation and&#xD;
      surgical tools, anatomical alignment was abandoned in the early TKA era. Mechanical alignment&#xD;
      was selected to minimize errors and secondary failures. With novel technologies (personalized&#xD;
      instruments built on MRI), anatomical alignment might be the best way to replicate knee&#xD;
      biomechanics and improve patient outcomes after TKA. The proposed study will allow us to&#xD;
      establish the real value of anatomical alignment and its safety.&#xD;
