      The primary objectives were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of steady state TPV co-administered with low dose RTV on steady&#xD;
           state PegIFN and RBV in HIV negative subjects with mild hepatic impairment (scheme A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of steady state of pegylated interferon (PegIFN) and RBV on&#xD;
           steady state pharmacokinetics of TPV co-administered with low dose RTV in HIV negative&#xD;
           subjects with mild hepatic impairment (scheme A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of single dose and steady state TPV/r 500/200 mg in&#xD;
