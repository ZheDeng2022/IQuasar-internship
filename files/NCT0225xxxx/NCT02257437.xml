    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the acceptability of the LNS to women and their&#xD;
      children aged 12-17 months in comparison to Corn Soy Blend++, and Sprinkles added to borbor&#xD;
      (white rice porridge, which is the traditional weaning food in Cambodia). Acceptability will&#xD;
      be assessed through a sensory test for caregivers, and by measuring children's consumption.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cambodia, progress in combatting malnutrition has stalled. In 2010, 40% of all children&#xD;
      under five (and 49% of 4-5 year-olds) were stunted, 11% were wasted, and 28% were&#xD;
      underweight, indicating, respectively, chronic and acute malnutrition, and a combination of&#xD;
      the two. Stunting is partially attributed to poor complementary feeding, which remains&#xD;
      inadequate for achieving growth outcomes and micronutrient status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition can be prevented and treated with supplementary foods. These foods usually&#xD;
      contain a source of protein and lipids such as powered milk, soy or peanuts, and multiple&#xD;
      micronutrients. They can be prepared as a fortified blended product, such as Corn-Soy Blend++&#xD;
      (CSB++), that is mixed with water to make a porridge, or ready-to-use supplementary foods&#xD;
      (RUSFs). The latter are usually lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) which are often&#xD;
      pastes such as the peanut-based Plumpy'Nutâ„¢. These energy-dense supplementary foods contain&#xD;
      both macro and micronutrients and are used to prevent and treat malnutrition by promoting&#xD;
      improved linear growth, weight gain and micronutrient status among children. Until recently,&#xD;
      prevention of malnutrition has relied on fortified blended products. The new RUSFs are also&#xD;
      proving effective, as they are higher energy and have a longer shelf life, and since they&#xD;
      require no preparation, are convenient. Another common nutrition intervention is multiple&#xD;
      micronutrient supplements such as Sprinkles. These are individually-packed powders that can&#xD;
      be added to food. However, micronutrients are more likely to achieve growth outcomes when&#xD;
      they are combined with energy, for example, in lipid-based nutrient supplements and there is&#xD;
      no evidence that micronutrient powders alone contribute to growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until June 2014, the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) used CSB++ (now called&#xD;
      Supercereal Plus) to prevent malnutrition in Cambodia. Sprinkles are also being distributed,&#xD;
      though not widely, to prevent micronutrient deficiencies. These products that have been&#xD;
      recently or are currently used are relatively expensive to procure and ship to Cambodia and&#xD;
      in the case of Sprinkles, are not as effective as foods that contain macronutrients.&#xD;
      Moreover, CSB++ was not very well accepted in practice, and WFP has phased it out. Therefore,&#xD;
      UNICEF and the Cambodian Ministry of Health are looking for a locally-produced product&#xD;
      containing macro and micronutrients to prevent malnutrition in Cambodia. Locally-produced&#xD;
      products are more likely to be acceptable and cheaper than imported products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of how effective a product may be, it is vital to determine its acceptability in a&#xD;
      given setting, in other words, will a child eat the product and will a caregiver feed it to&#xD;
      them. Acceptability to children can be measured by how much they eat and how readily, while&#xD;
      acceptability to caregivers is measured in terms of their sensory perception of the food,&#xD;
      that is, of the smell, colour, and taste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this trial will evaluate the acceptability of the LNS to women and their children&#xD;
      aged 9-23 months in comparison to CSB++, Sprinkles added to borbor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is a cluster randomised, incomplete block, 4 x 4 crossover design that aims to&#xD;
      establish the superiority (i.e. the greater acceptability) of the novel LNS (as a snack or&#xD;
      mixed with borbor), in comparison to CSB++, and Sprinkles added to borbor. The allocation&#xD;
      ratio is 1:1. The study will take place in two parts over two weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Substudy 1: Acceptability by children, three days x four foods for a total of 12 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Substudy 2: Acceptability by mothers, 13th day&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in peri-urban Phnom Penh. The study will be conducted in four&#xD;
      test-feeding sites such as pagodas or health centres. Participants will be recruited for&#xD;
      convenience from villages close to the four sites. The four test-feeding sites will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to begin on one of the foods. All children in a given site will be eating&#xD;
      the same food at the same time for three consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon consent and enrolment, baseline data will be collected from the participants. This will&#xD;
      include demographics, morbidity, anthropometry (weight, height, mid-upper arm circumference),&#xD;
      and dietary data (breastfeeding, food frequency and dietary diversity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will be asked to bring their child to their designated test-feeding site for the&#xD;
      following 12 days. They will be asked not to feed their child for the preceding hour, if&#xD;
      possible. The same food will be given three days in a row, to allow averaging of results and&#xD;
      reduce the effect of chance findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will receive the four foods, namely, the LNS added to borbor, CSB++ porridge,&#xD;
      Sprinkles added to borbor, and the LNS snack, for three days each over twelve days. Children&#xD;
      in each group will taste each food in a different sequence (to balance for carry-over&#xD;
      effects). The mothers will be asked to feed their child for 15 minutes or until the child&#xD;
      refuses to eat any more. The amount of food consumed will be measured each time the child&#xD;
      eats. Each mother will be asked to assess how she thinks her child liked the food, taking&#xD;
      into account the amount eaten and the child's reactions and emotional state during feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the 13th day, mothers will be asked to come to the test-feeding site, alone if possible,&#xD;
      to rank the foods. For the sensory test, the foods will be presented one at a time. No&#xD;
      weighing is necessary and mothers will not be expected to eat a whole cup. Between foods, the&#xD;
      mother will be asked to rinse her mouth out with water. Mothers will rate each food with&#xD;
      respect to colour, smell, taste, preparation process, and their overall opinion. The foods&#xD;
      will then be presented at the same time and mothers will then be asked to rank them. Finally,&#xD;
      on the 14th day, a smaller number of mothers (8-12) from each site will be asked to stay for&#xD;
      a focus group discussion related to infant feeding practices and reasons for preference&#xD;
      ranking.&#xD;
