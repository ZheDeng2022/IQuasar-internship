      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of reduced doses (10 mg and&#xD;
      20 mg) of intra-coronary alteplase compared with placebo as an adjunct to PCI in reducing MVO&#xD;
      and its consequences in high risk patients with STEMI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite numerous interventions, there remains a need to develop new ways to prevent&#xD;
      microvascular obstruction (MVO). The investigators aim to select patients with persistent&#xD;
      S-T-elevation on the ECG and an occluded artery and heavy thrombus burden at initial&#xD;
      angiography. These characteristics are causally linked to MVO. Patients with a thrombotic&#xD;
      culprit coronary artery have reduced myocardial perfusion compared to those without and the&#xD;
      presence of coronary thrombus is an independent predictor of adverse ischaemic outcomes&#xD;
      post-MI. Intra-luminal thrombus, as revealed by intra vascular imaging with optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) in STEMI patients, has shown that thrombus commonly persists in the culprit&#xD;
      coronary artery, including within the stent post-implantation, even when the thrombus is&#xD;
      invisible with conventional angiography. The amount of persistent thrombus predicted the&#xD;
      likelihood of persistent S-T-segment elevation, a marker of microvascular injury, and&#xD;
      impaired perfusion.Therefore, coronary thrombus represents a therapeutic target in primary&#xD;
      PCI. The pathophysiology of MVO and microvascular thrombosis has elucidated in MRI studies of&#xD;
      reperfused MI in swine. The investigators demonstrated that LATE MVO corresponds closely with&#xD;
      infarct zone haemorrhage as revealed by T2-weighted MRI and pathology. The investigators&#xD;
      observations were validated by Robbers et al who showed that in swine 7 days post-MI, when&#xD;
      LATE MVO and haemorrhage correspond (which is usually the case), there is severe capillary&#xD;
      loss and disruption coupled with thrombosis and inflammation. They concluded that following&#xD;
      reperfusion, acute inflammation and microvessel thrombosis result in degradation of&#xD;
      endothelial integrity and capillary breakdown. Very interestingly, their histology also&#xD;
      demonstrated diffuse microvascular thrombosis within the area of late gadolinium enhancement&#xD;
      surrounding the haemorrhagic core which explains reduced perfusion (or wash during first pass&#xD;
      of gadolinium contrast MRI) within the ischaemic area-at-risk. This observation points to the&#xD;
      therapeutic potential of local thrombolysis within the culprit artery circulation.The study&#xD;
      addresses the question of whether a pharmacological strategy involving reduced dose alteplase&#xD;
      given early during the primary PCI procedure will both prevent and treat distal microvascular&#xD;
      thrombosis and MVO and, subsequently, reduce infarct size.Current evidence around the&#xD;
      potential safety and efficacy of reduced dose fibrinolysis in primary PCI is limited. These&#xD;
      limitations set-the-scene and support the rationale for the clinical trial: Full systemic&#xD;
      dose intravenous fibrinolysis to facilitate primary PCI is potentially harmful and increases&#xD;
      the risk of off-target bleeding complications; therefore, the investigators will use&#xD;
      reduced-dose fibrinolysis. They will directly infuse alteplase into the culprit artery to&#xD;
      achieve effective and sustained local plasma concentrations and much lower systemic&#xD;
      concentrations of unbound drug. It is anticipated that bleeding rates may be low; therefore,&#xD;
      the investigators will measure fibrinogen in all patients. Fibrinogen and other haemostasis&#xD;
      parameters will serve as a surrogate measure of bleeding (and safety). In line with&#xD;
      contemporary practice, investigators advise that patients have radial artery access whenever&#xD;
      possible. Previous trials have used streptokinase (non-fibrin specific and immunogenic); this&#xD;
      study will use the fibrin-specific non-immunogenic second generation thrombolytic, alteplase&#xD;
      The only previous trial involved thrombolysis at the end of primary PCI (when microvascular&#xD;
      thrombosis may already be established after reperfusion); the efficacy of thrombolysis may be&#xD;
      greatest when thrombus is most abundant at the beginning of primary PCI; persistent residual&#xD;
      fibrin strands adherent within the culprit territory will be selectively targeted by&#xD;
      fibrinolytic therapy during primary PCI; thrombus which forms during the primary PCI&#xD;
      procedure could be treated by the sustained 'deep tissue' thrombolytic effects of locally&#xD;
      administered intra-coronary alteplase; in terms of ease-of-use and feasibility, there may be&#xD;
      advantages to giving alteplase as a single dose.T-TIME is a Phase II evaluation of two&#xD;
      reduced doses of alteplase, delivered locally, compared to placebo in STEMI patients&#xD;
      receiving PCI in a double-blind, randomised, parallel group, placebo-controlled dose-ranging&#xD;
      clinical trial. The investigators believe the strategy with intracoronary fibrinolysis&#xD;
      complements other therapeutic approaches which are currently being tested. Should the trial&#xD;
      demonstrate EFFICACY then a future trial might involve a factorial design with placebo,&#xD;
      alteplase and any other intervention that might also be shown to be effective in the&#xD;
      intervening time in order to test the comparative EFFICACY of each (alone or in combination)&#xD;
      on surrogate and/or clinical outcomes.&#xD;
