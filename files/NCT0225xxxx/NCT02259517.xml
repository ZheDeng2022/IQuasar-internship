  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are typically treated with two&#xD;
      types of medications with differing mechanisms of action: stimulants and non-stimulants. The&#xD;
      stimulant Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine, LDX), and the non-stimulant Intuniv (extended-release&#xD;
      guanfacine, GXR), are both FDA approved treatment for ADHD. Clinical trials have shown that&#xD;
      both medications are effective in reducing ADHD symptoms, although the neurobiological&#xD;
      mechanisms by which Vyvanse and Intuniv produce these effects remain unknown. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to examine the mechanisms by which LDX and GXR reduce symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      ADHD. MRI scanning will be used to identify treatment-related changes in brain structure and&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with ADHD and age and sex-matched healthy controls will be scanned at the beginning&#xD;
      of the study. In this first part of the study, MRI findings will be compared between the two&#xD;
      groups to see whether brain functioning of children with ADHD differs from that of healthy&#xD;
      children. In the second part of the study, the children with ADHD will meet weekly with the&#xD;
      study doctor and be administered either extended-release guanfacine (Intuniv) or&#xD;
      lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) for 6 weeks. Selection into either treatment group will be&#xD;
      randomly determined. At the end of the study, the children with ADHD treated with either&#xD;
      medication will have a second MRI scan. The findings of that second MRI scan will be compared&#xD;
      to the first MRI scan in order to examine brain changes due to the medication. These second&#xD;
      MRI scans will also be compared to the scans of the healthy controls.&#xD;
