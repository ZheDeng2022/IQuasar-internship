    <textblock>
      Twenty six veterans with PTSD and cognitive impairment received 16 weeks of memantine in an&#xD;
      open label fashion. Cognition was assessed using the Spatial Span, Logical Memory I, and&#xD;
      Letter-Number Sequencing subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale III (Third edition) and the&#xD;
      Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). RBANS measures&#xD;
      attention, language, visuospatial skills, and immediate and delayed memories. The Clinician&#xD;
      Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Anxiety Scale&#xD;
      (HAM-A), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), and Sheehan&#xD;
      Disability Scale (SDS) were used to assess improvement in PTSD symptoms, as secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

      Participants were recruited from the Omaha Veterans Affairs Medical Center following local&#xD;
      IRB approval. We obtained written consent from all the subjects who were recruited in the&#xD;
      study. Veterans between the ages of 19 and 65 years with chronic PTSD (diagnosis for &gt;6&#xD;
      months) attributable to military combat exposure were included in the study. Patients were&#xD;
      required to be clinically stable on their psychotropic medication regimen for at least three&#xD;
      months prior to study entry. In addition to meeting DSM-IV criteria for PTSD and endorsing&#xD;
      subjective complaints of memory difficulties, patients had to score least one standard&#xD;
      deviation below the mean performance of a standardized, age- and sex-matched population on&#xD;
      the Spatial Span, Logical Memory I, and Letter-Number Sequencing subtests of the Wechsler&#xD;
      Memory Scale III (Third edition) for study entry. Patients with a history of dementia,&#xD;
      schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, traumatic brain injury, and seizure were excluded. Patients&#xD;
      with any history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse or dependence within the past one month&#xD;
      were excluded. Patients requiring concomitant treatment with drugs with potential effects on&#xD;
      the glutamergic system, such as amantadine,dextromethorphan, or carbonic anhydrase&#xD;
      inhibitors, were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects initially received memantine 5 mg once daily, which was increased weekly by 5 mg/day&#xD;
      in divided doses to a dose of 20 mg/day. Memory was assessed using the Repeatable Battery for&#xD;
      the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) [Randolph, 1998] using both forms A and B&#xD;
      at baseline, end of week 8, and end of week 16. The RBANS is composed of 10 subtests that&#xD;
      yield a total score and five index scores: immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional,&#xD;
      language, attention, and delayed memory. Each index score has a normal mean of 100 and&#xD;
      standard deviation of 15 based on the performance of a standardization sample matched to the&#xD;
      U.S. Census on sex, ethnicity, and level of education. Alternative forms of the RBANS (Forms&#xD;
      A and B) were used to avoid bias due to practice effects. We administered Clinician&#xD;
      Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Anxiety Scale&#xD;
      (HAM-A), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), and Sheehan&#xD;
      Disability Scale (SDS) to assess the secondary measures. Changes in the scores over time with&#xD;
      repeated measures were estimated with mixed-effects models. The primary outcome measures of&#xD;
      interest were index and percentile scores in RBANS total and subscale scores. The repeated&#xD;
      measures model included visit (as a categorical variable) as a fixed effect. An unstructured&#xD;
      covariance matrix was used to fit the within patient repeated measures effect. Tukey's method&#xD;
      was used to compare pair-wise means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures, CAPS, HAM-A, HAM-D, Q-LES-Q, and SDS, were analyzed similarly to&#xD;
      the RBANS with repeated measures models. P-values less than 0.05 are considered to be&#xD;
      statistically significant. SAS software version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for&#xD;
      the analysis&#xD;
