      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foot ulcers are a feared complication among diabetic patients. The ulcers can cause pain,&#xD;
      discomfort and reduced quality of life. The development of foot ulcers places the patients at&#xD;
      a risk of amputation. In the Danish Health Care System a substantial effort is done to&#xD;
      prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers. A constant research of how to treat these wounds is&#xD;
      ongoing. The goal is to optimize wound healing and prevent amputations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) involves the use of a device that generates&#xD;
      low-energy shockwaves through a headpiece, which is placed on the skin of the patient. A&#xD;
      small amount of energy will be deposited in the tissue when shockwaves are applied. This&#xD;
      stimulates the cells to produce substances that generate new vessels. No side effects to ESWT&#xD;
      have been shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to test whether shockwave therapy can improve wound healing among&#xD;
      diabetic patients with foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that shockwave therapy accelerates ulcer healing, increases&#xD;
      blood flow, reduces pain, and has no side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are interested in participation will be included in the study and divided by&#xD;
      randomization into two groups of equal size. The first group is treated with ESWT in&#xD;
      combination with regular guideline treatment. The second group is set up as control group and&#xD;
      will only receive regular guideline treatment. The participants are examined in different&#xD;
      ways to evaluate whether ESWT helps the healing of foot ulcers. The investigators want to&#xD;
      measure tissue oxygen pressure and foot sense of touch. The foot ulcers are inspected for&#xD;
      infection at every consultation, and a swab sample will be collected at enrollment. The size&#xD;
      of the ulcers are measured and photographed each time. The investigators will count how many&#xD;
      foot ulcers that are completely healed during the test period and measure the sizes of the&#xD;
      remaining foot ulcers. The patients are asked to evaluate pain related to the foot ulcer.&#xD;
      Data concerning participants' co morbidities and use of analgesic drugs are obtained from the&#xD;
      patient journal and by patient interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESWT should be considered a supplement to existing clinical guidelines in wound management if&#xD;
      shown to effectively help healing of diabetic foot ulcers. Improved healing should reduce the&#xD;
      heavy workload on care and treatment regarding to these wounds. Hopefully, the frequency of&#xD;
      amputations among diabetic patients will decline by implementing new treatment options for&#xD;
      the diabetic foot.&#xD;

      [Introduction]&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 5.5 % of the Danish population suffers from diabetes - corresponding to&#xD;
      more than 320.000 persons. Among Danish diabetic patients the yearly incidence of foot ulcers&#xD;
      is higher than 3.000 and the prevalence higher than 22.000. Diabetics have a lifetime risk of&#xD;
      foot ulcers of 15 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amputation is a possible consequence to having a diabetic foot ulcer. A 19-year follow-up&#xD;
      study performed on newly diagnosed diabetics shows an incidence of amputation of 400 per&#xD;
      100.000 patient years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economical costs associated with a diabetic foot ulcer vary with the severity and treatment&#xD;
      of the ulcer. In Denmark costs including hospitalized treatment, outpatient treatment,&#xD;
      homecare and other social services have been calculated to (written in Danish kroner 2009):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healed foot ulcer without ischemia: 152.800&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healed foot ulcer with ischemia: 252. 800&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Foot ulcer with minor amputation: 407.900&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Foot ulcer with major amputation: 597.300&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups including foot ulcers with minor or major amputation comprise 5 % of the total number&#xD;
      of diabetic foot ulcers (corresponding to 150 amputations per year). Total costs of diabetic&#xD;
      foot ulcers are 793 million Danish kroner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foot ulcers reduce the patients' mobility and their quality of life. Amputation is among the&#xD;
      most feared complications to diabetes and it affects patients' quality of life as much as&#xD;
      heart failure and cerebral stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of diabetic foot ulcers is in several places of Denmark taken care of by&#xD;
      multidisciplinary teams. Thus metabolic control, wound debridement, vascular surgery,&#xD;
      treatment of infections, pain relief, occupational therapy etc. is taken care of in one&#xD;
      specialized hospital unit. Parallel to a reorganization of the Danish health system 2000 -&#xD;
      2011 there was a significant decline in diabetic major amputations. However, no decline has&#xD;
      been seen in the group of minor amputations and it may be that patients are now identified&#xD;
      earlier for amputation thereby avoiding major amputations. Conclusively, a number of diabetic&#xD;
      ulcer patients still cannot be offered any other treatment than amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to develop supplementing treatment options for the worst cases of diabetic&#xD;
      foot ulcers. The goal is that ulcer healing is optimized and fewer patients are amputated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of diabetic foot ulcers a substantial amount of research is going on trying to&#xD;
      develop existing methods of treatment and finding new therapeutic techniques. Extracorporeal&#xD;
      shockwave therapy (ESWT) is a promising new option for ulcer treatment. ESWT has long been&#xD;
      known in kidney stone treatment, and more recently ESWT has been established as treatment to&#xD;
      regional pain disorders (such as plantar fasciitis of the heel and lateral epicondylitis of&#xD;
      the elbow) and non-union of long bone fractures. Furthermore, ischemic heart disease and&#xD;
      Peyronies disease have been treated with ESWT. Some studies show positive results when&#xD;
      treating foot ulcers with ESWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In physics, shockwaves are high fluctuations of acoustical energy. When applied to a tissue&#xD;
      shockwaves may stimulate an anabolic cellular response, increased blood perfusion and&#xD;
      neo-angiogenesis. Shockwaves may furthermore promote anti-inflammatory effects and pain&#xD;
      regulation. On a molecular scale upregulation of TGF-beta1, VEGF, FGF-2 signaling together&#xD;
      with increased levels of NO and substance P in the tissue is seen following ESWT. During&#xD;
      wound healing NO has been shown to induce IGF release through NF-kappaB pathway. Regarding to&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects, ESWT reduces the cellular expression of metalloproteases and&#xD;
      interleukins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies testing foot ulcer ESWT have not shown any significant side effects to&#xD;
      shockwave treatment. These studies conclude that ESWT is safe to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
      -------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Purpose]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to test if low-energy ESWT can help healing of complex diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers. The effect of ESWT will be evaluated by measuring wound sizes and numbers of total&#xD;
      healing, perception of pain using visual analog scale. Measures of cutaneous oxygen tension&#xD;
      and foot sense of feeling will be included as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
      -------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Hypothesis]&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESWT improves diabetic patients' healing of chronic foot ulcers. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators expect to see a faster wound area reduction among patients treated with ESWT&#xD;
      compared to control group only receiving treatment according to current clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure for ESWT is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shorter time wound healing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures for ESWT are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased perfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Method]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of patients: 6 months consecutive identification and inclusion of patients in&#xD;
      Wound Clinic, Department of Plastic Surgery OUH. Every year approximately 400 patients with&#xD;
      new ulcers are referred to the clinic. Patients who are either newly referred or in advance&#xD;
      related to the clinic can be offered participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Participants will be randomized to either intervention group or control group&#xD;
      using a computer-generated table indicating allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: ESWT as a supplement to treatment following current clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Ulcer treatment following clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESWT: A total of 6 times treatment over a 3 week period. Intervals between ESWT will be 3 - 4&#xD;
      days. ESWT will be carried out using the DUOLITH SD1 T-Top shockwave device, STORZ MEDICAL&#xD;
      AG. The device is CE mark registered for ESWT use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of intervention course: Participants in this group will have 8 consultations in a&#xD;
      7 week period. 6 times ESWT followed by 2 times follow-up respectively 2 and 4 weeks after&#xD;
      last ESWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of control course: Participants in this group will have 4 consultations in a 7&#xD;
      week period. First consultation by enrollment. Second, third, and fourth consultations&#xD;
      respectively 3, 5, and 7 weeks after enrollment. These four consultations corresponds to&#xD;
      intervention group consultation number 1, 6, 7, and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data: By the first consultation participants will be characterized in regard to the&#xD;
      following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidity (quantified using Charlson Index)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical treatment: antidiabetics, analgesics (relevant drugs are NSAIDs, neuroleptics&#xD;
           and opioids), antihypertensives, statins / cholesterol lowering drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking habits and alcohol consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Mass Index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marital status, educational level and type of profession&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Classification of foot ulcer using University of Texas Wound Score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemistry: HbA1c, CRP, leukocytes, s-Na, s-K, s-creatinine, s-alkaline phosphatase,&#xD;
           s-lactate dehydrogenase, s-cholesterol levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bacterial colonization of the ulcer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical parameters and medical treatment data will be obtained from the patient records.&#xD;
      New blood samples will be taken if the patient records do not include relevant test results -&#xD;
      furthermore results must not be more than 2 months old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will have access to all usually offered ulcer treatment.&#xD;
      Information about other treatment modalities and frequencies will be obtained from&#xD;
      participants patient records and patient interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
      -------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Data handling]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be noted in the REDCap online system. Data will be stored until study end. Analysis&#xD;
      will be carried out using Stata software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses only one data collector who will also enter data in REDCap. However, if data&#xD;
      are not available or missing, the specific measurements will be excluded from analysis.&#xD;
      Missing data will be reported with published study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
      -------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Statistics]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Average percentage reduction of ulcer area is the study's primary end-point. If data are&#xD;
      normally distributed (determined by probit or logit plot) statistical analysis can be&#xD;
      performed using Student's t-test. Non-normally distributed data can be analyzed using&#xD;
      transformation of data or non-parametric statistics (Wilcoxon rank sum test or Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U-test). Other numerical data (cutaneous oxygen tension, pain scoring, use of analgesics) can&#xD;
      be statistically evaluated in the same manner as ulcer area reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete ulcer healing is regarded as binary end-point data. Healing proportions will be&#xD;
      calculated and compared between intervention group and control group - risk ratio and&#xD;
      confidence intervals will be determined. Significance of data will be tested using Pearson's&#xD;
      chi-squared test (alternatively Fisher's exact test if data material is small / does not fit&#xD;
      chi-test). Sense of touch data will be evaluated in the same way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of patient's quality of life in intervention group and control group is based on&#xD;
      average questionnaire scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
      -------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Study power]&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should be considered a pilot study. Earlier studies investigating ESWT ulcer&#xD;
      treatment focus on study populations which are different from ours. The investigators&#xD;
      consider our design to be unique since the investigators have not been able to identify&#xD;
      earlier studies using a standard care control group to compare against intervention with 6&#xD;
      times ESWT in 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
      -------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Project feasibility]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is carried out as an undergraduate research year in the period 1/9-2014 -&#xD;
      1/9-2015. Medical student Sune Møller Jeppesen is accepted as an undergraduate student from&#xD;
      the Faculty of Health Science, University of Southern Denmark. The undergraduate student&#xD;
      works under guidance from main supervisor Lars Lund, professor, MD, DMSci. Knud Bonnet&#xD;
      Yderstræde, MD, PhD, and Benjamin Schnack Rasmussen, MD, PhD-student, are co-supervisors for&#xD;
      the project. Primarily, the undergraduate student's work will involve ESWT consultations and&#xD;
      data collection. The student will be trained in relevant techniques needed for measuring ESWT&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Office facilities are available for the undergraduate student at the Department of Urology.&#xD;
      Consultation room and devices for clinical measurements are available at the Wound Clinic,&#xD;
      Department of Plastic Surgery OUH. Shockwave device will be purchased (see budget&#xD;
      information).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be registered to relevant authorities including the Danish Data Protection&#xD;
      Agency and the Committee for Health Research Ethics, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
      -------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Publication]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial results will be applied for publishing in an international scientific journal.&#xD;
      Furthermore results will be presented at science conferences within the fields of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
      -------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Economy]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek research funding from private and public organizations. The&#xD;
      investigators apply for 120.000 Danish kroner (DKK) to cover 12 months undergraduate student&#xD;
      salary and 371.125 DKK for shockwave device purchase. Costs related to office facilities are&#xD;
      14.500 DKK. Project overhead is 3 % of total costs. Total project costs are 520.794 DKK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
      -------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Significance of the project]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to evaluate healing effects of ESWT. If ESWT effectively can improve healing&#xD;
      of complicated diabetic foot ulcers, ESWT should be considered for implementation in ulcer&#xD;
      treatment clinical guidelines. Better ulcer healing can potentially improve patient's quality&#xD;
      of life and decrease the number of diabetic patients who are being amputated (or at least&#xD;
      postpone amputations). Later, research may be carried out to refine ulcer ESWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proven ulcer healing effects of ESWT may also inspire future studies to test ESWT effects in&#xD;
      the context of other clinical conditions. Possibly ESWT can be used in several settings where&#xD;
      regenerative and anti-inflammatory effects are wanted.&#xD;
