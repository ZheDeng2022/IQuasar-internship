      Dose Finding and Efficacy Evaluation of DOXIL (Doxorubicin HCL Liposome Injection) in&#xD;
      Combination with Abraxane (Abraxane) in Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) [Phase I&#xD;
      and II]&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phase I Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the combination of (DOXIL) and Abraxane&#xD;
           in patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of DOXIL and Abraxane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the response rate of DOXIL and Abraxane in patients with MBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the time to disease progression in patients with MBC receiving DOXIL and&#xD;
           Abraxane.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the tolerability of this regimen in women with MBC and assess toxicity profile&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a biopsy proven or radiologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy na√Øve in the metastatic setting or had one prior regimen for metastatic&#xD;
             breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had multiple non-chemotherapy agents for metastatic breast cancer are&#xD;
             eligible i.e. hormonal therapies, Herceptin, Avastin etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If they had received a taxane or anthracyclines in the adjuvant or metastatic setting,&#xD;
             the interval should be more than 12 month and the cumulative dose of anthracycline&#xD;
             will have to be taken into account (for both adjuvant and metastatic setting).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have Her2/neu negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No significant co-morbid conditions as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal cardiac function, as evidenced by a left ventricular&#xD;
             ejection fraction (LVEF) within institutional normal limits. A Multiple Gated&#xD;
             Acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (the same test must be used throughout the&#xD;
             study) to evaluate LVEF must be done within 4 weeks (28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal laboratory values as explained below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No active malignancy in the past 5 years (other than non- melanomatous cutaneous&#xD;
             cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or in-situ cervical cancer).&#xD;

             equal to 10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section for the evaluation of measurable&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with Grade 3 or 4 neuropathy at baseline evaluation from any cause will also&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are permitted to receive radiation therapy (palliative or primary), but their&#xD;
             study drugs will be held during the course of radiation therapy until hematopoietic&#xD;
             recovery. The irradiated sites will not be used for response in the Phase II setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior anthracycline dose exceeding 360 mg/m2 for doxorubicin (including Doxil) or 720&#xD;
             mg/m2 for epirubicin will make them ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity reactions attributed to a conventional formulation of&#xD;
             doxorubicin HCL or the components of DOXIL. Prior history of severe reaction to Taxol&#xD;
             will also make them ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarct within 6 months before enrollment, New York Heart Association&#xD;
             (NYHA) Class II or greater heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled&#xD;
             ventricular arrhythmias, clinically significant pericardial disease, or&#xD;
