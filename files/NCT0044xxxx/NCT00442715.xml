    <textblock>
      Vigorous exercise is known to cause transient bronchoconstriction in school children with&#xD;
      asthma, many of whom initially have normal lung function at rest. The presence and extent of&#xD;
      this phenomena in early childhood is difficult to recognize, because exercise induced&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction (EIB) may not limit the child's performance and the child may fail to&#xD;
      notice the symptoms until taking part in organized or competitive sport. Conversely, as&#xD;
      children do participate in vigorous activities all day long, severe EIB may provoke a crucial&#xD;
      disabling condition in the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In school children the exercise challenge test (ECT) is a well standardized test and is used&#xD;
      to make a diagnosis of asthma because it is able to discriminate between asthma and other&#xD;
      chronic breathing illnesses of childhood and is also used to determine the effectiveness and&#xD;
      optimal dosages of medications prescribed to prevent EIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test includes is a controlled run on a motor-driven treadmill followed by scheduled&#xD;
      multiple spirometry maneuvers. This procedure was never been tested and may not be suitable&#xD;
      for the preschool age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we assumed that a free-run test which combined with measurements of duplicate&#xD;
      spirometry-sets would be the most convenient way to test young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are a) to examine the feasibility of a free-run protocol (according to&#xD;
      the ATS/ERS recomendations), followed by duplicate spirometry measurements in early&#xD;
      childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b) to explore the existence of exercise induced bronchoconstriction in young children (age&#xD;
      3-6 years old) with respiratory symptoms.&#xD;

      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children are to come in comfortable clothes and running shoes, having consumed no more&#xD;
      than a light meal and having had pulmonary medications withdrawn as described above. A&#xD;
      parent, a pediatric pulmonary physician and a technician is present throughout the test. Each&#xD;
      child undergoes a physical examination to exclude evidence of wheeze, and baseline spirometry&#xD;
      was performed. The children are asked to run freely back and forth (without a nose-clip) in a&#xD;
      50m long corridor next to the pulmonary laboratory. The target is to achieve 6 minutes of&#xD;
      &quot;free run&quot; to increase hart-rate to 80% in the maximum for at least 4 minutes according to&#xD;
      ATS/ERS recommendations for exercise challenge test in older children [1]. An adult&#xD;
      (parent/technician/ physician) will run with the child to encourage him/her to continue&#xD;
      running. Heart-rate and O2-saturation is monitored continuously throughout the run using a&#xD;
      portable mobile pulse-oximeter monitor (Nonin medical, INC, model 2500, Minneapolis, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry is measured according to the recommendations for preschool children [2], with a&#xD;
      commercial ZAN100 Spirometer situated in the pediatric pulmonary laboratory, by a skilled&#xD;
      technician. Measurements are performed in the standing position, without nose-clip (for&#xD;
      comfort of the child) until two consecutive technically acceptable curves are achieved. After&#xD;
      the free-run, spiroetmry is measured in duplicate sets at 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20 minutes&#xD;
      post-exercise [1]. The better of the two curves is selected as the representative value at&#xD;
      each interval, but differences between the two values of FEV1 has to be &lt;5%. The following&#xD;
      signs are monitored by the pulmonologist: wheeze and prolonged expiration on auscultation&#xD;
      over the trachea and two zones of both lungs (upper front and lower back). Cough, shortness&#xD;
      of breath, or perceived breathlessness within 20 minutes after the run were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Technically acceptable spirometry maneuvers are analyzed. Baseline values are first&#xD;
      compared to the spirometry values with relation to height derived from the indices in 109&#xD;
      healthy children in our previous study [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following exercise, best spirometry values for each interval are compared to baseline values.&#xD;
      Exercise response was defined as the greatest decrease in FEV1 expressed as a percentage of&#xD;
      the baseline values. A bronchoconstriction response to exercise is considered as positive&#xD;
      when the FEV1 decrease from baseline was greater than 13% [4]. Student's paired t-test is&#xD;
      used for comparison of data between each spirometry index and the calculated values for&#xD;
      healthy children. A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
