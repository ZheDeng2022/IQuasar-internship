  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of therapy to strengthen the&#xD;
      immune system (Interleukin - 2) plus a specific tumor target therapy (Bevacizumab) can&#xD;
      prolong the time between the start of treatment and disease progression, decrease tumor size,&#xD;
      as well as determine if the combination therapy is safer and less toxic than the standard&#xD;
      treatment for renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard first-line treatment for patients with metastatic RCC is IL-2 at higher doses,&#xD;
      but associated with higher frequency of toxicities. IL-2 given at lower doses have&#xD;
      demonstrated similar results than higher doses but it requires further study. RCC is highly&#xD;
      vascular and expresses high levels of VEGF. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed&#xD;
      against the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) responsible for angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to evaluate a response defined as time to progression, safety and&#xD;
      toxicity in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Tissue correlation to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of vascular VEGF on clinical outcome will be retrospectively performed&#xD;
