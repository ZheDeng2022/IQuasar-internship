      Major attempt is being given to the potential of curing patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer due to the recognition of dramatic change in survival figures achieved in palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy combination treatment protocols. Achieving resectablity rates in previously&#xD;
      unresectable patients has been defined as study endpoint among other well known primary and&#xD;
      secondary objectives. Curing metastatic colorectal cancer is most likely in resectable&#xD;
      patients and therefore the logical next step after completion of chemotherapy combination&#xD;
      studies (e.g. EORTC 40983) is the addition of targeted agents. Bevacizumab has the most valid&#xD;
      data of improving outcome figures and was therefore chosen as additional agent. Safety of the&#xD;
      combination with Xelox was demonstrated in the investigators pilot trial (Gruenberger JCO&#xD;
      2006, ASCO 2006, WCGC 2006, ESMO 2006), consequently response rate and resection rate will be&#xD;
      the primary endpoints in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is the Resectability (R0) rate after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant Bevacizumab in potentially resectable mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of this study include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility with regards to GI bleeding and wound healing complications after surgery of&#xD;
           liver metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General safety&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION Recruitment is planned for 12 months. Patients will be treated for 6 cycles&#xD;
      XELOX and 5 cycles Bevacizumab. Surgery will be performed 2 weeks after the last Capecitabine&#xD;
      administration, allowing a time window of 5 weeks between the last Bevacizumab administration&#xD;
      and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy with 6 cycles of XELOX and Bevacizumab will be restarted 4-5 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a Follow up period of 2 years after the last enrolled patient, in order to assess RFS&#xD;
      and OS, the trial will last for approx. 3 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Total Number of Patients and Target Population The planned total sample size for this study&#xD;
      is 40 patients. Patients with potentially resectable metastatic colorectal cancer previously&#xD;
      untreated for metastatic disease will be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This is a single arm, multicenter Phase I/II trial to evaluate the Resectability (R0)&#xD;
      rate after neoadjuvant Bevacizumab in combination with a biweekly regime of capecitabine plus&#xD;
      oxaliplatin (XELOX) in potentially resectable mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-operative treatment phase consists of 6 cycles XELOX and 5 cycles Bevacizumab. The&#xD;
      cycle duration is 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed 2 weeks after the last administration of Capecitabine, allowing a&#xD;
      time window of 5 weeks between the last dose of Bevacizumab and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-operative treatment phase consists of 6 cycles XELOX + Bevacizumab and will be&#xD;
      re-started 4-5 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be further followed for tumour progression and survival for a further 2 years&#xD;
      after the last patient has been enrolled in this trial (end of the study follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of Assessment and Study Procedures Study assessments and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed as shown in Table 1 and 2. Screening and Baseline Written informed consent must be&#xD;
      obtained prior to the patient undergoing any study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tumor assessments: abdominal and pelvic CT / MRI and chest CT / MRI may be obtained up&#xD;
           to 4 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessments to be made up to 14 days before enrollment include: demographic data,&#xD;
           medical history, cancer/treatment history, concomitant disease/treatment, physical&#xD;
           examination (including basic neurologic exam by investigator), electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
           and CEA, CA 19-9 determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessments to be made within 7 days before enrollment: height, weight, vital signs&#xD;
           (body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse/heart rate), ECOG Performance Status,&#xD;
           hematology, blood chemistry (including creatinine clearance calculation), INR &amp; aPTT,&#xD;
           serum pregnancy test (for all women less than 2 years amenorrheic), dipstick urinalysis&#xD;
           for proteinuria, and 24-hour urine collection for determination of total protein (if&#xD;
           necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Urine pregnancy test is required prior to first administration of study treatment if&#xD;
           more than 7 days have elapsed from baseline serum pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a Central Venous Access Device (CVAD) is required, at least a 2-day interval between&#xD;
      placement of a central line and first bevacizumab administration is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase (pre- and post-operative) Standard Clinical Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Vital signs [weight, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse/ heart rate]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On each (scheduled) visit, patients will be assessed for adverse events (grading by the&#xD;
           common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE version 3.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following laboratory tests are to be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  White blood cell count with differentials (lymphocytes, neutrophils), red blood cell&#xD;
           count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelet count&#xD;

           version 3.0) with special regard to wound healing&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second control visit will be performed 21 days after surgery and should include the same&#xD;
      assessments as on the first control visit with the addition of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Visit End of treatment safety visit to be performed 28 days after the last drug&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Phase and Termination of Study Progression Free Survival Status and Survival status&#xD;
      should be assessed every 3 months for a maximum of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY MEDICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose, Schedule and Administration Bevacizumab Bevacizumab will be given at 5 mg/kg on d1&#xD;
      every two weeks, for 5 consecutive cycles. The 6th cycle will be XELOX without Bevacizumab,&#xD;
      allowing for a time window between last administration of Bevacizumab and surgery of 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time window between surgery and re-start of treatment will be at least 4 weeks and wound&#xD;
      healing must be completed. Bevacizumab will then be given at 5 mg/kg on d1 every two weeks,&#xD;
      for 6 consecutive cycles in combination with XELOX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab doses will be calculated for each patient in milligrams per kilogram. The&#xD;
      patient's actual weight from the screening visit will be the reference weight throughout the&#xD;
      study (i.e., patients will receive the same dose at each treatment). Doses of Bevacizumab&#xD;
      will be recalculated for patients who experience more than 10% change in body weight from&#xD;
      baseline during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive an infusion of study drug in a total volume of 100 mL of 0.9%&#xD;
      Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Bevacizumab infusions should not be administered or mixed&#xD;
      with dextrose or glucose solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial study drug dose will be delivered over 90 minutes as a continuous IV infusion. If&#xD;
      the first infusion is tolerated without infusion associated adverse events the second&#xD;
      infusion may be delivered over 60 minutes. If the 60 minute infusion is tolerated, all&#xD;
      subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 minutes. If a patient experiences infusion&#xD;
      associated adverse events with the 60 minute infusion, all subsequent doses will be given&#xD;
      over 90 minutes. If a patient experiences infusion associated adverse events with the 30&#xD;
      minute infusion, all subsequent doses will be given over 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should extravasation of the study drug infusion occur, the following steps are to be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Discontinue the IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If a significant volume of the study drug infusion remains, restart the IV at a more&#xD;
           proximal site in the same limb&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treat the infiltration according to institutional guidelines for infiltration of a&#xD;
           noncaustic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-surgery phase, Bevacizumab will be obtained locally by prescription. After&#xD;
      surgery, Bevacizumab will be supplied as glass vials with 4-mL fill, containing 100 mg (25&#xD;
      mg/mL) or with 16-mL fill, containing 400 mg (25 mg/mL). Vials contain no preservative and&#xD;
      are for single use only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin Liquid Oxaliplatin will be given at 85 mg/m2 on d1 every two weeks, for 6&#xD;
      consecutive cycles, before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid Oxaliplatin dose will be calculated using the body surface area (BSA) of the patient&#xD;
      (see Appendix 2). The dose of oxaliplatin administered should be as close as possible to the&#xD;
      calculated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid Oxaliplatin administration does not require hyperhydration. In the event of&#xD;
      extravasation, administration must be discontinued immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For nausea and vomiting, 5-HT3 antagonists with or without dexamethasone are strongly&#xD;
      recommended for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid Oxaliplatin must be infused either by peripheral vein or central venous line over 2&#xD;
      hours. The infusion line must be adequately flushed with 5% dextrose solution (D5W) between&#xD;
      oxaliplatin infusion and the administration of any other drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin®) will be obtained locally by prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine The dose of Capecitabine is 1.500 mg/m2 twice daily from the evening of d1 until&#xD;
      the morning of d8, followed by 1 week rest period. One treatment cycle consists of 2 weeks.&#xD;
      Capecitabine will be given for 6 consecutive cycles, before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appropriate daily dose of capecitabine is identified by determination of the Body Surface&#xD;
      Area (see Appendix 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine is to be administered orally within 30 minutes after the end of a meal&#xD;
      (breakfast, dinner). Tablets should be swallowed with approximately 200 mL water (not fruit&#xD;
      juices). The first dose of each cycle will be administered as the evening dose on day 1 and&#xD;
      the last dose of each cycle is scheduled the morning of day 8, followed by a 7 day rest&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine (Xeloda®) will be obtained locally by prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment Duration In the pre-operative treatment phase 6 cycles of XELOX and 5 cycles&#xD;
      of Bevacizumab will be administered, resulting in a total treatment duration of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed 2 weeks after the last administration of Capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative treatment consists of 6 cycles XELOX + Bevacizumab and will re-start 4-5 weeks&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
