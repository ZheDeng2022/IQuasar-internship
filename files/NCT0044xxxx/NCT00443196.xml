      1. 0 Background and Rationale: Despite the use of aggressive treatment protocols, less than&#xD;
           10% of cancer patients with an advanced disease respond to the therapy. There is a&#xD;
           variety of different cancer drug regimens, all of which have approximately the same&#xD;
           probability of clinical effectiveness. Identification of those patients who will or will&#xD;
           not respond to a specific chemotherapy is important for making decisions regarding&#xD;
           chemotherapy regimens as well as alternative management approaches. A laboratory test&#xD;
           that could help to determine the sensitivity of an individual patient's tumor cells to&#xD;
           specific chemotherapeutic agents would be valuable in choosing the optimal chemotherapy&#xD;
           regimen for that patient with an expectation of increasing the response rate to the&#xD;
           therapy. Several types of in vitro assays that measure tumor cell survival following&#xD;
           exposure to cytotoxic agents have been evaluated for their ability to predict&#xD;
           chemotherapy outcomes. As a group, these assays are referred to as drug resistance&#xD;
           assays. In a resistance assay, the surviving tumor cells can be detected directly by&#xD;
           their exclusion or metabolism of specific dyes. Alternatively, since some of tumor cells&#xD;
           are proliferating, their survival can be detected by measurement of DNA synthesis by&#xD;
           radiolabeled precursor incorporation or demonstration of clonogenic potential by growth&#xD;
           into colonies in semi-solid culture medium. In several clinical studies, these assays&#xD;
           were useful in detecting drug resistance and in predicting a poor prognosis for cancer&#xD;
           patients. However, these resistance assays cannot detect sensitivity of an individual&#xD;
           patient's tumor cells to a specific drug. Therefore, new methods determining&#xD;
           drug-sensitivity of the tumor cells of an individual patient and, thus, capable of both&#xD;
           predicting a positive treatment outcome and guiding chemotherapy, would be of&#xD;
           significant value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Dr. Kravtsov has developed an automated microculture kinetic (MiCK) assay for&#xD;
      measuring drug induced apoptosis in tumor cells. Apoptosis is a distinct mode of cell death&#xD;
      which occurs under physiological conditions and yet can be induced in malignant cells by&#xD;
      chemical and physical factors including antitumor drugs. During the last decade, it has been&#xD;
      recognized that chemotherapeutic agents exert their antitumor activity by triggering&#xD;
      apoptosis in susceptible tumor cells. This implies that the MiCK assay for apoptosis provides&#xD;
      a mechanism-based approach to studying effects of cytotoxic agents on tumor cells. Unlike&#xD;
      &quot;resistance&quot; assays that measure a fraction of cells surviving drug exposure, the MiCK assay&#xD;
      measures a fraction of tumor cells killed by a chemotherapeutic agent via mechanism of&#xD;
      apoptosis. Therefore the MiCK assay determines drug sensitivity, rather than resistance.&#xD;
      Recently the MiCK assay has been shown to predict complete remission rate and survival in&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia patients better than clinical criteria did. In a limited study, the&#xD;
      MiCK assay has been used to direct chemotherapy of the leukemia patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MiCK assay has also been used to study drug-induced apoptosis in solid tumors, including&#xD;
      neuroblastoma and colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. More recent data accumulated by DiaTech&#xD;
      has demonstrated that the MiCK assay can detect drug induced apoptosis in primary cultures of&#xD;
      tumor cells isolated from patients with ovarian carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer and high grade soft tissue sarcoma. Based on these data, we suggest that the&#xD;
      MiCK assay may be used to detect drug sensitivity profiles of individual patients with&#xD;
      various types of solid tumors. This, in turn, may provide a way to tailor chemotherapy to an&#xD;
      individual patient's drug sensitivity profile, and, thus, improve treatment outcomes,&#xD;
      decrease adverse effects of the chemotherapy, increase the quality of patient's life, and&#xD;
      reduce the treatment cost.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pathological diagnoses of ovarian, fallopian and primary peritoneal&#xD;
             adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with de novo malignancies and no previous chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with advanced refractory malignancies who received no more than 2 standard&#xD;
             chemotherapy treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of any age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have tumor which is accessible and agree to undergo biopsies, or&#xD;
             drainage of effusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom chemotherapy is a treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Explanations: We anticipate that newly diagnosed patients will be mostly used to&#xD;
             evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to predict the outcome of the chemotherapy&#xD;
             (Objective #2.1) and to establish criteria correlating numerical response in the MiCK&#xD;
             assay with probability of the clinically established complete remission. The patients&#xD;
             with refractory malignancies will be mostly used to evaluate the ability of the MiCK&#xD;
             assay to guide cancer chemotherapy (Objective #2.2). Patients will be seen and managed&#xD;
             as outpatients or inpatients, depending on a clinical standard of the institution&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic/uncontrolled parenchimal brain metastasis and not accessible&#xD;
             tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with meningeal metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom chemotherapy clinically is not indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy. During the course of the study, all patients of childbearing potential&#xD;
             should be instructed to contact the treating physician if they suspect they might have&#xD;
             conceived a child; for females, a missing or late menstrual period should be reported&#xD;
             to the treating physician. If pregnancy is confirmed by a pregnancy test, the patient&#xD;
             must not receive study medication and must not be enrolled into the study or, if&#xD;
             already enrolled, must be withdrawn from the study. If a male patient is suspected of&#xD;
             having fathered a child while on the study drugs, the pregnant female partner must be&#xD;
             notified and counseled regarding the risk to the fetus. Pregnancy during the course of&#xD;
             this study will be reported to the Principal Investigator as a serious adverse event.&#xD;
             Women of child bearing potential are defined to include any female who has experienced&#xD;
             menarche and has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal&#xD;
             (defined as amenorrhea for more than 12 consecutive months); these includes also&#xD;
             females using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones, mechanical&#xD;
             devices, or barrier methods to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
