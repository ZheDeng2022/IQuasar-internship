      This study will determine whether pioglitazone (Actos, a drug approved to treat diabetes, can&#xD;
      benefit HIV-infected people with fatty liver. Fatty changes of the liver (also known as&#xD;
      steatosis) have been linked to diabetes and long-term liver damage in some patients.&#xD;
      Pioglitazone has been shown to improve fatty liver in people without HIV; this study will see&#xD;
      if it is beneficial for people with HIV as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with increased fat in the liver may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Screening includes a CT scan and liver biopsy (withdrawal of a small&#xD;
      sample of liver tissue through a needle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to take either 45 mg of pioglitazone or placebo (sugar&#xD;
      pill) by mouth once a day for 48 weeks. At the end of 48 weeks, all participants stop taking&#xD;
      their medication and are followed for an additional 48 weeks to see what, if any benefits, of&#xD;
      pioglitazone persist after treatment is stopped. In addition to taking the study medication,&#xD;
      participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits to the NIH Clinical Center over a period of approximately 2 years at day 0 and&#xD;
           weeks 2, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 52, 72, and 96. Most visits take about 1 hour and&#xD;
           include blood drawing for various laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin clamp test at day 0 and weeks 24 and 48 to see how the body processes glucose.&#xD;
           This test takes 4 to 6 hours and may include an overnight stay at the Clinical Center. A&#xD;
           catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the arm to infuse insulin and another is&#xD;
           placed in a vein on the back of the hand to draw blood samples. Blood sugar is checked&#xD;
           frequently and glucose is given to keep blood sugar at normal values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutrition evaluations at day 0 and weeks 24 and 48. Subjects write down all the food&#xD;
           they eat and drink for 4 days before the visit. They meet with a nutritionist to review&#xD;
           the food record and to complete simple measurements of body fat and shape.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan of liver and abdomen at weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver biopsy at week 48.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While the introduction of antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS has transformed HIV disease&#xD;
      into a chronic infection for many, the use of antiretroviral therapy is also often associated&#xD;
      with metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance, central fat accumulation and&#xD;
      peripheral fat atrophy. Fatty infiltration of the liver or hepatic steatosis may be an&#xD;
      important consequence of these metabolic derangements or may represent a direct toxicity&#xD;
      associated with HIV infection and/or antiretroviral medications. Preliminary data suggests&#xD;
      that hepatic steatosis may be very common and perhaps present in up to 50 percent of&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Hepatic steatosis represents one step&#xD;
      in the potential progression towards hepatocellular injury, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis&#xD;
      (NASH), and, in a small percentage of patients, subsequent fibrosis and cirrhosis. In&#xD;
      addition, hepatic fat content is closely associated with impaired insulin resistance and type&#xD;
      2 diabetes, conditions increasingly recognized among HIV-infected patients. In the setting of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and NASH, thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone, have been shown&#xD;
      to reduce hepatic steatosis, lower transaminase levels and improve insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the potential benefits of pioglitazone therapy in the setting of HIV&#xD;
      infection and hepatic steatosis, we will conduct a 96-week, double-blind, randomized placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial of pioglitazone (45 mg/day) in 50 HIV-infected men and women, with 48 weeks&#xD;
      of active treatment and 48 weeks of observational follow-up after study treatment ends. We&#xD;
      anticipate needing to screen 100 subjects to identify a sufficient number of eligible&#xD;
      participants to enroll in the study. The primary outcome variable of interest in this trial&#xD;
      will be the change in hepatic fat score, liver-to-spleen ratio, which is calculated from CT&#xD;
      scan of the abdomen. Important secondary outcomes will be histologic improvement on liver&#xD;
      biopsy performed at baseline and 48 weeks, as well as improvements in transaminase levels and&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. All participants will be&#xD;
      followed for 48 weeks after discontinuing study treatment to evaluate the short-term natural&#xD;
      history of steatosis in those who received placebo and to assess the durability of any&#xD;
      potential benefits of pioglitazone upon withdrawal. In this way, important information about&#xD;
      the efficacy of pioglitazone to treat hepatic steatosis and improve the metabolic profile in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients will be obtained, as well as preliminary data on whether benefits of&#xD;
      pioglitazone are sustained after treatment is discontinued.&#xD;
