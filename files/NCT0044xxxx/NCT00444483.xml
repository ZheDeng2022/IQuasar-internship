      The improvement of the quality of life (QoL) is one of the key treatment goals in patients&#xD;
      with diabetes mellitus. Objective: Prospective study to evaluate the impact of structured&#xD;
      diabetes education on the QoL in insulin-treated, elderly patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. Inpatients with insulin treated type 2 diabetes or failure of oral antidiabetic&#xD;
      therapy were successively recruited and participated in the structured inpatient diabetes&#xD;
      treatment and teaching program (DTTP) for insulin therapy QoL was assessed before and six&#xD;
      months after participation in the DTTP with the standardised questionnaire of Lohr analysing&#xD;
      the subscales: social relations, physical complaints, worries about the future, diet&#xD;
      restrictions, fear of hypoglycemia, and daily struggles.&#xD;

      All patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who were older than 54 years and admitted by&#xD;
      general practitioner to the inpatient unit of the university hospital of Jena, Germany, for&#xD;
      participation in a structured DTTP for insulin therapy because of hyperglycemia, were&#xD;
      candidates for successive inclusion in the study. All patients participated in a five day&#xD;
      inpatient structured DTTP for single or split dose administration of intermediate-acting&#xD;
      insulin which included instruction in insulin injection, self- monitoring, hypoglycemia,&#xD;
      acute/late complications, nutrition and foot care. Quality of life was assessed by using a&#xD;
      validated instrument, the standardised QoL- questionnaire of Lohr et al. (21) both before and&#xD;
      six months after participation in the DTTP. This questionnaire consists of 58 Likert- scaled&#xD;
      items comprising the subscales: social relations, physical complaints, worries about the&#xD;
      future, diet restrictions, fear of hypoglycemia, and daily struggles. Higher scores reflect&#xD;
      higher quality of life with 100% as an optimum quality of life. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      regarding patients metabolic control was the improvement of quality of life six months after&#xD;
      DTTP.&#xD;
