  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an investigational&#xD;
      vaccine (TG4040) to prevent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The primary goal of this study&#xD;
      is to determine the safety of increasing doses of TG4040 versus placebo (an inactive&#xD;
      substance) in subjects chronically infected with HCV. Approximately 85 patients, ages 18-65&#xD;
      years, with chronic HCV infection will be enrolled in this study at two sites, Saint Louis&#xD;
      University and Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Volunteers will receive doses of TG4040 and&#xD;
      placebo by injections into the thigh on different days, depending on which study group they&#xD;
      belong to. Safety will be checked before doses are increased, and each participant will&#xD;
      receive the study vaccine, TG4040, at some point during the study. Each subject will&#xD;
      participate in the study for 8 months. This study may help produce a new vaccine that would&#xD;
      improve control of HCV.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine, TG4040, in outpatients with chronic hepatitis C. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted in two parts at two DMID Vaccine Treatment and Evaluation Unit (VTEU)&#xD;
      Centers: Saint Louis University and Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Up to 85 subjects with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C will receive the test vaccine via subcutaneous injection into the thigh.&#xD;
      In Part I of this study, 18 subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups. At the initial&#xD;
      dosing time point, Group One will receive 10 to the 6th power particle-forming units (PFU)&#xD;
      and Groups Two &amp; Three will receive saline placebo in 3 doses on Days 0, 7, and 14. After&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) review, Group Two will receive a higher dose of TG4040 (10&#xD;
      to the 7th power PFU) and Groups One &amp; Three will receive saline placebo. After a further SMC&#xD;
      review, Group Three will receive a higher dose of TG4040 (10 to the 8th power PFU) and Groups&#xD;
      One &amp; Two will receive saline placebo. (Each subject will therefore be treated with one&#xD;
      course of TG4040 and receive two courses of placebo). In Part II of this study, 60 subjects&#xD;
      (30 non-responders or relapse subjects-Part IIa, and 30 treatment na誰ve, Part IIb) will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups to receive either 10 to the 8th power PFU (or the highest&#xD;
      tolerated dose) of TG4040 or saline placebo at two dosing time points with a crossover&#xD;
      design. (Each subject will therefore be vaccinated with the same dose of TG4040 and also&#xD;
      receive a course of placebo.) Subjects enrolled in either Part I or Part II of the study will&#xD;
      participate for 8 months. The primary objective for Part I of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      safety of escalating doses of TG4040 versus placebo administered to non-responders or relapse&#xD;
      subjects with chronic hepatitis C. The secondary objective for Part I of the study is to&#xD;
      assess immunogenicity of escalating doses of TG4040 versus placebo administered to&#xD;
      non-responders or relapse subjects with chronic hepatitis C. The primary safety objective for&#xD;
      Part II of the study is to assess the safety of the dose of TG4040 selected from Part I&#xD;
      versus placebo when administered to subjects with chronic hepatitis C, either non-responders&#xD;
      or relapse subjects or treatment- na誰ve subjects. The primary efficacy objective for Part II&#xD;
      of the study is to assess antiviral activity against HCV of TG4040 versus placebo in subjects&#xD;
      with chronic hepatitis C, non-responders or relapse subjects or treatment-na誰ve subjects,&#xD;
      assessed as a 1 log reduction in serum level of HCV RNA. The secondary objective for Part II&#xD;
      of the study is to assess immunogenicity of TG4040 versus placebo in subjects with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C, non-responders or relapse subjects or treatment-na誰ve subjects, and correlate&#xD;
      this with reductions in serum levels of HCV RNA. For Part I, the primary outcome measures are&#xD;
      related to safety and include measures of reactogenicity, changes in blood counts and hepatic&#xD;
      panel. For Part II, the primary outcome variable is a change in serum levels of HCV RNA&#xD;
      compared to baseline. A decrease in more than 1 log from baseline will be considered a&#xD;
      significant effect. In addition to this, other primary outcome measures will also include&#xD;
      safety and include measures of reactogenicity, changes in blood counts and hepatic panel.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes measures include those tests aimed at assessing immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      vaccine candidate and include, but are not limited to, development of anti-HCV using standard&#xD;
      commercial assays and research assays, developed of enhanced in vitro T cell reactivity when&#xD;
      stimulated with HCV antigens.&#xD;
