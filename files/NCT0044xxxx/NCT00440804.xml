      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of ibuprofen l-lysine&#xD;
      iv in premature infants in the early treatment of Patent Ductus Arteriosus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ductus arteriosus remains patent in about 40% to 80% of very low birth weight infants.&#xD;
      Early treatment by intravenous ibuprofen L-lysine (IV ibuprofen) has been suggested in&#xD;
      preliminary studies to close the ductus and shorten hospital stay. This study aims to&#xD;
      determine the effect of early treatment with IV ibuprofen given to the very low birth weight&#xD;
      infant with a non-symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) at less than 72 hours of life to&#xD;
      accelerate and maintain ductal closure, thereby reducing the need for rescue therapy.&#xD;

             (ECHO);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 72 hours of age at the time of randomization;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If infant is one of a multiple birth, he/she is one of the two (2) oldest infants who&#xD;
             meet the eligibility criteria;&#xD;

             volume and maximal vasopressor therapy as defined by the individual institution);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal failure or oliguria defined as urine flow rate &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/hr in the 8 hours&#xD;
