  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or clinically significant diabetic macular&#xD;
      edema requiring surgical intervention will receive a pre-operative injection of Macugen. An&#xD;
      initial, pre-injection vitreous tap will be done in order to provide baseline VRGF 165 and&#xD;
      cytokine levels. At the onset of the vitrectomy, a second vitreous sample will be taken to&#xD;
      obtain intra-operative levels of Macugen, VEGF 165 and cytokines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is one of the leading causes of blindness in North America. Diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      (PDR) is characterized by disruption of the normal microvascular circulation in the retina&#xD;
      and results in the production of neovascularization and increased microvascular permeability.&#xD;
      Similarly, clinically significant diabetic macular edema CSDME) results in loss of central&#xD;
      visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with these conditions, despite treatment, will go on to develop vitreous&#xD;
      hemorrhage or tractional changes that require surgical intervention (such)as vitrectomy&#xD;
      and/or vitrectomy with membrane peeling in the attempt to both restore vision and prevent&#xD;
      further visual loss or re-establish the normal macular anatomy and improve patient visual&#xD;
      acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although multiple etiologic factors are involved in the early changes seen in diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy and maculopathy, it has been shown that VEGF is the primary angiogenic growth&#xD;
      factor implicated in the development of neovascularization in PRD and in increased vascular&#xD;
      permeability, resulting in CSDME. VEGF levels have been found to correlate tightly with the&#xD;
      extent of diabetic retinopathy and introduction of VEGF into normal primate eyes can induce&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy. Although several isoforms of VEGF exist, isoform 165 (VEGF 165) is the&#xD;
      most pathogenic form of VEGF and therefore inhibition of VEGF 165 may play a significant role&#xD;
      in modulating diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macugen is a VEGF antagonist (anti-VEGF pegylated aptamer) which binds to VEGF 165 with high&#xD;
      specificity and affinity. In vitro pharmacology studies have shown that Macugen binds to the&#xD;
      amino acid isoform VEGF 165 and inhibits it from binding to its cellular receptors. As a&#xD;
      consequence, Macugen blocks signalling events and disrupts the cascade of proliferative and&#xD;
      vascular permeability responses associated with the binding of VEGF 165 to endothelial cells.&#xD;
      This effect has been clearly proven in Phase 3 trials for patients with age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration (AMD), resulting in inhibition of vascular development and decrease in vascular&#xD;
      leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although diabetic retinopathy represents a different challenge than AMD, the underlying&#xD;
      pathogenic factors are similar in the role and effects of VEGF. Regression of retinal&#xD;
      neovascularization after Macugen therapy in diabetic individuals has been shown. Phase 2&#xD;
      studies have been completed and Phase 3 studies are currently underway in patients with&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema to evaluate the efficacy of Macugen to restore vision in patients with&#xD;
      CSDME. These studies are ongoing but exclude patients in whom vitrectomy has been performed&#xD;
      or is planned in the near future due to tractional effects on the macula from epiretinal&#xD;
      membranes or vitreomacular traction syndrome. No studies have been done to date in patients&#xD;
      with PDR or CSDME to quantify the reduction of intravitreal VEGF 165 levels in these patients&#xD;
      following intravitreal Macugen injection or to evaluate the effects of VEGF 165 blockade on&#xD;
      the neovascular regression and surgical outcome in patients with extensive diabetic&#xD;
      proliferative neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to quantify the reduction of intravitreal VEGF 165 levels in&#xD;
      patients following intravitreal Macugen injection pre-operatively and determine the level of&#xD;
      Macugen in the vitreous cavity after variable time intervals (2,4, 6 or 8 weeks).&#xD;
