    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (HP) is a gram-negative bacillus responsible for one of the most common&#xD;
      infections found in humans worldwide. By the early-to-mid 1990s, further evidence emerged&#xD;
      supporting the link between the chronic gastritis of HP infection and malignancy in adults,&#xD;
      specifically gastric lymphoma and adenocarcinoma. The potential of HP eradication for the&#xD;
      prevention of gastric cancer was underlined. At the national consensus meeting held in&#xD;
      Brussels in 1998, HP eradication was strongly recommended in past or current peptic ulcer&#xD;
      diseases, regardless of activity, complication and post endoscopic resection of early cancer.&#xD;
      Some patients received gastric surgery due to the complications of peptic ulcer such as&#xD;
      bleeding or perforation in the pre-HP eradication era. Their HP infection status was not&#xD;
      surveyed and unknown at the time. Afterward, some of them were not suggested to receive an&#xD;
      eradication therapy and recovered from the operative procedure. According to the consensus to&#xD;
      treat HP for a purpose to reduce the risk of gastric cancer, these patients were still under&#xD;
      risk. There have been only a few surveys on the prevalence of persistent HP infection in&#xD;
      patients who have undergone surgery. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence and&#xD;
      histological features of HP infection after a time course of partial distal gastric surgery.&#xD;

      The eradication of H pylori is known to reduce the recurrence rate of peptic ulcer and&#xD;
      gastric inflammation. But it is still not clear about the prevalence of HP infection in&#xD;
      patients after surgical interventions when the micro-environment had been changed. Since&#xD;
      biliary enterogastric reflux is suggested to inhibit the growth of HP, we will investigate in&#xD;
      a prospective study the effect of partial gastrectomy on the influence of HP infection&#xD;
      incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with previous distal gastrectomy will be prospectively evaluated as study group.&#xD;
      Same number of patients with the same indication of endoscopy evaluations and without&#xD;
      previous gastrectomy will be established as a normal control group for H pylori infection&#xD;
      rate comparison. All patients in study and control groups who had previously received H&#xD;
      pylori eradication therapy will be excluded. Three gastric biopsy specimens were collected&#xD;
      from each patient for histological analysis. Patients with a pre-operative biopsy, operative&#xD;
      specimen revealing H pylori colonization or a positive serum H pylori IgG will be indicated&#xD;
      previous H pylori infection and will be assessed the percentage of spontaneous clearance of&#xD;
      HP infection. A positive bile staining will indicate biliary enterogastric reflux. This&#xD;
      assessment will be made by two investigators, and disagreements will be resolved by joint&#xD;
      discussion to reach a consensus. Tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and the&#xD;
      Giemsa stain will be examined by pathologist who was unaware of the endoscopy findings.&#xD;
      Density of HP in the tissue and histological gastritis activity and intestinal metaplasia&#xD;
      will be graded as normal (0), mild (1), moderate (2) and severe (3) based on the Sydney&#xD;
      system. Follicular gastritis will be based on the absence (0) or presence (1) of lymphoid&#xD;
      follicules and lymphoid with germinal center (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point will be the change of infection rate on HP after distal gastrectomy&#xD;
      procedure comparing the normal control. The secondary end point will assess the correlation&#xD;
      between the duration of the antrectomy, the operative procedure, the severity of bile reflux&#xD;
      with the inhibition of HP growth. Finally, this study will be base on histopathological&#xD;
      features with the density of HP, the grading of gastritis activity, intestinal metaplasia and&#xD;
      follicular gastritis.&#xD;
