      This study will determine whether resting beta cells (cells in the pancreas that produce&#xD;
      insulin) for 2 weeks will improve the ability of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (T2DM) to make insulin. Beta cells can rest by giving patients insulin shots. The study will&#xD;
      also examine how teenagers with T2DM feel about having diabetes and explore differences&#xD;
      between young people with and without T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes patients 12 to 25 years of age with T2DM who are overweight and who were&#xD;
      diagnosed within 2 years of enrolling in the study. Healthy individuals of normal weight or&#xD;
      who are overweight are also eligible. Candidates are screened with a medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with T2DM are assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 takes an anti-diabetes&#xD;
      medicine called metformin and follows a diet prescribed by a study staff dietitian for 2&#xD;
      weeks. Group 2 takes metformin, follows the prescribed diet, and receives insulin through a&#xD;
      pump under the skin for 2 weeks. During these two weeks, all participants have the following&#xD;
      tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequent blood sugar checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test (routine diabetes test in which blood samples are drawn&#xD;
           before and several times after the subject drinks a sugary solution).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arginine stimulation to test the response of the body to arginine, a normal ingredient&#xD;
           of food that stimulates the release of insulin. Two catheters are placed into veins in&#xD;
           the arms, one to administer a liquid containing arginine, the other to draw the blood&#xD;
           samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound of the blood vessels in the neck to check for hardening of the arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolism test to measure the amount of oxygen used during rest. The subject breathes&#xD;
           normally during rest while wearing a canopy over his or her head for about 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scans of the abdomen to examine the amount of fat in the belly (at the beginning and&#xD;
           end of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scan to determine percent body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests to explore quality of life and feelings about health, work or school, friends and&#xD;
           family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise testing on a treadmill or stationary bicycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic studies for information on diabetes and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers have blood draws, oral glucose tolerance testing, MRI scan, DEXA scan,&#xD;
      psychological testing, exercise testing, and genetic testing.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a condition characterized by insulin resistance and&#xD;
      progressive failure of the insulin-secreting beta-cells. Previously considered a disease of&#xD;
      adults, it is now becoming increasingly prevalent in children and adolescents. Patients with&#xD;
      childhood onset T2DM are at very high risk for diabetes-related morbidity and mortality, due&#xD;
      to a longer life-time duration of diabetes, as well as possible increased rapidity of&#xD;
      Beta-cell failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will address the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize hormonal, metabolic, and behavioral traits in patients with youth-onset&#xD;
           type 2 diabetes. These will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Assessment of Beta-cell function and insulin resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Psychological, demographic, and socioeconomic assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Assessment of the physiology and pathophysiology of incretins and other gut&#xD;
                hormones&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Identification of early biomarkers of diabetes complications, especially&#xD;
                cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Validation of new methods for studying glucose metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To serve as a recruitment and development tool for hypothesis-driven pilot studies,&#xD;
           discussed in the appendices of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and young adults ages 8 to 25 years with type 2 diabetes will be studied in a&#xD;
      cross-sectional and longitudinal manner. Two control groups without diabetes will be studied&#xD;
      for comparison purposes: healthy lean controls, and overweight/obese controls. Methods used&#xD;
      to study participants include routine blood sampling, oral glucose tolerance testing, mixed&#xD;
      meal testing, arginine stimulation testing, DEXA, MRI, carotid ultrasound, questionnaires,&#xD;
      exercise physiology, and measurements of energy expenditure. Patients with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      will be studied using oral glucose tolerance and mixed meal tests in a pilot study of&#xD;
      artificial sweeteners.&#xD;

        -  DIABETIC SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Fasting blood glucose greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL OR postprandial blood&#xD;
                  sugar greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL (either during OGTT at NIH or as&#xD;
                  previously documented on outside medical record).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Since subjects may already have been started on treatment with hypoglycemic&#xD;
                  agents at the time of enrollment, they may have blood glucose levels in the&#xD;
                  impaired glucose tolerance range (fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL and postprandial&#xD;
                  140-199 mg/dL). This is a sign of adequately controlled diabetes, rather than an&#xD;
                  incorrect diagnosis of diabetes. Therefore, prior documentation (on outside&#xD;
                  medical records) of blood glucose values documenting diabetes will be acceptable&#xD;
                  if the subject has impaired glucose tolerance rather than overt diabetes&#xD;
                  according to screening results at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Absence of insulin autoantibodies (in insulin na(SqrRoot) ve patients only)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Or&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (for Pilot Study only)&#xD;
&#xD;
             And&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age 8-25 years at enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Normal OGTT at NIH (fasting blood glucose &lt; 100 mg/dL AND 2 hour blood glucose &lt; 140&#xD;
             mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Significant comorbidity that, in the opinion of the investigators, will increase risk&#xD;
             to the subject(specific obesity-related comorbidities are explicitly permitted,&#xD;
             including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea and non-alcoholic&#xD;
             steatohepatitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Positive urine pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Psychiatric or cognitive disorder that will, in the opinion of the investigators,&#xD;
             limit the subject's ability to comply with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        NON-DIABETIC CONTROLS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Two types of volunteers will be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Overweight and obese volunteers who will be BMI matched with study enrollees who have&#xD;
             T2DM during analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Normal weight (BMI between 5th and 85th centiles for age) volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Significant comorbidity that, in the opinion of the investigators, will increase risk&#xD;
             to the subject (specific obesity-related comorbidities are explicitly permitted,&#xD;
             including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea and non-alcoholic&#xD;
             steatohepatitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current use of drugs that alter glucose metabolism (e.g. metformin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current use of prescription or non-prescription weight-loss drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Positive urine pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Psychiatric or cognitive disorder that will, in the opinion of the investigators,&#xD;
             limit the subject's ability to comply with study procedures&#xD;
