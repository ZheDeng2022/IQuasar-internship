    <textblock>
      Investigational drug AMG 714 will be given to 66 subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis&#xD;
      to study safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. Dose levels include 150mg and 300mg and will&#xD;
      be given to each subject for a total of 6 doses. Each dose for each subject will be given&#xD;
      once every 2 weeks. Subjects will followed for up to 300 days post the first dose of AMG 714.&#xD;
