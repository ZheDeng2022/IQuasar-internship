    <textblock>
      Multicentre, open label, phase III study. Subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis were&#xD;
      given efalizumab subcutaneously once per week for the 12-week treatment period. Assessments&#xD;
      involved physical examination, disease activity assessments, clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
      (haematology, blood chemistry and standard urinalysis), evaluation of the Psoriasis Area and&#xD;
      Severity Index (PASI), the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA), the Patient's Global&#xD;
      Psoriasis Assessment (PGPA), the SF-36 Health Survey and psoriatic body surface area (BSA).&#xD;
      The 12-week treatment period was followed by a 12-week follow-up (FU) period, during which&#xD;
      other antipsoriatic medications were allowed. The same assessments were also performed in the&#xD;
      12-week FU period.&#xD;
