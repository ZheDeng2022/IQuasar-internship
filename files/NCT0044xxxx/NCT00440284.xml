      Objective. Flexible, intensive insulin therapy (FIT) with pre-prandial regular insulin and&#xD;
      conventional insulin therapy (CIT) with twice daily premixed insulin are treatment options in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes who become insulin dependent. While intensive insulin therapy&#xD;
      can increase meal and life style flexibility, conventional therapy is easier to perform. The&#xD;
      aim of the study was to compare metabolic outcomes and patient preferences of both treatment&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods. Non-blinded, randomized controlled cross-over clinical pilot&#xD;
      trial. Insulin naive participants who failed therapeutic goals under oral antidiabetic&#xD;
      therapy underwent FIT and CIT for two months. Patients completed standard Diabetes Treatment&#xD;
      and Teaching Programs (DTTP) and trained FIT and CIT. Main outcome measures were glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin (GHb), mild and severe hypoglycemia, insulin dosage, blood pressure and&#xD;
      body-mass-index (BMI). Before/after and inter-group analyses were performed. Finally, therapy&#xD;
      preference was analyzed.&#xD;

      Hypothesis In the undertaken study we tested the hypothesis that flexible, intensive and&#xD;
      conventional insulin therapy in insulin-naive adults with type 2 diabetes are equally&#xD;
      effective in regards to metabolic outcomes. We hypothesized that younger participants in&#xD;
      employment would prefer flexible, intensive insulin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexible, intensive and conventional insulin therapy CIT consisted of twice daily injections&#xD;
      of premixed insulin (30% regular insulin, 70% NPH-insulin) before breakfast and dinner.&#xD;
      Participants followed individually adjusted diet plans with fixed amounts of carbohydrates.&#xD;
      Daily blood-glucose self-control was performed before insulin injections. Participants&#xD;
      documented blood glucose readings and insulin dosage. Limited self-adjustment of insulin&#xD;
      dosage was taught and encouraged in the DTTP, i.e. variance of up to 4 IU insulin per&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In FIT, participants measured blood glucose before main meals and at bedtime and adjusted&#xD;
      regular insulin dosages to actual blood glucose levels and their desired carbohydrate intake&#xD;
      on a meal by meal basis. When necessary, NPH insulin was added at bedtime. Additional&#xD;
      administration of oral antidiabetic drugs was not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design, randomization and intervention The trial was designed as a clinical,&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, non-blinded, single center, cross-over pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, participants started insulin therapy either with FIT or CIT and&#xD;
      completed a Diabetes Treatment and Teaching Program on an out-patient basis. In this four&#xD;
      week run-in period with weekly visits, individual insulin dosage and carbohydrate intake was&#xD;
      determined (figure 1). The run-in was followed by an 8 week study sequence until cross-over.&#xD;
      At cross-over, participants were given one structured teaching session for refreshing and&#xD;
      switched from CIT to FIT (Group A) or FIT to CIT (Group B), respectively. After a one week&#xD;
      run-in period for insulin dose-adjustment, participants completed the second 8 week study&#xD;
      sequence. Regular visits were held at the beginning and at the end of both study sequences.&#xD;
      Additional visits were held after 2 weeks, to adjust therapy if necessary. During visits, a&#xD;
      study team consisting of a diabetologist and a specially trained nurse educator analyzed&#xD;
      personal diabetes records and gave advice regarding insulin dose adjustment and other&#xD;
      problems related to current diabetes therapy. At the end of the trial, participants decided&#xD;
      which therapy to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting, eligibility criteria and outcome measures Participants were recruited in the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic of the Unit of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases of the Department of&#xD;
      Internal Medicine of the Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with type 2 diabetes who failed to achieve their therapeutic goals under oral&#xD;
      antidiabetic therapy and who were referred by local General Practitioners to the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic for initiation of insulin therapy were candidates for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
      Participants who agreed to participate in the study were recruited in consecutive order as&#xD;
      they were referred to the out-patient clinic. They were not admitted to the study if any of&#xD;
      the following criteria were present: (1) not type 2 diabetes, (2) diabetes duration &lt;2 years,&#xD;
      (3) not insulin naive, (4) ineffective oral antidiabetic therapy &lt; 3 months, (5) GHb below 7&#xD;
      or above 11%, (6) age below 40 or above 65 years, (7) co-medication with corticosteroids, (8)&#xD;
      pregnancy, severe mental or somatic diseases or (9) unwillingness to return for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point with respect to the effectiveness of FIT and CIT was glycosylated&#xD;
      (GHb). Secondary end-points were mild and severe symptoms of hypoglycemia, insulin dosage,&#xD;
      blood pressure, BMI and individual therapy preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size To have a 90% chance of detecting as significant (at the two sided 5% level) a&#xD;
      0.5 % difference between the two groups in GHb, with an assumed standard deviation of 0.8%,&#xD;
      38 participants were required.&#xD;
