  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has been recently introduced as an alternative to&#xD;
      UFH given several important biologic and pharmacokinetic advantages.1,2 In contrast to UFH,&#xD;
      it acts independently of antithrombin and inhibits both free and clotbound thrombin; it is&#xD;
      not neutralized by circulating inhibitors; does not bind to plasma protein and cause&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia.1,2 In the Bivalirudin Angioplasty Study, bivalirudin was associated with a&#xD;
      45% reduction in the relative risk for the composite of death, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      revascularization or hemorrhage as compared to UFH among patients with unstable angina&#xD;
      undergoing percutaneous coronary angioplasty.3 Recently, in another randomized trial of&#xD;
      patients with intermediate risk undergoing coronary stenting after varying pre-treatment&#xD;
      intervals with different doses of thienopyridines, use of bivalirudin was estimated to result&#xD;
      in 38% reduction in the relative risk of death, myocardial infarction, urgent repeat&#xD;
      revascularization or in-hospital major bleeding at 30 days compared to UFH.4 In addition,&#xD;
      bivalirudin was associated with a similar rate of ischemic events and less major bleeding and&#xD;
      estimated to be more cost-effective than abciximab administered in adjunct to UFH.4,5&#xD;
      However, previous studies have included patients treated with plain balloon angioplasty or&#xD;
      stenting after inadequate pretreatment with thienopyridines (ticlopidine or clopidogrel).&#xD;
      Recent guidelines recommend that all patients undergoing PCI must receive a loading dose of&#xD;
      300 - 600 mg of clopidogrel.6 Clopidogrel is a thienopyridine that acts by irreversibly&#xD;
      inhibiting the platelet adenosine 5'- diphosphate (ADP) receptor. Compared to ticlopidine, it&#xD;
      has the advantage of a more favourable side effect profile 7, 8 and more rapid onset of&#xD;
      action.9 Pre-treatment with clopidogrel has been associated with better outcomes among&#xD;
      patients undergoing PCI.10-12 After a loading dose of 600 mg, maximum inhibition of&#xD;
      aggregation with clopidogrel is achieved within two hours.13 The Intracoronary Stenting and&#xD;
      Antithrombotic Regimen-Rapid Early Action for Coronary Treatment (ISAR-REACT) trial showed&#xD;
      that after pre-treatment with 600 mg clopidogrel for at least 2 hours before intervention,&#xD;
      additional use of abicximab to UFH was not associated with any clinically measurable benefit&#xD;
      among low-to-intermediate risk patients who underwent PCI.14 On the other hand, patients who&#xD;
      received abciximab had a higher rate of thrombocytopenia and more frequently required blood&#xD;
      transfusions. Thus, an antithrombotic strategy consisting of a loading dose of 600 mg&#xD;
      clopidogrel in addition to UFH and aspirin is a safe and effective way to improve patients'&#xD;
      outcomes and reduce costs after PCI. There are few data about the use of protamine&#xD;
      neutralization of circulating heparin after successful stent implantation.15-18 However, all&#xD;
      the previous studies showed no excess in ischemic complications after stent implantation and&#xD;
      subsequent protamine administration, with a strong potential for bleeding complication&#xD;
      limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above-mentioned data it can be said that antithrombotic regimens based on either&#xD;
      bivalirudin or UFH intraprocedurally followed by protamine neutralization, are effective&#xD;
      strategies to reduce ischemic and hemorrhagic complications in patients with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease undergoing PCI. At present, it is not known whether bivalirudin is superior to UFH in&#xD;
      patients who have been optimally pre-treated with a loading dose of clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We designed this study to assess whether bivalirudin is superior to unfractioned heparin +&#xD;
      protamine in patients undergoing PCI. All patients older than 18 years of age, who require&#xD;
      coronary angiography for suspected or established coronary artery disease, but without&#xD;
      ST-segment changes, will receive a loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel at least 2 hours prior&#xD;
      to the procedure. Eligible patients who do not meet the exclusion criteria and in whom&#xD;
      angiography reveals that revascularization is required and the target lesion(s) is (are)&#xD;
      amenable to PCI, will be randomized to receive a bolus of 140 U/kg of heparin or bivalirudin&#xD;
      to be administered as an intravenous bolus of 0.75 mg/kg prior to the start of the&#xD;
      intervention, followed by infusion of 1.75 mg/kg per hour for the duration of the procedure.&#xD;
      All patients will receive aspirin indefinitely and clopidogrel for at least 1 month after&#xD;
      PTCA or implantation of bare metal stents and for at least 6 months after implantation of&#xD;
      drug-eluting stents; clopidogrel treatment for more than 6 months will be encouraged.19 The&#xD;
      primary end point of the study is in-hospital major bleeding. The study is designed to show&#xD;
      whether bivalirudin is superior to UFH + protamine with respect to the primary end point.&#xD;
