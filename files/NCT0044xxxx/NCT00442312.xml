  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Combigan ophthalmic solution in&#xD;
      combination with Latanoprost when the therapy is swiched from Latanoprost monotherapy in&#xD;
      patient with Glaucoma or ocular hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Combigan Ophthalmic Solution provides addition IOP loweringwhen combined with&#xD;
           Latanoprost.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The treatment with Combigan Ophthalmic Solution has an acceptable safety profile, as&#xD;
           measured by ocular and systemic safety parameters.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to comparethe efficacy and safety Ophthalmic Solution in&#xD;
      combination with Latanoprost when the therapy is swiched from Latanoprost monotherapy in&#xD;
      patient with Glaucoma or ocular hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be open label, prospective, multi-centered where patients will be swiched from&#xD;
      Latanoprostmonotherapy to a combination therapy of Latanoprost with Combigan Ophthalmic&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, of legal age of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of ocular hypertension (OHT) or glaucoma (incl. open angle glaucoma, chronic&#xD;
             angle closure glaucoma, exfoliative glaucoma, pigmentary glaucoma or pseudophakic&#xD;
             glaucoma) and requiring administration of IOP lowering eye drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Written informed consent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient can understand all study instructions, and is willing and able to comply&#xD;
             with the schedule of visits and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has been administering latanoprost eye drops as monotherapy in affected eye(s)&#xD;
             for at least 12 weeks according to the approved product labeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient's Day 0 IOP &gt; 18 mm Hg in the proposed study eye/s on established latanoprost&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have used COMBIGANÂ® Ophthalmic Solution in the past must not have been&#xD;
             discontinued from using this medication due to adverse events or due to lack of&#xD;
             efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Day 0: negative urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. .Uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. .Females who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy, or females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential who are not using a reliable means of contraception. A female&#xD;
             is considered of child-bearing potential unless she is post-menopausal, without a&#xD;
             uterus and/or both ovaries, or has a tubal-ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. .Known allergy or hypersensitivity to the study medication or components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. .Anticipated alteration of existing chronic therapy with agents which could have a&#xD;
             substantial effect on IOP (including, but not necessarily limited to systemic&#xD;
             adrenergic agents including beta-adrenergic blocking agents [e.g., propanolol,&#xD;
             metoprolol, nadolol, timolol and atenolol]), substantial interaction with study&#xD;
             medications, or interaction with study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. .Corneal abnormalities that would preclude accurate IOP readings with an applanation&#xD;
             tonometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. .Any other active ocular disease other than glaucoma or ocular hypertension (e.g.,&#xD;
             uveitis, ocular infections, or severe dry eye). However, patients with chronic mild&#xD;
             blepharitis, cataract, age-related macular degeneration, or a background diabetic&#xD;
             retinopathy can be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. .Required chronic use of other ocular medications during the study other than the&#xD;
             study medications. Occasional use of artificial tears or topical decongestants and/or&#xD;
             antihistamine is acceptable. Use of these within 24 hours of a scheduled study visit&#xD;
             is prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. .Ocular surgery within the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. .Current enrolment in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such&#xD;
             a study within 30 days of entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. .Patient has a condition or is in a situation which in the investigator's opinion may&#xD;
             put the patient at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere&#xD;
             significantly with the patient's participation in the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. .Day 0 - Significant ocular irritation.&#xD;
