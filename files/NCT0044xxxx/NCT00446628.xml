      The purpose of this study is to understand the spread of influenza (flu) in schools and&#xD;
      households with elementary (K-5) school children, and develop ways to reduce the flu using&#xD;
      non-pharmaceutical means.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pandemic influenza threatens to cause substantial disability, death, and societal disruption&#xD;
      and to overwhelm health care systems in the United States and around the world. Because&#xD;
      effective vaccines may not be available during the initial months of a pandemic, and because&#xD;
      anti-viral medication is both largely ineffective and in short supply, non-pharmacological&#xD;
      personal protection and behavioral changes may be the only means to combat the epidemic. In&#xD;
      our computational modeling work (through the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study&#xD;
      network), we have shown the potential value of multiple targeted and layered&#xD;
      non-pharmacological interventions in blunting the peak impact and slowing of a pandemic&#xD;
      (Nature, in press).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 of the project will be a pilot study in two elementary schools in the City of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh. The project has already obtained agreement to collaborate from the Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Public School System and we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of epidemiologists,&#xD;
      systems analysts, modelers, community and minority health workers, and virologists to&#xD;
      implement the project. Phase one was in 2 schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will be similar to Phase 1 with the addition of additional schools and application of&#xD;
      a &quot;hygiene&quot; intervention to selected schools and families. Phase 2 is in 10 schools with 3800&#xD;
      students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims (year 02):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in reducing&#xD;
           influenza rates among enrolled students in the intervention and control schools when&#xD;
           influenza is known to be circulating in the community. [Note: Enrolled, for purposes of&#xD;
           PIPP, will indicate students who present with ILI, consent to participate, and are&#xD;
           tested for influenza during the flu season.] Secondary: School-Based&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure number of absentees and determine the reason for absence by using a school based&#xD;
           absentee illness surveillance system prior to and through the end of influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure the effectiveness of NPIs in reducing absenteeism from all causes, including&#xD;
           illness/URI, illness/ILI, illness/other, and illness/GI through the end of influenza&#xD;
           season.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measure the effectiveness of NPIs in reducing secondary spread of ILI within classrooms&#xD;
           of participating schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess adoption of NPI behaviors and activities in classrooms of intervention schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary: Home-Based&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Measure the effectiveness of NPIs in reducing secondary cases of ILI within families of&#xD;
           enrolled school children with influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Assess adherence of families of enrolled school children with influenza to&#xD;
           isolation-related NPI behaviors and activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Measure correlation between rapid flu testing and PCR testing for influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Collect and archive influenza specimens for future molecular epidemiological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Contribute a sample of influenza-positive specimens to the CDC for national influenza&#xD;
           surveillance purposes.&#xD;
