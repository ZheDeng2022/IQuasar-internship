  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was designed to provide clinical confirmation of Cb2's value as a new&#xD;
      approach in the prevention of increased vascular permeability and hemoconcentration, both&#xD;
      signs of OHSS in humans, and in order to explore its mechanism of action. To this end, a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed in which Cb2 was employed in&#xD;
      women at risk of OHSS after gonadotropin administration for ART. Simultaneously, ovarian&#xD;
      perfusion was assessed in these patients using MR pharmacokinetic modeling.&#xD;

      Patients and Study design This study was performed in 82 oocyte donors between April 2004 and&#xD;
      July 2006. The study protocol was approved by our institution's Ethical Committee and all&#xD;
      participants signed a written consent form. The protocol for COH has previously been&#xD;
      described (23). Only patients at risk of developing OHSS were included. The definition of&#xD;
      risk was the development of 20-30 follicles &gt;12 mm in diameter, and retrieval of &gt;20 oocytes.&#xD;
      Once the decision to administer hCG was taken, patients were immediately allocated into two&#xD;
      groups based on a computer randomization: the study group initially consisted of 41 patients,&#xD;
      but 6 of these were discarded after randomization because &lt;20 oocytes were retrieved despite&#xD;
      the development of &gt;20 follicles &gt;12 mm. Thus, a remaining total of 35 patients received one&#xD;
      0.5 mg tablet of Cb2 daily for eight days. The control group was also initially composed of&#xD;
      41 women. However, 7 of these did not meet the criteria of number of oocytes retrieved, and 2&#xD;
      donors decided to withdraw themselves from the study. This left a remaining total of 32&#xD;
      women, all of whom completed the study, and who received a placebo tablet daily for 8 days.&#xD;
      Women were monitored every 48 hours from the day of hCG (day 0) until day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day hCG+4, in order to define ascites, and provided that there was a certain degree of&#xD;
      fluid in the pouch of Douglas after ovum pick-up, we employed transvaginal ultrasound (TVU)&#xD;
      to measure two major perpendicular diameters of fluid pockets in 15 donors who showed no risk&#xD;
      of OHSS. We observed 3.5±2.8 cm2 of fluid in the pelvis in normal conditions. Therefore, the&#xD;
      existence of ascites was confirmed when a pocket of peritoneal fluid &gt;9 cm2 was observed when&#xD;
      the patient was in lithotomy position (with the gynecological table always at 45º from the&#xD;
      floor of the room), which is the result of the mean± 2 standard deviations (SD) of the value&#xD;
      found in non-OHSS candidates. TVU scans were performed by the same researcher (CA), who was&#xD;
      blind to the treatment to which the patient was submitted. A 6.5 MHz vaginal probe (Voluson&#xD;
      730 Pro V, General Electric, Madrid, Spain) was employed for all TVU scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the biochemical risk of hemoconcentration, we evaluated hemoglobin, hematocrit,&#xD;
      and leukocyte count. Moreover, renal (creatinine) and liver [transaminases: aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase (AST); alanine aminotransferase (ALT)] functions, and electrolytes (Na, K)&#xD;
      were analyzed to ascertain the severity of the syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since all women undergoing ART experience a certain degree of discomfort and enlarged ovaries&#xD;
      (known as mild OHSS), we centered our attention on analyzing the incidence of moderate and&#xD;
      severe OHSS, which were identified according to our modified (24) classification of Golan et&#xD;
      al (25). Moderate OHSS was confirmed when a patient presented ultrasonographic evidence of&#xD;
      ascites, while diagnosis of severe OHSS required clinical evidence of ascites and/or&#xD;
      hydrothorax and breathing difficulties, or one of the following criteria: a) increased blood&#xD;
      viscosity due to hemoconcentration (hemoglobin ≥15 g/dl, hematocrit ≥45%, or leukocyte count&#xD;
      ≥20,000/mm3); b) coagulation abnormality; c) diminished renal perfusion and function (serum&#xD;
      creatinine levels &gt;1.2 mg/dl); d)liver dysfunction: defined when transaminases (AST or ALT)&#xD;
      were &gt;40 U/ml (24, 25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, serum PRL levels were measured and adverse drug reactions recorded. An&#xD;
      end-of-study assessment was scheduled 7-10 days after the last dose of Cb2/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, in the first 8 patients included in the study, follicular fluid aspirates without&#xD;
      obvious blood contamination were collected, pooled and and mRNA extracted to quantify the&#xD;
      amount of Dp-r2 in human ovaries, employing two different molecular techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further objectively analyze changes in vascular permeability and fluid shifts,&#xD;
      confirmatory studies were performed on six women in the study group and four controls,&#xD;
      employing magnetic resonance (MR) as described below. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR was&#xD;
      performed at three different stages of the study: at baseline, before gonadotropin&#xD;
      administration was initiated; just before hCG injection; and on day hCG+5, after oocyte&#xD;
      pick-up.&#xD;
