  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves the use of three different dosing regimens of AMG 706 in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors to see how the drug affects the gallbladder size and function. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in 11 sites in the US and Australia. A total of 48 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study with the possibility of enrolling 8 more in each treatment arm.&#xD;
