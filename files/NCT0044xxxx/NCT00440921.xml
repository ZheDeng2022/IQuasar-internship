    <textblock>
      -  Thermogenesis is a company that sells a machine for the production of fibrin sealant of&#xD;
           single donor plasma, the CryoSeal Fibrin Sealant System (CS-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fibrin sealant consists of two components: cryoprecipitate and thrombin. Cryoprecipitate&#xD;
           is the fraction of human plasma that contains concentrated coagulation factors, such as&#xD;
           fibrinogen. Thrombin is an enzyme that facilitates the conversion of fibrinogen into&#xD;
           fibrin, so that a clot will be formed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fibrin sealant can be used in surgery to increase hemostasis in the wound after e.g.&#xD;
           knee- or hip replacement, cosmetical surgery or partial liverresections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Until now, mainly autologous plasma was used to produce fibrin sealant with the CS-1.&#xD;
           Within Sanquin there is a question whether fibrin sealant can be produced from the&#xD;
           allogeneic quarantaine plasma that is in stock. Therefore in this study will be studied&#xD;
           whether allogenous single donor fibrin sealant produced using the CS-1 is effective in&#xD;
           wound healing and as consequence of this can be registered as a product of Sanquin. To&#xD;
           answer these questions a national working party is formed, working party Fibrin Sealant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  So far, three man personnel in Sanquin Blood Bank Nort East Region (SBNO) are certified&#xD;
           by Thermogenesis to use the CS-1 for production of fibrin sealant and an in vitro&#xD;
           validation has been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The next step will be a study for the in vivo effectiveness of fibrin sealant produced&#xD;
           of single donor allogeneic quarantaine plasma using the CS-1. As control patients&#xD;
           without fibrin sealant treatment will be studied. Two hospitals (Refaja Hospital in&#xD;
           Stadskanaal and Wilhelmina hospital in Assen) are already interested in participating in&#xD;
           this study. Probably, three more hospitals will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of fibrin sealant will be studied in a prospective randomized trial for patients&#xD;
           undergoing knee and hip replacements.&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Until now, mainly autologous plasma was used to produce fibrin sealant with the&#xD;
                CS-1. Within Sanquin there is a question whether fibrin sealant can be produced&#xD;
                from the allogeneic quarantaine plasma that is in stock. Therefore in this study&#xD;
                will be studied whether allogenous single donor fibrin sealant produced using the&#xD;
                CS-1 is effective in wound healing and as consequence of this can be registered as&#xD;
                a product of Sanquin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The use of fibrin sealant will be studied in a prospective randomized trial for&#xD;
                patients undergoing knee and hip replacements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
           · To study the effectiveness of fibrin sealant produced of single donor allogeneic&#xD;
           plasma when used intra-operatively after total knee or hip replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primairy endpoint: wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary endpoints: total blood loss until 24h post-operative, amount of blood&#xD;
                transfused, motion of the joint (knee) after surgery, amount of pain after surgery,&#xD;
                use of antibiotics, wound infections, stay in hospital, adverse events,&#xD;
                satisfaction with fibrin sealant as used by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We hypothesize that use of fibrin sealant will have a positive effect on wound&#xD;
                healing, will cause less blood loss, decreased use of antibiotics and and will&#xD;
                cause that a decreased number of infections will be seen compared to patients who&#xD;
                are not treated with fibrin sealant. Through this, hospital stay will probably be&#xD;
                shortened for patients who are treated with fibrin sealant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  As a working hypothesis we assume a score for wound healing of at least 20% lower&#xD;
                and at least 20% less blood loss for the fibrin sealant treated group.&#xD;
&#xD;

        7. Patients 7.1 Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age, minimum of 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gender, man or woman&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Admission of the patient after informed consent 7.2 Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Liver failure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Congenital or acquired coagulation disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Thrombocytopenia, &lt; 100 x10^9PLT/L 7.3 Number of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The number of patients needed in this study to indicate a statistical significantly&#xD;
                difference can be calculated from a pilot study for wound healing in patients that&#xD;
                have undergone knee- or hip replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Knee replacement: For calculation of the number of patients we aim to see a&#xD;
                significant difference of at least 20% better wound healing after use of fibrin&#xD;
                sealant during surgery. From a pilot we observed for wound healing a score of&#xD;
                0.71±0.49. With the power at 80% and alpha at 0.05 we need 193 evaluable patients&#xD;
                in both study group (fibrin sealant treated) and control group (non fibrin sealant&#xD;
                treated).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hip replacement: For calculation of the number of patients we aim to see a&#xD;
                significant difference of at least 20% better wound healing after use of fibrin&#xD;
                sealant during surgery. From a pilot we observed for wound healing a score of&#xD;
                1.58±0.79. With the power at 80% and alpha at 0.05 we need 96 evaluable patients in&#xD;
                both study group (fibrin sealant treated) and control group (non fibrin sealant&#xD;
                treated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each adverse event (AE) that occurs during of after the use of fibrin sealant will&#xD;
                be noted on the form by the physician on duty.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient (&quot;patient&quot; is defined as any&#xD;
                subject who has been enrolled in the study as evidenced by the subject having&#xD;
                signed informed consent) or any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an&#xD;
                abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease that occurs during the course of&#xD;
                the clinical investigation. The AE may or may not be considered as related to the&#xD;
                investigational drug or device. All AE's should be recorded in the patient's chart&#xD;
                and graded mild, moderate, or severe. All AE's shall be handled to the hospital&#xD;
                procedures in force and as soon as possible passed down to the study coordinators,&#xD;
                in case of fatality at least within 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Mild: Symptom barely noticeable to patient; does not influence performance or&#xD;
                     functioning. Prescription drugs not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom&#xD;
                     but may be given because of personality of patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Moderate: Symptom of sufficient severity to make patient uncomfortable;&#xD;
                     performance of daily activities influenced; patient is able to continue in&#xD;
                     study; treatment for symptom is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Severe: Symptom causes severe discomfort, or may be of such severity that&#xD;
                     patient cannot perform daily routines, may cause cessation of treatment with&#xD;
                     fibrin sealant; or even may be fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After complementary follow-up the physician on duty will conclude with notice of&#xD;
                argumentation whether the AE:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  is not caused by fibrin sealant&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  is possible, but not necessary caused by fibrin sealant (causes cannot be&#xD;
                     proven nor excluded)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  is probably caused by fibrin sealant&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  is certainly caused by fibrin sealant&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Procedure 9.1 Set up clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The study is a randomized prospective clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fibrin sealant treated patients will be compared with non fibrin sealant treated&#xD;
                patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients included undergo total knee or hip replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During participation of the patient, only the study coordinator of the hospital and&#xD;
                the staff of the operation room know whether a patient is treated with fibrin&#xD;
                sealant or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nurses and patients can be informed at the end of participation of the patient (at&#xD;
                discharge of the hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primairy endpoint is wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary endpoints are total blood loss until 24h post-operative, amount of blood&#xD;
                transfused, motion of the joint (knee) after surgery, amount of pain after surgery,&#xD;
                use of antibiotics, wound infections, stay in hospital, adverse events,&#xD;
                satisfaction with fibrin sealant as used by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each group (fibrin sealant treated and non fibrin sealant treated) wil contain 193&#xD;
                patients for knee and 96 patients for hip surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9.2 Production and release of fibrin sealant&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Fibrin sealant will be produced and released from SBNO according to the procedures in&#xD;
           force.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9.3 Controled treatment with fibrin sealant&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each patient who might be included (see 7.1 and 7.2) will be asked for admission to&#xD;
                participate in this study by informed consent prior to surgery. Therefore a letter&#xD;
                with information about this study will be given to each patient who might be&#xD;
                included.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After admission an envelope will be openend by the study coordinator in the&#xD;
                hospital in which a code is for treatment or no treatment with fibrin sealant. The&#xD;
                study coordinator will tell the outcome only to the personel of the OR who need to&#xD;
                know it for preparation and usage of the fibrin sealant. People from the operation&#xD;
                room do not communicate this outcome to the nursery. Except for treatment with&#xD;
                fibrin sealant there will be no difference in treatment of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient and nurses (when desired) will be informed about treatment with fibrin&#xD;
                sealant or not when the patient leaves the hospital and is discharged from this&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prior to surgery a blood sample of the patient will be taken to determine the&#xD;
                platelet count, hematocrit and hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fibrin sealant, if used, will be assessed just before closing the wound. 9.4&#xD;
                Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The following parameters of patients and surgery will be noted pre-operative by&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Results of knee and hip replacements will be analyzed and reported separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Via an unpaired t-test differences in primary and secondary endpoints between&#xD;
                fibrin sealant treated and non fibrin sealant treated patients will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Fisher's exact test will be used to determine the effect of use of fibrin&#xD;
                sealant in wound leakage, wound infections and undesired events.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Of the results a report will be written. Also a report for data of each separate&#xD;
                hospital will be written. Results about knee and hip replacements will described&#xD;
                separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Time scheduling&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The study will start in January 2007. After minimaal 193 evaluable patients per&#xD;
                group for knee surgery (193 patients treated with fibrin sealant and 193 patients&#xD;
                not treated with fibrin sealant) and minimal 96 evaluable patients per group for&#xD;
                hip surgery (96 patients treated with fibrin sealant and 96 patients not treated&#xD;

             -  It is expected that this study will take about 1 year, in case 5 hospitals&#xD;
                participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Only in case of serious reasons (e.g. severe adverse events) the study will be&#xD;
                terminated early.&#xD;
