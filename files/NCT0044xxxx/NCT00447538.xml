           posttraumatic distress in the aftermath of the continuing conflict on Gaza border,&#xD;
           Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increasing the capacity of local institutions to treat toddlers and families at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;

      This project's aim is to identify psychological distress, build resilience among toddlers and&#xD;
      their parents, and treat post traumatic stress disorder. The project components have&#xD;
      consisted of a) using resilience-building interventions geared toward helping parents and&#xD;
      daycare teachers deal with the stress engendered by the repeated emergency situations b)&#xD;
      screening toddlers (24-48 months) for post traumatic distress utilizing new validated&#xD;
      instruments c) referring highly symptomatic children and parents to dyadic treatment which&#xD;
      focuses on observing the dynamics and interaction between parents and children before&#xD;
      treatment intervention with the (more typically) mother/child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research into childhood trauma has clearly demonstrated that infants and children impacted by&#xD;
      terrorism or with mothers who have suffered traumatic experiences are at very high risk for a&#xD;
      multitude of long-term emotional disorders. Mothers suffering the effects of Post Traumatic&#xD;
      Stress Disorders (PTSD) have difficulty providing the emotional holding environment and&#xD;
      relational foundation necessary for healthy attachment and bonding. An anxious or traumatized&#xD;
      mother will have difficulty soothing her child if she herself is in a state of emotional and&#xD;
      physical hyper-arousal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is aimed at identifying children who are suffering from posttraumatic distress&#xD;
      and increasing capacity to provide treatment for them and for their caretakers. The project&#xD;
      will be implemented in Sderot. Professional staff (teachers, nurses and aides) will be&#xD;
      trained to conduct a systematic short screening in order to identify families with babies,&#xD;
      toddlers and young children suffering from, or at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elements of the project will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Screening of young children and implementation of treatment The screening will consist of&#xD;
      a short interviews with parents conducted by trained professional about exposure to traumatic&#xD;
      events and resulting post-traumatic specific symptoms among the toddlers and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Workshops for parents, teachers, nurses The knowledge and skills of preschool teachers and&#xD;
      nurses working in all our projects sights as well as parents will be increased by providing&#xD;
      training regarding the impact of war related trauma on preschool children. Workshops will&#xD;
      better equip teachers, nurses and parents with knowledge about the emotional impact of trauma&#xD;
      on young children and will increase the skills to help preschool children contain emotional&#xD;
      distress as well as to help them in coping with the emotional consequences of trauma&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Treatment Interventions Dyadic treatment involving parents and children is aimed at&#xD;
      increasing the attunement of parents to their toddlers and their needs in times of crises.&#xD;
      Local practitioners in Sderot will received specialized training in this methodology by a&#xD;
      child trauma specialist from Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. The effectiveness of the&#xD;
      dyadic treatment will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Evaluation of treatment Evaluation of treatment efficacy (dyadic treatment) will be&#xD;
      assessed by pre and post interviews that will be conducted by trained professionals with all&#xD;
      parents participating in the dyadic treatments in each of the three cities.&#xD;
