  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a four-center open-label study designed to determine activity of Velcade in&#xD;
      Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) patients. A total of 28 subjects will be enrolled. The&#xD;
      patients will be registered to GIMEMA Data Center before therapy starts and after inclusion&#xD;
      criteria verification.&#xD;

      The Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are an heterogeneous group of clonal disorders of the&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis leading to peripheral&#xD;
      cytopenias, and variable risk of progression to more advanced disease and/or transformation&#xD;
      to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The disease affects predominantly elderly individuals&#xD;
      (median age 69 years); the overall incidence is about 4 per 100,000 individuals but this&#xD;
      rises to &gt; 30 per 100,000 in the over 70 year age population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy for MDS has included hematopoietic growth factors (in primis EPO, in combination or&#xD;
      not with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor- G-CSF or granulocyte-colony stimulating&#xD;
      factor-GM-CSF), differentiating agents, immunotherapy, low dose chemotherapy strategies,&#xD;
      AML-like induction regimens, traditional cytotoxic agents, and hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) strategies. With the exception of HSCT, which can result in long-term&#xD;
      survival in 23% to 50% of patients (Ref. 10) therapy for MDS has not consistently shown a&#xD;
      survival advantage, and also modest results have been obtained in an attempt to improve&#xD;
      anemia and/or the other cytopenias, and to decrease the number of red blood cell (RBC)&#xD;
      transfusions. Furthermore, MDS is primarily a disease of older patients who cannot tolerate&#xD;
      aggressive therapy and therefore cannot receive HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No therapy has thus been considered standard for MDS, and supportive therapy, including RBC&#xD;
      transfusions, platelet transfusions and antibiotic therapy has often been focus of care,&#xD;
      especially in the older patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VELCADE™ (bortezomib) for injection is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor developed by&#xD;
      Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (MPI) as a novel agent to treat human malignancies. VELCADE&#xD;
      is currently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have&#xD;
      received at least 2 prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on the last&#xD;
      therapy. VELCADE is a modified dipeptidyl boronic acid derived from leucine and&#xD;
      phenylalanine; its chemical name is N pyrazinecarbonyl L phenylalanine L leucine boronic acid&#xD;
      and has a molecular weight of 384.25 daltons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from non clinical and clinical studies conducted to date support the development of&#xD;
      Velcade for the treatment of human malignancies.&#xD;
