      The purpose of the study is to determinate the free-progression interval in patients with&#xD;
      surgically resected locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck treated with&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of erlotinib, radiation therapy and cisplatin,&#xD;
      previously established in a safety trial.&#xD;

      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 cohorts of 3-6 patients, patients will received:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Erlotinib 100-150 mg/day po for 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cisplatin 30-40 mg/m2 iv weekly for 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation therapy 63 Gy, five days a week, for 7 weeks. Cohort 1: 3 patients will be&#xD;
           included in cohort 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no DLT has been recorded in the first three patients during the 7-weeks treatment, the&#xD;
      dose level of erlotinib will be escalated to 150 mg and enrollment of cohort 2 will be&#xD;
      initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If DLT has been recorded in one out of the first three patients during the during the 7-weeks&#xD;
      treatment, then the first cohort will be expanded to 6 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no further DLT has been recorded in patients 4 to 6 of cohort 1 during the 7-weeks&#xD;
           treatment cycle, the dose level of erlotinib will be escalated to 150 mg and enrollment&#xD;
           of cohort 2 will be initiated, after patient 6 has completed the 7-weeks treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If DLT has been recorded in one out of the patients 4 to 6 of cohort 1 during the&#xD;
           7-weeks treatment cycle, the dose level of erlotinib will be escalated to 150 mg and&#xD;
           enrollment of cohort 2 will be initiated, after patient 6 has completed the 7-weeks&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If DLT has been recorded in 2 patients of the patients 4 to 6 of cohort 1, during the&#xD;
           during the 7-weeks treatment, then the trial will be terminated and this dose level will&#xD;
           be considered as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If DLT has been recorded in 2 patients of the first three patients during the during the&#xD;
      7-weeks treatment, then the trial will be terminated and this dose level will be considered&#xD;
      as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If DLT has been recorded in one out of the first three patients or 1-2 of the 6 patients in&#xD;
      cohort 1, 3 patients will be included in cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no DLT has been recorded in the first three patients during the 7-weeks treatment, the&#xD;
      dose level of cisplatin will be escalated to 40 mg/m2 and enrollment of cohort 3 will be&#xD;
      initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If DLT has been recorded in one out of the first three patients during the during the 7-weeks&#xD;
      treatment, then the second cohort will be expanded to 6 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no further DLT has been recorded in patients 4 to 6 of cohort 2 during the 7-weeks&#xD;
           treatment cycle, the dose level of cisplatin will be escalated to 40 mg/m2 and&#xD;
           enrollment of cohort 3 will be initiated, after patient 6 has completed the 7-weeks&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If DLT has been recorded in one out of the patients 4 to 6 of cohort 2 during the&#xD;
           7-weeks treatment cycle, the dose level of cisplatin will be escalated to 40 mg/m2 and&#xD;
           enrollment of cohort 3 will be initiated, after patient 6 has completed the 7-weeks&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If DLT has been recorded in 2 patients of the patients 4 to 6 of cohort 2 during the&#xD;
           during the 7-weeks treatment, then the trial will be terminated and this dose level will&#xD;
           be considered as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If DLT has been recorded in 2 patients of the first three patients of cohort 2 during the&#xD;
      during the 7-weeks treatment, then the trial will be terminated and this dose level will be&#xD;
      considered as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If DLT has been recorded in one out of the first three patients or 1-2 of the 6 patients in&#xD;
      cohort 2, 3 patients will be included in cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no DLT has been recorded in the first three patients during the 7-weeks treatment, then&#xD;
      the Maximum Tolerated Dose has not been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If DLT has been recorded in one out of the first three patients during the during the 7-weeks&#xD;
      treatment, then the third cohort will be expanded to 6 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no further DLT has been recorded in patients 4 to 6 of cohort 3 during the 7-weeks&#xD;
           treatment cycle, then the Maximum Tolerated Dose has not been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
