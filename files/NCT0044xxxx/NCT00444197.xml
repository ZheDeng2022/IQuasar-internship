      Study Aims: 1) Assess the receptiveness of youth and families to injury prevention&#xD;
      interventions initiated from the emergency department; 2) In a sample of high risk youth&#xD;
      presenting to the ED with interpersonal assault injuries, determine the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      home-based family intervention with community linkage compared to a control group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The leading causes of death among U.S. children and adolescents are due to injuries. In the&#xD;
      US, homicide is the third leading cause of death for 10-14 year olds and second leading cause&#xD;
      of death for those 15-19 years. For African-Americans, homicide is the leading cause of death&#xD;
      for males and females ages 15-34. Findings from our city-wide surveillance of adolescent&#xD;
      injuries have found that for every death due to injury in youth, there were 8&#xD;
      hospitalizations and 102 ED visits. Non-fatal injuries represent significant morbidity and&#xD;
      may be a sentinel event and opportunity for prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assault-injured patients age 9-15 and their families seen in the ED or hospitalized will be&#xD;
      recruited into the study. Whenever possible, families will be recruited while they are still&#xD;
      in the hospital, others will be contacted by phone. We will randomize families to an&#xD;
      intervention group consisting of home visits involving a four session parental monitoring&#xD;
      curriculum for parents and a 6-8 session mentoring and problem solving curriculum for youth&#xD;
      occurring over 2-6 months. Both intervention and control groups will receive community&#xD;
      referrals to needed services. Interview assessments of parents and youth will occur in person&#xD;
      at baseline and 6 months, and by phone at 12 and 18 months after recruitment. Assessments&#xD;
      will include face to face and Walkman questioning, and phone questioning with DigitGrabber&#xD;
      touch tone response. The parent and youth assessments will include detail on cause of injury,&#xD;
      past experience risk factors, protective factors, perceived risk and self-efficacy. Medical&#xD;
      chart abstraction will be performed and aggregate data will be obtained from the police&#xD;
      department about the number of youth in the intervention and control groups that have had&#xD;
      contact with the police. We intend to recruit up to 400 families over 2-3 years in order to&#xD;
      achieve follow-up with at least 198 families. Human Subjects: Male and female adolescents&#xD;
      9-15 years of age and their parents who are residents of the Washington Metropolitan area&#xD;
      will be eligible for participation. Written parental consent and youth assent will be&#xD;
      obtained. There are no physical risks. Potential risks include unintentional uses of the&#xD;
      information gathered including disclosure of information that may be potentially legally&#xD;
      incriminating. All efforts will be made to protect participant confidentiality. If&#xD;
      information is revealed that places someone in immediate danger, disclosure may be necessary&#xD;
      which is explained in the consent form. There are potential benefits including facilitated&#xD;
      referral for therapeutic community-based intervention, access to an intervention of&#xD;
      demonstrated effectiveness without cost, and cash incentives. In addition, they will&#xD;
      contribute to knowledge about youth injury in the community.&#xD;
