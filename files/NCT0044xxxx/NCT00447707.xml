    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial of Positive Choice, an interactive multimedia computer&#xD;
      program, to determine whether it can detect and reduce risky behaviors among HIV-positive&#xD;
      adults. The behaviors of interest are: unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse, illicit drug&#xD;
      use, risky alcohol drinking, and failure to disclose HIV status to sex partners. The Positive&#xD;
      Choice program is integrated into the routine operations of outpatient HIV clinics, where&#xD;
      participating patients complete an in-depth risk assessment (computerized health&#xD;
      questionnaire) before a regularly scheduled medical appointment. Participants assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention arm receive brief, interactive risk-reduction counseling by an actor-portrayed&#xD;
      Video Doctor and an educational worksheet. Their health care provider receives as summary&#xD;
      cueing sheet, alerting them to the patient's risky behavior and readiness to change. Control&#xD;
      participants complete the computerized risk assessment and receive the clinic's usual care.&#xD;
      Three months after a baseline visit, intervention and control group patients are invited back&#xD;
      to complete an additional risk assessment. The intervention group also receives a &quot;booster&quot;&#xD;
      intervention. Six months after baseline, both groups complete a final risk assessment.&#xD;

      A preliminary analysis of baseline data was conducted in January 2006, which indicated that&#xD;
      the Positive Choice intervention achieved significant reductions in drug use. These findings&#xD;
      were reported in a poster presentation at the XVI International AIDS Conference in Toronto,&#xD;
      Canada, in August 2006. A final analysis of outcomes data was conducted in fall 2006&#xD;
      (September - December). Aggregate results from all five study sites are summarized below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We found a high prevalence of risky behaviors in our sample (497/918, or 54%) and achieved&#xD;
      high retention for follow-up in both groups (&gt;80%). We found significant elimination of any&#xD;
      drug use in the intervention group at both follow-ups. Among all participants who reported&#xD;
      drug use at baseline, 66% of intervention participants continued their drug use at 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up compared to 85% of control participants (OR 0.356, p&lt;0.01). At 6-month follow-up,&#xD;
      59% of intervention participants continued their drug use compared to 88% of the control&#xD;
      group (&lt;0.001). Among participants who reported methamphetamine use at baseline, 58%&#xD;
      continued their methamphetamine use at 3-month follow-up compared to 83% of control&#xD;
      participants (OR 0.285, p=0.02). At 6-month follow-up, 53% of intervention participants&#xD;
      continued their methamphetamine use compared to 73% of the control group (OR 0.344, p=0.03).&#xD;
      We also found significantly less unprotected sex with casual partners by intervention&#xD;
      participants at 3-month follow up (69% vs. 87%, OR 0.313, p=0.04), and fewer intervention&#xD;
      participants who exceeded the recommended number of drinks per week at 3-months (53% vs. 78%,&#xD;
      OR 0.310, p=0.02) Our findings indicate that the Positive Choice program was effective at&#xD;
      reducing important behavioral risks among HIV-positive adults in care. Positive Choice is an&#xD;
      appropriate and effective adjunct to routine medical care for HIV-positive adults.&#xD;
