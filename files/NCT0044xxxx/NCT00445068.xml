    <description>The response (complete response (CR) / partial response (PR)) rate as per Bladé criteria was assessed by the investigator. Response to treatment was evaluated in participants with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least two prior lines of therapy and whose disease was refractory to the most recent line of therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From Start of the Study up to 57 Weeks approximately.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria (Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR).&#xD;
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From Start of the Study up to 57 Weeks approximately.</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit rate is defined by the percentage of participants achieving either a confirmed tumor response or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks. Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is a system for measuring tumor shrinkage or progression in terms of the longest dimensions of the tumor on imaging scans such as computerized tomography (CT). A &quot;partial response&quot; requires a decrease of 30% or more, &quot;Progression&quot; requires an increase of at least 20%, and &quot;Stable disease&quot; falls in between these two. All responses have a repeat assessment to confirm the response</description>

&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have received at least two prior lines of therapy and be refractory to&#xD;
             the most recent line of therapy according to the following definitions: Refractory to&#xD;

             60 - 100 days after the completion of the most recent line of therapy. This includes&#xD;
             the development of disease progression during maintenance or consolidation therapy&#xD;
             with high dose glucocorticoids, or any other specific MM therapy Sixty days is counted&#xD;
             from the point in time when the first response assessment is performed after&#xD;
             completion of the last line of therapy. At a maximum, disease progression should be&#xD;
             documented within 100 days after the last day of the last dose of any anti-MM therapy,&#xD;
