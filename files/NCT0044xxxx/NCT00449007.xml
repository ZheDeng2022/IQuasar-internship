    <textblock>
      We will study patients with a current major depressive episode, comorbid alcoholism and a&#xD;
      history of a past suicide attempt. All subjects with alcohol dependence will be evaluated for&#xD;
      risk of alcohol withdrawal prior to randomization. The study will provide six months of&#xD;
      antidepressant pharmacotherapy as well as psychotherapy focused on alcohol relapse&#xD;
      prevention. Patients will also be encouraged to attend daily Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.&#xD;
      The outcome measures will be: 1) occurrence of suicide events; 2) reduction of suicidal&#xD;
      ideation; 3) reduction in neuropsychological measures of impulsivity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a significant public health problem. Depression, alcoholism (abuse or dependence),&#xD;
      and a prior suicide attempt are risk factors for suicide. However, little information exists&#xD;
      to guide clinicians in the choice of antidepressant medication for patients with comorbid&#xD;
      major depression and alcoholism who are at risk for suicidal acts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) may reduce impulsive&#xD;
      aggression, and therefore lower the risk for suicidal behavior. We will test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that fluoxetine, an SSRI, will be associated with fewer suicide events (defined as suicidal&#xD;
      acts or increases in suicidal ideation necessitating a change in management), decreased&#xD;
      suicidal ideation and decreases in neuropsychological measures of impulsivity compared to&#xD;
      bupropion. The non-serotonergic drug, bupropion will improve energy and hopelessness. We&#xD;
      expect the two drugs to be equally efficacious in reducing global depression severity. We&#xD;
      will compare fluoxetine with bupropion in a 6-month randomized, controlled study of major&#xD;
      depressive disorder and comorbid alcoholism in patients who have a prior history of suicide&#xD;
      attempt. Patients requiring alcohol detoxification will be excluded. Patients will also&#xD;
      receive weekly psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study 42 subjects with a current major depressive episode, comorbid alcoholism and a&#xD;
      history of a past suicide attempt (21 subjects per year) in a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      controlled trial, stratified by alcoholism type (1 vs 2). All subjects with alcohol&#xD;
      dependence will be evaluated for risk of alcohol withdrawal prior to randomization. We will&#xD;
      include patients who have suicidal ideation. However, patients with a suicidal plan or intent&#xD;
      will only be enrolled as inpatients if the research team and the independent treatment team&#xD;
      on the inpatient research unit agree that this is clinically reasonable. For example, if ECT&#xD;
      or antipsychotics are indicated, the patient will not be enrolled. The study will provide six&#xD;
      months of antidepressant pharmacotherapy as well as psychotherapy focused on alcohol relapse&#xD;
      prevention. Patients will also be encouraged to attend daily Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.&#xD;
      The outcome measures will be: 1) occurrence of suicide events; 2) reduction of suicidal&#xD;
      ideation; 3) reduction in neuropsychological measures of impulsivity.&#xD;

          <title>Occurrence of Suicide Events Either a Suicide Death, a Suicide Attempt, or Suicidal Ideation Severe Enough to Warrant a Medical Intervention</title>
          <description>patients have either a suicide death, a suicide attempt, or suicidal ideation severe enough to warrant a medical intervention. this is assessed using the Columbia Suicide History Form and a consensus conference rules on whether the event meets criteria or not. Medical interventions can include hospitalization, a change in medication (adding adjunctive meds) or an increase in frequency of visits or other methods to monitor the patient.&#xD;
The range is 0 and up and denotes the number of suicide events (not the number of participants and not the number of suicide attempts). Higher score is worse and predicts future suicidal behavior</description>
