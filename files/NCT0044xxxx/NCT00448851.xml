    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the effect of inhaled dust mite&#xD;
      allergen extract on airway responses in allergic individuals with mild asthma. Information&#xD;
      learned from this study will be used to identify a safe dose range of D Farinae extract for&#xD;
      use in inhalation challenge studies. This study will also help determine how inhalation of&#xD;
      the allergen affects mucociliary clearance (MCC) which is a measure of how quickly mucus&#xD;
      clears from the airway.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a non-blinded study of the effect of inhaled house dust mite (D Farinae)&#xD;
      allergen extract on airway responses, with the principal endpoint being a decrease in FEV1 of&#xD;
      15% within 10 minutes after inhalation of one of a sequence of doses of allergen compared&#xD;
      with measurements obtained immediately prior to challenge. These doses will be delivered as 5&#xD;
      inhalations of allergen at concentrations of 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16, 32, 64, 125,&#xD;
      250, 500, 1000, and 2000 AU/mL. Allergen challenge often induces an immediate and late phase&#xD;
      decrease in lung function. The immediate phase that occurs within 10 minutes, often self&#xD;
      resolves and is associated with release of histamine from airway mast cells, while the late&#xD;
      phase response often occurs 2 to 8 hours later and is associated with increased airway&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the subject's baseline visit occurring at least 2 days prior to allergen challenge, we&#xD;
      will measure mucociliary clearance (MCC) of inhaled, radiolabeled particles by gamma&#xD;
      scintigraphy. The subject will return 24 hours later for a follow-up scan and a sputum sample&#xD;
      will also be collected. At 4 hours post allergen challenge, we will again measure MCC as an&#xD;
      exploratory endpoint. It is expected that mucociliary clearance will be depressed as part of&#xD;
      a late phase reaction to allergen challenge. Twenty-four hours after allergen challenge,&#xD;
      induced sputum will be obtained and compared with the sputum sample obtained at the baseline&#xD;
      visit. Exploratory endpoints of interest from examination of induced sputum will also be&#xD;
      collected after inhaled allergen challenge.&#xD;
