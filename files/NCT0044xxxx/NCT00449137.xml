      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and leucovorin, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Arsenic trioxide may help fluorouracil and leucovorin work better by making tumor&#xD;
      cells more sensitive to the drugs. Giving arsenic trioxide together with fluorouracil and&#xD;
      leucovorin may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of arsenic trioxide&#xD;
      and fluorouracil when given together with leucovorin in treating patients with stage IV&#xD;
      colorectal cancer that has relapsed or not responded to treatment.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and best dose combination of fluorouracil and&#xD;
           arsenic trioxide when given together with leucovorin calcium in patients with relapsed&#xD;
           or refractory stage IV colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if arsenic trioxide down regulates the expression of thymidylate synthase in&#xD;
           tumor and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil and arsenic trioxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5, 8, 11, 15, 18, and 22 and&#xD;
      fluorouracil IV over 24 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 24 hours on days 8, 15, and 22.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of fluorouracil and arsenic trioxide until&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that&#xD;
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are&#xD;
      treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection and fine-needle tumor&#xD;
      aspiration periodically to determine the effects of arsenic trioxide on thymidylate synthase&#xD;
      expression in the tumor and in PBMCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

    <description>The objective of this phase I study is to determine a phase II dose of combination of 5-FU and ATO that can be safely used for the treatment of 5-FU resistant colon cancer. Following the dose escalation/de-escalation procedure described in section 4.2, the recommended phase II dose of the combination 5-FU with ATO will be established as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the highest dose level combination at which &lt;=1 out of 6 patients experiencing DLT.</description>

Intra-venous (IV) infusion of ATO (mg/kg body weight) over 1-4 hours will be administered for 5 consecutive days (day 1 to day 5) during the first week, twice a week on weeks 2 and 3 (days 8, 11, 15, and 18), and only one day (day 22) of week 4. Treatment will continue for a maximum of 8 cycles, provided that the patient tolerates treatment and there is evidence of clinical benefit.</description>
