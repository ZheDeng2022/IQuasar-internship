  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has an open-label, randomized, crossover design, in which each subject will receive&#xD;
      mannitol powder for inhalation using a dry powder inhaler with and without premedication with&#xD;
      a bronchodilator, mannitol powder for inhalation in capsules administered orally, and&#xD;
      mannitol in a commercial formulation designed for intravenous use.&#xD;
