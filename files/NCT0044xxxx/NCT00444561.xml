      This exploratory study is designed to evaluate various pharmacodynamic effects of&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) infused or injected pramlintide in obese, nondiabetic male and&#xD;
      postmenopausal female (not on hormone replacement therapy) subjects. The study will also&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of pramlintide administered by SC infusion or injection.&#xD;

    <description>Pramlintide acetate (AC137) injection is a clear, colorless, sterile solution for SC administration. It consists of pramlintide in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 43 mg/mL mannitol as an osmolality modifier and 2.25 mg/mL metacresol as a preservative. The concentration of pramlintide injection to be used in this study is 0.6 mg/mL.</description>
