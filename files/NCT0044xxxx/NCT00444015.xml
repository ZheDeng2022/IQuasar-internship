      This is a single site phase I dose escalation trial of the epidermal growth factor receptor&#xD;
      inhibitor Erlotinib with the SRC tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dasatinib in patients with&#xD;
      previously treated advanced stage (Stage IIIB/IV disease) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
      The treatment regimen consists of Erlotinib tablets starting Day 1 and Dasatinib tablets&#xD;
      starting Day 9 for a 28-day cycle. If there are no Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), dose&#xD;
      escalation continues. The recommended phase II dose for this combined treatment will be&#xD;
      defined and patients will be treated at the recommended phase II dose to confirm&#xD;
      tolerability.&#xD;

      This is a single site Phase I dose escalation trial of the epidermal growth factor receptor&#xD;
      inhibitor Erlotinib with the SRC tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dasatinib in patients with&#xD;
      previously treated advanced stage (Stage IIIB/IV disease) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
      The screening evaluation will consist of a medical history including dates/description of&#xD;
      your initial NSCLC diagnosis and documentation of any previous treatment. There will also be&#xD;
      a physical examination including vital signs, height, weight, Eastern Cooperative Oncology&#xD;
      Group (ECOG)performance status, blood draws for Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Complete&#xD;
      Metabolic Panel (CMP) tests, neurological examination, a pregnancy test for female patients&#xD;
      of childbearing potential, and (if applicable) any observable tumor measurements all within&#xD;
      14 days before study enrollment. A screening Electrocardiogram (EKG) as well as clinical&#xD;
      testing to evaluate all known sites of malignant lesions, including Computed Tomography (CTs)&#xD;
      of the chest and upper abdomen, the adrenal glands; ultrasound; or radionuclide scans of the&#xD;
      bones; and/or other radiographic studies should be performed within 30 days prior to&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment regimen consists of Erlotinib tablets starting Day 1 and Dasatinib tablets&#xD;
      starting Day 9 for a 28-day cycle. If there are no DLTs, dose escalation continues. Patients&#xD;
      continuing on therapy past two cycles will be seen by the treating physician every 4 weeks&#xD;
      and will have complete History and Physical (H&amp;P), CBC, and CMP. Tumor measurement and&#xD;
      response assessment will occur every 6-8 weeks. Dasatinib and Erlotinib will be continued&#xD;
      until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or patient request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended phase II dose for this combined treatment will be defined and patients will&#xD;
      be treated at the recommended phase II dose to confirm tolerability.&#xD;
