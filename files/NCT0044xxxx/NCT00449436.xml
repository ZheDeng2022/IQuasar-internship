  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current goal of antiretroviral therapy is to use a potent regimen that will suppress&#xD;
      plasma viral load and maintain this suppression as long as possible. However, for most&#xD;
      patients treated with such potent regimen, several problems can limit their long term&#xD;
      effectiveness and contribute to incomplete viral suppression. These problems include poor&#xD;
      tolerability, metabolic toxic effects. In order to avoid common problems as toxicity it might&#xD;
      be interested to simplify treatment with fewer toxicity, lower pill burden. In this study we&#xD;
      will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a simplification treatment with TRIZIVIR in long&#xD;
      term after a Boosted PI or NNRTI containing regimen as first line therapy.&#xD;
