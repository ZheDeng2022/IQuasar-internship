    <textblock>
      With this study the investigators will test, in a randomised clinical trial (RCT), the&#xD;
      efficacy of a behavioral dietary adherence enhancement intervention paired with PDA-based&#xD;
      dietary self-monitoring for controlling sodium intake. Seventy hemodialysis patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from units in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Participants will be randomized to a&#xD;
      4-month PDA-based dietary counseling intervention or to a 4-month attention control.&#xD;
      Potential participants will be stratified by whether or not they have diabetes. Data on&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes will be obtained at baseline and four months. Primary&#xD;
      dependent variables are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. adherence to dietary sodium targets as assessed from 3-day food recalls,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. average monthly interdialytic weight gain, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. average pulse pressure. Secondary dependent variables are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. adherence to dietary targets for calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats, saturated fats,&#xD;
           potassium, and phosphorus, as assessed from 3-day food recalls, (5) serum potassium and&#xD;
           phosphorus levels determined on a monthly basis, and (6) nutritional status as&#xD;
           determined from serum albumin. Laboratory data, interdialytic weight gain, and blood&#xD;
           pressure data will be obtained per dialysis center routine and abstracted from the&#xD;
           medical record. Three-day food recalls will be obtained at baseline, 4 and 8 months and&#xD;
           analyzed using the Nutrient Data System.&#xD;
