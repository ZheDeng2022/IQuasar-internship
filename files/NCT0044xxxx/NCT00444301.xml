  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure, a chronic illness afflicting 5 million persons in the United States is known&#xD;
      to cause shortness of breath and fatigue, yet at least half of persons with heart failure&#xD;
      also report the presence of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of pain for these persons is not clear. PAIN-HF (Pain Assessment, Incidence &amp;&#xD;
      Nature in Heart Failure), conducted through the Palliative Care-Heart Failure Education And&#xD;
      Research Trials (PC-HEART) collaborative will identify the prevalence of pain, its location,&#xD;
      severity and impact on activities and the possible causes of pain in persons living with&#xD;
      heart failure. The study will also try to understand relationships between other problems and&#xD;
      pain, as well as what treatments are given to reduce pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding sources of pain and its characteristics is the first step in helping health&#xD;
      care providers better manage pain and related problems in persons with heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited via physicians and nurses providing their care in clinical sites&#xD;
      who are members of PC-HEART. PC-HEART is a volunteer collaborative with&#xD;
      clinician-investigators at 60 sites nationally that include hospice organizations and heart&#xD;
      failure providers in academic, Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) and community settings.&#xD;
      Our goal will be to enroll 400 patients with 135 in hospice care and 265 in outpatient&#xD;
      settings (a mix of HMO, community practice, VA, and academic centers) who are members of the&#xD;
      Palliative Care- Heart Failure Education And Research Trials (PC-HEART) collaborative. We&#xD;
      will strive for broad representation of patients living in the community with about one-third&#xD;
      African American patients (who often present for initial treatment with advanced heart&#xD;
      failure) and at least one-half elderly (who have high prevalence of both pain and heart&#xD;
      failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use standardized tools to survey patients, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain &amp; other symptoms (Assessed at enrollment and one-two weeks later):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale- HF (MSAS-HF) Short-form McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ)&#xD;
      Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart-failure specific measures (Assessed at Enrollment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psycho-social situation &amp; cognitive function (Assessed at Enrollment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians Health Questionnaire depression screen (PHQ-9) Mini-cog Social functioning:&#xD;
      ENRICHD Social Support Inventory (ESSI) , The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) will&#xD;
      be collected on 1/2 of subjects Clinical Data (from medical record) Patient's medical&#xD;
      condition: Charleson Comorbidity Scale, prior diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus, Cancer, Chronic&#xD;
      lung disease, Coronary Artery Disease, Cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known painful conditions (osteoarthritis, chronic back pain, CAD with angina, neuropathy,&#xD;
      others) Physical examination: Jugular Venous Pressure (as per NIH trial standards: base of&#xD;
      neck, ½ way up, jaw level), edema (+1 (0-1/4&quot; depression), +2 (1/4-1/2&quot;), +3 (1/2-1&quot;), +4&#xD;
      (&gt;1&quot;)), Blood pressure, Respiratory rate, Heart rate &amp; rhythm Echocardiogram data: Date of&#xD;
      most recent Echocardiogram, LVEF, LVDD, LA dimension, presence of valvular disease &amp; measure&#xD;
      of severity (for example, if aortic stenosis then valve area, if mitral regurgitation then&#xD;
      1+-4+) Laboratory data: BUN, CR, Na+, HgB, BNP, hemoglobin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic Data Age, Sex, Race &amp; ethnic identification, Marital Status, Living situation&#xD;
      (alone, with family, with other person), employment status (employed, self-employed, retired,&#xD;
      unemployed due to disability), highest level of education, religious affiliation, annual&#xD;
      household income, insurance (none, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, Kaiser, other&#xD;
      Health Maintenance Organization, private fee for service).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications &amp; Treatment (Assessed at Enrollment and 1-2 weeks later) Heart Failure&#xD;
      medications: ACEI, ARB, β-blocker, digoxin, spironolactone, eplerenone, loop diuretics,&#xD;
      nesiritide, inotropes, warfarin Analgesics: NSAIDs, Cox-2 inhibitors, Aspirin, Acetaminophen,&#xD;
      Tramadol, Opioids Antidepressants: SSRI, Tricyclics, Psychostimulants, other Topical agents:&#xD;
      acetylsalicylate acid creams, capsaicin Physical therapy, cold, heat, other modalities&#xD;
      Statistical Evaluation We will report frequencies of pain in total, frequencies of levels of&#xD;
      severity &amp; interference in activities of pain, by occasional versus frequent or constant&#xD;
      pain, and by location with descriptive statistics. To the extent the etiology of pain is&#xD;
      identified this will be reported with descriptive statistics. Pearson product-moment&#xD;
      correlation coefficients, t-test and frequency statistics (Chi-square and Fisher's Exact&#xD;
      test) will be used to evaluate associations between pain presence, severity and type and&#xD;
      demographic and clinical variables. If possible, comparison will be made between patients&#xD;
      without pain and those with pain using chi-square tests and t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multivariate analysis of variance will be used to assess relationship between pain and&#xD;
      measures of heart failure severity, social support, depression and symptom distress other&#xD;
      than pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in Pain measures will be assessed between enrollment and the second assessment&#xD;
      1-2 weeks later, and changes will be correlated with changes in treatment for pain.&#xD;
      Geographic locations of pain will be mapped using the body diagram on the BPI to identify&#xD;
      areas of greatest frequency.&#xD;
