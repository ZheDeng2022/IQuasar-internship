      The purpose of this study is to determine if combination Erlotinib, Cisplatin/Carboplatin,&#xD;
      and Paclitaxel are effective first line treatment for metastatic, recurrent and persistent&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that Erlotinib fails to enhance the effects of chemotherapy on response and&#xD;
      survival because of Erlotinib's cytostatic effect, this results in a slowing down of the cell&#xD;
      cycle, this in turn results in a hampering of the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy leading to&#xD;
      a lack of synergism with the combination. We propose that a sequential approach to the&#xD;
      combination allows each drug to be used in its optimum time, by sequencing the Erlotinib,&#xD;
      giving it 24 hours after chemotherapy we allow the chemotherapy to exert its effect with&#xD;
      cells actively in cell cycle, but delivering the Erlotinib at a time when cells are trying to&#xD;
      return to cell cycle hence slowing the growth rate of the tumor cell population. By&#xD;
      withdrawing the Erlotinib about 4 days prior to the next chemotherapy cycle, we allow the&#xD;
      cells to go back into cell cycle and therefore become susceptible to chemotherapy again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with intravenous paclitaxel over 3 hours followed by intravenous&#xD;
      cisplatin/carboplatin on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle. Patients will be treated with Erlotinib&#xD;
      at a loading dose of 300mg on Day 2 followed by 150 mg orally daily from Days 3-17 of each&#xD;
      cycle of paclitaxel and cisplatin/carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess the response rate of combination of&#xD;
      erlotinib, cisplatin/carboplatin and paclitaxel in the first line treatment setting of&#xD;
      metastatic, recurrent and persistent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to assess toxicity, median survival, and progression free survival.&#xD;
