&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming&#xD;
                  pregnant); or,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Child-bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at&#xD;
                  screen, and employs one of the following acceptable measures of contraception:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of&#xD;
                       the investigational product, throughout the study, and for a time interval&#xD;
                       after completion or premature discontinuation from the study to account for&#xD;
                       elimination of the investigational drug (a minimum of 24 hrs); subjects&#xD;
                       utilizing this method must agree to use an alternate method of contraception&#xD;
                       if they should become sexually active and will be queried on whether they&#xD;
                       have been abstinent in the preceding 2 weeks when they present to the clinic&#xD;
                       for randomized treatment; or,&#xD;
&#xD;

                       expected failure rate is less than 1% per year (not all IUDs meet this&#xD;
                       criterion); or,&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Any other method with published data showing that the lowest expected&#xD;
                       failure rate for that method is less than 1% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Barrier method only if used in combination with any of the above acceptable&#xD;
                       methods&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Subject has a history of non-migraine (i.e., tension-type, sinus, etc.) headache&#xD;
