      The primary hypothesis is that titration of ACE inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers&#xD;
      (ARBs)to reduce urine protein excretion to &lt; 500 mg per day in Fabry Patients receiving&#xD;
      agalsidase beta therapy at 1 mg/kg every two weeks will slow the progression rate of decline&#xD;
      of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared to case controls drawn from the&#xD;
      Genzyme-sponsored Phase III extension study (GFR 60 to 125 ml/min/1.73 m², urine protein &gt; 1&#xD;
      gram/day) or the Phase IV study (GFR 20 to 60 ml/min/1.73 m², urine protein &gt; 0.5 gram/day).&#xD;
      After a 3 month initial Evaluation Phase, the patients will be followed during a 24 month&#xD;
      Observation Phase. FAACET is an open label, prospective observational study. The primary&#xD;
      objective is reduction of first morning urine protein/creatinine ratio to &lt; 0.5 gram/gram.&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the regression slope of MDRD GFR with time in years&#xD;

      TITLE: FABRAZYME® + ARBS + ACE INHIBITOR TREATMENT (FAACET) STUDY Multi-center, Open-label&#xD;
      Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Control of Proteinuria with Angiotensin Receptors&#xD;
      Blockers (ARBs) and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) in Patients with Fabry&#xD;
      Disease Who Are Receiving Fabrazyme®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL NO. UAB NEPHROLOGY 001-2006 SPONSOR: University of Alabama at Birmingham,&#xD;
      Birmingham, AL 35294 NAME OF FINISHED PRODUCTS: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors,&#xD;
      Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, Fabrazyme® INVESTIGATOR/STUDY CENTERS: Fourteen (14) study&#xD;
      sites worldwide PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To determine whether decline of GFR can be slowed by&#xD;
      titrating ACEI/ARB anti-proteinuric therapy to target urine protein/creatinine ratio of ≤&#xD;
      0.5, or 50% reduction from baseline, in Fabry patients with significant kidney involvement&#xD;
      (20 ≤ eGFRMDRD ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73 m²), and baseline urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 0.5 (based&#xD;
      on the last value obtained before initiating ACEI/ARB therapy or obtained at screening before&#xD;
      the first Evaluation Visit of the FAACET Study), who are receiving standard of care treatment&#xD;
      for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and Fabry disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether urine protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 0.5, or ≥ 50% reduction from&#xD;
           baseline, can safely be achieved in Fabry patients with ACEI/ARB therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether urine protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 0. 5, or ≥ 50% reduction from&#xD;
           baseline, result in a slower rate of GFR decline compared to patients who cannot achieve&#xD;
           this target.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if GFR decline can be slowed by titrating ACEI/ARB therapy to target urine&#xD;
           protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 0.5, or 50% reduction from baseline, in Fabry patients with&#xD;
           definite kidney involvement (125 ≥ eGFRMDRD ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m²), and baseline urine&#xD;
           protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 1.0 (based on the last value obtained before initiating&#xD;
           ACEI/ARB therapy or obtained at screening before the first Evaluation Visit of the&#xD;
           FAACET Study) who are receiving standard of care treatment for Chronic Kidney Disease&#xD;
           (CKD), and Fabry disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY This will be a multi-center, multinational, open-label study to confirm the&#xD;
      safety and the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and ARBs against proteinuria in patients with&#xD;
      advanced Fabry disease who are receiving Fabrazyme® at 1 mg/kg every other week. Following an&#xD;
      initial 3-month Evaluation Period, during which ACEI/ARB therapy will be titrated to reduce&#xD;
      urinary protein/creatinine ratio to a target of 0.5, or 50% of baseline level, the patients&#xD;
      will be followed for 24 months in an Observation Period with continued monitoring of their&#xD;
      eGFRMDRD and protein excretion every 3 monthly for 24 months. ACEI/ARB therapy will continue&#xD;
      to be titrated to maintain the proteinuria target in the Observation Period. The baseline&#xD;
      urine protein/creatinine ratio is defined as the last value obtained in the individual&#xD;
      patient before they began any ACEI/ARB therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SITES: 40 patients will be enrolled in the FAACET Study at 14 Study Sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient must provide written, informed consent, and be ≥ 19 yrs of age. The patient is&#xD;
      already receiving Fabrazyme® at 1 mg/kg every two weeks at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient has confirmed Fabry disease (plasma αGAL activity of &lt; 1.5 nmol/hr/mL, or leukocyte&#xD;
      αGAL activity of &lt; 4 nmol/hr/mg), or a known mutation compatible with Fabry disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. eGFRMDRD ≥ 20 and ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, and documented baseline urine protein/creatinine&#xD;
           ratio &gt; 0.5, based on the last value obtained before initiating ACEI/ARB therapy or&#xD;
           obtained at screening before the first Evaluation Visit of the FAACET Study; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. eGFRMDRD ≤ 125 ml/min/1.73 m2 and &gt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 with documented baseline urine&#xD;
           protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 1, based on the last value obtained before initiating&#xD;
           ACEI/ARB therapy or obtained at screening before the first Evaluation Visit of the&#xD;
           FAACET Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient has undergone kidney transplantation or is currently on dialysis, or is planning&#xD;
      on receiving a kidney transplant during the first year of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient has diabetic nephropathy or the presence of another, confounding kidney disease&#xD;
      unless there is kidney biopsy confirmation that the patient does not have diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy or another, confounding kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient has a clinically significant organic disease, or other condition that in the&#xD;
      opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in the full extent of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol, including&#xD;
      continuing on Fabrazyme® at 1 mg/kg body weight every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have documented allergies to ACE inhibitors and to ARBs are not eligible to&#xD;
      participate in the FAACET Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is pregnant or intends to become pregnant during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT REGIMEN During the Evaluation Period, the patients will be titrated with ACEI/ARBs&#xD;
      to reduce their first morning urine protein/creatinine ratio to ≤ 0.5, or 50% of the baseline&#xD;
      level. During the Observation Period, the ACEI/ARB therapy will be dose-adjusted, as&#xD;
      tolerated, to maintain their urine protein/creatinine ratio at target level. Patients will&#xD;
      continue to receive Fabrazyme® intravenously every 2 weeks throughout the study. Unless there&#xD;
      is a compelling clinical indication, patients in the FAACET study should avoid all&#xD;
      potentially nephrotoxic agents (e.g., NSAIDs, aminoglycoside antibiotics, X-ray contrast&#xD;
      agents, etc.) STUDY DURATION: 3 month Evaluation Period, followed by 24-month Observation&#xD;
      Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION Efficacy: Change in renal function will be assessed with the eGFRMDRD&#xD;
      for the FAACET patients, and compared to the Phase IV patient population (AGAL008 and&#xD;
      AGAL025) to assess the additional impact of ACEI/ARB therapy on the decline in eGFRMDRD in&#xD;
      patients receiving Fabrazyme® therapy. Patients who every received Fabrazyme for at least 12&#xD;
      months in AGAL008/AGAL025 or Phase III/extension study will be included in the Control&#xD;
      Cohorts: a). if eGFRMDRD ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73 m² and urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 0.5 at&#xD;
      Baseline before initiating treatment with Fabrazyme®, OR b). Baseline eGFRMDRD ≤ 125 and ≥ 60&#xD;
      ml/min/1.73 m², and urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 1.0 at Baseline before initiating&#xD;
      treatment with Fabrazyme®. These patients will be used in analyses for comparison to the&#xD;
      FAACET Study patients based on their characteristics before initiating Fabrazyme®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Safety will be monitored in terms of adverse experiences, vital sign parameters,&#xD;
      physical examinations, laboratory safety parameters, concomitant medications and antibody&#xD;
      formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSMP and DSMB: A Data Safety Monitoring Plan has been developed for the FAACET Study, and the&#xD;
      Steering Committee will assume the responsibilities usually attributed to a Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board. A summary log will be kept of all adverse events reported to the UAB IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS Efficacy: The primary efficacy analysis will be the change in renal&#xD;
      function assessed as eGFRMDRD for the patient group that reaches and maintains their urine&#xD;
      protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 0.5, or ≤ 50% of their baseline, to assess the impact of ACEI/ARB&#xD;
      therapy on decline of eGFRMDRD in patients receiving Fabrazyme® therapy. A secondary efficacy&#xD;
      analysis will be carried out on the change in eGFRMDRD for the patient group that cannot&#xD;
      maintain their urine protein/creatinine ratio ≤ 0.5, or less than 50% of their baseline. The&#xD;
      Phase III/Phase III extension and Phase IV/Phase IV extension patients, who met the Criteria&#xD;
      for evaluation listed above, will serve as the Control Cohorts for comparison to the FAACET&#xD;
      patients in the various analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control Cohort will be defined a priori before FAACET enrollment begins. The age, gender,&#xD;
      baseline eGFRMDRD, systolic blood pressure, and baseline proteinuria, as well as duration of&#xD;
      Fabrazyme® therapy versus the appropriate mixed models with random slopes for individual&#xD;
      patients. The mixed model analyses will be adjusted as needed for the covariates assumed to&#xD;
      be most important in determining the rate of decline in kidney function (i.e. age, gender,&#xD;
      baseline eGFRMDRD, systolic blood pressure, baseline proteinuria, and duration of Fabrazyme®&#xD;
      therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Adverse events and serious adverse events will be summarized by body system and&#xD;
      preferred term using a standardized coding dictionary (MedDRA). The severity and relationship&#xD;
      of treatment to adverse events will be summarized. Clinically significant laboratory values,&#xD;
      and physical exam findings will be summarized. Overall antibody status, including&#xD;
      seroconversion rates, and titer levels will be summarized. Concomitant medications will be&#xD;
      detailed at each study visit.&#xD;
