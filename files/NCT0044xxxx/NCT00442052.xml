      Primary: To compare the gastroprotective effects of a once-daily dose of PA 325 combination&#xD;
      tablet combining 325 mg pH sensitive aspirin and 20 mg immediate release omeprazole versus a&#xD;
      once-daily dose of 325 mg enteric coated aspirin utilizing Lanza scores from endoscopy&#xD;
      findings in normal healthy volunteers.&#xD;

      PA 325 is proposed for the reduction in the risk of aspirin-associated gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      adverse events in patients requiring daily aspirin. This study is designed as a Proof of&#xD;
      Concept study to evaluate the gastroprotective effects, pharmacokinetic profile, and safety&#xD;
      of PA 325 in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
