  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare two different nutritional supplements with respect to&#xD;
      their effect on building muscle, and to determine the factors that control the rate at which&#xD;
      muscle tissue can be produced in subjects with cancer. After three days of receiving all&#xD;
      meals from the Reynolds Institute on Aging in order to stabilize their diet, subjects will&#xD;
      then return to the Institute to perform a single day study, where they will be given one of&#xD;
      two supplements to drink. Blood will be taken from a catheter placed in one of their arms and&#xD;
      three muscle biopsy samples will be taken from a leg. Subjects will have x-ray evidence of&#xD;
      cancer and be 40 years of age or older in order to participate. It is the hypothesis that a&#xD;
      nutritional supplement with a high amount of protein and containing leucine will target the&#xD;
      metabolism problems in cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscle protein is generally diminished in cancer patients, with an effect on outcome.&#xD;
      Research has shown that recurrence in treated patients is directly related to the extent of&#xD;
      muscle loss. The effects of nutritional supplements; however, is still controversial.&#xD;
      Anorexia due to metabolic changes in cancer patients can lead to reduced food intake and&#xD;
      supplementation orally has often failed to show weight gain in these patients. These&#xD;
      observations have led to the conclusion that even though food intake should be increased in&#xD;
      order to gain lean body mass, this is difficult to achieve unless specific metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities are targeted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a comparison of two supplements on muscle protein synthesis. Approximately 40&#xD;
      patients with radiographic evidence of cancer, ages 40 and older will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will require a screening procedure, including a history of medical problems and&#xD;
      a physical exam, which may include blood testing for HIV or hepatitis as well as possibly for&#xD;
      various basic diagnostic parameters. There may also be a urine-based drug screen or pregnancy&#xD;
      test (if female). Participants should be in general good health and not have a variety of&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three days of diet stabilization, during which all meals will come from the&#xD;
      Reynolds Institute of Aging. If subjects cannot comply with the diet, dietary recording will&#xD;
      be substituted. Following these three days, there will be one day of main study activities.&#xD;
      There will be catheters placed in both arms and blood samples will be taken from one of&#xD;
      these. Stable amino acid isotopes will be infused into the bloodstream through the other.&#xD;
      There will be three muscle biopsies taken from the thigh muscle throughout the day. Two doses&#xD;
      of a nutritional supplements will be consumed 20 minutes apart during the main study day.&#xD;
