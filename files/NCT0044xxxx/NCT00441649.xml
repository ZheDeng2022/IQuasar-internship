  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate in treating&#xD;
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children with both attention deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder and Tourette syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder that is characterized by repetitive, involuntary&#xD;
      movements and vocalizations called tics. Many children with Tourette syndrome also have&#xD;
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is one of the most common childhood&#xD;
      mental disorders. Symptoms of ADHD usually include impulsiveness, inattention, and&#xD;
      hyperactivity. ADHD is commonly treated with a stimulant medication, such as methylphenidate.&#xD;
      It is under debate, however, whether using stimulants in children with Tourette syndrome&#xD;
      exacerbates tics associated with the disorder. This study will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of methylphenidate in treating ADHD in children who have both ADHD and Tourette&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this 6-week, double blind study will receive three doses of methylphenidate&#xD;
      over the course of the study. Each dose will be taken twice daily, approximately 3.5 hours&#xD;
      apart, for 2 weeks. Medication will be dispensed at study visits, which will occur once every&#xD;
      2 weeks. At each study visit, participants will take a dose of the medication. About an hour&#xD;
      after ingesting the medication, they will be observed in a classroom setting by study&#xD;
      physicians. Participants will then complete a Continuous Performance Test, which will measure&#xD;
      their voluntary attention levels. The following will be assessed at study visits: ADHD&#xD;
      symptoms; oppositional and aggressive behavior; frequency and severity of tics and obsessive&#xD;
      compulsive disorder symptoms; rebound tic exacerbation; effects of methylphenidate on&#xD;
      tic-related problems with self-esteem, family life, academic and social performance, and&#xD;
      overall tic severity; anxiety and mood symptoms; and adverse drug reactions. Parents and&#xD;
      teachers will also complete assessments of participants' behavior on 2 days of each week for&#xD;
      the duration of the study.&#xD;
