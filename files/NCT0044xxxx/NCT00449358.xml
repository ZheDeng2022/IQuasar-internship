      Correlation between Mohs surgery and microscopic fluorescence photometry in determination of&#xD;

      Background: Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of nonmelanoma skin cancer&#xD;
      worldwide. BCCs are slow-growing, locally invasive tumors that rarely metastasize but can&#xD;
      cause extensive morbidity through local tissue destruction. Recurrence is often the&#xD;
      consequence of incomplete removal of the cancer tissue. Mohs' micrographic surgery is&#xD;
      considered the most effective treatment modality for BCC with a recurrence rate of less than&#xD;
      5 %, however, the technique requires specialized training and is labor-intensive and costly.&#xD;
      Fluorescence imaging by topical application of a tumor-localizing agent such as methyl&#xD;
      5-aminolevulinic acid (MAL), resulting in buildup of photosensitizing porphyrin IX (PpIX)&#xD;
      that can be visualized by Woods' light fluorescence, might serve as a quick and simple&#xD;
      &quot;bed-side&quot; technique for demarcation of BCC tumor borders prior to surgical excision&#xD;
      Objective: To test the reliability of MAL-induced porphyrin fluorescence tumor demarcation by&#xD;
      comparison with the tumor borders determined by Mohs' surgery Methods: Twenty eight patients&#xD;
      with facial BCCs (17 nodular, 3 superficial, 1 morphea type, 3 ulcerated and 4 recurrent&#xD;
      tumors) scheduled for Mohs' surgery were recruited for the study. The night before the&#xD;
      surgical procedure, crusts were gently removed and an approximately 1 mm thick layer of a&#xD;
      cream containing 16 % MAL (MetvixR) was applied to the tumor area as well as to the&#xD;
      surrounding skin and covered by a transparent occlusive dressing. The following morning&#xD;
      (10-17 hours after MetvixR application), the dressing was removed, and the lesion size was&#xD;
      determined with a caliber by measuring the largest perpendicular diameters under natural&#xD;
      (clinical size) and Woods' (fluorescence size) illumination. The patients then underwent the&#xD;
      scheduled Mohs' surgical procedure, and the tumor size (Mohs' size) was determined when&#xD;
      reaching the tumor free margins.&#xD;
