  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with schizophrenia frequently have impairments in attention. These impairments&#xD;
      have been shown to be related to overall functioning. Some research suggests that Olanzapine&#xD;
      may be associated with improvement in various aspects of attention. The primary purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine whether switching from a typical antipsychotic to Olanzapine&#xD;
      improves task engagement. Individuals who taking typical antipsychotics will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either 1) remain on their typical antipsychotic medications, or 2) be switched&#xD;
      from their typical antipsychotic medications to Olanzapine. All participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      in a twice-weekly 20 session cognitive training program that is specifically designed to&#xD;
      target attention deficits and promote active engagement. Improvements in attention will be&#xD;
      compared between individuals who remained on their typical antipsychotic medications and&#xD;
      those that were switched to Olanzapine.&#xD;

      Objectives: Olanzapine (OLZ) has emerged as one of the promising pharmacologic interventions&#xD;
      that not only improves psychotic symptoms but may also target ability to sustain attention on&#xD;
      cognitive tests. Pupillary response, as measured by degree of pupil constriction, and visual&#xD;
      scanning patterns are unique methods of quantifying attention by gauging the level of&#xD;
      psychophysiologic engagement on a visual task. It is reasonable to expect that if a treatment&#xD;
      for attention problems is effective, then this will be reflected in more efficient allocation&#xD;
      of psychophysiologic attentional resources as measured by pupillometry. Primary purpose of&#xD;
      this pilot study is to demonstrate efficacy of switching to OLZ for improving task engagement&#xD;
      in schizophrenia. Secondary objectives are to demonstrate improved attention in response to&#xD;
      OLZ translates to improved attentional allocation strategies and vocational readiness, and&#xD;
      demonstrate efficacy of OLZ as agent that enhances ability to benefit from cognitive&#xD;
      training. The proposed study will examine functional implications of improved attention in&#xD;
      patients taking OLZ, and it will test the hypothesis that mechanism of this functional&#xD;
      improvement is through process of engagement as measured by pupillometry and functional&#xD;
      behavioral measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methodology: This is an industry-sponsored, investigator initiated trial&#xD;
      with 18 patients in an open-label design over 24-month period. Participants will be adult&#xD;
      outpatients (ages 18 to 55) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who&#xD;
      are on any regimen of &quot;typical&quot; antipsychotics. They will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      conditions: 1) Olanzapine Group (OLZ-G). Subjects assigned to the OLZ condition will be&#xD;
      switched to OLZ from their previous medication so OLZ is the only antipsychotic medication&#xD;
      part of their regimen. Following switch to OLZ, subjects will be enrolled in a twice weekly,&#xD;
      20-session cognitive training program that is specifically designed to target attention&#xD;
      deficits and promote active engagement. 2) &quot;Typicals&quot; Group (TYP-G). Subjects assigned to the&#xD;
      &quot;typicals&quot; condition will continue with their medication regimen throughout the course of the&#xD;
      study as they are enrolled in the same cognitive training program. Research questions are:&#xD;
      Compared to participants on any combination of &quot;typical&quot; medications, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      persons with schizophrenia on OLZ will (a) show significantly improved performance on&#xD;
      psychophysiologic measure of task engagement, (b) show greater engagement in cognitive&#xD;
      training, and (c) show greater improvement in attention on vocational task. Primary efficacy&#xD;
      measure will be an ASL H6 Series head-mounted optics pupillometer to measure task engagement&#xD;
      as function of pupil dilation and visual scanning patterns. Secondary efficacy measures will&#xD;
      include computer software specifically developed to assess on-task behavior on computer&#xD;
      exercises, brief neuropsychological test battery, global behavior and symptom inventories,&#xD;
      and functional assessment of treatment motivation.&#xD;
