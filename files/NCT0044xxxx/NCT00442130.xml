  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess the safety and immune activity of a vaccine&#xD;
      made from the participant's own cancer cells, when administered after a reduced intensity&#xD;
      transplant. In recent years, researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have discovered that&#xD;
      vaccines made from a patients's own cancer cells, that have been engineered in the laboratory&#xD;
      to produce a protein called GM-CSF, can be effective in stimulating a powerful immune&#xD;
      response specific to that cancer.&#xD;

      -  This study can be divided into four phases: 1) Screening; 2) Reduced intensity&#xD;
           transplant phase; 3) Vaccinations (cycle 1 and cycle 2:each cycle lasts 7 weeks) and 4)&#xD;
           Vaccine completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Phase: After signing the consent form, participants will be asked to undergo&#xD;
           some screening tests and procedures to find out if they are eligible to participate in&#xD;
           the study. These tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and&#xD;
           may be done even if the patient does not take part in the research study. It is&#xD;
           important to note that if insufficient numbers of the participant's leukemia cells to&#xD;
           generate vaccine were collected on the CLL collection and banking study (DF/HCC study&#xD;
           06-200), then they will not be eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogeneic reduced intensity stem cell transplant phase: The transplant phase of the&#xD;
           study will begin when the participant is admitted to the hospital to receive&#xD;
           chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. The minimum duration of hospitalization for the&#xD;
           procedure is approximately 8 days. Undergoing transplant involves the following&#xD;
           procedures and treatments: Central intravenous catheter; chemotherapy; medications to&#xD;
           prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD); medication to prevent infections; physical&#xD;
           exams; blood tests and bone marrow biopsy and aspirate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccination Phase: Vaccinations will be given in two cycles, of seven weeks each, that&#xD;
           are identical with the exception of when they are administered. Cycle 1 vaccination will&#xD;
           begin approximately one month after the stem cells have been infused, provided there is&#xD;
           no significant evidence of GVHD. Cycle 2 vaccination will be being approximately one&#xD;
           month after discontinuing tacrolimus, provided there is no evidence of severe acute or&#xD;
           chronic GVHD. The vaccine will be given 6 times over a period of two months. The&#xD;
           participant will receive vaccination shots once weekly for 3 vaccines and then every&#xD;
           other week for 3 vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsies will be done after the first and after the fifth vaccinations. Current&#xD;
           status of the participants CLL will be assessed to determine how the disease has&#xD;
           responded to transplant and vaccination. These tests include analysis of bone marrow and&#xD;
           blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccine completion phase: After one cycle of vaccination is completed, the participant&#xD;
           will return to the outpatient clinic monthly for check-ups for 6 visits, to monitor the&#xD;
           effects of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since this trial involves the use of genetically modified cells, it is recommended that&#xD;
           participants on this trial undergo annual checkups for at least 20 years, in order to&#xD;
           monitor for long term effects of the vaccination treatment.&#xD;
