      The purpose of this research is to learn more about the function of the body's ability to&#xD;
      fight infection when the immune response is activated when injury occurs, in the elderly&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Injury in the elderly is characterized by higher mortality rates, longer hospital stays and&#xD;
      increased long term disability when controlled for injury severity as compared to the younger&#xD;
      cohort of injury patients.(7) The greater likelihood of co-morbid, pre-existing medical&#xD;
      conditions, which have a negative impact on outcome, may in part be responsible for this&#xD;
      observation. However, there is some disagreement about whether there is an impact of&#xD;
      physiologic age as opposed to chronological age on outcomes and whether this is the most&#xD;
      important determining factor for the injured elderly. (8) It is clear that the combination of&#xD;
      an age factor and baseline health status may determine the ability of the elderly injured&#xD;
      patient to recover successfully. This may be due to age related degradation in immune&#xD;
      function either PMN related or cell mediated immunity (CMI) related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy individuals, the metabolic response to hemorrhage, burns and injury is&#xD;
      characterized by a hyperdynamic metabolic response that upregulates the&#xD;
      proinflammatory/immunologic/metabolic &quot;milieu&quot; and is designed to heal injury, combat&#xD;
      infection and prevent death. This inflammatory response on the part of the patient is both&#xD;
      functional and adaptive from a physiologic perspective (9). Aging is known to decrease&#xD;
      physiologic reserve and may play a role in altering the ability of the injured elderly&#xD;
      patient to mount an adaptive, appropriate, inflammatory response when injured (10). Some&#xD;
      evidence exists that documents the age-related decline of immunologic function in the&#xD;
      elderly, particularly that portion of the immune response described as cell mediated immunity&#xD;
      [CMI] (11). This contributes to the higher increase in infections in the elderly (12). There&#xD;
      is also animal model evidence that immune function is worsened when combined with injury&#xD;
      (13). Similarly, hemorrhage, burns and injury also depress cell mediated immunity in&#xD;
      previously healthy individuals increasing the likelihood of infection and organ system&#xD;
      failure as a result (14). Little is known, however, about the nature of the&#xD;
      immuno/inflammatory response to injury in the elderly. Therefore, one of the hypotheses of&#xD;
      our study is that the aging process attenuates this immuno/inflammatory response process,&#xD;
      adversely impacting the function of the nonspecific portion of the immune defense system and&#xD;
      the main component of that system, the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The systemic immuno/inflammatory response to hemorrhage, burns and injury is well&#xD;
      characterized in young, healthy volunteers and animal models and has been studied extensively&#xD;
      (15). The key feature of this response is the attraction of PMNs to the site of injury. These&#xD;
      are &quot;mature&quot; PMNs that are present in the peripheral bloodstream that possess a life span of&#xD;
      approximately 3-5 days. When activated, these cells are responsible for limiting microbial&#xD;
      invasion and promoting wound healing. However, prolonged activation of these cells is&#xD;
      deleterious as it can lead to perpetuation of the inflammatory response, exacerbating tissue&#xD;
      injury and leading to the development of organ system injury, and the condition known as&#xD;
      multi-system organ failure. Under normal circumstances, the process of apoptosis, or&#xD;
      programmed cellular death, limits the life span of the PMN to 2-3 days and serves to regulate&#xD;
      the extent of the immuno/inflammatory response. This allows sufficient time for the acquired&#xD;
      immune system to be activated and come on line in response to the cell mediated activity&#xD;
      against infection and antigen. Many of the normal functions of the innate, non-specific PMN&#xD;
      dependent, immune system are known to be dysfunctional in younger patients who have sepsis,&#xD;
      severe injury or shock. It is unclear, however, if the same impact is present in elderly&#xD;
      patients who have been injured because little is known about the function of the PMNs in&#xD;
      elderly patients in general, and, specifically in those elderly patients who have been&#xD;
      injured. Since elderly patients have known, age related depressed cell mediated immunity, our&#xD;
      second hypothesis is that there may be age related abnormalities present in the PMNs of&#xD;
      elderly patients who have been injured that contribute to the worse outcomes following&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to begin to characterize the functional status of a portion of&#xD;
      the innate immune response following injury in elderly trauma patients. This will be&#xD;
      accomplished through analysis of a standard battery of functional tests that characterize&#xD;
      PMNs regarding apoptosis and responses to immune challenges. These PMN functionality tests&#xD;
      will be correlated with observed clinical outcomes. The null hypothesis for this study is&#xD;
      that PMNs from elderly trauma patients have functional characteristics that result in&#xD;
      different local and systemic effects than PMN's from non-injured elder controls or&#xD;
      non-injured non-elder controls and that this may lead to different effects post injury that&#xD;
      impact outcomes.&#xD;
