      The investigators propose to prepare for clinical trials where SMA patients are asked to join&#xD;
      the research effort. The visits will include questions, physical exam, blood drawing, and&#xD;
      sometimes X-rays and a skin biopsy. The investigators will use modern computer methods to&#xD;
      process the information during which the investigators will plan a clinical trial. Once the&#xD;
      clinical trial begins, the investigators will offer SMA patients participation if they meet&#xD;
      the criteria for that trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying an effective SMA treatment is very important because there is currently none.&#xD;
      Clinical trials are the only way to decide whether a new treatment works in SMA patients or&#xD;
      not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is one of the most devastating neurological diseases of&#xD;
      childhood. Affected infants and children suffer from progressive muscle weakness caused by&#xD;
      degeneration of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. Clinically, four&#xD;
      phenotypes are distinguished within the continuous spectrum of disease severity based on the&#xD;
      age of onset and the highest motor milestone ever achieved. SMA is caused by homozygous&#xD;
      deletion of the survival motor neuron-1 (SMN1) gene. A related gene, SMN2, produces low&#xD;
      levels of full-length SMN protein due to inefficient splicing. There is an inverse&#xD;
      correlation between SMN copy number and disease severity, presumably mediated by levels of&#xD;
      full length SMN protein. Therefore, increasing the amount of full-length SMN protein is a&#xD;
      promising treatment strategy. Several drugs targeting splicing efficiency have resulted in&#xD;
      increased SMN protein in preclinical assays and are now awaiting clinical testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the future objective to conduct clinical trials in SMA, the proposed project has 3&#xD;
      specific aims: 1) To establish a web-based database that will serve to enroll the patient&#xD;
      population and that will facilitate timely recruitment for future clinical trials; (2) to&#xD;
      plan for clinical trials by a) developing reliable outcome measures, and (b) establishing the&#xD;
      infrastructure needed to carry out efficient clinical trials, (c) convening meetings of&#xD;
      preclinical and clinical researchers involved in SMA drug development to select candidate&#xD;
      drugs, and (3) to characterize the patient population from a clinical and molecular point of&#xD;
      view.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unstable medical condition precluding participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant respiratory compromise that would interfere with safe travel to site of&#xD;
