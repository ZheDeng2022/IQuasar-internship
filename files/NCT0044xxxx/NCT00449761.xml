      study was designed to assess the hematologic response associated with treatment of oral&#xD;
      panobinostat. Hematologic response is defined as the overall of complete hematologic response&#xD;
      (CHR), and of no evidence of leukemia (NEL) and of the return to chronic phase (RTC).&#xD;
      Hematologic responses were to be confirmed after 4 weeks, and all criteria listed below for&#xD;
      each type of response were to be concomitantly met to result into a response.&#xD;

    <description>QTc monitoring was performed on specified days (Cycle1: Day1, 5 and 26), as well as a single pre-dose ECG once weekly during Cycle1: Week2 and Week3, Cycle2, and all subsequent cycles. Patient eligibility was ensured by a screening QTcF interval calculated by eResearchTechnology(eRT) prior to the baseline assessments. Treatment decisions were based on QTc determined by the automated reading at the investigational site (commonly used the Bazett's correction,QTcB) or measured and calculated by trained personnel at the site. Dosing relied on the investigator's assessment of the 6 baseline ECGs (the average of the 6pre-dose QTc intervals) performed prior to Cycle1/Day1 dosing, of the 3pre-dose ECGs during Cycle1:Day5 and 26, and of the single pre-dose ECGs performed once weekly for the remaining weeks of Cycle1 and subsequent cycles. The Baseline and Change From Baseline to Extreme Value QTcF interval for analysis was calculated by eRT based on the 6 baseline ECGs obtained on Cycle1/Day1.</description>

Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards</description>

          <description>Participants received panobinostat 20 milligrams (mg) orally once daily (OD), three times a week as part of a 4 week (28 day) treatment cycle. Panobinostat was administered at the same time each morning, and with an 8oz/240 milliliter (ml) of water after a fasting period of at least two hours (water was allowed). Participants could continue this treatment until an unacceptable toxicity that precludes further treatment was experienced, or until disease progression.</description>

        <title>Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Panobinostat</title>
        <description>Cmax is defined as the maximum observed drug concentration observed in plasma over all PK sample concentrations. It will be obtained from the Cmax parameter calculated by WinNonlin®. If there is no measurable concentration in the subject's PK profile, then Cmax will be missing for that subject. Cmax will be reported in units of ng/mL.</description>

        <description>QTc monitoring was performed on specified days (Cycle1: Day1, 5 and 26), as well as a single pre-dose ECG once weekly during Cycle1: Week2 and Week3, Cycle2, and all subsequent cycles. Patient eligibility was ensured by a screening QTcF interval calculated by eResearchTechnology(eRT) prior to the baseline assessments. Treatment decisions were based on QTc determined by the automated reading at the investigational site (commonly used the Bazett's correction,QTcB) or measured and calculated by trained personnel at the site. Dosing relied on the investigator's assessment of the 6 baseline ECGs (the average of the 6pre-dose QTc intervals) performed prior to Cycle1/Day1 dosing, of the 3pre-dose ECGs during Cycle1:Day5 and 26, and of the single pre-dose ECGs performed once weekly for the remaining weeks of Cycle1 and subsequent cycles. The Baseline and Change From Baseline to Extreme Value QTcF interval for analysis was calculated by eRT based on the 6 baseline ECGs obtained on Cycle1/Day1.</description>
