      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of rosiglitazone on bone metabolism and&#xD;
      to assess the association between the changes in bone turnover parameters and plasma cytokine&#xD;
      levels in postmenopausal diabetic women&#xD;

      Fifty-six obese, drug naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled and&#xD;
      completed the study. Twenty-six healthy subjects matched for age and body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      served as nondiabetic controls. All subjects were postmenopausal women with last menses at&#xD;
      least 2 years. After the baseline measurements, all subjects were instructed to follow a&#xD;
      weight-maintaining diet, based on ADA recommendations, and were also encouraged to walk or to&#xD;
      jog at least 30 min daily. Subsequently, 28 of the diabetic subjects were randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive rosiglitazone (4 mg/day). Twenty-eight of diabetic subjects were on diet alone.&#xD;
      The randomization procedure was based on a random sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects had a complete clinical examination, anthropometric measurements, and laboratory&#xD;
      tests at baseline and at the end of the 12th week of the study. Laboratory investigations&#xD;
      included assessment of: (i) glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and insulin&#xD;
      levels, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index (22); (ii) serum bsALP and active human&#xD;
      osteocalcin concentration (OCL) as markers of bone formation; (iii) urine deoxypyridinoline&#xD;
      (DPD) as marker of bone resorption. Other non-specific bone markers including serum total ALP&#xD;
      activity, urinary calcium (Ca) and phosphate (PO4) concentrations were also measured. Urine&#xD;
      concentrations of DPD (nmol/L), Ca and PO4 (both in mmol/L) were corrected for their&#xD;
      respective urine creatinine (Cr) concentrations in mmol/L (Urine DPD/Cr, Urine Ca/Cr and&#xD;
      Urine PO4/Cr respectively). In addition, fasting blood samples were analyzed for plasma&#xD;
      cytokine levels including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, and for haptoglobin levels.&#xD;
