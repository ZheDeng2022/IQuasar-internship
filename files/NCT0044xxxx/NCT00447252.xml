      Assessment of Families Who Have Undergone the Traumatic Loss of a Child Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will focus on several objectives in the framework of the family perspective&#xD;
      and systemic understanding of the mourning process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of the psychological, social and practical needs of families that have&#xD;
           lost a child to terrorism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Deepening and extending the knowledge of how families cope with the loss of a child in a&#xD;
           violent incident of a security-related nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identification of risk and resilience factors within the family structure, and the&#xD;
           nature of the relationships within the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Al-Quds in East Jerusalem will be conducting an identical study in&#xD;
      conjunction with this one, examining Palestinian families who have lost a child in the&#xD;
      conflict with Israel. Collaboration between these studies will allow a cross-cultural&#xD;
      comparison of family coping with traumatic loss, and of the identification of resilience and&#xD;
      risk factors among the families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of the study Participants. The assessment process will include some twenty-five&#xD;
      Israeli families who have lost a son or daughter below the age of 18 as a result of a&#xD;
      terrorist incident, at least six months previously. All family members living at home will&#xD;
      participate in the study. The study will not include single-parent families, or family&#xD;
      members who suffer from mental retardation, disturbances because of addiction, or psychiatric&#xD;
      disturbance from the psychotic or autistic spectra (schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness,&#xD;
      psychotic disturbances, PDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. The recruitment of families will be done by the Kobi Mandel Foundation, which is&#xD;
      involved in helping families that have been victims of terror. The Foundation will not&#xD;
      approach families who fit the criteria of ineligibility for the study, as described in the&#xD;
      previous paragraph. The parents will fill out a form of informed consent on their own behalf,&#xD;
      and on behalf of their children who are under the age of 18, after they have received an&#xD;
      explanation about the procedure of the study, and have been given an opportunity to ask&#xD;
      questions about it. Teenagers over 14 years old will sign a form of informed consent, with&#xD;
      parental permission. Family members over the age of 18, living at home, will fill out a form&#xD;
      of informed consent on their own behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To carry out this stage, each family will be assigned a professional by the Israel Center for&#xD;
      the Treatment of Psychotrauma, who will be its liaison and responsible for the process of&#xD;
      assessment. The completion of the questionnaires will be coordinated with the family members,&#xD;
      and carried out in the presence of the liaison, who will assist in explaining the&#xD;
      questionnaire, and provide support in the event of emotional difficulties arising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every member of the family will fill out the questionnaire separately; the liaison will focus&#xD;
      on helping children who have difficulty doing so. The parents will fill out questionnaires&#xD;
      for small children (under 10 years old). In order to preserve the privacy of the&#xD;
      participants, each family member will receive a personal code to be written on the&#xD;
      questionnaire. The liaison alone will have the key to identify each participant, which is&#xD;
      important for the identification of needs within the family, and the ability to direct them&#xD;
      for appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible risks. The main risk for the participants relates to the possible uncomfortable&#xD;
      feeling the questionnaire might raise by evoking memories of the deceased, and to personal&#xD;
      distress. For this reason, the questionnaires will be given to the participants by a trained&#xD;
      professional who will be able to provide support, identify distress and suggest seeking&#xD;
      professional treatment if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualifications of the Principal Investigators. The work will be carried out under the&#xD;
      supervision of Dr. Danny Brom, the founder and current director of the Israel Center for the&#xD;
      Treatment of Psychotrauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the research instruments Demographic and organizational details. The&#xD;
      participants will relate to demographic details like age, sex, family status, place in the&#xD;
      family, occupation and socio-economic status, as well as information about the death&#xD;
      (circumstances and time of death, description of the loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD): This questionnaire contains 60 self-reported items&#xD;
      that assess six aspects of family functioning: Problem solving, Communication, Roles,&#xD;
      Affective responsiveness, Affective involvement, Behavior control In addition, the&#xD;
      questionnaire contains a component (12 items) of general functioning (Epstein, Baldwin and&#xD;
      Bishop, 1983).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Couple adjustment: Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) (Spanier, 1976). The quality of mutual&#xD;
      adjustment in the marital system will be measured by the DAS questionnaire, which contains 32&#xD;
      items in four subscales: Dyadic Consensus, Dyadic Satisfaction, Dyadic Cohesiveness and&#xD;
      Affectional Expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults Grief Response: Inventory of Complicated Grief - ICG (Prigerson and Jacobs, 2001). The&#xD;
      questionnaire examines adjustment to grief. Its 33 items measure non-adaptive symptoms of&#xD;
      response to loss. The items make up two primary distress scales - traumatic distress and&#xD;
      separation distress - which represent a uni-dimensional construct. The participants are asked&#xD;
      to grade the degree to which they experience each of the symptoms presented, on a Likert&#xD;
      scale of 1 (never) to 5 (always).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to trauma and post-traumatic distress. The PDS questionnaire (Foa, Feske &amp; Murdock,&#xD;
      1993) will examine the history of traumatic events, subjective trauma response,&#xD;
      post-traumatic symptoms and functional impairment. The questionnaire includes yes/no&#xD;
      questions for the parent to answer regarding possible traumas in his or her past. Four yes/no&#xD;
      questions examine the subjective response to the event (criterion A2). The section that&#xD;
      examines post-traumatic symptoms includes 17 items that relate to the appearance of different&#xD;
      symptoms, according to DSM, within the last month: re-experiencing the event (criterion B),&#xD;
      avoidance (C) and hyperarousal (D). The scale of responses runs from 0 (not relevant or&#xD;
      happened only once) to 3 (almost all the time). A grade of 2 or more is regarded as verifying&#xD;
      the existence of a symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond this, the questionnaire contains nine yes/no questions that relate to impaired&#xD;
      functioning in different areas of life, like work, relations with family members, leisure&#xD;
      time activity, and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). This widely accepted questionnaire measures&#xD;
      the severity of symptoms of depression. It was updated in 1996 in order to meet the criteria&#xD;
      of the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition). The&#xD;
      participants are asked to relate to 21 items that describe different depressive symptoms on a&#xD;
      scale of 0-3. A general score on the questionnaire can therefore lie between 0 and 63 (a&#xD;
      higher score indicates greater severity of depressive symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents Grief response: UCLA Trauma Psychiatry Service Grief Inventory (Layne et al,&#xD;
      1998). On this questionnaire, the participants are required to answer ten items that relate&#xD;
      to loss response, from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) on a Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-traumatic symptoms. UCLA PTSD Reaction Index Adolescent Version (RI-R) (Rodriguez,&#xD;
      Steinberg, &amp; Pynoos, 1999). The RI-R is a new version of the earlier UCLA Reaction Index&#xD;
      (Frederick, Pynoos, &amp; Nader,1992), which was based on the DSM-III. The RI-R includes 22 items&#xD;
      for self-report. It measures the frequency of post-traumatic symptoms in the previous four&#xD;
      weeks. Subject are asked to note the frequency of symptoms on a scale from 0 (never) to 4&#xD;
      (most of the time). The measure of the severity of post-traumatic symptoms will be computed&#xD;
      by summarizing 20 items on the questionnaire, as per Rodriguez et al (1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional impairment. This will be measured by means of items on the Diagnostic Predictive&#xD;
      Scale (DPS), which relates to significant impairment in different areas of functioning (APA,&#xD;
      2000), for example: functioning in school, social relations, family relations, activity&#xD;
      outside school and dangerous behavior. The participants will be asked to grade, on a scale of&#xD;
      0 (not at all) to 5 (very much) the degree to which they have experienced impairment in&#xD;
      functioning in these areas. The severity of functioning impairment will be computed as the&#xD;
      sum of all the items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to traumatic events. This self-report questionnaire is a translation of the&#xD;
      questionnaire by Ford et al. (1997), and works on the same basis. The subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to answer, yes or no, whether they were ever exposed to one or more of 17 different traumatic&#xD;
      events .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strengths and difficulties. The Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), self-reported&#xD;
      or filled out by parents, contains 25 items which assess different aspects of adjustment&#xD;
      among children and adolescents focusing on behavioral symptoms. The questionnaire is intended&#xD;
      to be completed by parents (or teachers) for children aged 3-16. Adolescents aged 11-16 can&#xD;
      fill out the questionnaire by themselves (Goodman, 1997). The participants are asked to&#xD;
      relate to 25 positive and negative statements, and respond as to what degree each statement&#xD;
      fits their children, on a Likert scale of 1 (not true) to 3 (certainly true). The&#xD;
      questionnaire is made up of five main factors: emotional symptoms, behavioral problems,&#xD;
      attentiveness and hyperactivity, relations with the peer group, and pro-social behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children (Grades 3-6) Depression. Children Depression Inventory (CDI) (Kovacz, 1992) is a&#xD;
      self-report questionnaire that assesses cognitive, affective, somatic and behavioral aspects&#xD;
      of depression in children and adolescents from age 6 to 17. The original version of the&#xD;
      questionnaire has 27 items, each containing three sentences. The child needs to choose the&#xD;
      sentence that best describes his feelings over the previous two weeks. The scoring of the&#xD;
      questionnaire presents a general score and five sub-scores: negative mood, interpersonal&#xD;
      problems, ineffectiveness, anhedonia and self-image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety. The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), (Birmaher et al,&#xD;
      1997) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses anxiety symptoms in children. A general&#xD;
      anxiety measure (eight items) and a separation anxiety measure (seven items) will be computed&#xD;
      from the questionnaire. The subjects will be asked to grade, on a scale from 0 (generally not&#xD;
      true) to 2 (generally true), the degree to which the items describes their situation. The&#xD;
      general score on the two scales will be computed as the sum of the items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small children The report on the distress of small children in the family will be divided&#xD;
      into two. For children aged 2-11, the parents will answer SDQs. For children aged 2-5, the&#xD;
      parents will answer the Post-traumatic Stress Questionnaire. Each parent will answer a&#xD;
      separate questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-traumatic stress. The questionnaire is based on a semi-structured interview with the&#xD;
      parents with respect to post-traumatic symptoms in their little children (ages 2-5)&#xD;
      (Scheeringa &amp; Zeanah, 1994). The parents will be asked to mark, on a scale of 0 (never) to 3&#xD;
      (yes), whether each one of the symptoms were evident in their children within the previous&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
