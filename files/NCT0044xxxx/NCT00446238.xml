    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is a randomized trial of cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBI)&#xD;
      for eligible adolescents who have Inflammatory Bowel Disease and subsyndromal depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, but who did not meet diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder at the time&#xD;
      of randomization into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This preliminary randomized trial will demonstrate the feasibility of a large-scale&#xD;
           research initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects will experience no adverse events, and the CBI group will demonstrate improved&#xD;
           negative cognitions, depressive symptomatology, and functioning at the post-intervention&#xD;
           and 6- through 12-month follow-ups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot study, which will serve to determine the feasibility of a larger&#xD;
      research initiative. The broader research is aimed at the prevention of depressive disorders&#xD;
      in adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who have risk factors for depression,&#xD;
      using a psychotherapeutic intervention. The intervention is based on a cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      approach to treating depression, the Primary and Secondary Control Enhancement Training&#xD;
      (PASCET), that has been modified and enhanced with physical illness narrative, social skills,&#xD;
      and family components (PASCET-Physical Illness), to make it more appropriate for physically&#xD;
      ill adolescents at risk for major depression. The cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBI)&#xD;
      draws on an etiological hypothesis that depression in adolescents with chronic physical&#xD;
      illness results from cumulative risk factors such as distorted cognitive processes, negative&#xD;
      physical illness experience, poor social functioning, and ineffective family interactions.&#xD;
      Thus, the development of depression may be prevented by teaching adolescents effective&#xD;
      strategies to 1) cope using cognitive-behavioral skills, 2) enhance social functioning, 3)&#xD;
      develop a more cohesive illness narrative, and 4) improve family communication skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized trial of the CBI for adolescents with IBD and depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      using the provision of psychoeducational materials as the attention control group. This study&#xD;
      is a pilot study designed to show feasibility of assessing and treating youth with&#xD;
      sub-syndromal depressive symptoms and IBD using a randomized clinical design at Children's&#xD;
      Hospital Pittsburgh (CHP) as a preliminary step for designing a two-site randomized trial&#xD;
      Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and Children's Hospital Boston powered to test preventive&#xD;
      effects of this CBI in this medically co-morbid population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, eligible adolescents who are at risk for developing depression due to having a&#xD;
      chronic physical illness (IBD) as well as having subsyndromal depressive symptoms but who do&#xD;
      not currently meet diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder according to a&#xD;
      diagnostic interview will be randomly assigned either to receive CBI or psychoeducation.&#xD;
