  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nattokinase is a potent fibrinolytic enzyme extracted from Natto. The objective of this study&#xD;
      was to compare the efficacy of the natto extract taken by healthy volunteers, dialysis&#xD;
      patients, and patients with cardiovascularrisk factors on the fibrinolytic factors and blood&#xD;
      lipids. The study has two primary objectives: to evaluate the effect of oral intake of&#xD;
      nattokinase in normal subjects, patients under dialysis, and patients of cardiovascular high&#xD;
      risk group, and to compare the effect of oral intake of nattokinase among three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen subjects, 20-70 years, for each group will be enrolled to take the capsules of natto&#xD;
      extract orally for 2 months. Fibrinolytic factors, vital signs and blood lipids for efficacy,&#xD;
      and body weight, renal function and self-administered questionnaire for safety will be&#xD;
      assessed at screening, 3, 7, 28, and 56 days after the initiation of intake, and 2 weeks&#xD;
      after the cease of intake.&#xD;

      This study will employ an open-label, parallel-group design. Adult men and women who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and give written consent to participate will be assigned to one&#xD;
      of the three groups according to their condition: Group A- normal volunteers; Group B-&#xD;
      patients under dialysis; Group C- patients of cardiovascular high risk group. Each group will&#xD;
      enroll 15 subjects. After two to four weeks run-in period, subjects will be given nattokinase&#xD;
      orally for 8 weeks, and will be asked to stop taking nattokinase for 2 weeks to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of long-term intake and cease of intake of nattokinase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests, including fibrinogen, T-PA, PAI-1, D-dimer, total cholesterol, LDL-C,&#xD;
      HDL-C, and TG, vital signs and body weight will be evaluated at screening visit, 3 days, 1&#xD;
      week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 10 weeks (2 weeks after cease of intake) visits. Patient&#xD;
      self-evaluation of tolerance and physical improvement will be assessed by a Patient&#xD;
      Questionnaire at 3-day, and 1-, 4-, 8-, and 10-week visits. Each patient will be carefully&#xD;
      monitored for the development of any adverse events (AE).&#xD;
