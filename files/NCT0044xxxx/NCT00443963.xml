  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal investigator hypothesizes that participants receiving NSAID drugs with&#xD;
      dyspeptic symptoms have increased production of gastric levels of free radicals. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to determine if Esomeprazole Magnesium increases gastric total&#xD;
      antioxidant capacity and decreases gastric free radical production in humans. Participants&#xD;
      (age 18 years and older) with no history of upper GI bleeding who are receiving non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs and then develop dyspepsia will be recruited from our primary care&#xD;
      clinic in Washington, DC. All eligible participants will undergo biopsies of antrum and&#xD;
      corpus. The participants will be randomized to receive either Zantac OTC or Nexium for 15&#xD;
      days. On day 15, all participants will undergo repeat upper endoscopy to obtain biopsies of&#xD;
      antrum and corpus. Tissue samples will then be extracted to determine total antioxidant&#xD;
      capacity and lipid peroxide levels (as an indirect marker of free radical production).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An extensive meta-analysis has confirmed that dyspeptic symptoms are common in individuals&#xD;
      using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (1). Both esomeprazole 20 mg daily and&#xD;
      esomeprazole 40 mg daily have been shown to be more effective than placebo for the control of&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal symptoms in patients receiving NSAIDs (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms by which H, K-ATPase inhibitors protect against NSAID gastropathy remain&#xD;
      unclear, although it is known that their use is more clinically effective than the use of the&#xD;
      H2-receptor antagonist, ranitidine (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biochemical basis for NSAID gastropathy is not fully understood (6). One potential&#xD;
      mechanism for the development of gastric damage in individuals receiving NSAIDs is oxidative&#xD;
      stress related to depletion of gastric antioxidants. A recent endoscopic study in patients&#xD;
      supports the hypothesis that NSAID use associated with gastric bleeding decreases gastric&#xD;
      mucosal glutathione levels (7), a major cellular micronutrient antioxidant produced by&#xD;
      mammalian cells. The principal investigator has been working on the possibility that&#xD;
      activation of afferent nerve fibers by oxidative stress can induce abdominal discomfort&#xD;
      during the use of NSAIDs. This notion is supported by animal studies that have shown that&#xD;
      oxidants evoke neurotransmitter release from enteric neurons (8). This experimental result&#xD;
      suggests that abnormal tissue levels of oxygen-derived free radicals (oxidative stress) could&#xD;
      directly activate afferent enteric nerves or could alter gastric motility via a neuronal&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this present proposal is that participants receiving NSAID drugs with&#xD;
      dyspeptic symptoms have increased production of gastric levels of free radicals. The primary&#xD;
      aims of this study are to examine gastric free radical production and total antioxidant&#xD;
      capacity in participants who are taking NSAID drugs and have dyspeptic symptoms. Gastric free&#xD;
      radical production and total antioxidant capacity will be measured before and after receiving&#xD;
      either 15 days of daily esomeprazole magnesium or ranitidine.&#xD;

          -  Participants who are capable of providing informed consent, ages 18 years old and&#xD;
             older. Partipants who are taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on a daily&#xD;
             basis must present with at least a 1 week history of dyspeptic symptoms including&#xD;
             epigastric or upper abdominal discomfort or pain.&#xD;
