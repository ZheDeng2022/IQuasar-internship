  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide bortezomib to patients with multiple myeloma who have&#xD;
      received at least 2 previous lines of therapy and are refractory or have relapse after their&#xD;
      last treatment. Additional objectives of this study are assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      bortezomib and follow the levels of paraprotein in patients receiving bortezomib as a way to&#xD;
      followup disease burden&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is uniformly fatal. Responses achieved after multiple lines of therapy are&#xD;
      normally of short duration. Therefore, all patients with multiple myeloma will eventually&#xD;
      relapse, having become refractory to therapy and subsequently will die of their cancer. The&#xD;
      rationale of this study is that bortezomib as a novel agent may allow additional periods of&#xD;
      response due to its different mechanisms of action. This is an open-label, single-arm,&#xD;
      multicenter, non-comparative study to provide expanded access to bortezomib to patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma that have received at least two previous lines of therapy and are refractory&#xD;
      to or have relapsed after their last treatment. Patients will receive treatment with&#xD;
      bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on day 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 3-week cycle. No treatment will be&#xD;
      administered on the last 10 days of each cycle. Treatment may be repeated for up to 8 cycles&#xD;
      with possible extension if patient is still responding at the end of the 8 cycle period.&#xD;
      Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 will be administered as an IV bolus&#xD;
