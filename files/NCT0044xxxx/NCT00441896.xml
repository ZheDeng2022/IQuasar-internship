  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two period (8-10 days/period), incomplete cross-over in which successive&#xD;
      cohorts of 9 subjects are randomized, in a 2:1 ratio, to 1 of 2 sequences, A and B. In each&#xD;
      cohort, Sequence A, comprised of 6 subjects, receives ascending doses of ganaxolone during&#xD;
      period 1 and ganaxolone (at the maximal dose attained in period 1) and ascending doses of&#xD;
      placebo during period 2. Sequence B, comprised of 3 subjects, receives ascending doses of&#xD;
      placebo during period 1 and receives the maximum dose of placebo and ascending doses of&#xD;
      ganaxolone during period 2. The dosing level in each subsequent cohort will be based upon&#xD;
      experience gained from previous cohorts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male or female, 4 to 24 months of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of IS with a 24 hour video&#xD;
      EEG (vEEG) recording confirming the diagnosis and previously treated with 3 or fewer&#xD;
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are eligible for the study. The subject is able to continue&#xD;
      treatment with concomitant AEDs (no more than 2; adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH],&#xD;
      corticosteroids, felbamate, and vigabatrin are not allowed concomitantly). A ketogenic diet&#xD;
      is permitted if it can be maintained for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of three weekly 24-hr video EEGs (baseline, end of weeks 1 and 2 of&#xD;
      treatment). Dosing titration begins the day after each video EEG during the inpatient stay.&#xD;
      All subjects will be receiving ganaxolone the day after the second video EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data Monitoring Board (DMB) will determine whether successive cohorts of subjects can be&#xD;
      dosed at an increased dose level; up to a maximum of 6 cohorts.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be diagnosed with IS (regardless of etiology- except for a progressive neurologic&#xD;
             illness). Diagnostic Criteria: Seizures consisting of single or repetitive short&#xD;
             muscular contractions leading to flexion or extension. Spasms may be characterized as&#xD;
             tonic or myoclonic contractions, may occur singly or in clusters, and typically occur&#xD;
             bilaterally and symmetrically. The EEG pattern must be consistent with the diagnosis&#xD;
             of IS (hypsarrhythmia, modified hypsarrhythmia, multifocal spike wave discharges,&#xD;
             etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a vEEG recording confirming the diagnosis of IS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed to determine any possible causes&#xD;
             of IS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been previously treated with 3 or fewer AEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If being treated with concomitant AEDs&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current AEDs have been at a constant daily dose for at least 2 weeks; Note:&#xD;
                  Subjects with minor dose adjustments may be allowed to enter the study after&#xD;
                  shorter periods after detailed discussion with the medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have a stable clinical response/plateau for at least 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Are able to continue treatment with no more than 2 concomitant AEDs (ACTH,&#xD;
                  corticosteroids, felbamate, and vigabatrin are not allowed concomitantly).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A ketogenic diet is permitted if it can be maintained for the duration of the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be a male or female, 4 to 24 months of age (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a Parent/Guardian who is properly informed of the nature and risks of the&#xD;
             clinical study, who is willing and capable of complying with all clinical study&#xD;
             procedures, and has given informed consent in writing prior to entering the clinical&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able to participate for the full term of the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with corticosteroids, ACTH, vigabatrin, felbamate, or any AED not approved&#xD;
             by Regulatory Agencies, 2 weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with more than two AEDs at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active CNS infection, demyelinating disease, degenerative neurological&#xD;
             disease, or CNS disease deemed progressive (with the exception of tuberous sclerosis)&#xD;
             as evaluated by brain imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any disease or condition (medical or surgical) at screening that might compromise&#xD;
             the hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, or hepatic&#xD;
             systems; or other conditions that might interfere with the absorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism, or excretion of the investigational product, or would place the subject at&#xD;
             increased risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or total bilirubin&#xD;
             greater than four times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or clinical laboratory value&#xD;
             deemed clinically significant by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of recurrent status epilepticus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been exposed to any other investigational drug within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
