  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for people whose cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  has resisted chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are taking a break from chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or are looking for an alternative to the toxic effects of chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is looking to see if a very low carbohydrate diet can inhibit the growth of certain&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two major goals of the RECHARGE study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether a very low carbohydrate diet can help participants reduce the amount of cancer&#xD;
           in their bodies (as measured by a PET scan at the beginning and end of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether participants can feel well while maintaining their weight on a very low&#xD;
           carbohydrate diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is for people with advanced cancers who decline chemotherapy or want to&#xD;
      take a break from chemotherapy and have cancers that primarily feed on blood sugar. Examples&#xD;
      of such cancers include metastatic breast cancer, colon cancer, cervical and uterine cancers,&#xD;
      ovarian cancers, and many others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' intervention consists of a 28-day diet of high protein foods such as fish,&#xD;
      poultry, meats, eggs and cheese as well as plenty of vegetables. Participants may eat as much&#xD;
      of the high protein foods as they wish and can eat up to two cups of vegetables per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants strictly eliminate carbohydrate-containing foods. These foods include all&#xD;
      starches and sweets (breads, pasta, rice, potatoes, cereals, fruit, cakes, candies, soda with&#xD;
      sugar, etc.).&#xD;

      You may be eligible to participate in this one month research study if you are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An adult with metastatic cancer (especially breast, colon, cervical, endometrial,&#xD;
           ovarian; others may qualify) that has resisted prior attempts to treat it with courses&#xD;
           of chemotherapy; or if you decline chemotherapy or are looking for a break, or you seek&#xD;
           an alternative to medicines or therapies due to toxic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your tumor has shown up on a PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willing to closely follow a diet and strictly limit your carbohydrate intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will not be eligible to participate if you:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have heart or liver condition or any other disease or condition that makes it difficult&#xD;
           or medically hazardous (determined by your doctor) for you to follow the diet&#xD;
           recommended for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have kidney or kidney stone disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will obtain a PET/CT scan to determine your eligibility if you are otherwise&#xD;
           interested in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will also obtain a second PET/CT scan at the end of the dietary trial (28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will also obtain blood and urine tests at weekly intervals during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits and contacts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will see you once/week for four weeks on the Albert Einstein, or Montefiore Medical&#xD;
           Center Campus (your choice) for a total of 5 visits, and will call you on the phone at&#xD;
           least one additional time each week. The first visit will take approximately one hour or&#xD;
           as long as is needed to understand the diet correctly. The remaining visits will take&#xD;
           approximately one-half hour. The PET/CT scan will take approximately 25 minutes in the&#xD;
           camera. Waiting time varies for the procedure but is usually less than 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low carbohydrate supplement shakes will be given to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All procedures and visits are without cost to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are no funds for direct compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diet will severely restrict carbohydrates (that is, NO sugars or starches; no bread,&#xD;
           pasta, rice, sugary drinks, potatoes or potato chips, cake, cookies, ice cream, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be allowed to eat AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE of foods that have very small amounts of&#xD;
           carbohydrate, such as eggs, beef, poultry, fish, salads (except potatoes and other&#xD;
           starchy vegetables).&#xD;
