      The purpose of this project is to evaluate an exercise and health promotion program for older&#xD;
      adults with mild memory loss. The study will investigate the efficacy of a memory-enhanced&#xD;
      exercise and health promotion program to determine whether it is more effective than a social&#xD;
      walking program in delaying further memory decline, improving mood and physical function, and&#xD;
      enhancing quality of life.&#xD;

      This project is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a group exercise&#xD;
      and health promotion program designed specifically for older adults with Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI). This study builds upon previous studies designed for cognitively intact&#xD;
      older adults, with a supplemental study using a modified intervention for MCI participants,&#xD;
      and for individuals with Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these prior investigations support the efficacy of behaviorally based&#xD;
      exercise interventions in improving cognitive, physical, and affective status in cognitively&#xD;
      intact and demented older adults. Results from a feasibility study suggest that these&#xD;
      positive outcomes can also be obtained in older adults with MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will investigate the efficacy of the modified exercise program called RALLI&#xD;
      (Resources and Activities for Life Long Independence) to determine whether it is more&#xD;
      effective than the control condition, a social walking program (SW), in delaying cognitive&#xD;
      decline, improving self-rated health and health behaviors, improving affect and physical&#xD;
      function, and enhancing quality of life. The long-term efficacy of RALLI to delay conversion&#xD;
      of MCI to dementia, reduce physical disability, maintain independent living, and improve&#xD;
      physiological health indicators will also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred seventy participants over the age of 70 who meet American Academy of Neurology&#xD;
      criteria for MCI will be recruited from independent living retirement residences.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two conditions (RALLI and SW) and&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, post treatment (3 months), and follow up visits every 6 months for a&#xD;
      total of 3 years (months 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36). The hypothesis is that RALLI&#xD;
      participants will experience better post-treatment outcomes than SW participants, and that&#xD;
      gains will be maintained over 36 months.&#xD;
