  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study that will investigate the effects of antacids (often used to treat&#xD;
      stomach upset) on Gleevec® (a drug that is FDA-approved to treat some types of cancer) in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. Twelve healthy volunteers (six men and six women) will be recruited to&#xD;
      complete the study. This research study will compare Gleevec® in the body when taken with and&#xD;
      without antacids. Each volunteer will receive a 400 mg pill of Gleevec® on two occasions. One&#xD;
      one occasion they will take the dose of Gleevec® alone. On another occasion, they will take&#xD;
      the Gleevec® 15 minutes after taking a 20 mL dose of antacids. Several blood samples will be&#xD;
      drawn to measure the concentrations of Gleevec® and its breakdown products in the blood, with&#xD;
      and without the influence of antacids.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-institution, randomized cross-over, fixed schedule study of the&#xD;
      effects of Mg-Al-based antacids on Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec®) pharmacokinetics. Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will be recruited to participate in this study such that twelve subjects (6 men /&#xD;
      6 women) will complete the study. Gleevec® pharmacokinetics will be assessed after oral&#xD;
      administration of Gleevec® and after oral administration of Gleevec® with concomitant&#xD;
      administration of magnesium-aluminum hydroxide-based antacid (Maalox). Gleevec® will be&#xD;
      administered at a dose of 400 mg, and the antacid (Maximum Strength Maalox®Max®&#xD;
      Antacid/Anti-gas) at a dose level of 20 mL (equivalent to 1600 mg aluminum hydroxide and 1600&#xD;
      mg magnesium hydroxide). Half of the subjects will receive Gleevec® and antacid on day 15 and&#xD;
      Gleevec® alone on day 1. The other half will be treated in reverse order, i.e., they will&#xD;
      receive the combination of Gleevec® and antacid on day 1, and Gleevec® alone on day 15. The&#xD;
      antacids will be administered 15 minutes before the Gleevec® dose.&#xD;
