      Autoinflammatory syndromes (AIS) are a group of disorders characterized by recurrent episodes&#xD;
      of inflammation.Although for the hereditary autoinflammatory diseases the genetic mutations&#xD;
      are known it remains largely unclear how these mutations lead to recurrent inflammatory&#xD;
      attacks. Treatment of the inflammatory symptoms remains a challenge. With beneficial&#xD;
      responses reported during treatment with simvastatin, etanercept or anakinra in some but not&#xD;
      all patients. ITF2357 is an orally active histon deacetylase inhibitor with a potent&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect due to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNFα, IFNg,&#xD;
      IL-6). We expect that ITF2357 is able to modify the clinical symptoms of AIS patients and&#xD;
      induce clinical complete remission or a reduction in attack duration.&#xD;

      Rationale: Autoinflammatory syndromes (AIS) are a group of disorders characterized by&#xD;
      recurrent episodes of inflammation. This occurs in the absence of autoantibodies and antigen&#xD;
      specific T cells. To date 6 genetically distinct hereditary autoinflammatory syndromes are&#xD;
      known and more recently other sporadic syndromes, such as the Schnitzler's syndrome&#xD;
      (urticaria, periodic fever and paraproteinemia) and Periodic Fever Aphtous stomatitis,&#xD;
      Pharyngitis and Adenitis (PFAPA) are being recognized as AIS. Amyloidosis is a serious&#xD;
      complication of chronic or recurrent inflammation seen in some of these syndromes. Although&#xD;
      for the hereditary autoinflammatory diseases the genetic mutations are known it remains&#xD;
      largely unclear how these mutations lead to recurrent inflammatory attacks. Symptomatic&#xD;
      episodes are associated with increased serum concentrations of both pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators (TNFα, IL-6, IL1β and IFN-g) as well as of the anti-inflammatory compounds (IL-1ra,&#xD;
      sTNFR p55 and sTNFR p75). In vitro and ex vivo experiments suggest a central role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis for IL-1β. The observation that rIL-1ra (anakinra) is highly effective in&#xD;
      refractory TRAPS, CAPS, HIDS, refractory FMF and SS support this idea. Despite its&#xD;
      effectiveness daily painful subcutaneous injections and injection site reactions remain a&#xD;
      problem. ITF2357 is an orally active histon deacetylase inhibitor with a potent&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect due to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNFα, IFNg,&#xD;
      IL-6). We expect that ITF2357 is able to modify the clinical symptoms of AIS patients and&#xD;
      induce clinical complete remission or a reduction in attack duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective is to asses whether ITF2357 is able to induce clinical&#xD;
      complete remission in patients with continuous symptoms or reduce attack duration with &gt; 33%&#xD;
      in periodically symptomatic patients. Secondary objectives are the emergence of adverse&#xD;
      events and toxicity as well as the influence of ITF2357 on cytokine production and laboratory&#xD;
      parameters for infection and metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Open Label Pilot Study Study population: AIS patients 18 years or older with&#xD;
      severe disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients with continuous symptoms will receive 2-3 times a day 50mg (capsule)&#xD;
      ITF2357 for a total period of 90 days. Patients with periodic symptoms will take ITF2357 (2-3&#xD;
      times a day 50mg) on 7-14 consecutive days during 6-12 attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters: A clinical complete remission will be regarded as a clinical score&#xD;
      (CS) &lt; 10 scored on the symptom score list in the absence of a temperature &gt; 38.0°C and&#xD;
      normalisation of CRP and WBC levels. The end of an attack will be defined as a CS &lt; 20 in the&#xD;
      absence of a temperature &gt; 38.0°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: All patients will be admitted once at the beginning of the study for 3 days in&#xD;
      this period there will be performed a daily venipuncture, a history and physical examination&#xD;
      twice and an ECG once. They will visit the outpatient clinic four times for physical&#xD;
      examination, history, venipuncture and an ECG. Patients are asked to complete a symptom score&#xD;
      list on which they can note down the date, number of ITF2357 capsules taken and if present&#xD;
      co-medication, symptoms, temperature and adverse events. Patients are asked to collect a&#xD;
      portion of morning urine once a week. ITF2357 showed the following adverse reactions&#xD;
      asymptomatic trombocytopenia and perhaps increased incidence of mild infections mainly of the&#xD;
      upper respiratory tract. There were gastrointestinal complaints in the sense of nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.&#xD;
