  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ThermoDox when&#xD;
      used in combination with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of primary and&#xD;
      metastatic tumors of the liver.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ablative treatment approaches, such as RFA or microwave ablation, have received increased&#xD;
      attention as alternates to other treatment approaches such as hepatic arterial embolization&#xD;
      or chemoembolization (TACE) or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) in the majority of&#xD;
      patients who are either not candidates for surgical resection or are not offered palliative&#xD;
      supportive care only for diffuse disease. RFA can be applied repetitively to the same patient&#xD;
      to treat multiple tumors at time of diagnosis or upon tumor recurrence (local or distant to&#xD;
      the site of ablation), and is largely limited in its application only by tumor location and&#xD;
      size (tumors near larger vessels, bowel or the hepatobiliary tree are more difficult to&#xD;
      ablate). To extend the volume of the ablation region in a controlled fashion in patients and&#xD;
      to improve the ability to kill tumor cells in the ablation margin region and allow for the&#xD;
      improved treatment of HCC and MLC lesions &gt; 3 cm in diameter by complete thermal ablation,&#xD;
      Celsion Corporation has developed ThermoDox, a thermally sensitive, intravenously&#xD;
      administered liposomal formulation of doxorubicin capable of selectively releasing its drug&#xD;
      contents when exposed to temperatures of &gt; 39.5°C. The concept behind this treatment approach&#xD;
      is to create a large concentration gradient of doxorubicin in the immediate region of the&#xD;
      tumor which borders the zone of RFA induced cell necrosis. The temperature isotherms produced&#xD;
      in this boundary region should be adequate to activate doxorubicin release by the thermally&#xD;
      sensitive liposomes deposited locally around the ablation zone. This in effect increases the&#xD;
      region of tissue that can be treated beyond that achievable by RFA alone. Several clinical&#xD;
      objectives are being tested in this study. The MTD for ThermoDox is to be confirmed. This&#xD;
      study will assess the safety of using ThermoDox in conjunction with RFA over multiple cycles,&#xD;
      consistent with the clinical needs of the subjects. While this study is not powered to define&#xD;
      effectiveness of the combination of RFA plus ThermoDox, the results of this study should&#xD;
      allow for an assessment of risk and benefit for designing future studies. This study will&#xD;
      also test alternative infusion reaction prophylaxis regimens.&#xD;
