  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of vitamin C&#xD;
      (ascorbic acid) given by injection into the vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second and third purpose of conducting this study is to observe any evidence of tumor&#xD;
      response to the vitamin C and compare the level of fatigue (weakness), pain control, ability&#xD;
      to do things, and quality of life, before and after vitamin C is given.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies of pharmacologic doses of vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbate) have shown&#xD;
      significant anticancer effects in animal models and tissue culture investigations including&#xD;
      cytotoxic effects in certain cancer cell lines at micromolar to millimolar concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early clinical studies have shown that intravenous and oral doses of vitamin C may improve&#xD;
      symptoms and prolong survival in terminal cancer patients. More recent double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled studies have shown that oral adminstration of vitamin C provides no&#xD;
      benefit to cancer patients. Conversely, intravenous vitamin C administration raises plasma&#xD;
      concentrations as high as 14 mM/L, and concentrations of 1-5 mM/L have been found to be&#xD;
      selectively cytoxic to tumor cells in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed Phase I trial with vitamin C should achieve millimolar concentrations of vitamin&#xD;
      C that have been shown to kill tumor cells in vitro. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD), PK,&#xD;
      possible drug accumulation with repeated dosing, quality of life, pain response, fatigue&#xD;
      status, and hints of efficacy in patients with advanced cancer will be examined.&#xD;
