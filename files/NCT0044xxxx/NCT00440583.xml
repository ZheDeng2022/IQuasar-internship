  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effective of Yt90-Zevalin therapy in patients&#xD;
      with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that have achieved at least an unconfirmed partial&#xD;
      remission after 6 cycles of CHOP therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are the most common lymphoid neoplasm and account for&#xD;
      30% to 40% of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). DLCBL is a potentially curable disease. The&#xD;
      ultimate goals of introducing new modality treatments such as monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      (Ab)-targeted therapy are to increase complete remission (CR) rate and prolong event-free&#xD;
      survival and overall survival.In phase II trials, it was shown that in DLBL the addition of&#xD;
      rituximab to CHOP was feasible, with an increase in ORR, including CR and an increase in the&#xD;
      OS and PFS in patients with DLBL.2 The benefit of R-CHOP was consistent across all subgroups&#xD;
      of patients tested, including good and poor risks according to IPI and independent of younger&#xD;
      than 70 years and older than 70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, new radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies have been established in the therapy of&#xD;
      malignant lymphoma which can induce high remission rates. Radiolabeled antibodies are&#xD;
      particularly effective as lymphoma cells are highly sensitive to radiation. In addition, the&#xD;
      local emission of radiolabeled antibodies is able to destroy cells in close proximity to the&#xD;
      bound antibody (bystander effect) therefore circumventing the problem of limited perfusion of&#xD;
      bulky or poorly vascularized tumors.Ibritumomab is covalently linked to the tiuxetan chelate&#xD;
      and radiolabeled with Yt90, producing Yt90-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Yt90-Zevalin). To optimize&#xD;
      biodistribution, Rituximab is given prior to the radiolabeled antibody.&#xD;
      Yt90-ibritumomab-tiuxetan-treatment was compared to a standard course of Rituximab. ORR in&#xD;
      the Yt90-ibritumomab tiuxetan group was significantly higher than ORR in the Rituximab group&#xD;
      (80% vs. 56% according to International Workshop Response criteria or 73% vs. 47% according&#xD;
      to protocol-defined evaluation of response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since radioimmunotherapy represents a significant advance over unlabeled immunotherapy for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, it is worthwhile to study the&#xD;
      consolidation therapy with Yt90-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Yt90-Zevalin) in patients who achieved&#xD;
      at least unconfirmed partial remission after 6 cycles of CHOP therapy.&#xD;
