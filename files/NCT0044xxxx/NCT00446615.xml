  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2001, an estimated 1.9 million Canadians had chronic renal disease and the number of&#xD;
      patients being treated for end stage renal disease climbed by nearly 20% in 5 years. Many&#xD;
      medications commonly used in elderly patients are excreted by the kidney. Failure to adjust&#xD;
      doses in those with impaired renal function can result in medication overdose, leading to&#xD;
      potentially serious morbidity and mortality. Studies in hospitals and long term care&#xD;
      facilities have found a 19-67% rate of non-compliance with guidelines for medication dose&#xD;
      adjustment in patients with renal insufficiency and in ambulatory care one study found a 69%&#xD;
      rate of non-compliance. Since primary care physicians write 80% of prescriptions for those&#xD;
      aged 65 years, there is a need for interventions to improve prescribing to patients with&#xD;
      renal impairment in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will develop an audit tool and electronic decision support tool that will be&#xD;
      incorporated into the electronic medical record in a large academic family health centre. It&#xD;
      is seen as a preliminary step in a project to assess the effectiveness of a multifaceted&#xD;
      intervention including chart audit, personalized feedback to prescribers, a&#xD;
      pharmacist-facilitated group learning session and the use of an electronic decision support&#xD;
      tool incorporated into the electronic medical record.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This descriptive study will develop and pilot test the tools for a multifaceted intervention&#xD;
      to improve prescribing to patients with renal impairment in primary care. These tools include&#xD;
      a chart audit tool, development of a group learning session and an electronic clinical&#xD;
      decision support tool that will be incorporated into the electronic medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at Stonechurch Family Health Centre, an academic family practice&#xD;
      teaching site of McMaster University. Stonechurch Family Health Centre currently provides&#xD;
      primary care to about 16,000 patients. There are three interdisciplinary clinical teams that&#xD;
      include academic and community family physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses,&#xD;
      RPNs, a pharmacist, social workers and other professionals. Approximately 9.5% of the patient&#xD;
      population is elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stonechurch Family Health Centre uses the Open Source Clinical Application Resource (OSCAR)&#xD;
      system as its electronic medical record (EMR). OSCAR was developed by Dr. David Chan and&#xD;
      colleagues and has the benefit of integrating clinical practice with clinical knowledge and&#xD;
      delivering necessary tools including pharmaceutical and other clinical reference at the point&#xD;
      of care. OSCAR has been used at Stonechurch since April 2002 and the transition from paper&#xD;
      chart to electronic records has been successfully completed for all practices within the&#xD;
      practice site&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Sample Inclusion: Patients over age 65 who have been prescribed one or more of the&#xD;
      targeted medications and who have a creatinine from within the previous year on record will&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions: patients on dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed multifaceted intervention employs a combination of high and low technology&#xD;
      strategies. Following a pre-intervention chart audit, personalized feedback about prescribing&#xD;
      practices will be provided to prescribers. This data will be used to design a curriculum for&#xD;
      a pharmacist-facilitated group learning session for providers about dose adjustments for&#xD;
      patients with renal impairment. Principles from the educational session will be reinforced&#xD;
      through an electronic medical record decision support tool. The tool will consist of a&#xD;
      calculator that will allow prescribers to estimate creatinine clearance. Electronically&#xD;
      delivered lab data will be used to populate appropriate fields in the creatinine clearance&#xD;
      calculator in order to improve the ease of use of this decision support tool. Users will be&#xD;
      prompted to supply missing data and will be advised about necessary dose adjustments for the&#xD;
      targeted medications. The targeted medications are those that have already been determined&#xD;
      through a consensus panel at the Centre for Evaluation of Medicines, McMaster University and&#xD;
      for which dose adjustment guidelines are available and that are being utilized for another&#xD;
      related project to improve dosing of medications in the long term care setting. The list of&#xD;
      included medications and recommended dose adjustments are attached (Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targetted prescriptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of prescriptions written for the targeted medications will be collected. Each&#xD;
      prescription will be reviewed and categorized as appropriate or inappropriate by examining&#xD;
      the drug regimen and creatinine clearance for the patient. Two people will independently&#xD;
      review each prescription and discrepancies will be resolved through concensus. The&#xD;
      appropriateness rating process will be pilot tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients for whom a prescription for the target drug was written, number of times&#xD;
      the electronic decision support tool was accessed and the time between initiation of the&#xD;
      decision support tool and electronic prescribing of the precriotion will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescriber knowledge and comfort with adjusting doses of medications will be measured in a&#xD;
      Likert scale before and after the teaching session. Prescriber assessement of the ease of use&#xD;
      of the decision support tool will be measured through a brief useability survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be a change in the number of appropriately written prescriptions for&#xD;
      the targeted medications 3 and 6 months after the educational intervention and introduction&#xD;
      of the clinical decision support tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prescribers' perception of their knowledge of and comfort with adjusting doses of&#xD;
           medications as measured in a Likert scale and their assessement of the ease of use of&#xD;
           the decision support tool&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cost savings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time for prescribers to use the decision support tool&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of times the decision support tool was used.&#xD;
