      1. Develop a treatment for clinically significant parental bereavement. The proposed&#xD;
           treatment development activities include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Development of a treatment manual, associated fidelity rating forms, and training&#xD;
                aids,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Pre-testing the treatment manual with bereaved parents, and revision in&#xD;
                consultation with treatment development experts,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a randomized, wait-list control, pilot study of the proposed treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Measure treatment-related change in (a) complicated grief symptoms, the primary&#xD;
                outcome variable, which will be assessed using the Inventory of Complicated Grief,&#xD;
                and, (b) marital adjustment, the secondary outcome measure, to be assessed using&#xD;
                the Dyadic Adjustment Scale. These outcomes will be assessed in treatment and&#xD;
                control groups at baseline, at treatment conclusion, and at three month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Test the difference between the treatment and control groups on changes from&#xD;
                baseline to three month follow-up on the exploratory outcome variables of PTSD,&#xD;
                depression, social and work impairment, and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Estimate effect sizes of these differences in changes in outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Develop a proposal for a randomized controlled trial of the treatment, based on the&#xD;
           results of aim 2.&#xD;

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Manual Development: Psychoeducation, Dyadic Communication in Adversity, Stress&#xD;
      inoculation training and skills building, Cognitive processing and restructuring, Exposure&#xD;
      through constructive narrative.Reconstruction of a positive future and relapse prevention..&#xD;
&#xD;
      WAIT-LIST CONTROL STUDY Once the treatment manual is developed, we will move immediately into&#xD;
      pilot testing of the treatment in bereaved families. The design for this pilot study is&#xD;
      repeated measures that compares two groups at three time points of assessment:&#xD;
      (pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, 3 months post-treatment). Although other outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed, the primary outcomes will be a measure of bereavement and a measure of&#xD;
      marital adjustment. The three month follow-up results will be compared to the pre-treatment&#xD;
      results using an intent-to-treat analysis with the last observation carried forward. As&#xD;
      treatment can last from 13 to 16 sessions, the wait-list control group's welfare is of&#xD;
      concern. We will use weekly phone conversations to check in with wait-list participants. If&#xD;
      they appear to be deteriorating, they will be immediately referred for treatment. Wait-list&#xD;
      participants will be offered treatment at the end of the wait-list period. It should be noted&#xD;
      that this contact during the wait-list period represents attention provided to wait-list&#xD;
      participants, and thus makes our design somewhat conservative. It is the primary purpose of&#xD;
      this study to establish preliminary efficacy through investigating effect sizes associated&#xD;
      with the treatment, and to develop a treatment manual, and other required tools to conduct a&#xD;
      full efficacy trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. Participants will be parents living in Israel who have lost a child, are at&#xD;
      least 6 months post loss (following Shear), are over the age of 21, can provide informed&#xD;
      consent, and score &gt; 30 on the Inventory of Complicated Grief. Subjects meeting these&#xD;
      criteria will undergo a structured clinical interview to assess for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Participants will be provided free treatment, and if needed because of income&#xD;
      restrictions will be provided with aid to defray transportation costs to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment. We will be using various methods of recruitment, including press as well&#xD;
      as working with partnering organizations who deal with parental bereavement , and recruitment&#xD;
      through the trained therapists who work in different clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessor Training. Assessors will be trained on all measures They are psychometric measures&#xD;
      and will be used as specified in the manuals that pertain to their use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Assessment. Assessors will be kept unaware of what treatment condition the person&#xD;
      is in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and Bereavement History. In addition to standard demographic information, we&#xD;
      will obtain detailed information about the circumstances surrounding the child's death .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric History. Axis I disorders will be assessed using the Structured Clinical&#xD;
      Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID-1).The SCID is a semi-structured interview commonly used in&#xD;
      research settings to assess a subject's psychiatric history. Bereavement. Adaptation to&#xD;
      bereavement will be measured using the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG).This is a 19 item&#xD;
      self report measure of maladaptive symptoms of loss as described by the authors. Responses&#xD;
      are given on a Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD. PTSD will be measured with both a clinician administered measure (CAPS) and a&#xD;
      self-report measure (PDS).The CAPS is a 30 item interview that provides a diagnosis of PTSD&#xD;
      based on all 17 symptoms of the DSM-IV defined disorder including frequency and intensity of&#xD;
      symptoms. It also provides a measure of the impact of the symptoms on the patient's social&#xD;
      and occupational functioning, the overall severity of the symptom complex, the patient's&#xD;
      global improvement since baseline, and the validity of ratings obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression. Depression will be measured with the SCID-I32 (described above) and the Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory (BDI- II). The BDI (and subsequently, the BDI-II) is the most widely&#xD;
      used instrument for measuring the severity of depression and a 'gold standard' among&#xD;
      self-report measures of depression. It is a 21-item scale, with possible scores ranging from&#xD;
      0 to 63 (higher values correspond to higher depressive symptomatology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suicidality. Will be assessed with the Beck Scale for Suicide Assessment (BSS). This is a&#xD;
      21-item self-report instrument measuring the presence and severity of suicide ideation.&#xD;
      Similar in format to the BDI, each item consists of three statements ranked in intensity from&#xD;
      0 to 2 Marital Impairment. The quality of adjustment in the marital relationship will be&#xD;
      measured using the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS). This 32 item measure is widely used in&#xD;
      clinical and research settings and consists of four subscales: Dyadic Consensus, Dyadic&#xD;
      Satisfaction, Dyadic Cohesion and Affectional Expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Impairment. Impairment in social functioning will be measured using the Social&#xD;
      Adjustment Scale-Self Report which provides scores in the following domains: work, social and&#xD;
      leisure activities, relations with extended family, primary relationship, parenthood, family&#xD;
      life and economic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Procedures. Referred persons will be screened and if they meet criteria will be&#xD;
      matched as noted above for randomization. If persons do not meet criteria they will be&#xD;
      referred for alternative treatment or to the community. Assessments will be conducted by our&#xD;
      assessor/outreach coordinator. Each case will be reviewed at a consensus conference chaired&#xD;
      by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suicidal ideation and plans will be clinically assessed throughout the treatment protocol.&#xD;
      Any participant identified at increased risk because of suicidal ideation will be monitored&#xD;
      closely. A clinical consensus conference will be held and additional treatment will be&#xD;
      recommended and provided as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Fidelity. Treatment sessions will be audiotaped. Treatment fidelity raters will be&#xD;
      trained to an 85% reliability level. Twenty-five percent of sessions will be randomly&#xD;
      reviewed (stratifying for session number) and rated for adherence to protocol. Ten percent of&#xD;
      sessions will be rated by a second rater to insure that reliability is maintained, guarding&#xD;
      against rater drift.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSES The design is a repeated measures (pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3 month&#xD;
      follow-up) comparison of intervention and wait-list control conditions. We will assess&#xD;
      treatment efficacy by examining the change from pre-treatment to the three-month follow-up&#xD;
      score using an intent-to-treat analysis (carrying last observation forward). To avoid the&#xD;
      loss of power associated with testing many hypotheses, we have selected a-priori as primary&#xD;
      outcomes to be analyzed (1) complicated grief symptoms (ICG) and (2) marital adjustment. An&#xD;
      analysis of change scores is equivalent to a repeated measures analysis comparing only&#xD;
      baseline to three-month follow-up. For each outcome measure, an analysis of covariance using&#xD;
      a change score will compare the intervention and wait-list conditions, controlling for the&#xD;
      baseline score on the measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HUMAN SUBJECTS RESEARCH Sources of Data Baseline assessments will include demographic data,&#xD;
      psychiatric history, current psychiatric diagnoses, description of the death of the child,&#xD;
      relationship information, and social functioning information. Only staff working on the&#xD;
      parental bereavement project will have access to subject identities. Any identifying subject&#xD;
      data will be stored separately from the rest of the data. All data will be collected through&#xD;
      in-person interviews and self-report questionnaires. All interviews will be videotaped for&#xD;
      treatment adherence factors. This data will be collected specifically for this research&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks The principal risks for subjects participating in this study include possible&#xD;
      emotional distress as they recall the painful story of the death of their child. The goal of&#xD;
      the present clinical trial is to alleviate emotional distress on a long-term basis. It is&#xD;
      also possible that subjects randomized to the wait-list control will have a deterioration of&#xD;
      symptoms prior to participating in the research protocol. We will monitor this through weekly&#xD;
      15-minute phone check-ins to assess psychiatric status. Immediate treatment referral will be&#xD;
      provided in the event of deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Informed Consent A referral system will be set-up through area churches and&#xD;
      synagogues, parental bereavement support groups, different departments in Mt. Sinai Hospital&#xD;
      (e.g. pediatrics, oncology, emergency medicine, etc), area funeral homes and Sloan Kettering&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital. Members of the parent bereavement referral network will be provided with&#xD;
      detailed descriptions of the program. Informed consent will be obtained in person after the&#xD;
      research clinician presents a description of the treatment as well as the regulations&#xD;
      regarding informed consent. They will be provided with written documentation of the above&#xD;
      information. Ample time will be provided for potential subjects to ask questions. When it is&#xD;
      clear that they understand the purpose of the study and the process of informed consent, they&#xD;
      will be asked to sign and date the consent form if they agree to be in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protection of Subjects Well-Being While bereavement treatment research to date has shown no&#xD;
      harm to subjects and some benefit, a system of monitoring the well being of participants will&#xD;
      be put into place including the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All clinicians providing the manualized treatment will be licensed and trained in the&#xD;
           techniques being applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to beginning the treatment protocol, intensive training and practice of the&#xD;
           manualized treatment will be provided through formalized training sessions for all&#xD;
           clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ongoing supervision will be provided throughout the duration of the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients randomized to the wait-list control will be monitored through weekly phone&#xD;
           conversations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referrals for any participants (focus groups, interviews, wait-list control study&#xD;
           participants, family members involved in treatment) can be made for emergency or other&#xD;
           inpatient or outpatient psychiatric services at Mt Sinai School of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protection of Data Any identifying subject data will be stored separately from all other&#xD;
      patient data. While stored separately, both sets of data will be stored in a locked cabinet&#xD;
      which will be in a locked room. Scientific presentations and publications will not use&#xD;
      subject names and will only use aggregate data. Data entry will be done twice and compared to&#xD;
      establish accuracy. After entry, data will be checked for variable ranges and internal&#xD;
      consistency using SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring Plan A DSMB will be established to monitor the project. In&#xD;
      addition, during all phases of the project, data collection will be monitored monthly by the&#xD;
      PI through individual supervision, project team meetings and random review of session&#xD;
      audiotapes and written transcripts. Monthly reports will be generated noting any problems&#xD;
      encountered in treatment and the drop out of any participants. Any adverse events that occur&#xD;
      during consent or treatment phases will be reported immediately to the PI. Adverse events&#xD;
      will also be reported to the IRB and the NIH. Specifically, all serious adverse events&#xD;
      associated with the study procedures, and/or any incidents involving the conduct of the study&#xD;
      or patient participation, including problems with the consent processes will be reported.&#xD;
      Summaries of safety and study performance information from reports will be provided to the&#xD;
      IRB at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine.&#xD;
