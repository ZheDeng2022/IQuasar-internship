      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer of the cervix (bottom third of the uterus, or womb) can be prevented by regular&#xD;
           Pap tests (also called Pap smears), which check for changes in the cells of the cervix.&#xD;
           Because many women in the United States have regular Pap smears, cervical cancer is not&#xD;
           common in this country. However, the disease is common among women in the Mississippi&#xD;
           Delta because of poor participation in screening programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The major causes of cervical cancer are persistent human papillomaviruses (HPV)&#xD;
           infection by cancer-associated HPV types and lack of screening. These viruses cause an&#xD;
           infection that often goes away by itself, but if it does not go away, over a long time&#xD;
           lead to cervical cancer. HPV causes cervical abnormalities, which are detected by Pap&#xD;
           smears and then treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine whether an at-home self-collection method for obtaining cells from the cervix&#xD;
      can be a simple, safe and inexpensive way to screen for cervical cancer for women who don t&#xD;
      go to the health clinic regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who reside in the counties of Leflore, Sunflower, Washington or Tallahatchie,&#xD;
           Mississippi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women between 26 and 65 years of age who are not pregnant and who have not had a&#xD;
           hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening study participants undergo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The doctor takes a cervical sample using the same self-collection device that women will&#xD;
           use at home to self-collect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pelvic examination and Pap test. For this test, the woman lies on an exam table and the&#xD;
           doctor inserts an instrument called a speculum into the vagina, opening it to see the&#xD;
           cervix. A special brush is used to take a few cells from the cervix. The cells are&#xD;
           placed on a glass slide and sent to a lab for examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervical cell specimen collection using an at-home self-collection kit that participants&#xD;
           will use at home after 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At-home self-collection by participant after 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referral to a doctor for follow-up care, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colposcopy (see below) in all women with a Pap test that is abnormal or positive for HPV&#xD;
           and for some women with a normal smear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colposcopy study participants undergo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The doctor takes a cervical sample using the same self-collection device that women will&#xD;
           use at home to self-collect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colposcopy, an exam in which the doctor examines the cervix using a light and looks&#xD;
           through a magnifying device to see if there is any abnormal tissue on the cervix. During&#xD;
           this exam, the doctor may remove a small sample of tissue to diagnose any abnormality.&#xD;
           Participants also have a sample collected using the self-collection kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At-home cervical sample collection by participant after 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Notification if further medical care is required and treatment if the biopsy looks&#xD;
           abnormal.&#xD;

      Background: Cytology screening programs have effectively reduced cervical cancer incidence&#xD;
      and mortality in the U.S. by greater than 75%. However, these programs requiring repeated&#xD;
      clinician-administered Pap smears do not adequately cover medically-underserved populations.&#xD;
      Based partly on HREB/DCEG etiologic research, we now know that carcinogenic types of human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer. Supported by our&#xD;
      translational work with DCP, HPV DNA testing is already approved by the FDA as an adjunctive&#xD;
      screening modality to cytology in this country and as a primary screening modality to&#xD;
      cytology in this country and as a primary screening modality internationally. A validated&#xD;
      screening program of HPV DNA testing of self-collected cervicovaginal specimens would permit&#xD;
      wider coverage screening than cytology in the populations underserved by cytology-based&#xD;
      testing like the Mississippi Delta region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the technical feasibility (i.e. non-inferiority or equivalence to&#xD;
      cytology for detection of cervical precancer and cancer) of cervical cancer screening based&#xD;
      on self-collection and HPV DNA testing of cervicovaginal specimens from women aged greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 30 years old who live in the Mississippi Delta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: One thousand women will be enrolled during 18 months, including 500 attending&#xD;
      colposcopy due to cytologic abnormality, 250 women who regularly attend a screening clinic,&#xD;
      and 250 unscreened women who have not had a Pap smear within the last 3 years (according to&#xD;
      current screening guidelines) but recruited to attend a screening. Three clinical specimens&#xD;
      will be collected from each woman. A cervicovaginal specimen (for HPV testing) and a cervical&#xD;
      specimen (for cytology and HPV testing) will be collected from each woman by the physician.&#xD;
      At the time of the clinic visit women will be give a kit for self-collection of a second&#xD;
      cervicovaginal specimen (for HPV testing) to be returned by mail within two weeks. All three&#xD;
      specimens from each woman will be tested by two clinical DNA tests that use pooled-probes for&#xD;
      detection of carcinogenic HPV: an FDA-approved signal amplification test (Hybrid Capture 2&#xD;
      from Digene) and a new DNA amplification test (AMPLICOR from Roche) currently in clinical&#xD;
      trials. Specimens will also be tested retrospectively by a research PCR asay that detects 37&#xD;
      HPV types, which will help us evaluate the performance of the two clinical HPV tests. Women&#xD;
      attending their screening visit who test positive by cytology (atypical squamous cells of&#xD;
      undetermined significance or worse) or for carcinogenic HPV will be referred to colposcopy&#xD;
      along with a random sample of HPV negative, cytologic negative women (n equals 100).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: We will compare the clinical performance of HPV DNA testing of self-collected&#xD;
      specimens to that of cytology (at a threshold of atypical squamous cells of unknown&#xD;
      significance (ASCUS) or more severe) for detection of histologically confirmed cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) or more severe (greater than or equal to CIN2).&#xD;
      Cytology results will be based on standard-of-care cytology screening for women attending the&#xD;
      screening visit and repeat cytology for women attending colposcopy. An estimated 150 cases of&#xD;
      greater than or equal to CIN2 will be identified. This is an equivalence study, where we wish&#xD;
      to reject the null hypothesis that HPV self-testing is greater than 10% less sensitive than&#xD;
      cytology. Assuming cytology has a 75% sensitivity for greater than or equal to CIN2, a sample&#xD;
      size of 150 subjects has 84% power (alpha=0.05) (one-sided non-inferiority or equivalence&#xD;
      test of correlated proportions) to rule out a 10% decrement in sensitivity for&#xD;
      self-collection with HPV DNA testing compared with cytology will guide whether the new&#xD;
      technique could be broadly introduced for cervical cancer screening.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Five-hundred women attending colposcopy and 500 women receiving cytology screening,&#xD;
        including 250 unscreened women, will be recruited for the study. Non-pregnant,&#xD;
        non-hysterectomized women aged 26-65 will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women under 26 or over 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women or women having given birth to a child in the past 8 weeks. To insure women&#xD;
        included in the study are not pregnant, we will ask women during the consenting process if&#xD;
        they are pregnant. Women who answer yes for either query will be excluded. Participants&#xD;
        will also receive a reminder call for their 2-week self-collection. At that time, women&#xD;
        again will be asked if they are pregnant. If any woman answers yes, she will be instructed&#xD;
        to not self-collect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who have had a total hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who have an overt cancerous lesion visible upon exam by the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other reasons to exclude women include the inability to speak English, the appearance of&#xD;
        mental incompetence, or refusal to participate or sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
