  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether certain alleles or haplotypes of major histocompatibility complex gene&#xD;
      are associated with AIP in Korean population, we undertook this study with high-resolution&#xD;
      typing for HLA (sequence-based typing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: detection of novel allele associated with AIP in Korean population&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: detection of genetic factor for relapse of AIP during steroid treatment&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Autoimmune chronic pancreatitis (AIP) can be defined as a chronic inflammation of the&#xD;
      pancreas due to an autoimmune mechanism; autoimmunity is responsible for producing the&#xD;
      pancreatic lesion. AIP is a distinctive type of chronic pancreatitis that shows reversible&#xD;
      improvement of pancreatic morphology and function with oral steroid therapy, in comparison to&#xD;
      other types of chronic pancreatitis which hardly respond to various treatments. AIP is&#xD;
      increasingly being recognized to be a worldwide entity. The sudden increment in cases&#xD;
      reported probably reflects the growing awareness of the entity, rather than a rise in the&#xD;
      true incidence. In previous Japanese report, HLA DRB1*0405-DQB*0401 haplotype may be&#xD;
      associated with autoimmune pancreatitis in the Japanese population. However, to date there&#xD;
      was no subsequent data for supporting these results. In addition, this Japanese study had a&#xD;
      limitation in methodology by using a low-resolution typing for HLA. Although this entity is&#xD;
      well responsive to steroid therapy, relapse of AIP during steroid treatment is not uncommon.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there has been no laboratory or genetic predictor for responsiveness to&#xD;
      steroid therapy in patients with AIP. To further clarify and confirm high-risk and protective&#xD;
      genotypes for autoimmune diseases, therefore, high-resolution typing for HLA should be&#xD;
      needed. Thus, to determine whether certain alleles or haplotypes of major histocompatibility&#xD;
      complex gene are associated with AIP in Korean population, we undertook this study with&#xD;
      high-resolution typing for HLA (sequence-based typing).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with autoimmune pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis is mainly based on the following three characteristic findings proposed&#xD;
             by Japan Pancreas Society in 2002: (1)Imaging studies: irregular narrowing of the main&#xD;
             pancreatic duct and diffuse enlargement of the pancreas, (2) Laboratory data: elevated&#xD;
             serum IgG or the presence of autoantibodies, (3) Histological examinations: fibrotic&#xD;
             changes with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the pancreatic tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years and above&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No serious medical or psychological condition that would preclude study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory&#xD;
             tests, and other study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age below 18 years&#xD;
