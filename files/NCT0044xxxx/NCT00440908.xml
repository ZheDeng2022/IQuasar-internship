      The study is a prospective cohort trial utilizing sequential laboratory results from excess&#xD;
      serum obtained from hemodialysis patients (acting as their own controls). The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the impact of converting from reuse to single use of dialyzers on&#xD;
      specific markers of nutrition (pre-albumin) and inflammation (CRP) in hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      followed over a period of 6-months after conversion. The Hypothesis is: Comparing values&#xD;
      obtained at baseline to values at the end of 6-months after conversion from reuse to single&#xD;
      use in the same patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patients with baseline CRP &gt; 5 mg/L: Mean decrease of 5 mg/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In patients with baseline CRP &lt; 5 mg/L: &gt; 95% will remain &lt; 5 mg/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mean serum pre-albumin levels will increase by at least 3 mg/dL. The study population&#xD;
           will be drawn from ~2,900 patients that are currently undergoing hemodialysis in 48&#xD;
           dialysis units that have been identified as continuing to reuse dialyzers and&#xD;
           specifically are using a peracetic acid-based disinfectant (Renalin®), as of February 1,&#xD;
           2007. These facilities will be scheduled to convert to single use of dialyzers between&#xD;
           May and December, 2007. The selection of patients will depend solely on the facility&#xD;
           conversion date, on a first-come, first-served basis. All patients within the dialysis&#xD;
           facility that provide blood specimen for their routine monthly lab draws will be&#xD;
           eligible. The facilities and patients will be enrolled consecutively until the desired&#xD;
           sample size of approximately 2,500 patients is reached&#xD;

      The proposed project is an ancillary quality improvement study that intends to prospectively&#xD;
      track serum markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein or CRP) and nutrition (pre-albumin)&#xD;
      at baseline (within 2-months before conversion from reuse to single use of dialyzers) and at&#xD;
      the end of a 6-month follow-up period after the conversion, in maintenance hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients. The first 2,500 patients from a potential pool of ~2,900 patients from 48 dialysis&#xD;
      units that are scheduled to convert from reuse to single use of dialyzers, will be included&#xD;
      in the study. Apart from routine monthly laboratory measurements, the investigators, in&#xD;
      collaboration with Spectra Laboratories (central lab) will perform measurements of CRP and&#xD;
      pre-albumin on the excess blood (after all the routine blood chemistries have been obtained)&#xD;
      from the patients selected to be part of the study cohort. It is anticipated that the nature&#xD;
      of this study as a quality improvement project, with no additional burden to the patients&#xD;
      since tests will only be performed on excess blood from samples already sent to the&#xD;
      laboratory, and the utilization of the information only in aggregate with no identifiable&#xD;
      personal health information will allow for this study to proceed without the need for&#xD;
      informed consent from each individual patient. It is hypothesized that the survival benefit&#xD;
      that has been observed in some epidemiological studies (including the prior experience at&#xD;
      Fresenius Medical Care, North America) may be accompanied by and/or the result of, reduced&#xD;
      inflammation and/or improvement of nutritional status in patients that are converted from&#xD;
      reuse to single use of dialyzers. The study will compare the difference between the values of&#xD;
      CRP and pre-albumin separately, at baseline and at the end of 6-months after the conversion.&#xD;
      CRP levels are expected to decline while pre-albumin are expected to increase during the&#xD;
      follow-up period. Even with a 20% dropout rate, the study is expected to have &gt;90% power to&#xD;
      detect a change in CRP of &gt;3 mg/L and &gt;99% power to detect a similar change in pre-albumin.&#xD;
      The patients in this study are only a subset of a larger epidemiological study that will&#xD;
      examine the impact of converting from reuse to single use of dialyzers on patient survival.&#xD;
