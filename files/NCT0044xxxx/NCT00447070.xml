  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that certain antiviral therapies, the socalled protease inhibitors, used in the&#xD;
      treatment of HIV infection has an untowarded effect on the blood vessels, promoting early&#xD;
      occurence of atherosclerosis. A a newer protease inhibitor, atazanavir, has been shown to&#xD;
      have no negative effect on the levels of blood cholesterol and it is hypothesized that this&#xD;
      may indicate that atazanavir is less prone to induce atherosclerosis. An early sign of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis is a reduced vasomotion and this study investigate the influence of&#xD;
      atazanavir on functionality of the conduit blood vessels compared to that of &quot;standard&quot;&#xD;
      antiviral therapy.&#xD;

      Indication: Dyslipidemia Type II in HIV-Infected Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives: Change of flow-mediated dilation in the forearm after 6 months using the&#xD;
      protease inhibitor atazanavir in a potent antiviral therapy combination compared with a&#xD;
      combination including current proteinase inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: Changes in plasma lipid profiles and further clinical chemistry&#xD;
      parameters after 6 months of treatment compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a multicenter, observer-blind (measurements of vessel parameters and&#xD;
      statistical evaluation), treatment-controlled, randomized, study with 2 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Total Sample Size: (40-50) eligible randomized patients (20-25 per group) from 2-5&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men and women, 18 to 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV-infection, documented by HIV-antibody ELISA and either positive immunoblot for&#xD;
           HIV-antibodies or presence of HIV1 in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two consecutive Roche Ultrasensitive Amplicor tests showing plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50&#xD;
           copies/ml within 60 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD4 count of &gt; 100 cells/ml during 60 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 weeks prior to study entry (a protease&#xD;
           inhibitor plus 2 NRTIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's treatment history allows, in the opinion of the investigator, atazanavir as&#xD;
           replacement for current PI, i.e. continued viral suppression is expected based upon&#xD;
           patient's treatment history and results of previous resistance testing, if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting LDL-cholesterol &gt; 3.0 mmol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraindications for participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, or&#xD;
           cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 14 days prior&#xD;
           to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any contraindication for study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) (previous exposure&#xD;
           allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous virologic failure on proteinase inhibitor-containing regimens which was not the&#xD;
           consequence of poor adherence to therapy or drug adverse events; i.e. virologic failure&#xD;
           was probably due to lack of potency of drug regimen, and may consecutively have resulted&#xD;
           in protease resistance mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously documented protease resistance mutations which are known to result in&#xD;
           cross-resistance against atazanavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any lipid lowering drugs within 4 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testosterone or anabolic steroids unless stable therapy at least 12 weeks prior to study&#xD;
           entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic glucocorticoids, long-acting inhaled steroids or other immunomodulators within&#xD;
           30 days prior to study entry (prednisone &lt; 10mg/day or equivalent is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug or alcohol abuse, in the opinion of the investigator rendering the patient&#xD;
           unreliable for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in any other drug/treatment study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Atazanavir capsules in daily standard dose (2 x 200 mg once daily) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Continuation of current protease inhibitor&#xD;
