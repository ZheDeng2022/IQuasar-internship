    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether the combination for RAD001 and Nexavar® works&#xD;
      better when given together than they do alone. The purpose of the first phase of this study&#xD;
      is to determine the best dose of RAD001 given with Nexavar®, and to see what effects, good&#xD;
      and/or bad, the study drug has on the subject and the subject's tumor. This study will also&#xD;
      observe side effects experienced by the subject.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite significant progress in understanding the biology of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), it&#xD;
      is estimated that over 35, 000 people in the United States will be diagnosed and&#xD;
      approximately 12, 000 have died from this disease in 2005. Renal cell carcinoma presently&#xD;
      ranks tenth as the leading cause of cancer death and constitutes 3% of all solid neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to many other malignancies, treatment for RCC is limited. Treatment remains a&#xD;
      highly difficult and perplexing challenge due to its resistance to both chemotherapy and&#xD;
      hormone therapy and limited response to cytokines. Despite recent advances in our fundamental&#xD;
      knowledge of RCC biology and development of molecular therapeutics, more clinical research&#xD;
      will be required to best guide our use of these exciting new agents in combination regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of RAD001 and Nexavar®, in current clinical trials with minimal toxicity,&#xD;
      represents a treatment regimen which should be investigated for tolerance and toxicity as&#xD;
      well as initial phase II efficacy. The study is designed to evaluate the MTD. Following the&#xD;
      completion of the phase I, utilizing the MTD, Phase II study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
