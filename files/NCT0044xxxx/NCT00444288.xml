  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, or PCOS, is the most common endocrine disorder in women. Depending&#xD;
      on the strictness of the diagnostic criteria used, it is thought to occur in about 6-10% of&#xD;
      all women, many of whom do not know they have the syndrome. Women with PCOS produce&#xD;
      abnormally high levels of male hormones (hyperandrogenism); this counteracts their ovaries'&#xD;
      ability to make enough of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone needed for normal&#xD;
      menstruation. PCOS is the number one cause of hormonally related infertility and also&#xD;
      increases women's risks for diabetes, high blood pressure, hypercholesteremia, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and certain cancers. It is currently unclear to what extent PCOS and PCOS-associated&#xD;
      traits (hyperandrogenisms, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and coronary artery disease) are the results of&#xD;
      environmental factors or genetic predisposition. Therefore, the NIEHS Program in Clinical&#xD;
      Research is conducting a multi-phase twin study to measure the extent of PCOS heritability&#xD;
      and to identify environmental and genetic factors involved in the development of PCOS. The&#xD;
      proposal described here is for Phase 2 of this study. The goals of Phase 2 are to: 1)&#xD;
      establish more reliable concordance rates and baseline heritability estimates for PCOS in MZ&#xD;
      and DZ twins; and 2) establish a cohort of intact MZ and DZ female twin pairs as a resource&#xD;
      for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, about 1500 individual female twins were identified from the Mid-Atlantic Twin&#xD;
      Registry (MATR) based on self report of a history of irregular periods and/or cystic ovaries&#xD;
      in the MATR General Health Screening Questionnaire. Those twins were surveyed by phone for&#xD;
      other traits associated with PCOS. In Phase 2, the twins most likely to have PCOS based on&#xD;
      their answers to the Phase 1 phone survey will be recontacted for further PCOS screening.&#xD;
      This includes providing a blood sample for measuring bioavailable testosterone (BaT) levels.&#xD;
      Women with elevated BaT levels are likely to have PCOS. The women with elevated levels will&#xD;
      then be asked to undergo a medical evaluation for PCOS confirmation. This includes a physical&#xD;
      exam, medical history, ultrasound, 2-hour glucose tolerance and other biochemical blood&#xD;
      tests, and a Ferriman-Gallwey evaluation for abnormal hirsutism (another characteristic of&#xD;
      PCOS). The women will also be tested for pregnancy and zygosity. Their female co-twins will&#xD;
      be invited to undergo...&#xD;

      Research is conducting a multi-phase twin study to measure the extent of PCOS heritability&#xD;

      and DZ twins; and 2) establish a cohort of intact MZ and DZ female twin pairs with PCOS as a&#xD;
      resource for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, about 1500 individual female twins were identified from the Mid-Atlantic Twin&#xD;
      Registry (MATR) based on self report of a history of irregular periods and/or cystic ovaries&#xD;
      in the MATR General Health Screening Questionnaire. Those twins were surveyed by phone for&#xD;
      other traits associated with PCOS. In Phase 2, the twins most likely to have PCOS based on&#xD;
      their answers to the Phase 1 phone survey will be recontacted for further PCOS screening. One&#xD;
      or both twins in a pair will be screened for elevated levels of testosterone (total and free&#xD;
      testosterone, bioavailable testosterone or BaT; free androgen index or FAI). Hyperandrogenism&#xD;
      is one of the hallmark traits of PCOS and can be exhibited either biochemically (elevated&#xD;
      testosterone) or clinically (hirsutism, acne, hair loss, alopecia, other). If one twin in a&#xD;
      pair has an elevated BaT level, then both twins in the pair will be asked to undergo a&#xD;
      medical evaluation for PCOS confirmation. This includes a physical exam, medical history,&#xD;
      ultrasound, 2-hour glucose tolerance and other biochemical blood tests, and a&#xD;
      Ferriman-Gallwey evaluation for abnormal hirsutism (another characteristic of PCOS). The&#xD;
      women will also be tested for pregnancy and zygosity. Their female co-twins will be invited&#xD;
      to undergo a similar medical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on their PCOS traits, twin pairs in which neither member has elevated testosterone&#xD;
      levels might be asked to undergo the medical evaluation as well. In clinical practice, PCOS&#xD;
      diagnoses are often made on women with normal testosterone levels if they have other certain&#xD;
      PCOS traits. The determination to include pairs in which both members have normal&#xD;
      testosterone levels will be made depending on their collective PCOS traits that they reported&#xD;
      on their Phase 1 survey.&#xD;
