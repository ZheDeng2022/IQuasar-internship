  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chitin microparticles (CMP) has been demonstrated in animal studies that have modelled&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis to be effective against a wide range of common respiratory allergens. It is&#xD;
      an immuneenhancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate safety in a first into man study on 24&#xD;
      human volunteers. The secondary objective is to demonstrate efficacy by chosing subjects that&#xD;
      demonstrate a response to a nasal allergen challenge using grass pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects are being given increasing doses of CMP, supplied as a nasal spray, for 7 days&#xD;
      followed by a nasal allergen challenge with Timothy Grass Pollen extract. Over this period&#xD;
      nasal symptom scores, eosinophil counts and cytokine measurements will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chitin microparticles are a special preparation of chitin. This a long chain polysaccaride&#xD;
      derived from shells of the North Atlantic shrimp. CMP acts a an immunenhancer which improve&#xD;
      immune function by stimulating macrophages and other cells such as T-helper lymphocytes, (Th&#xD;
      cells). In allergies there is an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 cells. Imuneenhancers shift&#xD;
      the balance in favour of Th1 cells. The immunomodulatory properties of CMP have been&#xD;
      demonstrated in animal models against a wide range of respiratory allergens. There have been&#xD;
      no indications of toxic side effects in animal models.&#xD;

             as determined by history, physical examination and screening investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Forced expiratory volume over one second (FEV1) within normal limits (≥ 90% of&#xD;
             predicted, ECCS 1993).&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. A pre-nasal allergen challenge total nasal symptom score sheet on study entry so&#xD;
                  that subjects produce a score of &lt;2 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Non smokers for at least the past 12 months with a pack history ≤ 1 pack years (Pack&#xD;
             years = (n of cigarettes smoked/day/20) x n of years smoked).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. An increase in nasal symptom score of between 4 and 10 following screening nasal&#xD;
             allergen challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements&#xD;
             and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Available to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Negative urinary drugs of abuse screen, determined at screening and in the 24 hours&#xD;
             before the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Negative carbon monoxide test (smokerlyzer) determined at screening and in the 24&#xD;
             hours before the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
