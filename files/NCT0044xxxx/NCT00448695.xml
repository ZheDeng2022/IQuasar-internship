      The objective of this study is to establish the safety of MRI targeted laser thermal&#xD;
      treatment for men with biopsy confirmed early stage low grade single sector prostate cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open-label Phase I study to establish the safety of&#xD;
      interstitial laser thermal therapy (ILTT) in patients with a single site of low grade&#xD;
      (Gleason &lt;7) prostate cancer who have not yet received treatment for their cancer. No control&#xD;
      group will be utilized and all patients will receive laser thermal therapy. The patient will&#xD;
      undergo multimode MRI to determine if a single site of prostate cancer can be localized by&#xD;
      this technique and to localize the tumor in 3 dimensions within the prostate. A multicore (12&#xD;
      + cores) mapping transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate would then confirm that&#xD;
      no other sites of cancer exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will complete quality of life and performance questionnaires. ILLT will be&#xD;
      performed under general anesthetic in a procedure similar to brachytherapy, using transrectal&#xD;
      ultrasound to guide insertion of the laser and monitoring probes into the sector containing&#xD;
      the cancer as visualized by the MR scan. Following the procedure, patients will be assessed&#xD;
      for clinical signs of urinary, rectal, and erectile complications and will complete validated&#xD;
      self-assessment tools on these functions. MRI at 7 days and MRI and biopsy at 6 months will&#xD;
      be used to assess the extent of tissue effect and presence of cancer due to ILTT. Patients&#xD;
      will remain on standard Watchful Waiting surveillance for any further sign of disease&#xD;
      progression. ILLT will not restrict any future treatment of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize the treatment risk, participants in the trial will be staged according to&#xD;
      location of the disease in the prostate. The first 3 participants recruited to the trial will&#xD;
      have targeted loci well separated from the urethra, erectile nerves and the rectum, and so&#xD;
      treatment in this region poses minimal risk of injury to these vital structures. Lesions&#xD;
      sizes measured in this initial stage will be used in planning fiber placement in the three&#xD;
      remaining stages, in which fiber placement is closer to critical structures such as the&#xD;
      urethra (Stage 2), erectile nerves (Stage 3) and rectum (Stage 4).&#xD;

    <description>The Interstitial Laser Thermal Therapy (LTT) procedure is similar to brachytherapy, with fibers and probes inserted trans-perineal using transrectal ultrasound guidance. Patients will be under general anesthetic, and the procedure is expected to last 3 hours. Patients will be able to return home the day of the procedure.</description>
