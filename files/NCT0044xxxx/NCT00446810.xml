      An AGE-rich diet can induce after 2-6 weeks persistent increases in mediators linked to&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction (e.g. TNFÎ±, VCAM-1) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;
      Benfotiamine (BT), the liposoluble derivative of vitamin B1, blocks several pathways common&#xD;
      to hyperglycaemia- and AGE-induced endothelial dysfunction. We have shown that advanced&#xD;
      glycation end products (AGE) of a regular mixed meal can acutely induce vascular dysfunction&#xD;
      in T2DM and that this effects can be prevented by a three days pretreatment with BT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of this study are that chronical treatment with benfotiamine (900 mg/day for 6&#xD;
      weeks) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. prevents postprandial impairment of endothelial function after a high-AGE meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improves fasting endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improves parameters of autonomic function in fasting and postprandial state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improves insulin sensitivity and prevents postprandial increase in insulin resistance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a two to fivefold increase in cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality compared to non-diabetic controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is an early messenger of atherosclerosis and is responsible for&#xD;
      increased vascular permeability, platelet aggregation and adhesion, leucocyte adhesion and&#xD;
      smooth muscle cell proliferation and favours a vasoconstrictive and pro-inflammatory state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postprandial ED occurs not only in patients with CV disease or diabetes, but even in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Distinctive and cumulative effects of hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia on&#xD;
      postprandial ED have been demonstrated. Since postprandial dysmetabolism was linked to CV&#xD;
      disease, the postprandial ED was proposed to be the mechanism connecting them. Considering&#xD;
      that the postprandial state covers most of our daytime, interventions targeting a reduction&#xD;
      in postprandial ED might play a decisive role in atherosclerosis prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the treatment of postprandial ED several therapeutical approaches have been suggested,&#xD;
      such as treatment with folic acid, tetrahydrobiopterin, vitamins C and E,statins etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These approaches aim at reducing postprandial oxidative stress (vitamins C and E, statins and&#xD;
      partly folic acid), postprandial hyperglycemia (insulin), postprandial hypertriglyceridemia&#xD;
      (statins) or have a direct effect on endothelial NO production (folic acid, insulin and&#xD;
      tetrahydrobiopterin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data suggests that advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) might also play a role in the&#xD;
      development of ED, leading to the long-term complications of diabetes and accelerated aging.&#xD;
      AGEs are a heterogeneous group of moieties, one of the most representative being&#xD;
      carboxymethyllysine (CML). Diet is a major source of exogenous AGEs and the food AGE content&#xD;
      is highly dependent on food nutrient composition, as well as on temperature, method and&#xD;
      duration of heat application during cooking. About 10% of ingested AGEs are rapidly absorbed&#xD;
      and partly retained into the body, where they exert different pathological effects including&#xD;
      binding with and activation of receptors for AGE (RAGE). AGE precursors such as methylglyoxal&#xD;
      (MG) can also activate RAGE. Endogenous MG synthesis increases in parallel with hyperglycemia&#xD;
      in vivo. Postprandially, the absorbed and endogenously generated AGEs and MG act&#xD;
      synergistically to decrease vascular function through direct NO scavenging or increased&#xD;
      oxidative stress. Part of these effects can be counteracted by benfotiamine (BT), a&#xD;
      liposoluble vitamin B1 derivative with much higher bioavailability than thiamine. BT,&#xD;
      commonly used in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, is a transketolase activator that&#xD;
      directs glucose substrates to the pentose phosphate pathway. Thus, it blocks several&#xD;
      hyperglycemia-induced pathways, one of them being endogenous AGE and dicarbonyls formation.&#xD;
      We have recently shown that a three day pretreatment with benfotiamine can prevent&#xD;
      postprandial ED in T2DM (Stirban et al, Diabetes Care, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at investigating the effects of a chronical treatment with benfotiamine (900&#xD;
      mg/day for 6 weeks) on parameters of endothelial function and autonomic neuropathy in fasting&#xD;
      and postprandial state in people with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will therefore investigate 30 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a randomized,&#xD;
      cross-over, double blind, placebo-controlled design. Pre- and postprandial endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction (flow mediated dilatation -ultrasound- and reactive hyperemia -laser-doppler-)&#xD;
      will be investigated before and after chronical treatment with benfotiamine. Investigations&#xD;
      will be performed in fasting state as well as 2,4 and 6 hours postprandially.&#xD;
