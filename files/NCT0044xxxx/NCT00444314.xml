  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a histologically confirmed renal cell cancer with a component of&#xD;
             clear cell carcinoma and evidence of metastasis (pure sarcomatoid variant cancers and&#xD;
             collecting duct malignancies will be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one target lesion that can&#xD;
             be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 20 mm with conventional techniques or as greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 2 times the slice width with spiral CT scan (i.e. 10 mm if the CT slice width&#xD;
             is 5 mm, 14 mm if the CT slice width is 7 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have previously received or be currently receiving sunitinib malate&#xD;
             (Sutent) with evidence of disease progression while receiving sunitinib malate (as&#xD;
             evident by new lesions on CT/MRI/bone scan or unequivocal growth in measurable tumor&#xD;
             lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients will be stratified to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A: Patients previously treated with sunitinib malate. At least 4 week washout since&#xD;
             last treatment administered is required before patient is eligible for study. Once&#xD;
             patients meet all other eligibility criteria, they will be treated with Panzem® NCD&#xD;
             alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
             B: Patients currently still on sunitinib. Patients will continue to receive their&#xD;
             current dose/schedule of sunitinib. Once eligibility determined, patients will be&#xD;
             started on Panzem® NCD concurrently with their sunitinib. No drug washout of sunitinib&#xD;
             malate is required for this stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Enrollment to the individual stratification will stop once that stratification&#xD;
             has met its accrual goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ECOG performance status 0-2 (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,200/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dl (patient may be transfused to this&#xD;
                  level)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)less than or equal to 2.5 X institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate cardiac function by history. If the patient has any history of cardiac&#xD;
             disease (prior myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, etc.), a normal&#xD;
             echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan will be required (LVEF greater&#xD;
             than or equal to institutional lower limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No evidence for uncontrolled hypertension as documented by 2 baseline blood pressure&#xD;
             readings taken at least 1 hour apart. The systolic blood pressure must be less than or&#xD;
             equal to 140 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg.&#xD;
             Patients are allowed to be on anti-hypertensive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. No major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, cytokine therapy or other experimental&#xD;
             therapy is permitted within 4 weeks of treatment initiation. Patients must recover to&#xD;
             baseline or grade 1 from any clinically significant adverse event experienced during&#xD;
             those prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients may not be concurrently receiving any other investigational agents while&#xD;
             participating on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with active brain metastases are excluded. Previously treated brain&#xD;
             metastasis will be allowed provided that the patient is clinically stable (off&#xD;
             systemic steroids and not on antiepileptic agents) with a repeat imaging study (within&#xD;
             4 weeks of registration) of the brain confirming stable CNS disease. Patients with&#xD;
             known CNS carcinomatosis or leptomeningeal spread of their disease will be excluded&#xD;
             from this study due to their poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with gastrointestinal abnormalities including inability to take oral&#xD;
             medications, requirement for intravenous alimentation, and malabsorption syndromes&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with type I insulin-dependent diabetes or poorly-controlled type II&#xD;
             insulin-dependent diabetes or a fasting blood glucose of more than 10 mmol/L (200&#xD;
             mg/dL) will be excluded due to difficulty evaluating the tumor metabolic activity&#xD;
             using FDG-PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of myocardial infarction or hospitalization for congestive heart failure&#xD;
             within 12 months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of prior malignancy (except basal cell carcinoma resected with curative&#xD;
             intent) unless resected or treated with curative intent, and disease free for greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 5 years.&#xD;
