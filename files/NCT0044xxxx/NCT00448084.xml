  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use functional MRI (fMRI, a technique that shows what areas of the brain are&#xD;
      active when performing different mental tasks), to examine how the brain in people with&#xD;
      functional movement disorders (FMD) may differ from that in people without FMDs. People with&#xD;
      FMD have movement symptoms they feel they cannot control and that are not due to a known&#xD;
      medical disorder. Previous studies looking at the brain activity of FMD patients have found&#xD;
      areas in the frontal lobe of the brain that appeared overactive. These overactive areas may&#xD;
      make it difficult to perform complex mental tasks. Studying the brain during performance of&#xD;
      these tasks may enhance knowledge about FMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older with an FMD and healthy normal volunteers may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Participants have two visits to the NIH Clinical Center for the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit (screening):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine drug screen for illicit drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological testing, including an interview and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain MRI (if one has not been done at NIH within the past 12 months): MRI uses a&#xD;
           magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. The subject&#xD;
           lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing&#xD;
           earplugs to muffle loud noises that occur during the scanning process. The procedure&#xD;
           lasts about 2 hours, during which time the patient is asked to lie still for up to 30&#xD;
           minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain fMRI: While in the MRI scanner, subjects read questions and answer them yes or no&#xD;
           by pushing buttons. They are asked to answer questions about their health, their&#xD;
           movement symptoms and unrelated topics (like personal preferences and current events).&#xD;
           The questions vary in difficulty. Sometimes subjects are instructed to answer correctly;&#xD;
           other times they are asked to answer incorrectly. A strap is placed around the subject's&#xD;
           chest and two wires are taped to the fingers to monitor heart rate, breathing rate and&#xD;
           sweat response during the scan. The scan takes about 2 hours.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to utilize functional MRI (fMRI) to identify structural brain&#xD;
      regions and activation patterns involved in deception in order to determine whether illness&#xD;
      deception can be differentiated from involuntary conversion disorders. We intend to compare&#xD;
      the brain activations of functional movement disorder (FMD) patients against those of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers in order to determine whether various aspects of the disorder are under volitional&#xD;
      control, suggesting a component of illness deception, or are involuntary as hypothesized in&#xD;
      conversion disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to use up to 35 right-hand dominant adult healthy volunteers (the first five&#xD;
      subjects will be used to develop this method) and 30 functional movement disorder patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a slow event-related design, we will scan subjects using a 3T fMRI scanner while they&#xD;
      are visually presented with survey-based stimuli which require a yes/no response using a key&#xD;
      press. Information used to create the stimuli will be pseudo-randomly derived from one of two&#xD;
      databases. The first database will be created from the information garnered in the survey&#xD;
      subjects will complete during their screening visit (i.e. subjects eye color or height). The&#xD;
      second database will be a collection of non-specific information (i.e. current year, season,&#xD;
      etc.) that intentionally does not apply to the subjects. For each question displayed,&#xD;
      subjects will receive a visual instruction to respond either truthfully or deceptively.&#xD;
      Correct answers to responses will be evaluated based upon the survey the subjects completed.&#xD;
      In addition to the BOLD data collected, we plan to calculate reaction times and acquire&#xD;
      autonomic data in order to identify possible correlates with the brain responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the BOLD-fMRI data collected from subjects while answering&#xD;
      yes-no type questions. Secondary outcome measures will include reaction times and autonomic&#xD;
      data that will be collected simultaneously with the fMRI data. Standard univariate general&#xD;
      linear model analysis will be performed on the fMRI data as well as the use of multivariate&#xD;
      methods, including support vector machine learning. Subgroup analyses will be conducted to&#xD;
      characterize the correlation between reaction times, autonomic data, and fMRI results as well&#xD;
      as potential differences in activation patterns for subject-referenced questions and&#xD;
      questions which are unrelated to the subject.&#xD;
