      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of the study drug (GW679769) on a commonly&#xD;
      used chemotherapy drug (docetaxel) which will be given I.V. Blood samples will be taken to&#xD;
      see if the GW679769 alters the blood levels of the chemotherapy. The study will last about 2&#xD;
      weeks with a final follow-up visit 6 weeks later.&#xD;

             malignancy) which, in the opinion of the investigator, may confound the results of the&#xD;
             study or pose an unwarranted risk to the subject. Subjects with a previous, but not&#xD;
             current, history of alcoholism may be permitted provided that, in the investigator's&#xD;

             dose within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. Topical&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity or contraindication to ondansetron or other 5-HT3 receptor&#xD;
             antagonist, dexamethasone, docetaxel, casopitant, or any component of the above&#xD;
             mentioned medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received an investigational drug within the 28 days or five half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             longer) prior to receiving the first dose of study medication, or is scheduled to&#xD;
             receive any investigational drug during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 (other than steroids described in Exclusion&#xD;

          -  Active peptic ulcer disease (PUD) or a history of PUD of unknown etiology. NOTE:&#xD;
             Subject is eligible to enter and participate in this study if they have a history of&#xD;
             PUD of known etiology with documentation from a gastroenterologist or other qualified&#xD;
             physician of the etiology of the PUD and that effective treatment was provided with&#xD;
             full eradication of ulcers and symptoms. Subjects who present with symptoms of&#xD;
             gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are eligible. However, if the investigator&#xD;
             suspects PUD in such a subject, the subject must have a GI assessment to rule out PUD.&#xD;
             If assessment is negative, subject may enter the study. For these subjects,&#xD;
             appropriate steps must also have been taken to minimize the risk of reoccurrence. If&#xD;
             PUD was non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced, the subject should no&#xD;
             longer be taking NSAID medication(s). If PUD was induced by H. pylori, the subject&#xD;
             should have been appropriately treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stool positive for occult blood. Test may be repeated once if subject did not abstain&#xD;
             from red meat for the previous three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pepsinogen level below the lower limit of laboratory reference range (LLRR).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Troponin level above 10% of the coefficient of variation of the assay as determined by&#xD;
             the laboratory performing the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Calculated QT interval (QTc) &gt; 480 msecs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease that would interfere with participation in the&#xD;
             study as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected iron deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of NSAIDS, including aspirin at any dose, and including COX2 inhibitors. These&#xD;
             medications are prohibited 7 days prior to administration of study drug and for the&#xD;
             duration of the study until 72 hours after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
