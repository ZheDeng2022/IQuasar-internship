  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study that will investigate the effects of proton pump inhibitors (often&#xD;
      used to treat stomach upset) on Gleevec® (a drug that is FDA-approved to treat some types of&#xD;
      cancer) in healthy volunteers. Twelve healthy volunteers (six men and six women) will be&#xD;
      recruited to complete the study. This research study will compare Gleevec® in the body when&#xD;
      taken with and without proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Each volunteer will receive a 400 mg&#xD;
      pill of Gleevec® on two occasions. On one occasion they will take the dose of Gleevec® alone&#xD;
      (without PPI). On another occasion, they will take the Gleevec® after taking 40 mg of PPI&#xD;
      daily by mouth for six days. Several blood samples will be drawn to measure the&#xD;
      concentrations of Gleevec® and its breakdown products in the blood, with and without the&#xD;
      influence of PPI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-institution, randomized cross-over, fixed schedule study of the&#xD;
      effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) on Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec®) pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be recruited to participate in this study such that twelve subjects&#xD;
      (6 men / 6 women) will complete the study. Gleevec® pharmacokinetics will be assessed after&#xD;
      oral administration of Gleevec® and after oral administration of Gleevec® with concomitant&#xD;
      administration of PPI (Prilosec® Delayed-Release Capsules). Gleevec® will be administered at&#xD;
      a dose of 400 mg, and the PPI (Prilosec®) at a dose level of 40 mg daily for 6 consecutive&#xD;
      days. Half of the subjects will receive Prilosec® starting 5 days before Day 1 through Day 1&#xD;
      along with Gleevec® on Day 1, and Gleevec® alone on Day 15. The other half will receive&#xD;
      Prilosec® on Days 10-15, along with Gleevec® on Day 15, and Gleevec® alone on Day 1. On days&#xD;
      that both drugs are administered, the Prilosec® will be administered 15 minutes before the&#xD;
      Gleevec® dose.&#xD;
