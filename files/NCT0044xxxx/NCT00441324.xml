  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In programmes of IVF, normal women undergo controlled ovarian stimulation using exogenous FSH&#xD;
      injections to obtain multiple eggs. The process results in eggs of mixed quality with a broad&#xD;
      range of developmental and implantation potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to determine whether, treatment with recombinant human LH prior to&#xD;
      the FSH injections can improve outcome for women undergoing IVF. High grade embryos implant&#xD;
      with a higher frequency and baby delivery rate than poor quality embryos. The mature oocyte&#xD;
      is the most important determinant of embryo quality. Early follicles, containing immature&#xD;
      eggs, have LH receptors in the theca cells that surround the follicle, and LH stimulates&#xD;
      these cells to produce factors essential for normal follicular development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent of the study was to use recLH treatment prior to recFSH to treat a cohort of&#xD;
      follicles, so that they can all mature together, thus increasing the proportion of high grade&#xD;
      oocytes and their subsequent embryos&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normal women undergoing IVF (Total n = 146; GRI n = 43) were recruited in 4 centres in 3&#xD;
      countries, and all were started on treatment with a depo GnRH-agonist to suppress endogenous&#xD;
      gonadotropin secretion. Block randomisation lead to a distribution 71 untreated cases and 75&#xD;
      cases treated with rec-hLH (Luveris,[Serono]; 300IU/d) for 7 days. On the following days&#xD;
      recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rec-hFSH) stimulation of the ovaries was initiated&#xD;
      using Gonal-f (150IU/d) for approximately 12 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCG (3500IU) was given when &gt;2 mature follicles were seen by ovarian ultrasound, and oocytes&#xD;
      (eggs) were fertilized in vitro after collection between 36 and 38h after the injection.&#xD;
      Embryos were scored for quality, and a maximum of 2 embryos were transferred 2 or 3 days&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results During Luveris treatment the LH concentration was increased by approximately 3 IU/L,&#xD;
      but there was no change in the hormone profiles of androgens or estrogens in blood samples&#xD;
      measured in a central laboratory. Both groups of patients showed an increase in the&#xD;
      circulating anti-mullerian hormone, although there was no difference between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Luveris treated group showed a significant (p=0.007) increase in the number of small&#xD;
      antral follicles, but to a degree that was not different from the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During rec-hFSH stimulation, there was no difference in the duration of FSH injections&#xD;
      required or the total dose, or the total number of follicles seen, or the hormone profiles&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Luveris pre-treated group showed a slight (not significant) increase in oocyte yield. In&#xD;
      this group there was a significant increase in the normally fertilized embryo yield (no&#xD;
      treatment mean = 5.1; Luveris treatment mean = 7.0: p= 0.038).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion The observations of negligible effects of LH upon the hormone profiles may be&#xD;
      explained by the fact that the hormone concetrations were at the lower limit of sensitivity&#xD;
      of the assay methods, and they do not preclude an effect within the follicles. We did observe&#xD;
      effects upon follicular development in the ultrasound profiles. Effects upon hormone profiles&#xD;
      may require both hormones (LH and FSH) to be present at the same time (instead of in&#xD;
      sequence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The small effect of the pre-treatment upon normal embryo yield may be an important&#xD;
      observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion These results demonstrate that treating follicles with LH prior to FSH, may lead&#xD;
      to the development of more viable follicles than with FSH treatment alone. This should lead&#xD;
      to improved regimes of ovarian stimulation and improve the outcome potential for women&#xD;
      undergoing IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future Research Exploration of this phenomenon will be required in order to maximise any&#xD;
      potential benefit from the process. There are numerous sub-groups of patients who may&#xD;
      possibly benefit, including poor responding patients, but further data are required.&#xD;
