      Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. Hormonal&#xD;
      ablation, in the form of medical or surgical castration is the cornerstone of management for&#xD;
      metastatic prostate cancer however, treatment options for a patient in whom androgen ablation&#xD;
      fails are limited. Second-line hormonal agents are generally associated with low response&#xD;
      rates and no documented survival benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, chemotherapy was not considered to have significant activity in hormone&#xD;
      refractory prostate cancer (HRPCa). This view has changed within the past 10 years, partly&#xD;
      because of the availability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements to monitor tumor&#xD;
      burden. Although it seems that chemotherapy, either as a single agent or combination of&#xD;
      agents may lead to clinical responses, reduction in PSA measurements, pain control, or&#xD;
      improved quality of life, no benefit in overall survival has been definitively proven. The&#xD;
      current standard of care for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer is hormone therapy&#xD;
      (androgen blockade).3,4 When this strategy is no longer effective, few good treatment options&#xD;
      are left. For this reason, prostate cancer research has aimed to identify new therapeutic&#xD;
      modalities to increase the impact of these parameters as well as prolong patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 24 men with prostate cancer ranging from non-metastatic rising PSA only disease to&#xD;
      bony metastatic disease will be enrolled in the study. All patients will have failed androgen&#xD;
      treatment and at least one prior taxane chemotherapy or have refused chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out of the 24 patients, 12 patients will be treated using TroVax® and 12 will be treated&#xD;
      using TroVax® plus GM-CSF.&#xD;
