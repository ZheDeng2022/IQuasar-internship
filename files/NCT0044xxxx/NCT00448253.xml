    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of three doses of NP-015 (210, 420&#xD;
      or 840 units TNA) in healthy volunteers. To evaluate the safety of NP-015 based on adverse&#xD;
      events and laboratory assessments. To determine the dose proportionality relation of three&#xD;
      different doses of NP-015.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The test product is Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), NP-015.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The product is supplied as a sterile liquid suitable for IV administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Product potency is expressed in units of anthrax toxin neutralization assays(TNA) per&#xD;
           vial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study is a phase 1, placebo controlled, dose-ranging study in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
           Subjects will receive one of three NP-015 doses (210, 420 or 840 units TNA) or equal&#xD;
           volumes of saline placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrolment will be sequential, starting at the lowest NP-015 dose with accrual into the&#xD;
           next higher dose after all patients at the lower dose have been treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first 3 Cohorts: The Subjects will be recruited in cohorts of 24, with placebo&#xD;
           controls included in each dosing group. In each cohort, subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
           receive either NP-015 (N = 18/dosing group) or placebo (N = 6/dosing group). For Cohort&#xD;
           4: 20 Subjects will be recruited and dosed at the highest dose with 2 additional product&#xD;
           lots (10 subjects per lot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be drawn over 84 days. Plasma will be tested for anti-anthrax antibodies&#xD;
      by a protective antigen (anti-PA) ELISA and toxin neutralization assay (TNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serological testing for HIV, HBV and HCV will be conducted at screening to determine&#xD;
           eligibility. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) and serological testing for HIV,&#xD;
           HBV and HCV will be conducted at baseline (day -1) and at the final visit (day 84 or&#xD;
           early withdrawal). NAT for parvovirus B19 will be conducted at baseline (day -1), day&#xD;
           14, and the final visit (day 84 or early withdrawal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety data will be collected throughout the 84-day study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening (within 28 days prior to Baseline):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of admission criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, general physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram and&#xD;
           concomitant medications will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, viral serology (anti-HIV-1/2, Anti-HCV, HBsAg,&#xD;
           anti-HBc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum pregnancy test for all female subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug screen (urine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood collection for anti-PA antibody and toxin neutralization assay (TNA) assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (Day -1, within 24 hours prior to Day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of admission criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of brief physical exam, vital signs, weight, hematology, blood chemistry,&#xD;
           urinalysis, and concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of haptoglobin and free hemoglobin levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Update of medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NAT testing for HIV, HBV, HCV and parvovirus B19, and serological testing for HIV, HBV&#xD;
           and HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum pregnancy test for all female subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol (urine) and drug screen (urine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood collection for baseline anti-PA antibody and TNA assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be required to stay overnight following their baseline assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      NP-015 Administration (day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following baseline assessment, NP-015 will be administered intravenously&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis will be performed at the end of the infusion period (appearance and color,&#xD;
           specific gravity, protein, glucose, pH, occult blood, ketones, microscopic examination)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments following the completion of NP-015 administration (1, 3 and 8 hrs; days 1, 3, 5,&#xD;
      7, 9, 11, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56 and 84 or early withdrawal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following NP-015 administration, blood will be collected for anti-PA antibody ELISA&#xD;
           analysis and TNA assessment at each of the respective times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of vital signs, adverse events and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 84 or early withdrawal: Assessment of hematology, blood&#xD;
           chemistry and urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1: Assessment of haptoglobin and free hemoglobin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 14: NAT for parvovirus B19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 28: serum pregnancy test for female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final (day 84 or early withdrawal) visit: a general physical exam, serum pregnancy test&#xD;
           for female subjects, and viral marker testing (NAT for HBV, HCV, HIV and parvovirus B19,&#xD;
           and serology for HIV, HBV and HCV) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cohort 4 there will be no anti anthrax antibody testing and the subjects will be assessed&#xD;
      for safety only, up to day 28.&#xD;
