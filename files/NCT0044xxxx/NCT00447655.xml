      Limb loss can result from a variety of etiologies including diabetes, trauma and cancer.&#xD;
      Following limb loss, individuals are at elevated risk for activity limitations and&#xD;
      participation restrictions with significant impact on health and quality of life.&#xD;
      Intervention: Working with the Amputee Coalition of America we have developed, evaluated, and&#xD;
      established the effectiveness of a self-management program (PALS) to improve health and&#xD;
      outcomes following limb loss. Literature suggests that the access to, and effectiveness and&#xD;
      utilization of, this class of interventions may be enhanced by the concerted use of early&#xD;
      intervention, peer mentorship, motivational interviewing and provider training. Objectives:&#xD;
      Our goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of an enhanced, early self-management intervention-&#xD;
      PALS Plus. The specific aims are:1) evaluate the effectiveness of the PALS Plus intervention&#xD;
      in improving outcomes for persons with limb loss; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the PALS&#xD;
      Plus intervention in maximizing utilization of self-management interventions for persons with&#xD;
      limb loss. A cohort of 200 patients will be enrolled prior to implementation of the&#xD;
      intervention and will serve as the control group. Subsequently, a second cohort of 200&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled and receive the PALS Plus intervention and will serve as the&#xD;
      intervention group. Assessment will be at baseline, treatment completion and six month&#xD;
      follow-up. Outcomes: Primary outcome measures are: pain, depressed mood, and positive mood.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are: function, participation and bothersomeness of limitations.&#xD;
      The investigation will also provide unique and valuable information regarding patients'&#xD;
      acceptance and use of peer visitation and self-management following limb loss. Relevance: By&#xD;
      establishing the utility and effectiveness of the enhanced self-management intervention,&#xD;
      there is the potential to improve the health, activity, participation and quality of life for&#xD;
      individuals with disabilities. The intervention addresses the areas of activity and&#xD;
      participation in such a way that it can be implemented in local health care facilities&#xD;
      working in combination with a national consumer based organization - the Amputee Coalition of&#xD;
      America.&#xD;

      Plus intervention in maximizing utilization of self-management interventions for persons with&#xD;
      limb loss. Study Design and Participants: The prospective clinical trial will use a two&#xD;
      group, lagged-control design to evaluate the intervention at five health care facilities. A&#xD;
      cohort of 200 patients will be enrolled prior to implementation of the intervention and will&#xD;
      serve as the control group. Subsequently, a second cohort of 200 patients will be enrolled&#xD;

      will be at baseline, treatment completion and six month follow-up. Outcomes: Primary outcome&#xD;
      measures are: pain, depressed mood, and positive mood. Secondary outcome measures are:&#xD;
      function, participation and bothersomeness of limitations. Improvements in primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will result through the impact on self efficacy, patient activation,&#xD;
      catastrophizing and social support. The investigation will also provide unique and valuable&#xD;
      information regarding patients' acceptance and use of peer visitation and self-management&#xD;
      following limb loss. Relevance: By establishing the utility and effectiveness of the enhanced&#xD;
