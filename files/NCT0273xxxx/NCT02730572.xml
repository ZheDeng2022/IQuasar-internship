      The primary purpose of this study is to identify whether, after adjustment for confounders&#xD;
      via stratification on a propensity score and adjustment for calendar year, the combined&#xD;
      endpoint consisting of #1 to #4 (1. switching back to Concerta, 2. changing the use of&#xD;
      immediate release [IR] methylphenidate, 3. beginning a new attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
      disorder [ADHD] medication, or 4. stopping both Concerta and the long acting [LA]&#xD;
      methylphenidate {authorized generic [AG] methylphenidate or equivalent generic [EG]&#xD;
      methylphenidate} that was begun on the index date), differs between participants who switch&#xD;
      from branded Concerta to the EG formulations versus participants who switch from branded&#xD;
      Concerta to the AG formulation.&#xD;

      This is a retrospective cohort study based on a health claims database, the Truven Commercial&#xD;
      Claims and Encounters (CCAE) database. Participants will enter the cohort when, after using&#xD;
      Concerta continuously for at least 60 days after October 3, 2012, they receive a dispensing&#xD;
      of the AG or EG formulation within 15 days of the end of the days of Concerta supplied. The&#xD;
      date of that dispensing of the AG or EG formulation is the participants index date. This&#xD;
      study will track various events, example, back-switches, and methylphenidate dose changes&#xD;
      over time (the 60 days before the switch from Concerta to an AG or EG generic compared to the&#xD;
      60 days after that switch).&#xD;
