    <textblock>
      Some individuals who are exposed to traumatic events experience both psychological and&#xD;
      cardiovascular changes that affect their health and well-being. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to learn more about how reducing the psychological symptoms (such as those that occur with&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD) affects cardiovascular systems that regulate heart&#xD;
      and blood pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a fundamental gap in the understanding of how a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD) portends excess risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). This is primarily&#xD;
      because of two reasons: (1) the core studies which provide support for an association between&#xD;
      PTSD and CHD risk depended on lengthy follow-up periods with no repeat measurement of either&#xD;
      PTSD or other related cardiovascular risk factors; (2) PTSD is highly comorbid with both&#xD;
      adverse health behaviors and with psychiatric comorbidity that also vary across time and&#xD;
      could largely explain the association between PTSD and increased risk of CHD. The long-term&#xD;
      goal is to better understand whether there is a direct link between PTSD and CHD risk, as&#xD;
      well as to ascertain the role of candidate pathophysiological mechanisms. The study proposed&#xD;
      in this application is designed to examine how changes in PTSD symptoms following an&#xD;
      established therapeutic intervention (Cognitive Processing Therapy) affect CHD disease&#xD;
      pathways in individuals with PTSD. This design will permit an evaluation of the hypothesis&#xD;
      that individuals who show significant improvement in PTSD symptoms will also show improvement&#xD;
      in CHD risk biomarkers, and individuals who fail to show improvement or show worsening PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms, will show no change or worsening in CHD biomarker activity. The study will also&#xD;
      provide an evaluation of the role of key stress-related CHD biomarkers as mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the increased CHD risk burden associated with PTSD. Choice of CHD biomarkers&#xD;
      focused on the established association of PTSD with chronic activation of stress response&#xD;
      systems and includes autonomic nervous system dysregulation, chronic systemic inflammation,&#xD;
      and vascular endothelial dysfunction. The proposed research is significant because it is&#xD;
      expected to provide knowledge of the role of both the direct impact of PTSD symptoms on CHD&#xD;
      risk pathways and the role of these systems as candidate mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      relationship between PTSD and CHD risk. By better defining how PTSD is a risk factor for CHD,&#xD;
      as well as identifying the disease pathways involved, the proposed study will help inform&#xD;
      strategies for CHD prevention, as well as guide optimal medical management for vulnerable men&#xD;
      and women with PTSD, especially in those who refrain or who are refractory to psychiatric&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
