      Hyo-mandibular suspension has been previously studied as a treatment for obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA) and has shown to be highly effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multi-center, registry during which 30 subjects with OSA will be&#xD;
      considered for hyo-mandubular suspension treatment. After obtaining informed consent and&#xD;
      meeting all inclusions and exclusion criteria, subjects will be treated using the Encore&#xD;
      System. Subject follow-up with the physician or nurse will occur at one (1) week, one (1)&#xD;
      month, three (3) months, and twelve (12) months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the effectiveness of hyoid suspension in reducing the apnea-hypopnea&#xD;
      index (AHI), and improving the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), snoring (VAS) and functional&#xD;
      outcome (FOSQ) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In addition, the study&#xD;
      will evaluate the effect that the change in hyoid position has on the airway anatomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has become a major heath problem in the United States. With&#xD;
      prevalence in middle-aged adults of 2 to 4% of the population, untreated OSA has been&#xD;
      implicated in increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and heart&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first line and most common treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) treatment, utilized by an estimated 3 million Americans. CPAP is effective in reducing&#xD;
      the AHI if used properly. However, the nasal mask required for CPAP during sleep leads to&#xD;
      poor acceptance and compliance rates. Published studies on CPAP have shown that only 58 to&#xD;
      80% of patients accept CPAP therapy,, and further 65 to 90% of these patients exhibit&#xD;
      long-term compliance with CPAP. Additionally, there are many patients who would choose other&#xD;
      therapy besides CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients cite a number of issues with CPAP, namely discomfort and inability to sleep while&#xD;
      connected to an air pump. Auto-titrating CPAP, heated and humidified air, and bi-PAP&#xD;
      (different pressures on inspiration and expiration) have improved patient compliance, but&#xD;
      there remains a significant unmet clinical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is widely accepted that the region behind the tongue is a major site of collapse during&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea. In fact, there are many surgical procedures performed currently to&#xD;
      address tongue base collapse. These include: RF ablation (Somnoplasty) of the tongue base;&#xD;
      genioglossus advancement; Medtronic's Repose system for tongue base suspension; hyoid&#xD;
      suspension; and maxillomandibular advancement (MMA). The change in airway dimension after MMA&#xD;
      surgery on the lateral cephalograph is presented in Figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the principal mechanisms of effect of MMA surgery is to move the base of the tongue&#xD;
      and the attached structures forward. Hyo-mandibular suspension has been previously studied as&#xD;
      a treatment for OSA and has shown to be highly effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multi-center, registry during which 30 subjects with OSA will be&#xD;
      considered for hyo-mandubular suspension treatment. After obtaining informed consent and&#xD;
      meeting all inclusions and exclusion criteria, subjects will be treated using the Encore&#xD;
      System. Subject follow-up with the physician or nurse will occur at one (1) week, one (1)&#xD;
      month, three (3) months, and twelve (12) months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the effectiveness of hyoid suspension in reducing the apnea-hypopnea&#xD;
      index (AHI), and improving the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), snoring (VAS) and functional&#xD;
      outcome (FOSQ) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In addition, the study&#xD;
      will evaluate the effect that the change in hyoid position has on the airway anatomy.&#xD;
