  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with T2-T4a N0 urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC) with residual disease after&#xD;
      transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB, surgical opinion, cystoscopy or radiological&#xD;
      presence) will receive 3 cycles of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) at the dose of 200mg 3 weekly&#xD;
      prior to surgery (radical cystectomy). Cystectomy will be planned to be done within 3 weeks&#xD;
      of the last dose (accounting for a total of 9 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) scan and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (FDG-PET)/CT scan will be done during screening and before surgery. After cystectomy,&#xD;
      patients with the evidence of pathologic stage T3-4 (pT3-4) and/or pathologically&#xD;
      node-positive disease will be managed according to local guidelines. Further anti&#xD;
      programmed-death (PD)-1 or anti PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy will not be given&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD-L1 status will be centralized and assessed on TURB specimen using an anti-PD-L1 antibody&#xD;
      (Ab) and a prototype immunohistochemical (IHC) assay. PD-L1 positivity will be defined as any&#xD;
      staining in the stroma or in ≥1% of tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathologic complete response (pCR) is the primary endpoint. All patients enrolled who receive&#xD;
      at least 1 cycle of study drug will be includes in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alternative hypothesis (H1) is pCR ≥20% and null hypothesis (H0) pCR≤10%. A 2-stage&#xD;
      design will be used to estimate the number of pts required. Out of 90 pts overall, with the&#xD;
      first stage of 49 pts, ≥6 pCR will be required in the first stage, and ≥13 pCR in the whole&#xD;
      study population (80% power and a 2-sided test of significance at the 10% level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative research on tissue/blood samples will include immune-cell profiling in tumor and&#xD;
      blood during Pembrolizumab, cytokine assessment, and molecular profiling of tumor samples.&#xD;
