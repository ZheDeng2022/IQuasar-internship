    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the role of addition of an anti-angiogenic agent&#xD;
      (Nintedanib/placebo) to conventional combination chemotherapy as concomitant and maintenance&#xD;
      treatment in primary advanced or with first relapse of endometrial cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase 2 study is&#xD;
      evaluating combination chemotherapy with nintedanib in patients with primary advanced stage&#xD;
      (3C2 &amp; 4), or with first relapse of endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are stratified according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stage of disease (stage 3C2 vs. stage 4 vs. recurrent disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Disease status (Measurable disease vs. non-measurable /RECIST 1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to one of the two treatment arms 1:1 randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Paclitaxel and Carboplatin (6 courses) and Nintedanib (until PD). (Experimental&#xD;
           arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Paclitaxel and Carboplatin (6 courses) and Placebo (until PD) (Control Arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is PFS. 148 patients to be enrolled.&#xD;
