      The purpose of this study is to further evaluate and adjust the photoacoustic flow cytometry&#xD;
      device and its use in detecting circulating emboli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Cohort 1: Normal healthy volunteers will be enrolled to further adjust the&#xD;
      device settings. Cohort 2: Use the Phatoacoustic flow cytometry (PAFC) to detect circulating&#xD;
      emboli in vivo in patients with venous thromboembolism at diagnosis, during and after&#xD;
      anticoagulation therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laser beam from the investigational device Phatoacoustic flow cytometry PAFC will be applied&#xD;
      to skin and underlying blood vessels. The optical and ultrasound signal will be collected for&#xD;
      analysis. On each tested vessel, we will estimate the vessels diameter (using optical or/and&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging). The subject's skin pigmentation will be classified as light, medium, or&#xD;
      dark. A photoacoustic (PA) contrast will be considered usable for detection of circulating&#xD;
      emboli if the photoacoustic signal from the vessels is more than 1.3-fold higher than the&#xD;
      photoacoustic signal from surrounding tissue. The device for subjects enrolled on cohort 2&#xD;
      will be completed on day 0 (immediately after venous thromboembolism diagnosis and prior to&#xD;
      anticoagulation therapy), day 7 ± 3 days after initiation of anticoagulation therapy, one&#xD;
      week ± 3 days after completion of planned anticoagulation therapy and one month ± 3 days&#xD;
      after completion of planned anticoagulation therapy. Anticoagulation therapy is part of the&#xD;
      patient's normal standard of care and is not part of this study however data from what&#xD;
      therapy was received may be captured. D-dimer test will be performed on each time point as&#xD;
      part of their normal standard of care however if the D-dimer test is not ordered as part of&#xD;
      the standard of care it will be required for the study.. Patients will then be followed in&#xD;
      hematology clinic to monitor the venous thromboembolism recurrence every 3 months for one&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
