  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG) and lamivudine (3TC) are indicated in combination with other&#xD;
      antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)&#xD;
      infection. Fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets of existing approved drugs are preferred by&#xD;
      many patients and offer the potential for increased patient adherence and consequently a&#xD;
      reduced likelihood of virological failure and viral resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of two&#xD;
      experimental FDC tablets of DTG and 3TC relative to co-administration of the single entity&#xD;
      products in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as a randomized, open label three-way, crossover design with 6&#xD;
      treatment sequences in approximately 30 subjects. Each subject will have a screening visit&#xD;
      within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug, three treatment periods each with a&#xD;
      single dose of study drug and a follow-up visit within 7-14 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug. There will be at least 7 days washout between dosing periods. The total duration of&#xD;
      participation of a subject in this study will be approximately 9 weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not&#xD;
             specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference&#xD;
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in&#xD;
             consultation with the Medical Monitor if required agree and document that the finding&#xD;
             is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt;= 50 kilogram (kg) (110 pounds [lbs.)] for men and &gt;= 45 kg (99 lbs) for&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male or Female&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Non-reproductive potential defined as: Pre-menopausal females with one of the&#xD;
