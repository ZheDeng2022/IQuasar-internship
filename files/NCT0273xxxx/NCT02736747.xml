  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stroke has been described as the third cause of death and main cause of disability in the&#xD;
      worldwide population. About 60% of the survivors are able to walk following the&#xD;
      rehabilitation process, however deficits on lower limbs functions often persists in most&#xD;
      cases, affecting the gait and functional mobility. In this sense, several interventions are&#xD;
      applied in the clinical practice to optimize the functional performance. Cryotherapy is one&#xD;
      of the most used techniques aiming to reduce spasticity temporarily, allowing the training of&#xD;
      functional tasks, such as walking. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the immediate&#xD;
      effects of cryotherapy (ice pack) on neuromuscular performance, proprioception, passive&#xD;
      resistance of dorsiflexors and plantarflexors muscles, and also on gait performance in&#xD;
      chronic post-stroke subjects. Eighteen chronic hemiparetic subjects will participate in this&#xD;
      crossover placebo-controlled trial. The order of intervention (cryotherapy or placebo) will&#xD;
      be randomized. Fifteen days of washout period will be considered. The cryotherapy/placebo&#xD;
      will be applied on the posterior area of the leg for 20 minutes. Initially Fugl Meyer will be&#xD;
      applied. All other assessments will be performed before and after intervention: spasticity&#xD;
      level, classified according to Modified Ashworth Scale; temporo-spatial and angular&#xD;
      parameters for trunk, hip, knee and ankle during gait, using a motion analysis system&#xD;
      (Qualysis AB, Gothenburg, Sweden); the proprioception (joint position sense), passive&#xD;
      resistance to stretching, isometric and isokinetic torques during contractions of&#xD;
      plantarflexors and dorsiflexors of the ankle, evaluated through isokinetic dynamometer.&#xD;
      Concomitantly, bilateral activation of soleus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and peroneus&#xD;
      will be assessed by electromyography during isokinetic dynamometer assessment and gait. The&#xD;
      following electromyographic variables will be analyzed: maximum activation amplitude, muscle&#xD;
      onset, coactivation index between agonists and antagonists. For statistical analysis,&#xD;
      normality (Shapiro Wilk) and homogeneity (Levene) tests will be applied. If the variables&#xD;
      have a distribution considered normal and homogeneous, Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures&#xD;
      will be applied. Otherwise, non-parametric statistics (Friedman test) will be applied. A&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05 will be considered for all statistical tests.&#xD;

    <description>The post-evaluation will be performed immediately after the end of the intervention (cryotherapy or placebo, applied for 20 minutes). A motion analysis system (Qualysis AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) will be used for kinematic data collection during gait. Passive reflective markers will be placed on the anatomical landmarks (anatomical markers) according to the International Society of Biomechanics. In addition, clusters will be placed on T4, L2 and bilaterally on the lateral portion of the thighs and legs. Following markers and clusters placement, a static posture (duration: 10 seconds) will be performed with the subjects in orthostatic position. Then dynamic data will be collected during walking in the self-selected comfortable speed (10 trials). The displacement (°) of the joints of the trunk, hip, knee and ankle during heel strike, stance phase and balance phase will be calculated during gait.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 20 minutes (immediately post-application of cryotherapy or placebo)</time_frame>
    <description>The post-evaluation will be performed immediately after the end of the intervention (cryotherapy or placebo, applied for 20 minutes). The joint position sense (proprioception) test will be performed on an isokinetic dynamometer. The participants will be seated and blindfolded. Initially, the dynamometer will move the foot toward references angles (for dorsiflexion or plantarflexion). Then, subjects will be allowed to sense the reference angle for 10 seconds before the ankle is returned passively to the start position. Subsequently, the foot will be moved passively by the dynamometer toward the reference position (for dorsiflexion or plantarflexion), and subjects will press a button in their hand that will stop the machine when they feel the position has been reached. The absolute error (in degrees) will be calculated as the difference between the indicated and reference positions.</description>

    <description>The post-evaluation will be performed immediately after the end of the intervention (cryotherapy or placebo, applied for 20 minutes). The assessment of passive resistance for plantarflexion and dorsiflexion muscles will be performed on an isokinetic dynamometer. The equipment will passively move the foot in a series of 6 repetitions in the movements of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. Both responses to slow and fast passive stretching will be evaluated. Passive torque peak (N.m) of plantarflexors and dorsiflexors of the ankle will be recorded.</description>
