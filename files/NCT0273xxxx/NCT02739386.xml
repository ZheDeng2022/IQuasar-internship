      The research questions to be addressed by this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the prevalence of ipilimumab use among adults with a history of autoimmune&#xD;
           disease that received treatment with ipilimumab for advanced melanoma?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do melanoma patients with a history of autoimmune disease experience complications that&#xD;
           require hospitalization related to their underlying autoimmune disease following&#xD;
           treatment with ipilimumab?&#xD;
