      The purpose of this research study is to test a new way to deliver oncology and palliative&#xD;
      care for patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The goal of this study is to test a model where oncology and palliative care work&#xD;
           together to care for participants with metastatic breast cancer who were recently&#xD;
           admitted to the hospital or have new or worsening cancer involving their brain or the&#xD;
           fluid around the brain or spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators are studying whether participants who receive care from both teams&#xD;
           have better communication about their care and improved quality of life and mood&#xD;
           compared to those receiving care from only their oncologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to conduct a randomized trial testing the&#xD;
      impact of the collaborative palliative and oncology care model or standard oncology care&#xD;
      models among patients with poor prognosis metastatic breast cancer. Participants assigned to&#xD;
      the intervention arm will participate in a series of structured palliative care visits,&#xD;
      following tailored clinical practice guidelines previously developed for patients with&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study tests whether or not the earlier introduction of a team of clinicians&#xD;
      that specialize in the lessening (palliation) of symptoms and addressing quality of life&#xD;
      concerns may improve the end-of-life care, quality of life, and mood of women with poor&#xD;
      prognosis metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palliative care is a specific type of medical care given to patients to improve their pain&#xD;
      and other symptoms like fatigue, and to support patients and their families as they cope with&#xD;
      their illness. Palliative care includes physicians and advanced practice nurses who have been&#xD;
      specifically trained in how to help patients with serious illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasingly, the role of palliative care has been shown to benefit patients when introduced&#xD;
      early in the disease trajectory. For example, in patients with metastatic (or spread) lung&#xD;
      cancer, early involvement of palliative care improves patients' quality of life and mood.&#xD;
      Patients with some metastatic cancers, like breast cancer, have an unpredictable disease&#xD;
      trajectory, which makes it difficult to determine the best time to introduce palliative care&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
