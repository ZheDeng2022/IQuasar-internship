  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization reported that Thailand ranked third for number of road&#xD;
      fatalities at 38.1 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010. Most of these cases were admitted to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory interventions such as intubation and mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation that can lead to a common problem of pulmonary complications such as pneumonia&#xD;
      and atelectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence supports the effectiveness of chest physical therapy technique (CPT) to improve&#xD;
      alveolar collapse and remove pulmonary secretion. A previous study has shown that the&#xD;
      positive airway pressure technique reduced work of breathing (WOB) and re-inflated lung&#xD;
      atelectasis. The use of positive pressure devices has been part of physiotherapy intervention&#xD;
      since intermittent positive pressure breathing was introduced in clinical practice. In&#xD;
      intensive care settings, the use of positive pressure by physiotherapists includes manual&#xD;
      hyperinflation (bagging or bag squeezing), which has been shown to increase oxygenation and&#xD;
      mobilize excessive bronchial secretions, and to re-inflate collapsed areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual hyperinflation technique (MHI) is provided for use in patients with lung atelectasis.&#xD;
      Several studies demonstrated the short-term effects of increased oxygenation and pulmonary&#xD;
      compliance, improved lung collapse, and removed pulmonary secretions. To apply MHI technique,&#xD;
      patients were disconnected from the ventilator which lead to the adverse effect of losing&#xD;
      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) corresponding to loss of functional residual&#xD;
      capacity, decreased oxygenation, and shear stress of distal lung units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative method of performing pulmonary hyperinflation uses the mechanical ventilator.&#xD;
      Although there is evidence that positive pressure interventions such as continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (CPAP) and intermittent positive pressure breathing IPPB) can improve lung&#xD;
      expansion and mobilize secretions in the airway, there are few studies examining&#xD;
      ventilator-induced hyperinflation as a physiotherapy intervention in intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study showed that the ventilator hyperinflation technique (VHI) was as effective&#xD;
      as MHI to improve pulmonary complications such as secretion retention and lung atelectasis.&#xD;
      Especially, VHI technique using applied by the mechanical ventilator, patient was not&#xD;
      disconnected from the ventilator and therefore did not result in loss of PEEP and its adverse&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atelectasis is a common pulmonary complication in acute trauma patients maintained on&#xD;
      ventilator support who would benefit from VHI but even though recent studies indicate that&#xD;
      VHI technique is an improvement on the MHI technique there are relatively few study of the&#xD;
      hemodynamic responses to VHI. There is controversy in hemodynamic responses to VHI,&#xD;
      Ventilator hyperinflation technique (VHI) is especially valuable in treating patients in the&#xD;
      ICU because other techniques such as percussion and postural drainage may not be possible&#xD;
      because of wounds, broken bones or surgical drains. However, the technique is very rarely&#xD;
      used by physical therapists in the ICU, possibly because they are concerned that increasing&#xD;
      in the intra-thoracic pressure by uses VHI to inflate lung will result in dangerous changes&#xD;
      in heart rate and blood pressure; that any such changes may persist after the treatment&#xD;
      leading to complications such as pulmonary edema and, lastly, the positive pressure to the&#xD;
      patient may precipitate episodes of cardiac arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent study demonstrated that heart rate and blood pressure were changed after VHI in ICU&#xD;
      patients but the condition of patients in their study were mixed, not only traumatic&#xD;
      patients. Previous study showed that basal heart and blood pressure were increased in&#xD;
      patients underwent traumatic conditions. The hemodynamic responses to VHI were required for&#xD;
      safety and increasing physiotherapist's confidences to use this technique in ICU. Therefore,&#xD;
      the purpose of this study is to explore acute hemodynamic responses to VHI technique in&#xD;
      critical traumatic patients with pulmonary complications in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
