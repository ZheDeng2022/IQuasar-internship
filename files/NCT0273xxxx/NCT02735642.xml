  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knowledge of HIV status is a first step towards accessing HIV care, treatment, and prevention&#xD;
      services.The GIRLS study will rigorously compare two 'seek' recruitment strategies, three&#xD;
      'test' strategies, and two enhancements to an adaptive (SMART trial design) 'linkage' to care&#xD;
      intervention, among young at-risk women, 15-24 years old, in Homa Bay County, western Kenya.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will evaluate a scalable primary prevention messaging intervention to&#xD;
      support identified HIV-negative young women in reducing HIV risk and adhering to recommended&#xD;
      HIV re-testing recommendations. We will also conduct an economic evaluation, using cost&#xD;
      effectiveness analyses to determine the relative utility of each seek, test, link, and&#xD;
      prevention interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lessons learned will inform Government of Kenya, and other key policymakers, implementing&#xD;
      partners and agencies throughout sub-Saharan Africa that are exploring policies about&#xD;
      appropriate scale up of these multiple seek, test, link, retain, and prevention strategies to&#xD;
      realize the dream of an AIDS-free future for adolescent girls and young women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GIRLS study will inform best practices to increase adolescent girls and young women's&#xD;
      uptake of HIV prevention, testing, and linkage for HIV to care services in a high-HIV burden&#xD;
      African setting to optimize engagement in both the HIV prevention and care continua.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the preferred recruitment venue and testing modality that targets and&#xD;
      finds the highest number of HIV infected and at risk female youth aged 15-24 years in Homa&#xD;
      Bay County, Nyanza region, western Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This will be determined by examining the uptake and yield of previously undiagnosed HIV&#xD;
           infection of the two (2) 'seek' strategies (community or home-based) and the three (3)&#xD;
           'test' strategies (self-testing, HIV testing services (HTS) in a home/mobile setting, or&#xD;
           facility-based HTS) among female youth;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: (a) To pilot and evaluate an adaptive intervention to link newly diagnosed&#xD;
      HIV-positive female youth to treatment and care services; and (b) To identify barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to seeking HIV care services after receiving a positive diagnosis; (c) To&#xD;
      identify barriers and facilitators to seeking HIV prevention services for high risk female&#xD;
      youth after receiving a negative HIV test result; (d) To provide an HIV prevention&#xD;
      intervention to a randomly selected subset of high risk negatives, and to re-test them; and&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To conduct an economic evaluation, using cost effectiveness analyses to determine the&#xD;
      relative utility of each seek, test, link, and prevention intervention.&#xD;

    <description>After completing HIV testing, newly diagnosed adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) (N=32) participated in an adaptive intervention pilot to figure out the best way to support those newly diagnosed with HIV with initial linkage to care. The SMART trial pilot consisted of two randomizations. In the first randomization, AGYW were assigned to either standard referral (counseling and a referral note) or standard referral plus SMS message; those not linked to care after the first randomization (within a 2-week period) were randomized a second time to receive either a SMS message or financial incentive to link to care.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled between May 2017 and April 2018 from three sites in Homa Bay County, Nyanza region, western Kenya. In fulfillment of Aim 1, we explored two recruitment approaches (homebased vs. mobile-event based) and three HIV testing options (oral self-test, staff-administered, or referral to health facility).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After participants completed HIV testing, only newly diagnosed participants living with HIV were enrolled into the SMART trial component of the study. This occurred from June 2017 to June 2018. Please note these are not additional participants, they are part of the N=1198 enrolled in the overall study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>SMART Trial Pilot to Link Newly Diagnosed Adolescent Girls and Young Women to HIV Care Services.</title>
        <description>After completing HIV testing, newly diagnosed adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) (N=32) participated in an adaptive intervention pilot to figure out the best way to support those newly diagnosed with HIV with initial linkage to care. The SMART trial pilot consisted of two randomizations. In the first randomization, AGYW were assigned to either standard referral (counseling and a referral note) or standard referral plus SMS message; those not linked to care after the first randomization (within a 2-week period) were randomized a second time to receive either a SMS message or financial incentive to link to care.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to about 6 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Please note our SMART trial is underpowered because HIV prevalence was lower than expected. In the outcome measure data table below, we report the total numbers allocated to each intervention and the number of participants who successfully linked to care.</population>
