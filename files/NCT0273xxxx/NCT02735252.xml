      This is a tissue and blood collection protocol requiring image-guided biopsies of metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer and other genitourinary malignancies including renal cell carcinoma and&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma. Whenever possible, a new bone lesion or new/progressing soft tissue&#xD;
      lesion will be chosen for biopsy as opposed to radiographically stable lesion. Patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled in into one of several parallel cohorts based upon disease status or type and the&#xD;
      planned systemic therapy following baseline tumor biopsy: (A) Androgen signaling inhibition,&#xD;
      (B) Immunotherapy, (C) Radiotherapy, (D) Targeted Therapy/Investigational therapeutic, (E)&#xD;
      DNA damage response pathway, (F) Aggressive variant disease, (G1) Castration-sensitive ADT&#xD;
      na√Øve and ADT &lt; 3 months), or (G2) Castration-sensitive pre-treated with sub-optimal PSA&#xD;
      nadir &gt;0.2 ng/ml, (R) metastatic renal cell carcinoma and metastatic and (U) urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After performing tumor biopsies and blood collection and processing the biopsies and research&#xD;
      blood for comprehensive molecular analysis using established methods for RNA and DNA&#xD;
      analysis, we will use Pathway Recognition using Data Integration on Genomic Models (PARADIGM)&#xD;
      and Differential Pathway Signature Correlation (DiPSC), computational approaches to pathway&#xD;
      activity and predictive signature identification developed at University of California, Santa&#xD;
      Cruz. We will also collect blood samples (for circulating tumor DNA, plasma, and serum) and&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells from participating patients. Residual paraffin- embedded blocks,&#xD;
      frozen tissue, and blood products (serum, plasma, and circulating cells) will be stored in a&#xD;
      repository for future testing of candidate predictive markers identified during microarray&#xD;
      analysis. We will utilize only Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified&#xD;
      laboratories(e.g. Strata Oncology) to identify genetic mutations within mCRPC tumors to&#xD;
      provide genetic information that can be returned to patient to potentially inform treatment&#xD;
      decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain genomic sequencing will be performed by Strata Oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following biopsy and baseline peripheral blood collection, patients will be treated per&#xD;
      investigator discretion, with treatment corresponding to assigned patient cohort and&#xD;
      initiated within 42 days following baseline tumor biopsy and/or research blood collection.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for response to therapy per the standard of care for their&#xD;
      specific disease type; such as with monthly serum PSA measurements (may be done at UCSF or at&#xD;
      local laboratory) and/or restaging scans (bone scan + CT abdomen/pelvis) (UCSF or local&#xD;
      radiology facility). Outcomes on treatment post-biopsy will be recorded, including maximal&#xD;
      PSA decline, date of radiographic progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of disease progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria for&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients, or by RECIST v1.1 for patients with metastatic renal or urothelial&#xD;
      cancer, patients may undergo optional repeat assessment for metastatic tumor biopsy, along&#xD;
      with mandatory blood collection for analysis of circulating tumor DNA and circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells (CTCs). Following second biopsy at progression, patients should continue to be followed&#xD;
      for response to subsequent therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed every 6 months for updates on disease status including post-study&#xD;
      therapies and survival status via telephone calls and/or chart review.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of histologically confirmed prostate cancer, or other advanced / metastatic&#xD;
             genitourinary malignancies for cohorts R (renal cell carcinoma) and U (urothelial&#xD;
             carcinoma). Patients without histologically confirmed cancer are eligible if both the&#xD;
             treating physician and the study PI agree that the patient's history is unambiguously&#xD;
             indicative of advanced prostate cancer (e.g. high Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
             responsive to Androgen Deprivation Therapy in prostate cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographic evidence of metastatic disease amenable to image-guided or excisional&#xD;
             biopsy of a metastatic site. Soft-tissue as well as bony metastatic lesions will be&#xD;
             considered acceptable. Patients with locally advanced disease only (where the biopsy&#xD;
             would be of a prostatic mass) are NOT eligible. Biopsy of newly emerging or&#xD;
             progressive metastases is desired and preferable to the biopsy of previously existing&#xD;
             stable lesions whenever possible. Patients without lesion amenable to biopsy are still&#xD;
             eligible, and have the option of re-assessment for potential of metastatic tumor&#xD;
             biopsy upon progression as outlined in the study calendar.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with metastatic lesion amenable for biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt; = 75,000/microliter (Œºl)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial&#xD;
             thromboplastin time (aPTT) &lt; = 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on warfarin, aspirin, or other anti-coagulants are eligible provided they are&#xD;
             deemed able to tolerate discontinuation of anti-coagulation prior to the biopsy as per&#xD;
             usual standard of care. Conversion to low molecular weight heparin prior to biopsy is&#xD;
             permitted per local standard operating procedures, provided there is agreement&#xD;
             regarding the procedure between the treating physician, the interventional radiologist&#xD;
             and the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorders (eg type 3 von&#xD;
             Wildebrand's disease, acquired bleeding factor inhibitors) are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 yrs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC)&#xD;
             according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or for&#xD;
             metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by Prostate Cancer Working&#xD;
             Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria, with progression as defined by one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. PSA Progression: PSA level of at least 2 nanograms (ng)/milliliter (ml) which has&#xD;
                  risen on at least 2 separate measurements, at least one week apart (for prostate&#xD;
                  cancer patients only)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Disease progression by RECIST v1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Bone scan progression: the appearance of &gt;= 2 new lesions (for prostate cancer&#xD;
                  patients only)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Symptomatic progression in an area of radiologically evident disease&#xD;
&#xD;

             prior bilateral orchiectomy are required to remain on Luteinizing hormone-releasing&#xD;
             hormone (LHRH) analogue for duration of study. Patients with previously documented&#xD;
             denovo primary small cell carcinoma of the prostate are exempt from this criterion. If&#xD;
             serum for analysis of testosterone level has been collected but result not available&#xD;
             by day of scheduled baseline biopsy, patient may still be eligible for study&#xD;
             participation upon at the discretion of the Principal Investigator&#xD;

             into more than one category, cohort assignment will be per PI discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (Cohort U) with planned&#xD;
             treatment with a novel agent such as an Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) or a targeted&#xD;
