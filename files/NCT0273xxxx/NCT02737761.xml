  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to understand how positive emotions (e.g., optimism, happiness)&#xD;
      are associated with health behavior adherence in patients with heart failure (HF), as well as&#xD;
      whether performing exercises to improve positive emotions may help to improve health behavior&#xD;
      adherence as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a study that will specifically and innovatively focus on the&#xD;
      development of a novel positive psychology intervention that is adapted for patients with HF.&#xD;
      The MGH inpatient units and MGH Heart Center outpatients will serve as the source of subjects&#xD;
      for the study, with patients who have a diagnosis of HF serving as potential subjects. The&#xD;
      investigators will interview 30 HF patients within two weeks of enrollment in the study, and&#xD;
      again three months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators hope to do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify, through qualitative research, deficits in positive emotional and cognitive&#xD;
           states in clinically stable patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or&#xD;
           III HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine potential links between positive emotional deficits and impaired health&#xD;
           behaviors (low sodium diet, physical activity, medication adherence), as well as links&#xD;
           between positive emotional sufficiency and successful health behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify other barriers to health behavior completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore strategies to enhance positive emotional and cognitive states in HF patients and&#xD;
           inquire about the utility of potential PP exercises in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Develop a preliminary PP-based intervention using the above information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assess the feasibility of our proposed survey-based measures for adherence,&#xD;
           psychological health, and physical health in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Explore the feasibility of using methods to objectively measure medication adherence and&#xD;
           physical activity (via electronic pillcaps and accelerometers, respectively) in this&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline information about enrolled participants will be obtained from the patients, care&#xD;
      providers, and the electronic medical record as required for characterization of our&#xD;
      population. This information will include data regarding medical history (history of prior&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery bypass graft, congestive HF, hypertension, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking), current medical variables (renal function,&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction, NYHA class), medications, and sociodemographic data (age,&#xD;
      gender, race/ethnicity, living alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo an open-ended, semi-structured interview within 2 weeks of&#xD;
      enrollment. The interview will be approximately 1 hour in length, performed by study staff&#xD;
      who have been trained in qualitative research methods. Participants will then undergo another&#xD;
      qualitative interview and repeat the battery of questionnaires again at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear an Actigraph accelerometer for 2 weeks at Baseline and again at 12&#xD;
      weeks to measure physical activity, and will also use a MEMSCap electronic pill counter&#xD;
      throughout the study to measure medication adherence, respectively.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Adult patients with NYHA class II or III HF admitted to an MGH inpatient unit or&#xD;
        outpatients at the MGH Heart Center. Investigators will enroll subjects who develop mild to&#xD;
        moderate HF symptoms during activity but not at rest. NYHA class II/III HF patients&#xD;
        comprise the majority of subjects in studies that identify links between physical activity&#xD;
        and improved exercise capacity, QoL, and survival making them an ideal study population. HF&#xD;
        diagnosis, clinical stability, and NYHA class will be clarified with the inpatient or&#xD;
        outpatient cardiology team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive deficits impeding a subject's ability to provide informed consent or&#xD;
             participate, assessed via a 6-item cognitive test that is sensitive and specific for&#xD;
             screening for cognitive impairment in research subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical conditions precluding interviews or likely to lead to death within 6 months.&#xD;
