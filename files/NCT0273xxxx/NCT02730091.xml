  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the clinical effects of the addition of metronomic oral&#xD;
      vinorelbine to letrozole and anastrozole. The study will compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of oral metronomic vinorelbine administered in combination with letrozole or&#xD;
      anastrozole, as treatment for hormone receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      without resistance to Aromatase Inhibitors (AI).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Letrozole and Anastrozole are AI generally used as the first line of therapy for women with&#xD;
      HR+ breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, present hormonal treatments of advanced breast cancer (ABC) or Metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer (MBC) are sub-optimal, as only approximately one half of patients with oestrogen&#xD;
      and/or progesterone receptor positive tumours will respond to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this patient population, chemotherapy is a valid option, especially after failure or&#xD;
      intolerance to hormone therapy. Both combination and sequential single-agent chemotherapy are&#xD;
      reasonable options. Based on the available data, sequential monotherapy is recommended as the&#xD;
      preferred choice for MBC. Preferred first-line chemotherapy single agents are anthracyclines,&#xD;
      taxanes, capecitabine, gemcitabine and vinorelbine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of oral chemotherapy formulations offer numerous benefits to patients,&#xD;
      oncologists, oncology nurses, pharmacists and healthcare providers Metronomic therapy (MT)&#xD;
      refers to repetitive, low doses of chemotherapy drugs. MT exerts an effect not only on tumor&#xD;
      cells, but also on their microenvironment. In particular, the low-dose schedule compromises&#xD;
      the repairing process of endothelial cells, leading to an anti-angiogenic effect. A&#xD;
      systematic review of the results of phase I, II and III studies suggests that MT is a&#xD;
      treatment option for breast cancer patients, has a low toxicity profile, efficacy in most&#xD;
      patients and has potentially significant cost-effective advantages for public health.&#xD;
