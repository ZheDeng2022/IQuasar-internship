    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of the suctioning flexible ureteroscopy(SF-URS)&#xD;
      with automatic control of renal pelvic pressure for the treatment of upper urinary calculi&#xD;
      using a prospective, randomized design. Half of participants will receive suctioning flexible&#xD;
      ureteroscopy with automatic control of renal pelvic pressure, while the other half&#xD;
      participants will receive retrograde intrarenal surgery using the classic flexible&#xD;
      ureteroscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retrograde intrarenal surgery using flexible ureteroscope has become the first-line treatment&#xD;
      for renal calculi &lt; 3.0 cm and is recommended by the European Association of Urology due to&#xD;
      its minimally-invasive nature and satisfactory result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, high perfusion rate leads to renal pelvic pressure increase, resulting in absorption&#xD;
      of liquid, bacteria, and endotoxin into blood, followed by short-term complications such as&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome(SIRS , 8.1%), sepsis (0-4.5%), renal pelvic and&#xD;
      ureteral tumor spread, and long-term complication of renal function impairment. Currently the&#xD;
      commonly used flexible ureteroscope sheath (ureteral access sheath, UAS) reduces the renal&#xD;
      pelvic pressure to a certain extent, but still can not control and monitor the renal pelvic&#xD;
      pressure to reduce the incidence of complications, which, limit the clinical application of&#xD;
      ureteroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators present a novel technique of SF-URS with automatic control of&#xD;
      renal pelvic pressure. In this study, transverse comparison is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the suctioning flexible ureteroscopy with automatic control of renal&#xD;
      pelvic pressure for the treatment of renal calculi.&#xD;
