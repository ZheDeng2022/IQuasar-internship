           for Phase I in terms of Incidence of treatment-related AEs and SAEs (including&#xD;
           infections and bleeding)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the efficacy for Phase I+II of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor&#xD;
           site wounds (DSW) in terms of The healing time from DSW creation to 100%&#xD;

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds&#xD;
           (DSW) in secondary efficacy endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds (DSW)&#xD;

             but no more than 100 cm2, with a minimum width of 3 cm and with an approximate&#xD;
             thickness of 0.010~0.012 inches. The graft cannot be harvested from a site from which&#xD;
             a skin graft was previously obtained.&#xD;
