      The aim of this phase I-II study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of PRRT with&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTATATE (Lu-PRRT) associated to metronomic chemotherapy with Capecitabine in patients&#xD;
      affected by aggressive FDG-positive gastro-entero-pancreatic NET. Moreover to analyze the&#xD;
      effects of the capecitabine metronomic schedule on the level of circulating angiogenetic&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are relatively rare tumors, mainly originating from the&#xD;
      digestive system, able to produce bioactive amines and hormones. NETs tend to be slow growing&#xD;
      and are often diagnosed when metastatic. Treatment is multidisciplinary and should be&#xD;
      individualized according to the tumor type, burden, and symptoms. Therapeutic tools include&#xD;
      surgery, interventional radiology, and medical treatments such as somatostatin analogues,&#xD;
      interferon, chemotherapy, new targeted drugs (everolimus, sunitinib) with radiolabelled&#xD;
      somatostatin analogues. Despite the options available, antiproliferative treatment options&#xD;
      for patients with inoperable gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) NETs are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRRT with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues 90Y-DOTATOC, and 177Lu-DOTATATE&#xD;
      (177Lu-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotate), has been experimented for more then 15 years in few&#xD;
      centers. The introduction of PRRT and, particularly, the advent of 177Lu-DOTATATE, broke&#xD;
      through the poor scenario of available treatment for NETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosimetric studies demonstrated that 90Y-DOTATOC and 177Lu-DOTATATE are able to deliver high&#xD;
      radiation doses to somatostatin receptor sst2-expressing tumors and low doses to normal&#xD;
      organs. Clinical studies demonstrated that partial and complete objective responses in up to&#xD;
      30% of patients can be obtained, with a great survival benefit including those with stable&#xD;
      disease. Side effects may involve the kidney and the bone marrow and are usually mild. Renal&#xD;
      protection is used to minimize the risk of a late decrease of renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, in order to further increase the objective response to PRRT, a combined treatment&#xD;
      with the radiosensitizer capecitabine, has been proposed and tested on GEP-NET patients'&#xD;
      population. Capecitabine is the oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracile (5-FU), which is active in&#xD;
      GEP tumors and a radiosensitizer itself. The finding that neo-angiogenesis can be shut down&#xD;
      also with cytotoxic drugs like capecitabine when administered in low and frequent doses,&#xD;
      constitutes the rationale for proposing a particular schedule of chemotherapy that is,&#xD;
      therefore, named &quot;metronomic&quot; or &quot;anti-angiogenic&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the reported experience, the investigators think to offer a combined therapy in&#xD;
      aggressive, metabolically active tumors, such as those patients with a positive FDG scan.&#xD;
      FDG-PET allow the investigators to obtain in vivo imaging of increased glycolysis which is&#xD;
      known to be an hallmark of tumor aggressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this phase I-II study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of PRRT with&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTATATE (Lu-PRRT) associated to metronomic chemotherapy with Capecitabine in patients&#xD;
      affected by aggressive FDG-positive gastro-entero-pancreatic NET. Moreover to analyze the&#xD;
      effects of the capecitabine metronomic schedule on the level of circulating angiogenetic&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
