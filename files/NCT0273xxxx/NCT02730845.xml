  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be carried to evaluate the efficacy of intra-articular 0.5 bupivacaine&#xD;
      with intra-articular or intravenous alpha-2agonist; Dexmedetomidine; for intraoperative&#xD;
      anesthesia and postoperative analgesia after arthroscopic knee surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arthroscopic knee surgery is one of the most common minimally invasive orthopedic procedures&#xD;
      in recent practice which is frequently performed as a day surgery procedures. It can be done&#xD;
      under general, regional or local anesthesia (LA) with or without sedation. It is associated&#xD;
      with varying amount of postoperative pain. Postoperative pain negatively influences patient's&#xD;
      early ambulation, rehabilitation and psychology which consecutively prolonged the hospital&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-articular administration of local anesthetic for knee arthroscopy is a well-documented&#xD;
      procedure that offers many advantages over other anesthesia types. Many anesthesiologists are&#xD;
      still trying to improve the technique of local anesthetic administration through using many&#xD;
      combinations with LA solutions in order to administer safe anesthesia to those patients and&#xD;
      to obtain a pain-free knee with good operating conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2 adrenergic agonist. It has analgesic, sedative,&#xD;
      anxiolytic, hypnotic, sympatholytic, antihypertensive properties with anesthetic sparing&#xD;
      effects. It becomes an attractive alternative to the current opioids because it does not have&#xD;
      a respiratory depressant or addictive effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients were kept fasting after midnight and received midazolam 5 mg orally as&#xD;
      premedication. All patients were premedicated with I.V. midazolam 0.03 mg/kg ten minutes&#xD;
      before starting the operation. The anesthetic technique was standardized for all patients.&#xD;
      All surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon and consisted of arthroscopic&#xD;
      removal of torn meniscus. Both intra-articular and intravenous solutions were prepared by an&#xD;
      individual not involved in the study and the intra-articular drugs were injected by the&#xD;
      surgeon (without knowing the contents). The anesthesiologist managing and monitoring the&#xD;
      patient throughout the surgery provides IV drugs. No leg holder or tourniquet or surgical&#xD;
      drain was used for any of the cases. After preparation and draping the patient's leg,&#xD;
      patients were warned prior to each needle stick to decrease anxiety. All procedures were&#xD;
      performed under complete aseptic conditions. Skin and subcutaneous tissues at each&#xD;
      arthroscopic portal site were anesthetized with LA consisting of injection of a mixture of 2%&#xD;
      lidocaine 5 mL with 1:200,000 epinephrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care should be taken to avoid infiltration of the fat pad. It is a relatively aneural&#xD;
      structure; as, too much local infiltration allows it to bulge out into the joint during the&#xD;
      surgery. Flexion and extension of the knee joint several times help to spread of&#xD;
      intra-articular solution and then waiting 20 minutes for anesthesia to take effect is helpful&#xD;
      before the surgical incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arthroscope was inserted into the knee, and inflow through the sheath was established. No&#xD;
      pump was used for the saline inflow which was maintained through the arthroscope by the&#xD;
      gravity. Gravity outflow drained through the superolateral portal. A separate egress cannula&#xD;
      was used if indicated. The patient was encouraged to view the video monitor during the&#xD;
      procedure. Constant verbal communication between the surgeon and the patient is important&#xD;
      throughout the arthroscopic examination and surgery. This keeps the patient anxiety and&#xD;
      muscle tension to the minimum which facilitates manipulation of the leg and thorough&#xD;
      examination of the entire joint. Once finishing, instruments were removed and portals were&#xD;
      closed with a 4-0 absorbable suture subcutaneously and steri-strips. A compression dressing&#xD;
      was applied for three days to the knee.&#xD;
