      Increasing rates of highly malignant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and biliary tract cancers&#xD;
      (GBTC) observed in Western populations may be related to obesogenic lifestyle factors and&#xD;
      their metabolic consequences, such as metabolic syndrome (MetS), inflammation and altered&#xD;
      production of bile acids (BA). Such lifestyle behaviours may induce changes in the gut&#xD;
      microflora which in turn affect BA profiles, increasing their carcinogenicity. Some elevated&#xD;
      BA may be oncogenic in exposed liver, bile ducts and gall bladder. Vertical sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy may change bile acid composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. whether specific presurgical bila acid profiles are predictive of efficacy of vertical&#xD;
           sleeve gastrectomy, reflective of liver function and metabolic dysfunction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. whether specific presurgical bile acid profiles are predictive of the efficacy of sleeve&#xD;
           gastrectomy&#xD;

      &quot;Increasing rates of highly malignant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and biliary tract&#xD;
      cancers (GBTC) observed in Western populations may be related to obesogenic lifestyle factors&#xD;
      and their metabolic consequences, such as metabolic syndrome (MetS), inflammation and altered&#xD;
      production of bile acids (BA). Such lifestyle behaviours may induce changes in the gut&#xD;
      microflora which in turn affect BA profiles, increasing their carcinogenicity. Some elevated&#xD;
      BA may be oncogenic in exposed liver, bile ducts and gall bladder. Data from case-control&#xD;
      studies show higher blood BA in patients with various liver diseases, but from these designs&#xD;
      it is unclear if the differences in BA levels are etiologic or consequential. To date no&#xD;
      prospective studies have investigated the role of circulating BA levels in the development of&#xD;
      HCC/GBTC, nor any potential interactions with diet, obesity and MetS. Interestingly, Vertical&#xD;
      Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG), an anti-obesity intervention, may alter BA profiles in some&#xD;
      patients towards a potentially detrimental composition, but this is largely unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project description: This project is composed of two complementary studies designed to&#xD;
      explore the role of BA in obesity, liver function and tumourigenesis. The 1st study is a&#xD;
      case-control study of hepatobiliary cancers (191 HCC; 266 GBTC; 457 matched controls) nested&#xD;
      within a large prospective cohort of Franco-European populations (EPIC, &gt;520,000 subjects)&#xD;
      with extensive and detailed dietary/lifestyle data, body size measures and biological samples&#xD;
      taken at baseline prior to disease development. The aim of this study is to explore&#xD;
      associations between pre-diagnostic MetS markers and BA levels and the risk of HCC and GBTC,&#xD;
      and to establish whether the observed associations are modulated, in part, by&#xD;
      dietary/lifestyle factors or metabolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2nd study is based on a clinical setting and aims to recruit 100 morbidly obese subjects&#xD;
      undergoing VSG to compare their BA and metabolic profiles pre- to 1 year post-surgery. This&#xD;
      study is based on observations that post-VSG BA synthesis is increased, but changes in BA&#xD;
      composition towards possibly harmful profiles have not previously been studied. It is also&#xD;
      hypothesized that the degree of weight loss and metabolic improvement in VSG patients may be&#xD;
      related to pre-surgical BA profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both studies, comprehensive panel of 17 serum BA (primary, secondary, (un)-conjugated,&#xD;
      sulphated) and metabolic biomarkers (inflammation, liver function, dyslipidemia, HbA1c, MetS&#xD;
      indicators, hepatitis status) will be assessed using validated methods. Study 2 will also&#xD;
      assess expression of liver FXR, a BA receptor gene. Statistical Methods: Study 1 will&#xD;
      calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for circulating BA levels/MetS markers in&#xD;
      relation to HCC and GBTC risk by multivariable conditional logistic regression, controlling&#xD;
      for potential confounding variables and effect modifiers. Receiver operating characteristics&#xD;
      (ROC) analyses will be performed to assess a combination of BA and metabolic markers with&#xD;
      best performance to prospectively distinguish between cancer cases and controls. In study 2,&#xD;
      GLM (repeated measures) ANOVA will be used to compare pre-/post-surgery changes in&#xD;
      biomarkers. BA profiles from both studies, will be compared and correlations between BA and&#xD;
      other biomarkers, lifestyle and body size measures will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: This project is based on two related concepts. First, that lifestyle&#xD;
      behaviours and obesity may alter gut microflora leading to changes in BA metabolism,&#xD;
      enhancing production of specific BA known to be cancer promoting. Second, observations of&#xD;
      increased BA levels post-VSG surgery, which may improve metabolic function, but some BA may&#xD;
      be pro-carcinogenic over the longer term. The project will provide improved understanding of&#xD;
      the inter-relations between BA, lifestyle behaviours and metabolic factors and the&#xD;
      development of hepatobiliary cancers. It will also identify specific BA most strongly&#xD;
      associated with these highly malignant cancers. The findings will contribute to the evidence&#xD;
      base for advice on lifestyle and metabolic modifications for cancer prevention. The clinical&#xD;
      implications are two-fold. First, the findings will provide insight as to whether BA profiles&#xD;
      are predictive of the efficacy of VSG with potential implications in personalized medicine,&#xD;
      and second, identified biomarker profiles may be used for more refined risk stratification&#xD;
      for development of these cancers and subsequent closer patients' surveillance for early&#xD;
      detection &quot;&#xD;
