    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to assess the effect of the intake of different types of fruits on&#xD;
      memory and attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is to assess effect of intake of different types of fruits on metabolic&#xD;
      markers, including glucose, insulin, total cholesterol and triglyceride and the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of the anthocyanins.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed as a randomized 2-arm, placebo-controlled, within-subjects crossover&#xD;
      utilizing a multiple sampling, repeated measures paradigm to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      consumption of different types of fruits on cognitive performance and metabolic responses.&#xD;
      This trial will test 2 treatment conditions in forty men and women who will be enrolled into&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be asked to come for one screening visit, a pre-study visit, and two dinner&#xD;
      pick-ups the day before each of the two test visits and 2 test visits. Participation in this&#xD;
      study will last approximately four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening visit will provide the subject with the informed consent document and&#xD;
      determine eligibility through anthropometric measurements, vital signs, fasting blood glucose&#xD;
      test , vein assessment, color test and completion of a survey relate to general eating,&#xD;
      health, and exercise habits. In addition, subjects will take brief tests of attention and&#xD;
      memory to ensure capability and willingness to perform tests during subsequent research&#xD;
      visits. Eligible subjects will be trained and instructed to record all food and beverages&#xD;
      consumed for a 3-day period (one weekend day and two weekdays) on food record diaries. At the&#xD;
      pre-study visit, subjects will be instructed to follow a strictly limited polyphenolic diet&#xD;
      for 7 days prior to the study and throughout their participation time, while maintaining&#xD;
      their usual diet pattern and physical activity. A dinner meal will be provided the day before&#xD;
      the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each test visit, subjects will arrive at the clinic after fasting 8 to 12 hours and in a&#xD;
      well-hydrated state. After confirming compliance with protocol, anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      and vital signs will be taken along with a finger prick for fasting blood glucose and a&#xD;
      catheter placement .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting baseline blood sample from a catheter will be collected after which baseline&#xD;
      cognitive performance measures will be assessed. After completing baseline measures, subjects&#xD;
      will receive a standard breakfast meal along with a beverage containing different fruits&#xD;
      according to the randomization sequence. Additional blood samples will be taken at 30, 60,&#xD;
      120, 180, 240, 300, 360, and 480 minutes after the start of the breakfast meal. Additional&#xD;
      cognitive tests will be performed at the 120, 240, 360, and 480 minute time points. A&#xD;
      standardized lunch will be provided between the 360 and 480 minute time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will come to the clinic for 2 test day visits; all procedures will be the same except&#xD;
      for the treatment (the test or control treatment).&#xD;
