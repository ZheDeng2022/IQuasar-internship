  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Changing the microbiota has become the most intriguing target for intervention in&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Dietary therapy is successful in mild to moderate Crohn's&#xD;
      disease and may be effective in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) as well, though&#xD;
      dietary interventions in UC are just getting underway. However these interventions are less&#xD;
      likely to be effective for the more severely inflamed or refractory end of the spectrum.&#xD;
      Fecal transplantation (FT) has been suggested as a method to treat refractory IBD, but most&#xD;
      studies have been unsuccessful in establishing remission and especially sustained remission.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that this is due to selection of random donors and the&#xD;
      inability to maintain an optimal microbiota eco system post transplant. Diet is a powerful&#xD;
      tool to modulate the microbiota. The investigators propose that use of a donor and recipient&#xD;
      diet designed for UC during fecal transplantation will be superior to diet alone of fecal&#xD;
      transplantation alone and will improve patient outcomes.The investigators propose to modify&#xD;
      FT using a novel protocol and approach that we have developed. We have developed a unique&#xD;
      diet that is geared to rectify dysbiosis in UC and damage to the mucous layer in active UC.&#xD;
      The investigators intend to condition both donor and recipient with the diet to achieve&#xD;
      optimal conditions for transplant to succeed for both donor and recipient .The investigators&#xD;
      intend to evaluate this protocol in adults with active UC that are refractory to medications.&#xD;
      The investigators will start with a randomized controlled trial involving 76 transplanted&#xD;
      patients+ 20 subjects for dietary controls with the UC diet alone.&#xD;

      Study type- It will be an open label 3 arm multicenter randomized controlled single blinded&#xD;
      study, with review of endoscopic activity by blinded reviewers. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of three groups; Group 1 will undergo standard fecal transplantation by colonoscopy on&#xD;
      day 1 and 60 ml rectal enemas on days 2 and 14 from the same donor without dietary&#xD;
      conditioning, while Group 2 will undergo the same transplantation (colonoscopy and enemas at&#xD;
      night day 2 and day 14), with dietary pre-conditioning of the donor for 14 days and dietary&#xD;
      treatment of the recipient immediately after transplantation and for the following 12&#xD;
      weeks.We will attempt to use the same donors for group 1 and 2 by using the preconditioning&#xD;
      stool for group 1 and the post conditioning stool for group 2 in order to control for the&#xD;
      &quot;donor effect&quot;. Group 3 will receive dietary therapy only.Physicians will be blinded to&#xD;
      treatment arm and donors used within the transplantation arms. A data safety monitoring board&#xD;
      will review safety after the first 34 patients to make sure that there is no ethical problem&#xD;
      with continuing the study. The investigators will continue the fecal transplantation trial to&#xD;
      reach our target enrolment number ( 76 patients) for transplantation + 20 dietary controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may continue their stable medications but should not start new medications during&#xD;
      the 8 week period unless they fail to respond. Steroid weaning can commenced from day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen on weeks0, 2, 6, 8, 12 and during week 20. Week 6 will be only a&#xD;
      dietitian visit. The last visit is a visit off diet to evaluate sustainability of the initial&#xD;
      intervention, safety and changes in BMI due to FT or diet. A telephone conversation to assess&#xD;
      SCCAI will be made at week 1 and week 7. At each visit (weeks 0, 2, 6, 8, 12, 20) patients&#xD;
      will have Weight, a disease activity score, PGA, CBC, CRP, albumin and complete chemistry&#xD;
      panel performed. Adverse events and medications used will be recorded at each visit.Stool&#xD;
      samples for microbiome (16S rDNA, Short chain fatty acid analysis) and Calprotectin will be&#xD;
      measured locally at baseline, weeks 2, 8 and 12. All patients (patients in group 1,2 and 3)&#xD;
      will have a repeat sigmoidoscopy performed at week 8. A food frequency questionnaire will be&#xD;
      performed on week 0 and a food diary will be collected at week 2 and 12. A compliance&#xD;
      questionnaire will be completed on weeks 2, 8and 12. A 24 hours recall will be collected at&#xD;
      weeks 0, 2 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group 1 or 2 in remission from FT, may receive up to 2 rescue enemas during the 8&#xD;
      weeks of the study from their original donor.&#xD;
