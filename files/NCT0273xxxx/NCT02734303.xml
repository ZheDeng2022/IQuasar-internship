      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first nuclear bomb test took place in New Mexico in July 1945. This was called the&#xD;
      Trinity test. Researchers want to learn how it affected the health of people who lived in New&#xD;
      Mexico at the time of the test. To do this, they want to learn about the diet and daily life&#xD;
      of those people at that time. They want to study Native Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, and&#xD;
      non-Hispanic/Latino whites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about the health risks for people who may have been exposed to radiation from the&#xD;
      Trinity nuclear test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are Native American, Hispanic/Latino, or non-Hispanic white&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are age 70 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lived near the fallout region of the Trinity test and know about lifestyle and dietary&#xD;
           patterns in New Mexico in the 1940s and 1950s&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions in an interview or a focus group. This will be at a place&#xD;
      like an office, tribal or community center, or library. It will take up to 2 hours. The&#xD;
      interview or group session will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about their and their family members activities and eating habits in the 1940s&#xD;
           and 1950s&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A card-sorting exercise: There will be cards with pictures and names of certain foods.&#xD;
           They will sort the cards into 2 piles: those that were consumed and those that were not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Filling out a chart of their family members and the foods they ate&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants give permission, their interview or group session will be recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last four decades, assessments of health risks based on estimated radiation doses&#xD;
      received by the public have been completed for all major U.S. nuclear testing sites and&#xD;
      nuclear fuel cycle facilities in the U.S. except for the Trinity test. This research plan is&#xD;
      for a radiationrelated cancer risk projection study for the residents of the state of New&#xD;
      Mexico (NM) potentially exposed to radioactive fallout from the Trinity nuclear test&#xD;
      conducted in 1945. Data to be collected on diet and lifestyle from the three main ethnic&#xD;
      groups in NM (white, Hispanic, and Native American) via focus groups and key informant&#xD;
      interviews will be used to derive means and ranges of exposure-related parameters for a dose&#xD;
      assessment and risk projection. As preliminary work to this proposal, in 2014 we conducted a&#xD;
      pilot study to obtain information from 9 key informants (maximum number allowed under OMB&#xD;
      regulations prior to clearance) determined that the elders could recall the relevant time&#xD;
      period and relevant lifestyle practices. This work established that it is possible to: 1)&#xD;
      locate elderly representative of the ethnic groups, 2) assemble groups of members of tribal,&#xD;
      a n d Hispanic/Latino communities in New Mexico who were alive in 1945 at the time of the&#xD;
      test to participate in focus groups, and 3) obtain lifestyle and diet information to be used&#xD;
      for refining focus group interviewing tools. Due to the successful completion of the pilot&#xD;
      phase, here we are proposing a second phase to collect data, on a larger scale, via focus&#xD;
      group and individual interviews, on lifestyle and diet from up to 150 Native American,&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic white participants living in New Mexico who were alive at&#xD;
      the time of the Trinity detonation (currently greater than or equal to 70 years old). The&#xD;
      data collected in the proposed study will allows us to estimate exposure-related parameter&#xD;
      values that can be used in fallout dose assessment models to estimate external and internal&#xD;
      radiation doses to representative persons in all counties in New Mexico by ethnicity, gender,&#xD;
      and age. Those doses will be used with published risk models and coupled with&#xD;
      literature-derived parameters on risk/unit dose to project the excess cancers (per 1,000&#xD;
      persons within each strata) expected. Endpoints are leukemia, thyroid cancer, stomach cancer,&#xD;
      and colon cancer.&#xD;
