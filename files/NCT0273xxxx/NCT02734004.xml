    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness, safety, and antitumor activity of&#xD;
      study drugs MEDI4736 in combination with olaparib (modules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7) and MEDI4736&#xD;
      in combination with olaparib and bevacizumab (module 6). It will also examine what happens to&#xD;
      the study drugs in the body and investigate how well the combination between MEDI4736,&#xD;
      olaparib and bevacizumab is tolerated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of MEDI4736 in combination with olaparib in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors, selected based on a rationale for response to olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-inhibitor and&#xD;
      immunotherapy (IMT)-naïve (defined as no prior exposure to PARP inhibitors or IMT, including,&#xD;
      but not limited to, other anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4],&#xD;
      anti-programmed cell death 1 [PD-1], anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or&#xD;
      checkpoint pathways).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4 initial stage cohorts (Modules 1 to 4) include patients with relapsed small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (SCLC), germline BRCA mutated (gBRCAm) metastatic human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, gBRCAm platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer,&#xD;
      and gastric cancer. The data cut-off occurred once all 4 Modules had reached last patient&#xD;
      first visit (LPFV) + 2 years and all 4 cohorts had observed a median value for PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second stage cohorts (Modules 5 to 7) include patients with relapsed gBRCAm&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer and non gBRCAm platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian&#xD;
      cancer. The final data cut-off will be once Modules 6 and 7 have observed a median value for&#xD;
      overall survival. At this timepoint, the clinical study database will close to new data.&#xD;
