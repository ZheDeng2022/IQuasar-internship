  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are 1) to evaluate the longer-term impact of an&#xD;
      adjunctive, low-cost financial incentives intervention (relative to standard care) on smoking&#xD;
      abstinence rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals participating in a&#xD;
      clinic-based smoking cessation program and 2) to identify treatment mechanisms and contextual&#xD;
      factors associated with cessation outcomes among intervention participants using both&#xD;
      traditional and ecological momentary assessment approaches. Those randomized to the financial&#xD;
      incentives intervention will have the opportunity to earn small gift cards for&#xD;
      biochemically-verified abstinence through 12 weeks post-quit. We hypothesize that individuals&#xD;
      who are randomly assigned to the adjunctive CM intervention will have significantly higher&#xD;
      rates of biochemically-verified abstinence at the 26-week post-quit follow-up than those&#xD;
      assigned to Usual Care. In addition, we hypothesize that several factors related to&#xD;
      socioeconomic disadvantage will be directly associated with non-abstinence, especially&#xD;
      greater stress/adversity, limited psychosocial resources, greater negative affect, greater&#xD;
      nicotine dependence, and poorer treatment adherence. The primary study endpoints will include&#xD;
      self-reported tobacco use/abstinence, expired carbon monoxide (CO) levels (i.e., the amount&#xD;
      of carbon monoxide present in an individual's breath when they breathe out), and saliva&#xD;
      cotinine levels at 26 weeks post-quit attempt, though smoking status will be assessed at all&#xD;
      visits. Traditional questionnaire measurement and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) will&#xD;
      be utilized to measure potential treatment mechanisms including motivation, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      and treatment adherence. Other variables including stress/adversity, psychosocial resources,&#xD;
      negative affect, nicotine dependence, and treatment adherence will also be assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Individuals (N = 320) will be recruited during their initial visit to the Tobacco Cessation&#xD;
      Clinic. Eligible participants (N = 320) will be randomized to: 1) Standard Care, which is&#xD;
      counseling and pharmacological treatment (SC; n = 160), or 2) SC + adjunctive financial&#xD;
      incentives through 12 weeks post-quit (CM; n = 160). All participants will be followed weekly&#xD;
      from 1 week pre-quit through 4 weeks post-quit, and will return for visits at 8, 12, and 26&#xD;
      weeks post-quit. Biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence will be assessed at&#xD;
      all visits, though abstinence at 26 weeks post-quit (longer-term abstinence) will serve as&#xD;
      the primary outcome variable. Those randomized to the CM intervention will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to earn small gift cards for biochemically-verified abstinence through 12 weeks&#xD;
      post-quit. The value of the gift cards will escalate weekly with continuous abstinence from&#xD;
      the quit date through 4 weeks post-quit. Additional gift cards for abstinence may be earned&#xD;
      at 8 and 12 weeks post-quit. We also hope to gain a better understanding of CM treatment&#xD;
      mechanisms and to identify other factors that directly influence cessation via traditional&#xD;
      questionnaire and smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment approaches. Smartphone&#xD;
      technology allows for &quot;real-time&quot; data collection to more accurately capture important&#xD;
      cessation-related variables, and will be used to deliver gain-framed messages to support and&#xD;
      strengthen the CM intervention. Participants will complete traditional questionnaire measures&#xD;
      on a laptop computer weekly from 1 week pre-quit through 4 weeks post-quit, and at 8, 12, and&#xD;
      26 weeks post-quit. Assessments will be completed by participants either before or after&#xD;
      their counseling appointments, for which they will receive reimbursement in the form of gift&#xD;
      cards. Participants will also receive a smartphone at the 1 week pre-quit visit and they will&#xD;
      be asked to carry it with them at all times through 4 weeks post-quit in order to complete&#xD;
      EMAs (5 weeks total). Participants will be prompted to complete EMA assessments 5 times per&#xD;
      day (4 random assessments + 1 daily diary) for five consecutive weeks. Participants will be&#xD;
      compensated upon the return of the smartphone, based on the percentage of random/daily diary&#xD;
      assessments that they completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Standard Care. According to the Clinical Practice Guideline, currently&#xD;
      recommended components of an intensive tobacco treatment intervention include 1) initial&#xD;
      assessment of willingness to participate, 2) the use of multiple types of clinicians (e.g.,&#xD;
      medical, non-medical), 3) at least 4 treatment sessions, in an individual- or&#xD;
      group-counseling format, that are greater than 10 minutes in duration, 4) counseling that&#xD;
      includes problem-solving, skills training, and social support components, and 5) and the&#xD;
      opportunity to use effective medications to aid in tobacco cessation (e.g., nicotine patch,&#xD;
      varenicline). The clinic currently offers all components of standard care. Specifically,&#xD;
      individuals who would like to quit smoking are referred (typically via electronic medical&#xD;
      record). Patients are scheduled for their initial appointment with a Tobacco Treatment&#xD;
      Specialist for an individual counseling session and to discuss pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      options. Nicotine replacement therapy is provided during the session, or other medications&#xD;
      are prescribed via communication with the patient's physician or by a provider on-site. Those&#xD;
      enrolled in the current study will be encouraged to attend at least 5 weekly group sessions&#xD;
      to facilitate follow-up and the delivery of study incentives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1, Part 1 (Recruitment/Screening). Individuals attending the initial clinic intake&#xD;
      session will be provided with a 1-page informational handout with information about the&#xD;
      study. After the session, study staff will check in with potential participants regarding&#xD;
      their interest. Study staff will review the consent form with interested participants, and&#xD;
      they will be screened for eligibility on-site in a private room in the clinic. Participant&#xD;
      eligibility for the current study will not influence eligibility for standard treatment&#xD;
      through the clinic. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM; see Appendix A)&#xD;
      will be administered to ensure that all participants are able to read at ≥ sixth grade level&#xD;
      (i.e., required to complete EMA and self-report questionnaires). Expired carbon monoxide (CO)&#xD;
      will be measured with a Vitalograph BreathCO carbon monoxide monitor. Participants will be&#xD;
      questioned about their 1) insurance status 2) age, 3) current level of smoking, 4)&#xD;
      willingness to quit smoking, and 5) willingness/ability to attend 6 weekly sessions&#xD;
      (including the first visit). Eligible participants may complete the assessment portion of&#xD;
      visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1, Part 2 (Pre-Quit Assessment). Participants will complete self-report questionnaires&#xD;
      on a laptop computer; and expired CO, weight, and height will be measured in a private room&#xD;
      to ensure confidentiality. Participants will be provided with an Android smartphone and&#xD;
      instructed regarding the use of the phone (participants may make personal calls) as well as&#xD;
      the EMA procedures. Participants will receive 4 random prompts and 1 daily diary prompt (in&#xD;
      the morning) during the normal waking hours each day for four consecutive weeks. Participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to quit smoking at bedtime or 10:00 pm (whichever occurs first), on the&#xD;
      evening prior to their next scheduled counseling session (one week later). Participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to Standard Care (SC) or CM using a random numbers table and advised of their&#xD;
      group assignment at the conclusion of visit 1. The appropriate schedule of payments (SC or&#xD;
      CM) will be discussed with all participants (see Table 1). Visit 1 takes approximately 1 hour&#xD;
      to complete, and participants will be scheduled to return for visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Quit Day). Participants will complete self-report questionnaires on a laptop&#xD;
      computer; and expired CO and weight will be measured in a private room to ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality. Visit 2 takes approximately 40 minutes to complete. Participants randomized&#xD;
      to the CM treatment will receive an additional payment if they self-report abstinence from&#xD;
      smoking since 10 p.m. the prior evening, and their expired is CO level is &lt; 10 ppm (please&#xD;
      note that the less stringent cut-off of 10 ppm will be used to verify abstinence at the first&#xD;
      visit only, due to the recency of quitting). Participants who do not attend will be contacted&#xD;
      by phone to obtain their self-reported smoking status only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (1 Week Post-Quit). Participants will complete self-report questionnaires on a laptop&#xD;
      computer; and expired carbon monoxide (CO) and weight will be measured in a private room to&#xD;
      ensure confidentiality. Visit 3 takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. Participants&#xD;
      randomized to the CM treatment will receive an additional payment if they self-report&#xD;
      continuous abstinence from smoking since the quit day and have an expired CO level of ≤ 6&#xD;
      ppm. Participants who do not attend will be contacted by phone to obtain their self-reported&#xD;
      smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 (2 Weeks Post-Quit). Expired carbon monoxide (CO) and weight will be measured in a&#xD;
      private room to ensure confidentiality. The visit 4 assessment takes approximately 5 minutes&#xD;
      to complete. Participants randomized to the CM treatment will receive payment if they&#xD;
      self-report continuous abstinence from smoking since the quit date and have an expired CO&#xD;
      level of ≤ 6 ppm. Participants who do not attend will be contacted by phone to obtain their&#xD;
      self-reported smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 (3 Weeks Post-Quit). Expired carbon monoxide (CO) and weight will be measured in a&#xD;
      private room to ensure confidentiality. The visit 5 assessment will take approximately 5&#xD;
      minutes to complete. Participants randomized to the CM treatment will receive payment if they&#xD;
      self-report continuous abstinence from smoking since the quit date and have an expired CO&#xD;
      level of ≤ 6 ppm. Participants who do not attend will be contacted by phone to obtain their&#xD;
      self-reported smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6 (4 Weeks Post-Quit). Participants will complete self-report questionnaires on a&#xD;
      laptop computer; and expired CO and weight will be measured in a private room to ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality. The visit 6 assessment will take approximately 50 minutes to complete. Upon&#xD;
      return of the smartphones, participants will be compensated based on the percentage of&#xD;
      completed random assessments. Participants who do not attend will be contacted by phone&#xD;
      and/or mail to request that the phone be returned by mail (postage paid envelopes will be&#xD;
      sent) or in-person at the next visit. When participants return the phone they will be&#xD;
      compensated according to the compensation schedule described above. Participants randomized&#xD;
      to the CM treatment will receive an additional payment if they self-report continuous&#xD;
      abstinence from smoking since the quit date and have an expired CO level of ≤ 6 ppm.&#xD;
      Participants who do not attend will be contacted by phone to obtain their self-reported&#xD;
      smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 7 (8 Weeks Post-Quit). Participants will complete self-report questionnaires on a&#xD;
      laptop computer; and expired CO and weight will be measured in a private room to ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality. Participants will receive a payment for completion of the in-person&#xD;
      assessments, which will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Participants randomized to&#xD;
      the CM treatment will receive an additional payment if they self-report abstinence from&#xD;
