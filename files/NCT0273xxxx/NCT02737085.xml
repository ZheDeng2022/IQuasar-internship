  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to explore the sequential therapeutic effect of&#xD;
      CD19-targeted and CD20-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells in the treatment of&#xD;
      Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma(DLBCL)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anti-CD20 antibody has been broadly used in the treatment of B cell malignancies and&#xD;
      exhibited good clinical outcomes. The CD19-targeted CAR-T has shown excellent therapeutic&#xD;
      efficiency in B cell malignancies,especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia. However, patients&#xD;
      treated with CD19-targeted CAR-T may face relapse of CD19 mutation. Therefore we attempt to&#xD;
      treat Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma(DLBCL) patients by sequential therapy of the 2 targets&#xD;
      and hope to combine their advantages.&#xD;

    <description>The trial will be conducted in a manner of simon two-stage design with Anti-CD19 CAR-T cells and Anti-CD20 CAR-T cells, beginning in the first stage with the aim of over 30% reaction rate among 15 patients with Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma(DLBCL). Only when the expected reaction rate is achieved the 30 patients left can be recruited.</description>

          1. CD19-expressing and CD20-expressing Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma(DLBCL) must be&#xD;
             assured and must be relapsed or refractory disease after at least one standard&#xD;
             chemotherapy and one salvage regimen. According to current traditional therapies,&#xD;
             there must be no available alternative curative therapies and subjects must be either&#xD;
             ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), have refused SCT, or have&#xD;
             disease activity that prohibits SCT at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients enrolled must have an evaluated score above 60 with KPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Expected survival time of patients enrolled is over 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment, which&#xD;
             may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease detected by&#xD;
             flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients are expected to survive for more than 3 months by their physicians at the&#xD;
             time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate absolute CD3 count estimated need to be assured for obtaining target cell&#xD;
             dose based on dosage cohorts.&#xD;

             of the number of WBCs; CNS 2, defined as presence of &lt; 5/uL WBCs in CSF and cytospin&#xD;
