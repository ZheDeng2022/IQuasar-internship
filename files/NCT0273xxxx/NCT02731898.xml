      A prospective, international and multicenter, non interventional single-cohort study, which&#xD;
      will enroll consecutive adult patients who have received mechanical ventilation (invasive and&#xD;
      noninvasive ventilation) for at least 12 hours during a 1-month period, and will follow each&#xD;
      patient for the duration of mechanical ventilation, up to 28 days. The main objectives will&#xD;
      be to analyze the mortality and clinical outcomes in ventilated patients and secondly, to&#xD;
      evaluate the practices of liberation from mechanical ventilation, the failure of non invasive&#xD;
      ventilation in the ICU, and to analyze the clinical outcomes in specific populations of&#xD;
      critically ill patients with the need of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is commonly used in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs).&#xD;
      Clinical studies have investigated some of the aspects associated with its utilization, and&#xD;
      have contributed to improve the knowledge and management of patients with acute respiratory&#xD;
      failure. In 1998, the main researchers conducted the first international study on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, including 5183 patients who were mechanically ventilated longer than 12 hours.&#xD;
      Six years later, the investigators carried out the second international study on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation including 4968 patients. These studies allowed to analyze the evolution of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and to judge the concordance of practice with results of randomized&#xD;
      trials. The main finding of this study was the high degree of concordance between observed&#xD;
      changes in mechanical ventilation practice and changes predicted from reports of randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials. However, despite apparently beneficial changes in ventilatory practice,&#xD;
      the results did not able to detect significant differences in clinical outcomes over this&#xD;
      time period. These results have served as an updated benchmark on the usual care and outcomes&#xD;
      of mechanically ventilaed patients in a 'real-world' setting. Lastly, in 2010 the main&#xD;
      researchers finished the Third International Study of Mechanical Ventilation and were able to&#xD;
      find out, for the first time, a significant reduction of ICU mortality in mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated patients. Then, the investigators propose to lead up the fourth-international&#xD;
      study of mechanical ventilation. This study will keep the same methodology and it will be a&#xD;
      prospective, international and multicenter non interventional single-cohort study, which will&#xD;
      enroll consecutive patients who have received mechanical ventilation (invasive and&#xD;
      noninvasive ventilation) for at least 12 hours during a 1-month period, and will follow each&#xD;
      patient for the duration of mechanical ventilation, up to 28 days. Despite of all the current&#xD;
      implementations in different ventilatory strategies, and new ventilatory modalities, the&#xD;
      mortality and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation is&#xD;
      poorly known all over the world. The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact and clinical outcomes in ventilated patients over the world; and&#xD;
           to determine the factors associated with the clinical outcomes in ventilated critically&#xD;
           ill patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyze the aspects related with the process of liberation from mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the clinical outcomes of patients with failure of noninvasive ventilation&#xD;
           (NIV) in the ICU;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate what differences may occur between geographical areas in the ventilatory&#xD;
           management of mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To describe the clinical outcomes in specific populations of critically ill patients&#xD;
           with the need of mechanical ventilation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.a: Outcomes of prolonged mechanically ventilated patients. 5.b: Prevalence of delirium in&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients. 5.c: Performance of tracheostomy and outcomes of&#xD;
      tracheostomized patients. 5.d: Outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients due to neurologic&#xD;
      diseases. 5.f: Outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients due to chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.g: Outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients due to acute renal failure. 5.h: Outcomes&#xD;
      of mechanically ventilated patients due to hypercapnia in patients with acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.i: Prediction and Prevalence of ICU acquired weakness (ICUAW) in mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.j: Clinical Outcomes and associated factors with reintubation in ventilated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.k: Clinical Outcomes of elderly patients subjected to mechanical ventilation. 5.l: Clinical&#xD;
      impact of the use of sedatives and analgesic drugs in mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study This is a multicenter, international, observational and&#xD;
      non-interventional study that will collect data of all patients who are admitted to the study&#xD;
      ICUs and who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria between May 1st, 2016 at 00:00 hours and&#xD;
      May 31st, 2016 at 23:59 hours. Patients who were already mechanically ventilated prior to&#xD;
      April 1 at 00:00 hours will not be included in the study. Approval from the research ethics&#xD;
      board of each participating institutions will be sought for this protocol. Only the&#xD;
      investigator and research coordinators at each site should be aware of the purpose and the&#xD;
      precise timing of the study, in order to minimize any practice modification in response to&#xD;
      clinicians' knowledge that they are under observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the main purpose of the study we will consider the following variables to fill out:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Date of ICU admission, mode of mechanical ventilation, date of initiation of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, demographic dates (age, gender, reason to start mechanical ventilation, severity&#xD;
      score at admission, weight, and height), arterial blood gas at the beginning of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, daily ventilator parameters (applied positive end expiratory pressure [PEEP],&#xD;
      volume tidal, peak pressure, plateau pressure), mode of NIV, duration of NIV (failure and&#xD;
      success), monitoring during NIV (respiratory rate, sedation scale [Richmond Agitation&#xD;
      Sedation Scale, RASS], arterial blood gas during NIV [at the beginning, every 2 hours of NIV&#xD;
      if tolerated, and if it failed]), date of the starting of withdrawal of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, method for weaning in the first attempt, mode of spontaneous breathing trial&#xD;
      (SBT), reason for failure of SBT, date of extubation, date of reintubation, arterial blood&#xD;
      gas at the time for extubation, reason for reintubation, development of complications during&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (organ failures [cardiovascular, hematological, hepatic or renal&#xD;
      failures], barotrauma, ARDS, sepsis, ventilator-associated pneumonia, ICUAW), tracheostomy if&#xD;
      needed, date of tracheostomy, type of tracheostomy, date of ICU discharge and status of ICU&#xD;
      discharge, reason of ICU mortality, status at hospital discharge, length of ICU and hospital&#xD;
      stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Secondary variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      We consider secondary parameter the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Mode of mechanical ventilation, brand of the ventilator, biochemical parameters during&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, use of co-adjuvant therapies (corticosteroids, insulin therapy), use&#xD;
      of medications (neuromuscular blockers, sedatives and analgesics), type of interfaces for&#xD;
      NIV, type of respirator for NIV, fluid balance, NIV at home, previous tracheostomy, any&#xD;
      isolated ventilator monitoring and setting during mechanical ventilation (invasive or not&#xD;
      invasive ventilation), destination after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Randomization This is a prospective, observational, and no intervention&#xD;
      study, and therefore, randomization is not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Despite of the characteristics of this observational study (an&#xD;
      international survey) with multiple objectives to evaluate, we decided to include patients&#xD;
      according with the calculation of the sample size for the main objective (ICU mortality). In&#xD;
      this way, we estimated that 2,600 patients would need to be enrolled for the study to have&#xD;
      90% power to detect a rate of survival to ICU discharge of 23% versus 28% in the previous&#xD;
      study, at an overall two-sided alpha level of 0.05, and assuming 20% of missing patients. The&#xD;
      secondary ob-jectives will be tested using the same sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods Appropriate statistical analyses will be conducted. Data will be express&#xD;
      as mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range) and proportion as appropriate.&#xD;
      Student's t or Mann Whitney U tests will be use to compare continuous variables and&#xD;
      chi-squared tests were used for categorical variables. Statistical analyses will be conducted&#xD;
      using appropri-ate statistical software according to evaluated outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Control Extensive efforts will be made to ensure the quality of the data collected&#xD;
      throughout the study. At each site, the study physicians, including review of the chart, will&#xD;
      review the data from a randomly chosen 5 percent of screened patients and from all patients&#xD;
      about whom the screeners had questions. Data from a random sample of 7 percent of cases were&#xD;
      abstracted and entered into the database twice, with an error rate of less than 0.25 percent.&#xD;
      The charts were reevaluated until the final notes, laboratory test results, and oth-er&#xD;
      results will be completed. Complete data will be necessary to include patients in the final&#xD;
      analysis, and we will accept patients with no missing data for the main variables or patients&#xD;
      with missing data less than 10% for secondary variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical and legal issues in this study. Patterns of practices in different hospitals are&#xD;
      often idiosyncratic and empiric based in usual care of mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will provide high quality information about the ventilatory management of&#xD;
      critically ill patients from a very large cohort of subjects in a short period of time. It&#xD;
      will inform clinical practice much more rapidly than would be possible with a standard&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials. Given the study design and the use of anonymous surveys based in&#xD;
      routine clinical parameters and ventilatory setting from critically ill patients, the main&#xD;
      coordinator team guarantees the ano-nymity of the patients included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no possibility for reporting any adverse events due the type of study&#xD;
      (international, pro-spective and non-interventional survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, given the low risk nature of the research (nonintervention study), the anonymity&#xD;
      of the survey, and the &quot;unreasonable effort&quot; to get the written informed consent, we will use&#xD;
      a pro-cess of &quot;opt-out consent&quot; which involves the provision of information to patients&#xD;
      (Information Form) and their next kin and the opportunity to opt-out from the use of their&#xD;
      data if they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality of patient data Patients will be allocated a unique study code. The site&#xD;
      research coordinator will enroll the patient in the international database and the main&#xD;
      coordinator of the study will create an enrollment number that include the country, the unit&#xD;
      and the unique study code. Study data will be obtained from routinely collected quality&#xD;
      assurance. The unique number will identify data entered into the study database only that&#xD;
      guarantee the irreversibility of clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT Data collection methods All data used in this study are routinely collected&#xD;
      from the clinical parameters obtained daily during the ICU admission. These data will be&#xD;
      collected by each participating center led by a local coordinator and saved in an online&#xD;
      database. This database will be design in the Hospital Universitario de Getafe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring Committee (DMC) A committee of three main investigators (Fernando Frutos&#xD;
      Vivar, Óscar Penuelas, Alfonso Muriel) will ensure the rights and safety of patients involved&#xD;
      in the study are protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FUNDING This study, including the protocol, will be upload in clinicaltrials.com and&#xD;
      supported by the Centro de Investigaciones Biomédicas en Red; (CIBER of Respiratory Diseases&#xD;
      (CIBER de Enfermedades Respiratorias del Instituto Carlos III) and the Respiratory Group from&#xD;
