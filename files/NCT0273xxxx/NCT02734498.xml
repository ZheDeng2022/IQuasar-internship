    <textblock>
      The purpose of this treatment study is to compare the effectiveness of different electrode&#xD;
      placements used in Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) in the treatment of catatonia. In this&#xD;
      study Electroconvulsive Therapy will be compared to medications used in the treatment of&#xD;
      catatonia. Medications will be administered by the primary team as part of standard of care.&#xD;
      Medications are not primarily being used as a part of this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatments study, will be able to compare response rate of catatonia to right unilateral&#xD;
      electroconvulsive treatment (RUL ECT) and Bilateral electroconvulsive treatment (BL ECT).&#xD;
      Also having a control group of catatonia patients, which will not be treated with ECT will&#xD;
      provide additional information on early ECT treatment of Catatonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Catatonia was first described in 1873 by a German psychiatrist, Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum in his&#xD;
      monograph titled ''Die Katatonie oder Das Spannungsirresein'' (Catatonia or tension insanity)&#xD;
      (Kahlbaum, 1873). He conceptualized catatonia as a motor syndrome characterized by lack of&#xD;
      motion, speech, alternating with periods of excessive purposeful motor activity, rigidity,&#xD;
      negativism, verbigeration, automatic imbalance, posturing, grimacing and stereotypes. He also&#xD;
      described that the syndrome generally had a periodic course and lethal outcome in a few.&#xD;
      Despite a long history, &quot;katatonia&quot; was associated with different illnesses and was given as&#xD;
      diagnostic specifier. DSM- V made a change and added catatonia as an independent diagnostic&#xD;
      symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to DSM-V, catatonia is characterized by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. the clinical picture is dominated by 3 or more of the following symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Stupor (2) Catalepsy (3) Waxy flexibility (4) Mutism (5) Negativism (6) Posturing (7)&#xD;
      Mannerism (8) Stereotypy (9) Agitation (10) Grimacing (11) Echolalia (12) Echopraxia&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination or laboratory findings that the&#xD;
      disturbance is in the direct patho-physiological consequence of another medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. the disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,&#xD;
      occupational or other important areas of functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroconvulsive therapy has a very good track record in treatment of catatonia (World J&#xD;
      Psychiatr. 2015 June 22; 5(2): 182-192), but current literature does not shed light on the&#xD;
      speed and degree of response of catatonia to ECT. This study aims to analyze and describe the&#xD;
      change of clinical signs and symptoms as a response parameter to judge ECT treatment series&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment study, will be able to compare response rate of catatonia to right unilateral&#xD;
      electroconvulsive treatment (RUL ECT) and Bilateral electroconvulsive treatment (BL ECT).&#xD;
      Also having a control group of catatonia patients, which will not be treated with ECT will&#xD;
      provide additional information on early ECT treatment of Katatonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the response rate of catatonia to right unilateral (RUL) ECT and bilateral (BL)&#xD;
           ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare response rate of catatonia to RUL ECT and BL ECT&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze and describe the change of clinical signs and symptoms after ECT treatment&#xD;
           series&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This study is a case control study. Currently ECT is considered standard of treatment&#xD;
      for catatonia in addition to alternative medication options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be and providing informed&#xD;
      consent will be randomly assigned to receive either bilateral electroconvulsive treatment (BL&#xD;
      ECT) or right unilateral electroconvulsive treatment (RUL ECT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are otherwise eligible and consent to participate in our study, but refuse&#xD;
           ECT (or ones who are unable to consent but their court appointed legal guardian or&#xD;
           health care power of attorney refuse ECT) will be enrolled as a control group. The&#xD;
           control group will undergo all the same laboratory investigations and Bush Francis&#xD;
           measurements for evaluation of their catatonia but will not receive ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent will be obtained from the study participant or their legally authorized&#xD;
           representative by the principal investigator or sub-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to treatment each patient will be examined by a clinician (psychiatrist and&#xD;
           psychiatric resident) in which the following information will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Psychiatric interview with uniformed questioner&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. History of the present illness (HPI) with onset, course of presenting symptoms,&#xD;
                comorbidities, precipitating illness or life events - emphasis upon psychological&#xD;
                stress&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Substance abuse screening&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Psychiatric history - Psychiatric diagnoses with age/date of diagnoses&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Medical history, with focus on comorbid developments and chronic medical disease&#xD;
                states - especially if recent worsening or change in therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Previous episodes of catatonia - dates and pertinent developments to social history&#xD;
                (as noted above with HPI) with time course and treatment response/failure to ECT or&#xD;
                medications&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Recent medication changes, with specific focus on timing of symptoms if possible -&#xD;
                regimen prior to symptom/sign development, medication changes, and current&#xD;
                medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Neurological conditions - including Traumatic brain injury (TBI), seizure history,&#xD;
                neurodevelopmental disorders, delirium, dementia. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
                (MOCA) will be administered the day prior to each ECT treatment and the day after&#xD;
                each ECT treatment for pre and post procedure cognitive monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
            10. Medical, metabolic, and/or psychiatric comorbidities are recorded but intentionally&#xD;
                NOT excluded, with limited exceptions:Cerebrovascular accident (CVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
            11. Questionnaires and rating scales: The following instruments will be administered by&#xD;
                a trained clinician (psychiatric resident, medical student):&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Bush- Francis Scale (BFCRS): The BFCRS is a rating scale consisting of 23&#xD;
                     catatonia items (Bush et al., 1996a). The first 14 items on this scale are the&#xD;
                     most common, classical sings of catatonia &amp; are also known as Catatonia&#xD;
                     Screening Instrument (BFCSI). If two or more of the BFCSI signs are present,&#xD;
                     for 24 hours or longer, catatonia is a possibility (Sienaert et al, 2011). For&#xD;
                     the purpose of this study, a score of 4 or more on the 23-item BCFRS will be&#xD;
                     considered for inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Hamilton depression scale&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)&#xD;
&#xD;
                The administration of the BFCRS, Hamilton depression scale and MoCA will be&#xD;
                videotaped for additional rating by a blinded rater. These assessments will be&#xD;
                administered before and after each ECT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
            12. Labs and testing to rule out organic causes of catatonia include:&#xD;
&#xD;
                EEG electroencephalogram EKG - electrocardiogram CT scan of the head w/o contrast&#xD;
                CMP complete metabolic panel, CBC diff complete blood count with differential&#xD;
                Thyroid studies TSH T3 T4 Metabolic/Inflammatory laboratory tests (in specific&#xD;
                conditions) Urine Analysis with Urine Drug Screen within 48 hours of admission) Fe&#xD;
                serum level Fibrin D-dimer Magnesium (Mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
            13. Pre-anesthesia work-up performed by the department of anesthesia to determine&#xD;
                fitness for ECT. Anesthesia faculty will administer anesthesia to participants&#xD;
                during the ECT procedure. They will monitor patient in the operating room (OR)&#xD;
                before, during and after the ECT procedure for at least 30 minutes for any adverse&#xD;
                effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
            14. ECT treatments will begin after initial evaluation as described above. ECT&#xD;
                treatments will be administered three times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
            15. Participants will not be required to try and fail a challenge of Intravenous (IV)&#xD;
                or Intramuscular (IM) Lorazepam prior to being assigned to receive ECT treatments.&#xD;
