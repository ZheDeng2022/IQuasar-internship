      Stress is well known to affect visceral sensitivity and gastrointestinal function in general.&#xD;
      A majority of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) report stress as an&#xD;
      important factor triggering symptom exacerbation. A real-life stressor could exacerbate&#xD;
      heartburn symptoms in GERD patients by enhancing perceptual response to esophageal acid&#xD;
      exposure. In Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) patients, visceral hypersensitivity is a major&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanism and stress is shown to trigger or exacerbate symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible mechanism of stress-induced visceral sensitivity could be the barrier dysfunction.&#xD;
      Indeed, in a study performed by our group, in human, an acute psychological stressor induces&#xD;
      hyperpermeability in a mast cell dependent fashion and exogenous peripheral&#xD;
      corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) recapitulated its effects on barrier function. This&#xD;
      increase in intestinal permeability is a phenomenon which appears as a prerequisite for&#xD;
      visceral hypersensitivity. Furthermore, few studies indicate that human intestinal motility&#xD;
      is probably modulated by CRH. It has been shown that the brain-gut axis in IBS patients has&#xD;
      an exaggerated response to CRH.To our knowledge, the acute effect of exogenous CRH on&#xD;
      esophageal motility has not been studied before.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), defined as the presence of&#xD;
           symptoms or lesions that can be attributed to the reflux of gastric contents into the&#xD;
           esophagus, is an increasingly prevalent condition in Western societies. The most typical&#xD;
           symptoms are heartburn and regurgitation, but GERD can manifest itself through a variety&#xD;
           of esophageal and extra-esophageal symptoms (e.g. chronic cough).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In humans, pain is a multimodal experience composted of sensory, physiological and&#xD;
           psychological aspects. In order to mimic the clinical situation, experimental models&#xD;
           should be based on testing regimens in which different receptors and central nervous&#xD;
           system mechanisms are activated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Advances in esophageal sensory stimulation have established that both typical and&#xD;
           atypical symptoms may not only arise from acid reflux, but also from reflux events with&#xD;
           less acidic pH (pH 4-7). In GERD patients with symptoms that persist in spite of acid&#xD;
           suppressive therapy, ongoing weakly-acidic and non-acid reflux is now well established&#xD;
           as the main underlying factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The basis for symptom generation during weakly-acidic reflux events remains to be&#xD;
           determined, but acid sensitivity in the pH range 4-7, mechanical distention (enhanced by&#xD;
           air in the refluxate), sensitivity to other chemical factors (e.g. bile) and esophageal&#xD;
           hypersensitivity to physiological levels of reflux have all been proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators speculate that visceral hypersensitivity plays an important role in&#xD;
           symptom perception. This is suggested by the reflux parameters that are usual within the&#xD;
           physiological number during proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Also, our group&#xD;
           previously demonstrated that refractory GERD patients have increased visceral&#xD;
           hypersensitivity for thermal, chemical and mechanical esophageal stimulation compared to&#xD;
           healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stress is well known to affect visceral sensitivity and gastrointestinal function in&#xD;
           general. A majority of patients with GERD report stress as an important factor&#xD;
           triggering symptom exacerbation. A real-life stressor could exacerbate heartburn&#xD;
           symptoms in GERD patients by enhancing perceptual response to esophageal acid exposure.&#xD;
           In Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) patients, visceral hypersensitivity is a major&#xD;
           pathophysiological mechanism and stress is shown to trigger or exacerbate symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A possible mechanism of stress-induced visceral sensitivity could be the barrier&#xD;
           dysfunction. Indeed, in a study performed by our group, in human, an acute psychological&#xD;
           stressor induces hyperpermeability in a mast cell dependent fashion and exogenous&#xD;
           peripheral corticotrophin-releasing hormone recapitulated its effects on barrier&#xD;
           function. This increase in intestinal permeability is a phenomenon which appears as a&#xD;
           prerequisite for visceral hypersensitivity. Furthermore, few studies indicate that human&#xD;
           intestinal motility is probably modulated by CRH. It has been shown that the brain-gut&#xD;
           axis in IBS patients has an exaggerated response to CRH.To our knowledge, the acute&#xD;
           effect of exogenous CRH on esophageal motility has not been studied before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES CRH is considered to be a prominent mediator of stress&#xD;
           responses in the brain-gut axis. In particular, stress-related activation of CRH&#xD;
           receptors has been reported to produce alterations in gastrointestinal function. In a&#xD;
           first study, the investigators studied the effect of CRH on esophageal sensitivity in&#xD;
           healthy volunteers (HV). Preliminary results demonstrated that CRH-administration&#xD;
           increased esophageal sensitivity (pain perception threshold) to mechanical stimulation&#xD;
           of the esophagus. In the present study the investigators want to study whether exogenous&#xD;
           CRH changes the response to mechanical stimulation through an effect on esophageal&#xD;
           contractility. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of&#xD;
           CRH-administration on esophageal motility during a standard high resolution manometry&#xD;
           (HRM) in HV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY This study will be performed in 15 HV, to have&#xD;
           sufficient data to compare volunteers mutual and to be able to make conclusions. All&#xD;
           participants will sign a copy of the informed consent, attached as appendix, before&#xD;
           initiation of the study. Esophageal motility will be measured by a standard HRM before&#xD;
           and after administration of CRH.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria include an age between 18 to 60 years old and no history of&#xD;
           gastrointestinal symptoms or complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria include history of allergic reaction to CRH, atopy (eczema, asthma,&#xD;
           food allergies, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis) or multiple allergies to several drugs,&#xD;
           pregnancy or lactation, concomitant administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors&#xD;
           (MAOI), verapamil or diltiazem or medication affecting esophageal motility, significant&#xD;
           co-morbidities (neuromuscular, psychiatric, cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine,&#xD;
           autoimmune, renal and hepatic), prior history of esophageal, Ear Nose and Throat (ENT)&#xD;
           or gastric surgery or endoscopic anti-reflux procedure, history of gastrointestinal&#xD;
           disease and first degree relatives with Crohn's disease or celiac disease. During the&#xD;
           last two weeks before the study, HV should be free from medication, except for oral&#xD;
           contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each subject that is willing to participate in this study will be submitted to a&#xD;
           physical examination. Medical history will be taken and the use of medication will be&#xD;
           inquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MATERIALS AND METHODS High Resolution Manometry Esophageal body pressure, peristalsis&#xD;
           and pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the upper part of the stomach&#xD;
           will be measured using HRM, as it is routinely performed in the university hospital of&#xD;
           Gasthuisberg in patients with symptoms of dysphagia. HRM consists of measuring multiple&#xD;
           pressures simultaneously and this allows detailed assessment of all relevant data for&#xD;
           the entire esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRH administration The effect of CRH-administration on esophageal motility will be studied.&#xD;
      After positioning of the HRM probe the investigators will first study esophageal motility at&#xD;
      baseline conditions. After the baseline procedure, 100µg CRH powder for injection (CRH&#xD;
      ferring®, Ferring, Aalst, Belgium) will be dissolved in 1 mL of sodium chloride (NaCl) 0.9%,&#xD;
      the solution will be injected intravenously over the course of 1 minute. With this dose, the&#xD;
      side-effects are limited to transient facial flushing that lasts from 5 to 45 minutes in 75%&#xD;
      of patients. CRH is clinically used as a diagnostic tool in locating the source of&#xD;
      hypercortisolism in Cushing's disease. After 20 minutes, esophageal peristalsis will be&#xD;
      studied again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva Samples Salivary samples will be obtained during the HRM procedure and will be used to&#xD;
      determine salivary cortisol at baseline conditions, immediately before the&#xD;
      CRH-administration, 30 minutes and 60 minutes after administration. Salivary cortisol will be&#xD;
      determined by ELISA (DRG Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of emotional state An assessment of general mood will be performed by the Profile&#xD;
      of Mood Schedule (POMS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI state) questionnaires&#xD;
      before and after the esophageal manometry. The POMS consists of 32 pairs of words that&#xD;
      describe different feelings and emotions at the present moment. The STAI state is validated,&#xD;
      and widely used questionnaire measuring transitory anxiety states. The scale consists of 20&#xD;
      items, which are answered on a 4-point scale. Scores are expressed as total sum scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL After an overnight fast volunteers will come to the endoscopy unit of the UZ&#xD;
      Gasthuisberg, where the study will be performed. At the beginning of the study, the&#xD;
      solid-state manometric catheter consisting of 36 manometry channels at 1cm intervals and 16&#xD;
      impedance channels (Medical Measurement Systems, Enschede, The Netherlands) will be placed&#xD;
      transnasally under topical anesthesia and will be positioned along the esophagus. Manometry&#xD;
      will measure pressure in the esophageal body, and the LES and the upper part of the stomach.&#xD;
      The impedance channels are used to measure bolus movement. After the catheter is positioned&#xD;
      in the esophagus the volunteer will remain in a bed, in semi-recumbent position for the&#xD;
      entire study period. HRM and impedance will be recorded for approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primarily, baseline recordings will be obtained. Test boluses of 5 mL liquid, 5 mL semisolid,&#xD;
      and 2 cm2 solid will be administered orally. During every swallow, volunteers will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a 5-point scale to monitor sensation of bolus hold up with 1 = normal passage, 2&#xD;
      = slow passage, 3 = step-by-step passage, 4 = partial blockage, and 5 = complete blockage.&#xD;
      After the manometry at baseline conditions, CRH will be administered IV and a waiting period&#xD;
      of 20 minutes will be taken into account since previous protocols with CRH administration&#xD;
      showed that 20 to 30 minutes after CRH injection, salivary cortisol levels are the highest.&#xD;
      After the waiting period we will repeat the same procedure used under baseline conditions.&#xD;
