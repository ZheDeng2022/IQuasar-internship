    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, dose escalation phase I trial to&#xD;
      evaluate safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 in patients with advanced Melanoma. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to assess safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 and identify recommended phase II&#xD;
      doses of SHR-1210 in patients with advanced Melanoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, nonrandomized, dose-escalation Phase 1 study to&#xD;
      evaluate safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 in subjects with advanced Melanoma who have&#xD;
      failed current standard antitumor therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical&#xD;
      examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events. Evaluations of immune safety will&#xD;
      also be conducted (immune-related adverse events (AEs), or labs of autoimmune sera,&#xD;
      inflammatory events, and immunogenicity). Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory)&#xD;
      are performed at baseline, before each study treatment, and throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed every 8 weeks. The study consists of 3 periods: screening (up to 14&#xD;
      days before the first dose), treatment, and follow-up (up to 3 months after the last dose of&#xD;
      study treatment).&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Male or female 18-70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects diagnosed with histologically or cytologically confirmed Melanoma documented&#xD;
             as advanced or metastatic disease. Subjects must be considered relapsed or refractory&#xD;

             standard therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects enrolled in the Part 2 expansion cohorts must have measurable lesion(s)&#xD;
             according to response evaluation criteria in solid (RECIST) v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Adequate laboratory parameters during the screening period as evidenced by the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L (1500/mm3)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L (100,000/mm3)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Albumin (ALB) levels ≥ 2.8 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Total bilirubin (TBIL) ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN;&#xD;
                  for subjects with liver metastases, ALT and AST ≤ 5 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
