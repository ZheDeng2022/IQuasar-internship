      Relieving symptoms of patients hospitalized in a palliative care unit is a priority. Although&#xD;
      they receive appropriate care, they may still experience pain refractory to analgesia or/and&#xD;
      to conservative treatment during care procedures. For instance, pain can be caused by the&#xD;
      bandaging of carcinological or ischemic wounds, or by the mobilization of traumatic injuries&#xD;
      which cannot be specifically treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these types of situations are rare, they remain unacceptable, especially at the end&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to current recommendations, a short-term sedation treatment can be administered&#xD;
      although detailed procedures for this type of sedation have not been very much documented. In&#xD;
      reality, midalozam is often used in those cases but it has drawbacks, which is why the&#xD;
      investigators have looked into alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol, which is already widely used in anesthesia and emergency medicine to manage painful&#xD;
      procedures, seems to be an interesting molecule because of its pharmacological properties. It&#xD;
      allows to quickly reach deep sedation and thus obtain a certain level of comfort for the&#xD;
      patient, but also ensures a prompt awakening as soon as care procedures are over, which&#xD;
      limits respiratory side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from a preliminary study encouraged us to go further and to present a prospective&#xD;
      study conducted in multiple centers in order to evaluate the efficiency and safety of a&#xD;
      procedural sedation administered by trained doctors who are not anesthesiologists on&#xD;
      terminally ill patients with refractory pain hospitalized in a palliative care unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the end of life, some patients may feel pain during care procedures. These painful&#xD;
      procedures contribute to the patient's overall suffering. Of course the investigators do not&#xD;
      take into account procedures which could be considered as futile medical care and would not&#xD;
      bring any comfort to the patient. The procedures that the investigators do consider are&#xD;
      necessary and acceptable: basic hygiene care, such as bandaging. Even with the best&#xD;
      palliative care, certain pains caused by these procedures can be refractory to analgesics, to&#xD;
      Entonox and to other conservative treatments. These pains are ethically unacceptable,&#xD;
      especially at the end of life. In these cases, short-term procedural sedation could benefit&#xD;
      the patient, as indicated by the Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament (French Agency&#xD;
      for the Safety of Health Products). However, there are no documented recommendations on the&#xD;
      way to administer these types of sedations because of a lack of scientific studies in that&#xD;
      field. It therefore remains an important issue in palliative care research. The sedations&#xD;
      consist of a transitory reduction of vigilance which is sufficient enough for the patient not&#xD;
      to suffer. They are therefore a major tool to provide sufficient comfort to terminally ill&#xD;
      patients while being used as part of a treatment approach. However, they still have&#xD;
      drawbacks: patients lose contact with the environment but can also experience respiratory&#xD;
      complications (embarrassment, respiratory depression, inhalation). These risks compel the&#xD;
      investigators to only use these sedations for terminally ill patients suffering from major&#xD;
      refractory pain at the end of life, in which case they consider that comfort is an absolute&#xD;
      priority (principle of double effect). The decision to use sedation must be agreed upon after&#xD;
      collegial consultation and discussion with the patient and/or his or her relatives. The risk&#xD;
      of side effects must be reduced as far as possible without pursuing a reanimation approach&#xD;
      which would go against a palliative approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation, which was originally exclusively administered by anesthesiologists, has been used&#xD;
      by palliative care doctors for many years. At first, midazolam seemed to be the best sedative&#xD;
      agent and its use spread although it has not been much documented in that context. However,&#xD;
      midazolam has its limits. It cannot provide a very deep sedation because of its respiratory&#xD;
      depressant effect and the patient, when under light sedation, often experiences persistent&#xD;
      discomfort. Moreover, midazolam requires a long titration period and often causes a sedation&#xD;
      which can last several hours, thus reducing the patient's relational life and increasing the&#xD;
      risk of congestion and respiratory depression. Investigators are therefore looking for&#xD;
      alternatives. According to them, propofol would be a suitable molecule because of its&#xD;
      pharmacological properties. Its pharmacokinetic properties allow the patient not only to&#xD;
      quickly reach deep sedation and therefore better comfort, but also to wake up as soon as the&#xD;
      painful care procedure is completed, thus limiting the risk of respiratory side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that it is already used in other situations for procedural sedation by doctors who are&#xD;
      not anesthesiologists (pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, emergency doctors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a feasibility study, investigators pointed out that propofol could be used in a palliative&#xD;
      care unit for transitory sedation administered by an anesthesiologist following a strict&#xD;
      protocol and could relieve terminally ill patients at the end of life during painful care&#xD;
      procedures in a sufficiently safe way (preliminary results presented at the French Society of&#xD;
      Support and Palliative Care conference in 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim at showing that a procedural sedation using propofol can be administered by&#xD;
      palliative care doctors who are not anesthesiologists but have been trained to follow a&#xD;
      precise protocol and that it can bring relief to terminally ill patients with refractory pain&#xD;
      experienced during care procedures without causing major side effects.&#xD;
