    <textblock>
      Treatment cessation in chronic hepatitis B is associated with high rates of disease relapse.&#xD;
      However patients who achieve the seroclearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (&lt;0.05&#xD;
      IU/mL) show good off-treatment durability after treatment cessation. Through the&#xD;
      quantification of HBsAg, the study aims to investigate how low should quantitative HBsAg be&#xD;
      before once can achieve successful disease control after treatment cessation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment paradigm of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) has been transformed by the introduction&#xD;
      of nucleoside analogue (NA) therapy. Long-term NA therapy can suppress viral replication,&#xD;
      improve liver histology, and reduce the risk of liver-related complications and mortality.&#xD;
      For the large majority of CHB patients, NAs need to be taken long-term, since the occurrence&#xD;
      of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance, the established treatment endpoint of&#xD;
      CHB, is a rare event. Nonetheless, once HBsAg seroclearance is achieved, virologic&#xD;
      suppression and improvement in clinical outcomes remain sustained in almost all patients even&#xD;
      after treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, attempts to discontinue NA therapy before HBsAg seroclearance had yielded variable&#xD;
      results. Concerning hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative CHB, prior studies found rates of&#xD;
      disease relapse to range from 45% to 66% after treatment cessation. A recent multicenter&#xD;
      prospective study involving three Hong Kong institutes (including our center) and 184&#xD;
      patients found the 48-week cumulative rate of virologic relapse to be 91.4%. While variations&#xD;
      in relapse rates could be explained by the difference in study design and definition of&#xD;
      endpoints, an important factor which could play a role is the serum HBsAg level of recruited&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantification of serum HBsAg has recently been advocated as a marker of disease&#xD;
      monitoring for CHB [10]. Low levels of serum HBsAg are associated with good immune control of&#xD;
      the hepatitis B virus (HBV), with serum HBsAg levels of 100-200 IU/mL being predictive of&#xD;
      eventual HBsAg seroclearance in treatment-naïve CHB. Nonetheless , in the abovementioned&#xD;
      multicenter prospective study, only 4.8% and 14.1% of study subjects had HBsAg levels &lt;100&#xD;
      IU/mL or &lt;200 IU/mL at the point of treatment cessation - which could explain the study's&#xD;
      high rate of disease relapse. In contrast, in another study of retrospective nature which&#xD;
      found a lower relapse rate of 66%, 27.6% of patients had HBsAg levels &lt;200 IU/mL at treatment&#xD;
      cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although HBsAg seroclearance is the established treatment endpoint of CHB, patients would&#xD;
      still have low amounts of intrahepatic HBV DNA. Moreover, HBsAg seroclearance via a&#xD;
      conventional assay (HBsAg &lt;0.05 IU/mL) does not mean absence of serum HBsAg, but merely serum&#xD;
      HBsAg at undetectable levels. Using more sensitive assays, detectable HBsAg can be found in&#xD;
      29.1% to 53.2% of such patients. So despite the continued presence of HBV, the off-treatment&#xD;
      durability of HBsAg seroclearance would suggest for treatment cessation, viral replication&#xD;
      and viral protein production do not need to be totally absent, but at sufficiently low&#xD;
      amounts to permit successful host immune control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, a relevant clinical question would be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How low must serum HBsAg be for successful off-treatment durability? Must the &quot;magic&#xD;
           figure&quot; of 0.05 IU/mL be reached? Or could an HBsAg level in the &gt;0.05 - 200 IU/mL range&#xD;
           be sufficient? This could have implications in drug budgeting. According to data&#xD;
           retrieved from the Clinical Data and Analysis Reporting System (CDARS), Hospital&#xD;
           Authority, NA prescription headcount in 2014 reached 36,287 prescriptions, with an&#xD;
           estimated total drug expenditure of 381 million Hong Kong dollars. A finite duration of&#xD;
           therapy for certain patients could help in the reduction of drug expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other clinical questions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Could a longer duration of NA therapy enhance the success of off-treatment durability?&#xD;
           For many available therapy cessation studies, the mean NA therapy duration was&#xD;
           approximately 1.5-3 years. There is emerging evidence demonstrating intrahepatic&#xD;
           covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) could actually decrease profoundly after more&#xD;
           than 5 years of NA therapy ; a low intrahepatic HBV cccDNA level could be the key to&#xD;
           successful off-treatment durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there any clinical factor that can reliably predict off-treatment virologic relapse?&#xD;
           A potential novel marker is the hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg), which detects&#xD;
           an identical amino-acid sequence shared by HBeAg, hepatitis B core antigen and 22 kDa&#xD;
           precore protein . Serum HBcrAg levels reflect the level of HBV disease activity [15],&#xD;
           predict the occurrence of liver-related complications , and also correlate well with&#xD;
           intrahepatic HBV cccDNA levels , the master intrahepatic reservoir for the production of&#xD;
           HBV virions. Low levels of HBcrAg could reflect low levels of intrahepatic HBV cccDNA,&#xD;
           meaning a better chance of maintaining off-treatment durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Hypotheses to be Tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the optimal HBsAg level for cessation of NA therapy in CHB&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the rate of virologic relapse in after treatment cessation in CHB patients&#xD;
           with serum HBsAg levels ≤200 IU/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the role of serum HBcrAg in predicting virologic relapse after treatment&#xD;
           cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design We propose a prospective observational study following the STROBE guidelines in&#xD;
      which we will follow-up study subjects after cessation of NA for 48 weeks. HBsAg-positive&#xD;
      patients from our clinic taking either entecavir or tenofovir therapy will be tested for&#xD;
      HBsAg levels and screened for study eligibility. Those with serum HBsAg levels &lt;200 IU/mL and&#xD;
      fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed above will be seen by one of the study&#xD;
      investigators, who would explain the study objectives and offer the option of treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled study subjects, after cessation of therapy, will be evaluated at baseline, week&#xD;
      6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48, with liver biochemistry, alpha-fetoprotein, HBV DNA, HBsAg and&#xD;
      HBcrAg levels determined at each clinic visit. A regular 6-week follow-up will be in place&#xD;
      for the first 24 weeks, since approximately 75% of all virologic relapse occurs in the first&#xD;
      24 weeks - the regular monitoring will allow detection of relapse at an early stage. In&#xD;
      addition, a dedicated research assistant will follow-up all study subjects and assist on all&#xD;
      monitoring logistics. A telephone hotline will be provided to all study subjects if they have&#xD;
      any additional queries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every HBV DNA measurement of &gt;2,000 IU/mL, as second HBV DNA will be measured after 2&#xD;
      weeks. The primary outcome of the study will be virologic relapse, defined as serum HBV DNA&#xD;
      &gt;2,000 IU/mL in both 2 measurements of 2 weeks apart, regardless of serum ALT levels, in&#xD;
      which the original NA (entecavir or tenofovir) will be recommenced. We chose HBV DNA &gt;2,000&#xD;
      IU/mL as the threshold for restarting NA as this is the level in which CHB patients would&#xD;
      need to be considered for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes of the study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HBV DNA &lt;200 IU/mL at week 48&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Undetectable HBV DNA (&lt;20 IU/mL) at week 48&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. HBsAg seroclearance (&lt;0.05 IU/mL) at week 48&#xD;
&#xD;
      NA treatment could also be resumed at the discretion of the study investigators based on&#xD;
      special clinical consideration, e.g. the sudden diagnosis of malignancy requiring&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Patients will be always given the option of dropping out from the study;&#xD;
      nonetheless we do not expect a high dropout rate (3.3% in our previous study).&#xD;
