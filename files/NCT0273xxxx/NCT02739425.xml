  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the Sentimag/Sienna+ System (Sentimag®) in clinical&#xD;
      routine practice. On the one hand this allows evaluation of the equivalence of the two&#xD;
      techniques. On the other hand this ensures that patients do not experience any possible&#xD;
      disadvantages by participating. The hypothesis behind this evaluation is that Sentimag is as&#xD;
      efficient as conventional sentinel node mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The programme will compare the Sentimag® with the conventional sentinel lymph node detection&#xD;
      with radioactive tracer combined with blue dye (in centres using the combined technique) and&#xD;
      thereby determine whether the new technique is equivalent to the standard technique for SLNB.&#xD;

      Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is now the standard technique used in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients with a clinically and radiologically negative axilla. SLNB for breast cancer was&#xD;
      introduced in the 1990s3 and it significantly reduces the morbidity associated with axillary&#xD;
      node dissection (ALND) including lymphedema, seroma, numbness, wound infection, reduced&#xD;
      shoulder motility, and chronic pain.2 The gold standard for sentinel node detection is the&#xD;
      'combined technique'; using both blue dye and radioisotope injection. After allowing both&#xD;
      radioisotope and blue dye to localize in the lymphatic system, the clinician uses a 'gamma&#xD;
      probe' (a handheld scintillation counter) to locate the SLNs. The blue dye assists in&#xD;
      localisation post-incision, with lymph nodes that are blue and/or radioactive are judged as&#xD;
      'SLNs' and excised. Some centres use either radioisotope or blue dye alone. Although&#xD;
      detection rates are lower, they can still reach satisfying values in experienced centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of radioisotope exposes patients and healthcare workers to radiation, is heavily&#xD;
      controlled by legislation (both on the specific training for operators and subsequent&#xD;
      disposal of surgical waste), and provides poor pre-operative imaging. As a result, many&#xD;
      centres have stopped undertaking routine pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy. There is thus a&#xD;
      clinical need to develop new techniques for detecting sentinel nodes without these drawbacks.&#xD;
