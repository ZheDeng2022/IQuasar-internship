  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 90% of the radiotherapy patients will develop a certain degree of skin reaction at the&#xD;
      treated area, also known as radiodermatitis (RD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is a wide variety of strategies to manage RD, including creams, gels,&#xD;
      ointments, wound dressings. However, up to now, there is still no comprehensive,&#xD;
      evidence-based consensus for the treatment of RD. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a&#xD;
      promising, non-invasive technique for treating RD. In a recent study conducted in our&#xD;
      research group, LLLT prevented the aggravation of RD and provided symptomatic relief in&#xD;
      patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer after breast-sparing surgery. This was the&#xD;
      first prospective study investigating the potential of LLLT for RD. In the current study, we&#xD;
      want to investigate the efficacy of LLLT as a tool for the prevention of radiodermatitis in&#xD;
      head and neck cancer patients.&#xD;
