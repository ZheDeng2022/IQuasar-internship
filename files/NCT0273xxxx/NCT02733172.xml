  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in&#xD;
      substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is&#xD;
      hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is&#xD;
      based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical&#xD;
      phenotypes (characteristic of the disorder) are composed of multiple biological&#xD;
      endophenotypes (such as an hereditary characteristic that is normally associated with a&#xD;
      condition but not a direct symptom of that condition) and that meaningful subgroups can be&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current proposal, the investigators plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD&#xD;
      patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological,&#xD;
      and biological parameters. The hypothesis is that central mechanisms (including alterations&#xD;
      in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are&#xD;
      important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain&#xD;
      signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has&#xD;
      considerable implications for future drug development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of 100 females diagnosed with either generalized vulvodynia (GVD) or&#xD;
      provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) which is similar however more localized to just the vestibule&#xD;
      area of the vulva enrolled. It will be a total of 140 with PVD and 60 with GVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 2 visits total over about 1-3 weeks depending on schedules and&#xD;
      menstrual cycle. The investigators will not scan a person if menstruating AND having&#xD;
      abdominal cramps/emotional liability as this may confound analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be screened for inclusion /exclusion criteria. After signing the consent&#xD;
      the participant will have a history and physical and brief psychological interview to&#xD;
      evaluation for any psychological problems present (using standard DSM-IV (diagnostic and&#xD;
      statistical manual for mental disorders) criteria. The participant will completed&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess mood, pain, pain related behavior and sexual functioning on Survey&#xD;
      Monkey. The participant will have a neuro-sensory evaluation of the perineum performed by a&#xD;
      qualified gynecologist Medical Doctor or Nurse Practitioner. During the examination the&#xD;
      clinician will swab the vaginal canal using 2 sterile swabs (vaginal fluid) for microbiota&#xD;
      (normal vaginal healthy bacteria). There will be 1 venous blood draw of about 2 teaspoons via&#xD;
      venipuncture by the nurse, to look at blood metabolites and genes. Then the participant will&#xD;
      have discomfort threshold testing of the right and left shin and upper arm muscle with an&#xD;
      algometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following screening the participant will return within 1-3 weeks to have brain scanning done&#xD;
      which involves both functional (resting state) and structural scans. The investigators will&#xD;
      measure changes in the autonomic nervous system simultaneously through electrodes on finger&#xD;
      tips which measure minute changes in sweat glands. Saliva samples will be collected for&#xD;
      analysis of polymorphism in genes controlling inflammation, pain, and nerve functioning.&#xD;
      Prior to the scanning the participant will be asked to complete questionnaires to assess&#xD;
      current (state) mood and symptoms on Survey Monkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of time of each visit is assessed to be about 90 minutes each.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Psychiatric disease: Psychiatric criteria (DSM-IV) will be used to determine exclusion&#xD;
             of volunteers with psychiatric illnesses. A psychological interview by a trained&#xD;
             clinician to determine diagnoses. We will exclude participants with any disorders or&#xD;
             psychiatric diagnoses, including, but not limited to; schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,&#xD;
             current/active and untreated depression or generalized anxiety, post traumatic stress&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. History of Drug Abuse (including major nicotine dependence): We will also exclude&#xD;
             volunteers who give self- reports or other evidence of recent (within 6 months) use of&#xD;
             psychotropic agents (other than light marijuana or alcohol). Meeting diagnostic&#xD;
             criteria for current abuse or dependence on alcohol or any illicit drugs of abuse will&#xD;
             be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Heavy tobacco smokers will be excluded to avoid confounding effects of nicotine&#xD;
             withdrawal or recent smoking on assessments during functional MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Medications or treatments for VD, including psychological or physical therapy, that&#xD;
             have been initiated less than 3 months prior to the study. Topical medication such as&#xD;
             gabapentin or estrogens are allowed. Limited use of certain antidepressants&#xD;
             (tricyclics and serotonin inhibitors) will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. CNS disease: Evidence of central nervous system (CNS), cerebrovascular, and/or&#xD;
             infectious disease, and history of neurological disease (e.g., stroke/epilepsy) or&#xD;
             history of head trauma with loss of consciousness &gt;30 minutes, any history of&#xD;
             post-traumatic amnesia, or more than one episode of head trauma, regardless of&#xD;

          8. Presence in the body of a metal device (e.g., pacemaker, infusion pump, aneurysm clip,&#xD;
             metal prosthesis or plate) that could either interfere with the acquisition of the MRI&#xD;
             scan of the brain or for whom the MRI scan would pose a potential risk will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Oral opiates/anxiolytics and steroids are never allowed due to changes in the brain&#xD;
             that would confound analysis.&#xD;
