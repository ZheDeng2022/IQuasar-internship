  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that Jetstream atherectomy (JS) and&#xD;
      adjunctive balloon angioplasty (PTA) (JS +PTA) improves target lesion revascularization (TLR)&#xD;
      at 6 months follow-up when compared to historic data from PTA alone in the treatment of&#xD;
      femoropopliteal (FP) arterial In-stent restenotic (ISR) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm study evaluating the investigational use of&#xD;
      Jetstream Atherectomy (JS) and adjunctive balloon angioplasty (JS +PTA) in the treatment of&#xD;
      FP ISR lesions in subjects with claudication or limb ischemia (Rutherford clinical category&#xD;
      (RCC) of 2-4) (lesion length ≥ 4 cm). The comparator arm is historic data from plain old&#xD;
      balloon angioplasty derived from a Meta-analysis of the 3 published randomized trials in the&#xD;
      field.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Boston Scientific Jetstream XC catheter is a rotating, aspirating, expandable catheter&#xD;
      for active removal of atherosclerotic disease and thrombus in peripheral vasculature. The JS&#xD;
      XC System has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the&#xD;
      peripheral vasculature to treat denovo and non-stent infrainguinal lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that stenting of the FP artery leads to higher long term patency.&#xD;
      Bare metal stents however have not shown conclusively to reducemTLR which is in contrast to&#xD;
      drug coated balloons (DCB) and drug coated stents (DCS). Irrespective, stenting has several&#xD;
      disadvantages including a continued high rate of restenosis and stent fractures that is&#xD;
      progressive with time. FP ISR occurs in more than one third of patients at 1 year and up to&#xD;
      49% at 2 years. Complex lesions (long, Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II C/D lesions,&#xD;
      total occlusions), certain demographics (female gender, diabetes mellitus), critical limb&#xD;
      ischemia and significant stent fractures are associated with a higher rate of restenosis.&#xD;
      Also the majority of occluded stents are restenotic-thrombotic and generally are more&#xD;
      challenging to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently 3 randomized trials were presented in treating FP ISR; the EXCImer Laser Randomized&#xD;
      Controlled Study for Treatment of FemoropopliTEal In-Stent Restenosis (EXCITE ISR) trial&#xD;
      (randomized laser + PTA vs PTA alone), the RELINE trial (Propaten Bioactive Surface vs.&#xD;
      standard balloon angioplasty for treatment of in-stent restenosis in the superficial femoral&#xD;
      artery) and the Randomized Femoral Artery In-Stent Restenosis (FAIR) Trial. All these studies&#xD;
      showed superiority over PTA in treating FP ISR. Early animal data (porcine model of FP ISR)&#xD;
      and feasibility human data (JetStream ISR study) have shown that the JetStream device is&#xD;
      effective in ablating restenotic tissue within restenotic FP stents and had no safety&#xD;
      concerns within well apposed stents and in the absence of Class III and IV fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess and estimate the effect of treating FP ISR with plaque&#xD;
      excision using JS in combination with adjunctive PTA and compare this to historic control of&#xD;
      PTA. The comparator arm is historic data from PTA derived from a study-level meta-analysis of&#xD;
      the 3 published randomized trials in the field.&#xD;
