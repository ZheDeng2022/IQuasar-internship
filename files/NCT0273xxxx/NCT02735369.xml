  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical OC-10X&#xD;
      Ophthalmic Suspension in patients diagnosed with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (level&#xD;
      61, 65, 71, or 75). OcuCure Therapeutics, Inc. (Roanoke, VA) has developed a lead compound,&#xD;
      known as OC-10X, which is a selective tubulin inhibitor under development for the treatment&#xD;
      of Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). When&#xD;
      administered as a topical eye drop, OC-10X has both anti-angiogenic (inhibition) and&#xD;
      angiolytic (regression) properties in animal models of choroidal neovascularization (CNV).&#xD;
      Unlike other therapies, OC-10X provides the efficacy of a vascular targeting agent without&#xD;
      the traditional toxicity and works downstream independently of growth factors. As&#xD;
      demonstrated by OcuCure's preclinical data, tubulin inhibition, using OC-10X, may be a&#xD;
      promising new approach to the treatment of PDR and AMD. Like AMD, PDR is a major cause of&#xD;
      blindness in adults and is also caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels. Importantly,&#xD;
      the Phase I Study found that OC-10X can be safely applied topically in human eyes without&#xD;
      adverse ocular or systemic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are few options for the treatment of PDR. Clinical options, such as laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation or vitrectomy, require surgery and can permanently impair patients' vision.&#xD;
      With few treatment options available, administration of OC-10X as a topical therapy, along&#xD;
      with its novel mechanism, has the potential to provide benefits to patients with ocular&#xD;
      diseases associated with angiogenesis.&#xD;
