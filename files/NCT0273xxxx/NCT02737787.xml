  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a combination of an investigational WT1&#xD;
      vaccine and another drug called nivolumab. This is the first time that the WT1 vaccine and&#xD;
      nivolumab are being used in combination. Also, to test the safety of a combination of an&#xD;
      investigational NY-ESO-1 vaccine and another drug called nivolumab.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will initially receive 6 vaccinations over 12 weeks and 7 infusions of nivolumab every two weeks over 14 weeks. Toxicity assessments will be performed with each dose of vaccine, and 3 weeks after the completion of therapy at week 15. Patients who do not have disease progression at the week 15 evaluation are permitted to receive 4 additional vaccines administered approximately every 8 weeks. This maintenance vaccine course would begin at week 19.This cohort has completed recruitment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologic diagnosis of ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer confirmed&#xD;
             by pathology review at MSK.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will have relapsed at least once and returned to complete clinical remission&#xD;
             after additional chemotherapy. Interval surgery is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete clinical remission is defined as CA-125 within normal limits, examination and&#xD;
             CT or MRI without objective evidence of disease (non specific abnormalities are&#xD;
             permitted on radiologic imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may sign screening consent during recurrence or at time of remission if they&#xD;
             can start vaccine therapy within 4 months of completing chemotherapy.&#xD;

             biopsied tumor nodules must be positive for WT1 (Cohort 1) or NY-ESO-1 (Cohort 2)&#xD;
             protein expression. WT1 expression: Immunohistochemical analysis will be performed&#xD;
             using the technique described by Dupont et al [58]. WT1 expression will be graded&#xD;
             according to an adaptation of the German Immunoreactive Score (IRS). Only tumors with&#xD;
             moderate to strong IRS scores (4-12) will be considered WT1 positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NY-ESO-1 expression: Tissue available from primary and/or recurrent disease will be&#xD;
             evaluated for tumor expression of NY-ESO-1 by immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or RT-PCR&#xD;
             analysis will be performed using the technique described by Jungbluth et al&#xD;

             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement&#xD;
             doses &gt;10mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active&#xD;
             autoimmune disease.&#xD;
