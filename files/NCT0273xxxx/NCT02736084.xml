    <textblock>
      The investigators developed a novel, telephone-based, 12-week positive psychology&#xD;
      intervention and will assess its feasibility and short-term impact in adults with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D) and suboptimal health behavior adherence. Participants will receive a positive&#xD;
      psychology (PP) manual, complete exercises (e.g., writing a gratitude letter, performing acts&#xD;
      of kindness), and review these activities by phone with a study trainer over the 12-week&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1 (Feasibility and acceptability (immediate impact); primary aim): To assess&#xD;
      whether PP exercises administered over the phone are feasible and linked with immediate&#xD;
      benefit in patients with T2D, as measured by ratings provided pre- and post- each exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The PP exercises will be feasible (i.e., 4 of the 7 PP exercises will be&#xD;
      completed by a majority of participants, and participants will have a mean score of at least&#xD;
      7 out of 10 on ratings of ease of completion for the exercises. The PP exercises will also&#xD;
      have adequate immediate impact (i.e., mean ratings of 7/10 of exercise utility post-exercise&#xD;
      and ratings of optimism post-exercise that are significantly higher than pre-exercise).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2 (Changes in clinical outcome measures): To determine whether the PP&#xD;
      intervention is linked to improvements in psychological well-being, during and after the&#xD;
      intervention period (6 &amp; 12 weeks), via measures of optimism, gratitude, depression, and&#xD;
      anxiety. To examine whether the brief PP intervention is associated with improvements in&#xD;
      self-reported outcomes related to health (diabetes self-care, diabetes distress, health&#xD;
      related quality of life), during and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants will have higher mean scores on all psychological outcome measures&#xD;
      at 6 and 12 weeks compared to baseline. Participants will also have higher mean scores on all&#xD;
      health-related outcome measures at 6 and 12 weeks compared to baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot and feasibility study in adult inpatients and outpatients at MGH.&#xD;
      Participants will have Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and are required to report suboptimal adherence&#xD;
      to health behaviors, measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale (MOS&#xD;
      SAS). All participants will receive a 12-week PP intervention and pre- and post-intervention&#xD;
      assessments of mood and physical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled from the outpatient Diabetes Center and inpatient medical units&#xD;
      of MGH; research staff will introduce the study, assess for inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      and obtain written informed consent. Post-enrollment, and prior to initiation of the&#xD;
      intervention, participants will complete baseline self-report measures of clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial enrollment visit, participants will receive a treatment manual. In person&#xD;
      or by telephone, the study interventionist will review the introductory portion of the manual&#xD;
      and discuss the first exercise (Gratitude for Positive Events) with the participant. In&#xD;
      subsequent weeks, exercises will be completed independently by participants, recorded in&#xD;
      their treatment manual, and then discussed over the phone with their trainer. In the final&#xD;
      week, after the final exercise is reviewed, the interventionist and participant will discuss&#xD;
      future implementation and ways to incorporate the principles into daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 12-week intervention will consist of 7 distinct PP exercises, to be completed weekly for&#xD;
      the first 4 weeks and then biweekly over the next 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For feasibility, interventionists will record rates of exercise completion at each&#xD;
      participant phone session. For acceptability, participants will rate their optimism and&#xD;
      positive affect on a 0-10 scale prior to completing the exercise and then immediately&#xD;
      following the exercise. Additionally, participants will also rate the ease and overall&#xD;
      utility of the exercise on a 0-10 scale after each exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks, non-interventionist study staff obtained the following&#xD;
      validated measures of study outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimism = Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gratitude = Gratitude Questionnaire-6 (GQ-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety and depression = Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes-related distress = Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life and function = Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement&#xD;
           Information System physical function scale (PROMIS-PF-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes self-care behaviors = Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure (SDSCA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health behavior adherence = Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale (MOS SAS)&#xD;
