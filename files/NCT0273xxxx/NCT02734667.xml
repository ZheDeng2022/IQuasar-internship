    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the impact of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)&#xD;
      on families with newly diagnosed children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The investigators hope&#xD;
      to learn about how continuous glucose monitoring affects glycemic variables and&#xD;
      diabetes-related distress.&#xD;

      Synopsis of study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot randomized clinical trial compares newly diagnosed T1D youth who are started on&#xD;
      CGM (the intervention group) versus those who are not (the control group). The investigators&#xD;
      will examine group differences over a 6-month period (Phase 1) on two sets of outcomes:&#xD;
      psychosocial variables and glycemic variables. After the initial comparison of intervention&#xD;
      to control across the first six months after diagnosis, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      longitudinal follow-up (Phase 2) of glycemic and psychosocial variables for an additional 18&#xD;
      months. The CGM system used in this study is the Dexcom G5 System with the Share function&#xD;
      (FDA Approved). An IDE was obtained to use this system in a non-adjunctive manner.&#xD;
      Participants will complete Phase 1 in six months. Phase 2 includes 3 more assessments&#xD;
      conducted every six months until participants are two years post-diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited at two centers: Stanford University and the Barbara Davis&#xD;
      Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado. Participants will be enrolled while inpatient or&#xD;
      within 1 month of diagnosis. Once identified, study staff will approach potential&#xD;
      participants to explain the study, determine eligibility, and obtain informed consent. Once&#xD;
      enrolled in the study, participants will be randomized. Participants will be randomized at a&#xD;
      2:1 ratio, intervention to control. The investigators will also stratify by age group to&#xD;
      ensure equal representation of ages across groups. The age groups (in years) are 2-6, 7-11,&#xD;
      and 12-17. To ensure safety in the youngest group, recruitment of participants in the age 2-6&#xD;
      years group will not begin until the investigators have at least 2 weeks of non-adjunctive&#xD;
      CGM use data in at least 3 participants aged 7-17 years. Data will be reviewed by the DSMB on&#xD;
      these 3 participants and if deemed safe by the DSMB, the investigators will start enrolling&#xD;
      participants in the youngest age group.&#xD;
