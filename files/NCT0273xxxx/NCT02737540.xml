  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to confirm the existence of risky decision making in a&#xD;
      non strategic situation (Iowa Gambling Task) and a deficit of decision making in social&#xD;
      situations, linked to greater sensitivity to injustice (Ultimatum Game) and a lower level of&#xD;
      trust (Trust Game) in elderly depressed patients with a history of suicide attempts in&#xD;
      comparison with older depressed patients without a history of suicidal acts and healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives are to confirm or explore the deficits of certain cognitive&#xD;
      processes involved in potentially suicidal behavior in depressed elderly persons but that&#xD;
      have been little or not studied to date. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. cognitive control and sensitivity to interference (Victoria Stroop test, incompatibility&#xD;
      test, flexibility test, Go / No-Go);&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Strategic recovery of semantic memory (verbal fluency test);&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Working memory (TEA);&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Insight related to depression (Mood Disorders Insight Scale);&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Recognition of facial emotions;&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Emotional regulation;&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Negative attitudes;&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. Self-perception and;&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Time perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, patients will be contacted by telephone at month 6 to assess the occurrence of a&#xD;
      suicidal act during this period and thus calculate the predictive ability of cognitive and&#xD;
      psychological factors.&#xD;

        The study population consists of patients over 60 years of age with or without a personal&#xD;
        history of suicide attempts, hospitalized in the Nîmes University Hospital psychiatry&#xD;
        department or the Sophoras clinic for a major depressive episode. Healthy subjects over 60&#xD;
        years, not depressed and without personal history of severe mental illness or suicide&#xD;
        attempts will also be recruited.&#xD;

             of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Thesubject has current confusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pharmacological treatment is not a criterion for exclusion in itself but it will be left to&#xD;
        the judgment of the evaluator to choose to include a subject or not (or to postpone&#xD;
