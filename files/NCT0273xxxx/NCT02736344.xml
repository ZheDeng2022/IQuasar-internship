      The BioNIR Ridaforolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System is a single use device/drug&#xD;
      combination product comprising:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stent - mounted Cobalt Chromium (CoCr) alloy based stent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delivery System - Rapid Exchange (RX) Coronary System&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polymer matrix coating - Poly n-butyl methacrylate (PBMA) and polymer coating&#xD;
           (CarboSil®)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ridaforolimus drug - Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number: 572924-54-0 The&#xD;
           product is indicated for improving coronary luminal diameter in patients with&#xD;
           symptomatic heart disease due to lesions in vessels with reference diameters of 2.5mm to&#xD;
           4.25mm, including complex lesions.&#xD;

      The study will be a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study involving up to 4 centers in&#xD;
      the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject population is subjects with an indication for percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI) with stent implantation for stable angina and/or silent ischemia. Twelve (12)&#xD;
      consecutive patients referred for PCI or possible PCI with suspected or proven coronary&#xD;
      artery disease will be screened and consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve (12) consecutive patients referred for PCI or possible PCI with suspected or proven&#xD;
      coronary artery disease will be screened and consented. Patients with ACS are not eligible.&#xD;
      Patients will be considered enrolled and eligible to receive the BioNIR stent after&#xD;
      successful and uncomplicated crossing of the target lesion and successful and uncomplicated&#xD;
      lesion preparation (such as pre-dilatation) if needed. At least 30% (4 subjects) will receive&#xD;
      more than one stent or a sufficiently long stent so that the total implanted stent dose is&#xD;
      &gt;1.5 times the ridaforolimus dose of the workhorse BioNIR stent (3.0x17 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, a total of up to 14 blood samples will be collected at the following time&#xD;
      points: immediately prior to the first stent implant as time 0, at 10 and 30 minutes, and at&#xD;
      1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24±6, 48±12, 72±12, 168±36 (7 days), 336±36 (14 days) and 720±36 hours (30&#xD;
      days) after the first BioNIR stent implantation. Whole blood concentration of ridaforolimus&#xD;
      will be determined using a validated high performance liquid chromatography mass&#xD;
      spectrometry/mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method. If two consecutive measurements are&#xD;
      available and both demonstrate ridaforolimus levels below the detection limit of the assay,&#xD;
      the levels at all subsequent time points will not need to be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship to BIONICS STUDY: The general and angiographic inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be identical to the pivotal BIONICS trial with the exception of Acute Coronary Syndrome&#xD;
      (ACS) patients who will be excluded. Clinical data will be collected in an identical manner&#xD;
      to the BIONICS study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Clinical follow-up will be performed at 30 days, 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years post&#xD;
      enrollment.) The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be evaluated: maximum&#xD;
      concentration (Cmax), Cmax adjusted by treatment dose, time to maximum concentration (tmax),&#xD;
      the time of the last quantifiable concentration (tlast ), half-life time ( t1/2), total area&#xD;
      under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to tlast (AUC0-tlast), total area under the&#xD;
      concentration-time curve from time 0 to tlast (AUC0-t∞) and total body clearance (CL). AUCs&#xD;
      normalized by treatment dose will also be derived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 subjects will be enrolled in order to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of&#xD;
      ridaforolimus release from the BioNIR stent. The number of subjects was chosen based on&#xD;
      experience in the literature from other 'limus' drug eluting stents as well as specific&#xD;
      request from FDA.&#xD;
