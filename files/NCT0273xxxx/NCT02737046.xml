    <measure>Proportion of Participants achieving Complete Molecular Response (CMR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From End of Cycle 3 to End of Maintenance Therapy, Up to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants achieving Complete Molecular Response after receiving protocol therapy. Complete Molecular Response (CMR) is defined as no evidence of disease at any body sites AND the disappearance of malignant clone(s), as proven by negative T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies of peripheral blood DNA. Molecular response will be evaluated based upon T-cell clonality studies to be conducted while subjects are on Belinostat, and while subjects are receiving AZT-based maintenance treatment (after Belinostat completion).</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Participants with Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)</measure>
    <time_frame>From End of Cycle 3 to End of Maintenance Therapy, Up to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects with minimal residual disease (MRD) will also be reported. Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is defined as the presence of malignant clone(s) as determined by negative T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies of peripheral blood DNA.</description>

    <measure>One Year Rate of Failure-Free Survival (FFS)</measure>

    <description>Subjects will be evaluated during treatment and by follow-up assessments post-treatment. 1-year FFS is defined as the time from study treatment initiation until documented disease progression, relapse after response or death (by any cause, in the absence of progression). In the failure-free subjects, FFS will be censored at the last documented date of failure-free status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>One Year Rate of Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
