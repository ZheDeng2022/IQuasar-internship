      Ninety healthy pregnant women candidate for surgical evacuation after confirming 1st&#xD;
      trimester pregnancy loss were enrolled in the study. They were randomized in three groups;&#xD;
      misoprostol group in which 30 candidates were receive 2 tablets of misoprostol (i.e. 400 ug)&#xD;
      4 hrs prior to surgical evacuation, Effox group in which 30 candidates were received 2&#xD;
      tablets of Effox (i.e 40 mg) 4 hrs prior to surgical evacuation &amp; combination therapy group&#xD;
      in which 30 candidates were received 1 tablets of misoprostol 200ug &amp; 1 tablets of Effox 20&#xD;
      mg 4 hrs prior to surgical evacuation. For all participants, the route of administration was&#xD;
      the intravaginal route 1ry outcomes included cervical consistency &amp; dilatation immediately&#xD;
      before the procedure. 2ry outcomes included total duration of the operation and the&#xD;
      occurrence of drug-related side effects&#xD;

      Objective: To compare the efficacy of the individual use of Misoprostol or Effox or their&#xD;
      combination as cervical ripening agents in cases with 1st trimesteric pregnancy loss&#xD;
      candidate for surgical evacuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A randomized Single-blind comparative study. Setting: The Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology casuality department of Kasr El Aini hospital (Cairo University - Egypt) in the&#xD;
      period from November 2015 to June 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: ninety healthy pregnant women candidate for surgical evacuation after confirming&#xD;
      1st trimester pregnancy loss were enrolled in the study. They were randomized in three&#xD;
      groups; misoprostol group in which 30 candidates were receive 2 tablets of misoprostol (PGE1)&#xD;
      200ug (i.e. 400 ug) 4 hrs prior to surgical evacuation, Effox group in which 30 candidates&#xD;
      were received 2 tablets of Effox (Isosorbide mononitrate) 20 mg (i.e 40 mg) 4 hrs prior to&#xD;
      surgical evacuation &amp; combination therapy group in which 30 candidates were received 1&#xD;
      tablets of misoprostol 200ug &amp; 1 tablets of Effox 20 mg 4 hrs prior to surgical evacuation.&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Hospital Ethical Committee. Informed consents were obtained&#xD;
      from all participants after explanation of the aim of the study &amp; the potential adverse&#xD;
      effects. The study was not supported by any pharmacological company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria included maternal age 18-40 years, 1st trimesteric pregnancy loss with&#xD;
      gestational age 12 weeks or less (diagnosis was confirmed using transvaginal ultrasound&#xD;
      according to the following criteria: Crown-rump length {CRL} of 7 mm or more and no&#xD;
      heartbeat, Mean sac diameter {MSD} of 25 mm or more and no embryo, absence of embryo with&#xD;
      heartbeat 2 wk or more after a scan that showed a gestational sac without a yolk sac and&#xD;
      absence of embryo with heartbeat 11 days or more after a scan that showed a gestational sac&#xD;
      with a yolk sac)* &amp; closed firm cervix. Exclusion criteria included evidence suggesting&#xD;
      spontaneous onset of abortion (vaginal bleeding or and uterine cramps), previous trial to&#xD;
      induce abortion or the use of any cervical ripening agent during the current pregnancy,&#xD;
      presence or suspicion of septic abortion (fever &gt; 38 C, offensive vaginal discharge &amp;&#xD;
      leukocytosis), Uterine anomalies or history of any cervical surgery or manipulation. For all&#xD;
      patients, full history was taken followed by complete physical examination (including&#xD;
      cervical assessment), transvaginal ultrasound (to confirm early pregnancy loss) &amp; routine&#xD;
      preoperative investigation. Patient is then randomized to one of the three groups (using&#xD;
      computer generated random numbers) and accordingly the investigator gave her either 2 tablets&#xD;
      of misoprostol 200ug (misoprostol group) or 2 tablets of Effox 20 mg (Effox group) or 1&#xD;
      tablets of misoprostol 200ug &amp; 1 tablets of Effox 20 mg (Combination therapy group). For all&#xD;
      participants, the route of administration was the intravaginal route (tablets were places&#xD;
      high up in the posterior fornix of the vagina. Only patients were blinded to the nature of&#xD;
      the tablets. 4 hrs later, the patient was admitted to the operating room for surgical&#xD;
      evacuation with the following technique: under general anesthesia &amp; after assessment of&#xD;
      cervical consistency (soft or firm) &amp; dilatation (tested by the number of the largest Hegar's&#xD;
      dilator passed without resistance), ultrasound-guided suction evacuation was done followed by&#xD;
      fine curettage using the appropriate size curette. All participants were monitored for any&#xD;
      changes in vital signs (every hour), occurrence of headache &amp; severe abdominal cramps since&#xD;
      the onset of drug administration till 6 hours postoperative. 1ry outcomes included cervical&#xD;
      consistency &amp; dilatation immediately before the procedure. 2ry outcomes included total&#xD;
      duration of the operation and the occurrence of drug-related side effects namely high&#xD;
      temperature (38 or more) and severe abdominal pain for the misoprostol or headache and low&#xD;
      blood pressure for the Effox.&#xD;
