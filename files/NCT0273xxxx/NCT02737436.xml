    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct functional MRI scanning with a group of mothers who are&#xD;
      blindly and randomly assigned either intranasal oxytocin or a placebo. The purpose of this&#xD;
      investigation is to explore how oxytocin may modify early maternal brain and behavioral&#xD;
      responses to infant cues. This study will examine, for the first time, a potential&#xD;
      pharmacological intervention for maternal neglect which targets core neurobiological&#xD;
      deficits. This may eventually be used to supplement and augment other psychosocial and&#xD;
      behavioral interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will examine sex differences in parental brain and behavioral&#xD;
      responses to oxytocin by also recruiting fathers to participate in a similar protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct fMRI scanning with a group of mothers who are blindly and&#xD;
      randomly assigned either intranasal oxytocin or a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine whether intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) affects parental brain responses to&#xD;
      infant cues, as measured during functional MRI (fMRI) scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1 (i): Compared to placebo, mothers who receive intranasal oxytocin will show&#xD;
      greater activation of mesocorticolimbic dopamine reward regions in the brain, including the&#xD;
      ventral striatum and the medial prefrontal cortex, when viewing their own vs. unknown infant&#xD;
      faces during fMRI scanning. Hypothesis 1 (ii): Compared to placebo, fathers will show greater&#xD;
      activation of social-cognitive circuits, including the dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine whether IN-OT affects parental behavioral responses to infant cues, as&#xD;
      measured by videotaped parent-infant interaction procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2 (i): Compared to placebo, parents who receive intranasal oxytocin will score&#xD;
      higher on an overall measure of maternal sensitivity, during a free play parent-infant&#xD;
      interaction procedure (CARE-Index). Hypothesis 2 (ii): Compared to placebo, mothers who&#xD;
      receive intranasal oxytocin will demonstrate more frequent emotionally contingent responses&#xD;
      with their infant during the recovery phase of a modified Still-Face procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine whether attachment security interacts with the effect of IN-OT on&#xD;
      maternal brain and behavioral responses to infant cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3 (i): Compared to secure (Type B) mothers, mothers with insecure/dismissing (Type&#xD;
      A) attachment will have a greater brain and behavioral response to IN-OT (as described in&#xD;
      Hypotheses 1 and 2), with a 2-way interaction effect seen between treatment and attachment&#xD;
      groups. Hypothesis 3 (ii): Compared to Type B mothers, mothers with insecure/preoccupied&#xD;
      (Type C) attachment will have a reduced brain and behavioral response to IN-OT (as described&#xD;
      in Hypotheses 1 and 2), with a 2-way interaction effect seen between treatment and attachment&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To determine whether brain reward activation is associated with other indirect&#xD;
      measures of emotional neglect in mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4 (i): Maternal brain reward system activation, both with and without IN-OT, will&#xD;
      be positively correlated with 1) maternal sensitivity (as measured by the CARE-Index), 2) the&#xD;
      contingency of maternal responses to infant behavioral cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial enrollment: Recruitment will occur during the postpartum period. In addition to&#xD;
      recruiting from EPIC medical record, the investigators plan to execute other recruiting&#xD;
      measures in the form of advertising. Parent(s) will be recruited via newspaper, internet,&#xD;
      public postings, and mass mailings. Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be scheduled&#xD;
      for a study visit where they will be informed of confidentiality and consented before&#xD;
      participating in any study activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: 4 Months Post-Partum - Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). During this visit, each&#xD;
      enrolled woman will participate in a modified version of the Adult Attachment Interview&#xD;
      (AAI), a semi-structured 1Â½-2 hour-long interview involving specified questions and follow-up&#xD;
      inquiries relating to childhood relationships with attachment figures. The investigators will&#xD;
      also collect sociodemographic, breastfeeding data, and screening information for depression.&#xD;
      The EPDS will be repeated during subsequent visits in order to calculate mean scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2A&amp;B and 3A&amp;B: Intranasal Oxytocin vs. Placebo Administration In this double-blind&#xD;
      cross-over placebo-controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin, maternal brain and behavioral&#xD;
      responses to infant cues will be assessed within &amp; between subjects. Each participant will be&#xD;
      administered both the active (oxytocin) and inactive (placebo) nasal spray just prior to&#xD;
      separate behavioral or fMRI scanning sessions, with order of administration balanced across&#xD;
      subjects and between attachment groups. All involved will be blinded to the identity of the&#xD;
      oxytocin or placebo sprays. Before each visit, parent(s) will be asked to abstain from&#xD;
      tobacco, food and drink (except water) for at least 2 hours prior to the visit. The&#xD;
      investigators will attempt to schedule visits during the latter half of the mother's&#xD;
      menstrual cycle, to minimize potential confounding from fluctuations in estrogen levels.&#xD;
      Mothers without regular menstrual cycles will be scheduled one month apart. Mothers who are&#xD;
      still breastfeeding will be asked to feed their infant at least one hour prior to the visit.&#xD;
      For the four visits involving intranasal drug administration (two behavioral testing visits&#xD;
      and two fMRI scanning visits), the following protocol will apply: participants will be given&#xD;
      a urinary pregnancy test prior to the start of each visit. If a mother tests positive, she&#xD;
      will be excluded from the study due to theoretical concern about possible effects of oxytocin&#xD;
      on uterine contraction. Due to the fact that the pregnancy test may still not detect an early&#xD;
      pregnancy, the mothers will also be asked to abstain from unprotected sexual intercourse&#xD;
      during the 2 weeks prior to the visit, and will confirm, in signing the consent form, that&#xD;
      there is no substantial chance of a current pregnancy. Just prior to drug administration, the&#xD;
      parent(s) will complete the Positive and Negative Affect Scale, to rate her current emotions,&#xD;
      for comparison to post-spray. The parent(s) will then self-administer a dose of either&#xD;
      oxytocin (3 puffs per nostril [4 IU per puff] = 24 IU total) or a placebo spray that contains&#xD;
      only the inactive ingredients of the oxytocin solution. Both experimenters and subjects will&#xD;
      be blind to the treatment they are receiving. A stopwatch will be started at the moment the&#xD;
      subjects begins intranasal administration, so that the behavior assessment or fMRI scanning&#xD;
      can begin exactly 50 minutes later. Most other studies of intranasal oxytocin have used a 50&#xD;
      minutes delay time, based on CSF studies of other intranasally administered neuropeptides,&#xD;
      such as the analogous hormone vasopressin. Forty minutes after drug administration, the PANAS&#xD;
      will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2A&amp;B: 5-6 Months Postpartum - Behavioral Response&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. On arrival, the parent(s) and infant will be escorted into a behavioral observation room&#xD;
           at the Clinical Nutrition Research Center, where the infant will be introduced to some&#xD;
           developmentally appropriate toys. Questionnaires completed at home will be reviewed&#xD;
           (Infant Behavior Questionnaire [IBQ], Parenting Stress Index [PSI] and demographics and&#xD;
           breastfeeding questionnaire), and if incomplete will be completed at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Each parent will then self-administer the nasal spray, which has been previously&#xD;
           randomized by the investigational pharmacy to be either oxytocin or placebo. During the&#xD;
           following waiting period, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development screener will be&#xD;
           completed with the infant, to exclude developmental delays in areas of fine motor, gross&#xD;
           motor, language or social development. This will be performed by a research associate&#xD;
           who has been trained in the use of this standardized tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fifty minutes after the nasal spray is administered, each parent will rejoin their&#xD;
           infant to each participate in a videotaped &quot;free play&quot; interaction on the floor for 3&#xD;
           minutes (described below). The recording will later be coded for dyadic interactions&#xD;
           using a 14-point sensitivity scale in the CARE-Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A modified still-face procedure will then be conducted during the next 3 minutes(as&#xD;
           described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The parent(s) will then be taken to another area of the building, while the infant is&#xD;
           videotaped to obtain face images that will be used during the subsequent scanning&#xD;
           visits. During the brief separation period, the infant will be secured in a mounted car&#xD;
           seat, and videotaped while using age appropriate toys to elicit smiling (and neutral)&#xD;
           facial expressions. This should last no more than 10 minutes. Crying faces will also be&#xD;
           elicited, if necessary, by briefly leaving the infant alone in the room, secured in the&#xD;
           car seat, while the video recorder is running. The infant will be observed at all times&#xD;
           from behind a one-way mirror, and only left to cry for around 35-40 seconds. Infant cry&#xD;
           will also be recorded at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Infant face images with various degrees of affect-happy, neutral and sad-will then be&#xD;
           extracted from the digital video recording, for use in the subsequent fMRI procedure&#xD;
           (Visit 3). The images will be standardized for size, orientation and background using&#xD;
           Adobe Photoshop. All of the face images will be rated on degree of affect using a&#xD;
           5-point adaptation of the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), categorizing each image into&#xD;
           one of five affect groups: very happy, happy, neutral, sad or very sad. These faces will&#xD;
           be matched on age, sex, ethnicity and degree of affect with a large database of&#xD;
           &quot;unknown&quot; infant faces.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Approximately one month later, at a comparable time in the menstrual cycle, the basic&#xD;
           procedure will be repeated for each subject, except that those who received intranasal&#xD;
           oxytocin will be given placebo, and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3A&amp;B: 8-9 Months Postpartum - Brain Response&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Three months after the first behavioral response session, each parent will attend two&#xD;
           scanning sessions at the Human Neuroimaging Laboratory, Baylor College of Medicine.&#xD;
           Intranasal oxytocin or placebo will again be administered as described above. Infant&#xD;
           face images from Visit 3A will be used in Visit 4A scanning session, and Visit 3B with&#xD;
           4B, to ensure that the repeat scanning session uses comparable but unique face images.&#xD;
           The images from both sessions will be matched on degree of facial affect. Prior to&#xD;
           intranasal drug administration on the first scanning visit, the parent(s) will complete&#xD;
           the Positive and Negative Affect States (PANAS) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the waiting period, the parent(s) will complete questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fifty minutes after the administration of the nasal spray, the parent(s) will&#xD;
           participate in the functional MRI scanning session, passively viewing a series of unique&#xD;
           infant face images and hearing cries of her own infant and of an unknown infant. Using&#xD;
           an event-related fMRI design, randomly presented images will be viewed for 2 seconds,&#xD;
           with a random inter-stimulus interval of 2, 4 or 6 seconds (Fig 3). The 60 images will&#xD;
           be equally divided into 3 affect groups - happy, neutral or sad, with the intensity of&#xD;
           happy and sad affect balanced between the &quot;own&quot; and &quot;unknown&quot; faces. The order of the&#xD;
           images from each of the 6 groups (OH, ON, OS, UH, UN, US) will be pseudo-randomized&#xD;
           within the run, but not between subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All imaging will be performed using a 3 Tesla Siemens MRI scanner. Visual images will be&#xD;
           generated using a LCD projector, and presented to the parent(s) via an overhead mirror&#xD;
           display. Regional brain activation will be assessed by measuring changes in&#xD;
           blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI signal (BOLD-fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjects will participate in a single whole-brain functional run of around 185 scans&#xD;
           each.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. High-resolution T1-weighted structural images will then be acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. After the scanning session, each parent will be asked to rate each of the infant face&#xD;
           images on how they thought the infant was feeling, as well as their own feelings of&#xD;
           pleasure or arousal, using an adaptation of the Self-Assessment Manikin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. After the parent(s) has completed the questionnaires, 2 out of 4 randomly selected modules&#xD;
      of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development screener will be completed with the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. The parent(s) will then rejoin their infant to participate in a videotaped &quot;free play&quot;&#xD;
      interaction on the floor for 3 minutes. The recording will later be coded for dyadic&#xD;
      interactions using a 14-point sensitivity scale in the CARE-Index.&#xD;
