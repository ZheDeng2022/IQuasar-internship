      Heart failure is a growing throughout pathology in Europe. It is a public health issue and an&#xD;
      economic issue. The management to be effective needs to be early but specific. Generic&#xD;
      treatment (medication, rehabilitation, hygienic dietary measures) known for over 15 years and&#xD;
      has demonstrated its effectiveness, come s'ajouter solutions specific, technically complex&#xD;
      and expensive to implement. Because of the potential risk to the patient and their cost to&#xD;
      the company, these new techniques need to be adapted to each case. The passage of a generic&#xD;
      simple treatment for everyone in the single treatment tailored to each patient requires&#xD;
      decision support tools for the clinician. These tools or decision trees are developed using&#xD;
      mathematical and statistical models fed by all patient data (imaging, biology physiology ...)&#xD;
      before and after implementation of treatment. Predictive response models of a treatment&#xD;
      applied to a particular pathology can thus be generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is this type of models applied in systolic heart failure complicated by mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation and / or cardiac synchronization that will be generated in this project from&#xD;
      150 patients included in 3 European clinical studies (London, Brussels, Caen). In Caen we&#xD;
      will include 30 patients in this single-center study&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a clinical problem increasingly common throughout Europe, partly&#xD;
      because of the aging population and increasing numbers of patients now survive after&#xD;
      myocardial infarction [1, 2] . The IC is a progressive disease and when patients require&#xD;
      hospitalization, long-term prognosis is poor [3]. The treatment of IC is focused on improving&#xD;
      the work of the failing heart via the use of specific drugs, if necessary by cardiovascular&#xD;
      interventions correcting structural lesions (mitral regurgitation) or correcting a&#xD;
      disorganized contraction (therapy resynchronization). However, the IC is a disease complex&#xD;
      with multiple factors pathophysiological interdependent making difficult treatment choices&#xD;
      optimal or of a combination therapeutic optimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technologies HPV predictive, such as tools for processing data, statistical models and&#xD;
      simulations biophysical that incorporate these factors pathophysiological have tremendous&#xD;
      potential to help improve our understanding of the response to treatment in the context of&#xD;
      the IC. In particular, they have the potential to improve the selection of patients for&#xD;
      cardiovascular interventions such as cardiac resynchronization therapy and / or that an&#xD;
      intervention on the mitral valve [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Projects recent - European (HPV or Human physiological virtual) and national - have developed&#xD;
      a large number of these technologies, but n'ont not been fully released into the environment&#xD;
      clinic to help care for patients IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of VP2HF project is to develop and validate in clinical settings computer&#xD;
      modeling platform to integrate non-invasive clinical and imaging evidence acquired in&#xD;
      patients with heart failure ( IC) for two reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify for each patient, the likely response to different therapeutic interventions&#xD;
           with all clinical data processed by a decision support system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Optimize responses or interventions selected for each patient to maximize treatment&#xD;
           response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to generate complete data sets used to parameterize the model&#xD;
      calculations. All patients will have an accurate imaging assessment and a detailed assessment&#xD;
      of bio-signals at times (time points) accurate (as shown above) with variations depending on&#xD;
      the sustained cardiovascular procedure described below .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of symptoms with the Minnesota Quality of Life Questionnaire in patients with&#xD;
           heart failure (MLHFQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 minute walk test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiopulmonary stress test (CPET) to assess VO2 max&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reference initials Blood tests (CBC, urea and electrolytes, NT-proBNP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2D and 3D cardiac echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac MRI including myocardial tattoo 3D sequences (tagging 3D) and 4D sequences for&#xD;
           blood circulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-invasive measurement of central blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-interference Whatever the treatment envisaged by the surgical team in charge of&#xD;
      processing (resynchronization, mitral clip, mitral valve repair or mitral valve replacement)&#xD;
      operative techniques and monitoring procedures will be those normally used by operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) can be considered that 70% of patients in our cohort&#xD;
      eligible for a CRT are also eligible for this project. Invasive measurement of left&#xD;
      ventricular pressure with and without stimulation may also be acquired to study the acute&#xD;
      hemodynamic effects of CRT and to make comparisons with the extent of NBP in order to test&#xD;
      and validate the noninvasive pressure estimates and mechanical modeling tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repair and replacement of the mitral valve: It is expected that 30% of our cohort of patients&#xD;
      have significant mitral regurgitation requiring intervention, mainly to repair the mitral&#xD;
      valve and the occasional replacement of the mitral valve when the repair is unsuccessful. In&#xD;
      some of these patients, the repair will be carried out by trans-catheter track and they will&#xD;
      hemodynamic measurements in the aorta, the left ventricle and the left atrium before and&#xD;
      after the repair of the mitral valve that will be used for the purposes of test and validate&#xD;
      non-invasive estimates of pressure and mechanical modeling tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after surgery All patients will again echocardiography, non-invasive measurement&#xD;
      of central blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Followed at 6 months We will again perform , 6 months after surgery , complete postoperative&#xD;
      evaluation unless cardiac MRI in patients with a CRT ( because this review is against -&#xD;
      indicated ) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      in addition to standard care pathway exams non-invasive measurement of central blood pressure&#xD;
      The non -invasive blood pressure management Centron Diagnostics uses a humeral standard&#xD;
      oscillatory cuff estimate both the PA peripheral and central aortic pressure. For the&#xD;
      patient, this is an experiment similar to that of an automatic blood pressure recording . All&#xD;
      patients benefit from this measure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exams IRM3T to Cyc√©ron (M0 and M6)&#xD;
