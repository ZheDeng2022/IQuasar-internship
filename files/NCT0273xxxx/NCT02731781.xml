    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the major cause of disability and death among the younger&#xD;
      population. In the Pediatric population Head trauma may be responsible for primary and&#xD;
      secondary brain damage. Primary brain injury results from a direct mechanical damage at the&#xD;
      time of injury, whereas secondary injury is caused by further cellular damage that develops&#xD;
      hours or days post injury. Intracranial Injury in Infants (III) may be hard to diagnose in&#xD;
      the abcence of neurological deficit or early deterioration. On the other hand, symptoms such&#xD;
      as vomiting and restlessness may be present even in the case of minor head injury, and&#xD;
      unnesessary scaning (CT) may be performed in many centers just because clinical judgment is&#xD;
      problematic in this particular age. Some intracranial injuries may be imminent, such as&#xD;
      evolving Epidural hematoma (EDH) in infants, and early diagnosis may be lifesaving and&#xD;
      leading to excellent outcome. In adults, GCS has been accepted as the most usuful tool for&#xD;
      emergency evaluation of head injured patients. In children, several scores were introduced,&#xD;
      including the Children's Coma Score (CCS), however they have been found problematic to use in&#xD;
      the very young population, since accurate evaluation of communication in CCS is hard, and&#xD;
      there is insufficient relevant parameters uncorporated into the score that may have&#xD;
      significant importance in this particular age group. In TINS (Trauma Infant Neurological&#xD;
      Score) we characterized the clinical parameters and the mechanism of trauma in a simplified&#xD;
      method. As previously published, this score has been used by us and by other groups, in&#xD;
      retrospective studies. Still, in the lack of prospective studies using TINS, there are no&#xD;
      optimal guidelines to perform computed tomography (CT) in this unique population, and TINS&#xD;
      has not prospectively been challenged as a predictor tool for outcome. In this prospective&#xD;
      study we will approach these issues.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 infants (&lt;2 years old) will be enrolled into the study. Clinical data will be gathered&#xD;
      from the emergency room file, and in case of admission from the discharge letter and the&#xD;
      clinical file. Based on the current protocols of treatment and diagnosis of children with&#xD;
      head injury, CT will be performed according to the current axisting protocols. No&#xD;
      intervention, imaging, or treatment will be administered different from the current protocol&#xD;
      used in the hospital, according to the existing guidelines. Both TINS and Children's Glasgow&#xD;
      Coma Scale (CCS) score was applied, based on the clinical data obtained from the files. If&#xD;
      imaging is peformed data will be recoreded. As all children with head trauma are invited&#xD;
      routinely to follow-up clinic within the 1st year after injury, this data will be recoreded&#xD;
      as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is no violation of current treatment protocols, or any additional exams or&#xD;
      interventions due to the study - and since the data is obtained from the files, informed&#xD;
      concent will not be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be coded by the treating doctors into a database that will be coded in a manner&#xD;
      that identification of the child is not possible by the statisticians or by people who are&#xD;
      not involved in treatment and follw up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database used will be a &quot;filemaker pro&quot; data base, with concequent numbering of the&#xD;
      infant enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difficulty in clinical assessment and early diagnosis of infants using different versions&#xD;
      of the CCS, is well known as reported previously. [12-18] In our series, about half of the&#xD;
      patients were brought in unconscious, whereas two infants had CCS scores of 15 on arrival and&#xD;
      were neurologically intact .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with no neurologic deficit and full alertness, a conservative approach may be&#xD;
      chosen. Conservative treatment of acute epidural or subdural hematomas is rare. [20] This is&#xD;
      usually suggested in patients with a small EDH (less than 1 cm thick and less than 3 cm in&#xD;
      length in the anteroposterior plane on CT). If the patient is symptomatic, however (even&#xD;
      severe headache present without any focal neurologic deficit), and the EDH is larger than 1&#xD;
      cm thick, surgery is the treatment of choice. In infants, symptoms are not always clear&#xD;
      unless irritability or somnolence is observed. Objective signs rather than symptoms thus may&#xD;
      be more helpful. If conservative treatment is chosen for an infant on admission, very close&#xD;
      observation in an intensive care unit is mandatory. Also, in such cases, because of the lack&#xD;
      of language communication and underestimation of symptoms, repeat CT is advised within 12 to&#xD;
      24 hours, even if no neurologic deterioration appears. As described above, one of the&#xD;
      infants, a 7-month-old girl, was admitted with bilateral EDH. Conservative treatment was&#xD;
      undertaken, with close observation; however, there was no neurologic deterioration during the&#xD;
      subsequent 13 hours. On the next morning, repeat CT was performed, which clearly showed&#xD;
      enlargement of the EDH on the left. The infant was then taken to the operating room, and&#xD;
      bilateral craniotomy was performed. She was discharged within a few days in excellent&#xD;
      condition with no neurologic deficit. In this rare example, the hematoma grew on CT without&#xD;
      clinical deterioration, and surgery was indicated because the hematoma enlarged. Probably,&#xD;
      the child would have deteriorated at a certain point because of the enlarging hematoma, but&#xD;
      this was avoided by the routine repeat CT indicated in cases of attempted conservative&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Symptoms Transient loss of consciousness is not always clear in this age group, and&#xD;
      lack of symptoms and signs in a fully awake baby may be confusing. [3-6,12] In our series,&#xD;
      vomiting and loss of consciousness were very common. Also, most of the infants had&#xD;
      significant subgaleal hematomas. In fact, in some infants, these were the only positive&#xD;
      parameters for which CT was performed by the neurosurgeon, considering the young age of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CCS Score Looking at prognosis and CCS score on admission, one may be surprised. Of the five&#xD;
      infants who arrived unconscious, three left the hospital neurologically intact. As was&#xD;
      reported in previous series, a low CCS score in infants does not necessarily indicate a poor&#xD;
      prognosis or gross neurologic deficits on discharge. [12,13] On the other hand, early&#xD;
      diagnosis of EDH in infants admitted in good neurologic condition with a history of minor&#xD;
      head injury is difficult. Neither good condition nor minor trauma can rule out an&#xD;
      intracranial emergency. [13,17]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism of Injury In our series, most of the patients fell from less than 1 m, and even&#xD;
      when they arrived in good neurologic condition, surgical EDH was found on CT. When mechanism&#xD;
      of injury was a fall from more than 1 m, clinical presentation was much worse, with&#xD;
      lateralizing signs, loss of consciousness, and a high rate of posterior fossa hematomas. This&#xD;
      shows how vulnerable infants may be compared with older children even after minor head&#xD;
      injury. A relatively high rate of posterior fossa EDH was found in our series compared with&#xD;
      previous reports. [2-5,15]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lag Time An interesting observation was the lag time we found (up to 48 hours) in some&#xD;
      infants between the time of injury and admission to the ER. This was common with younger&#xD;
      infants when parents at first underestimated the apparently minor head injury (fall from less&#xD;
      than 1 m). These infants were eventually brought to the ER, however, because of some&#xD;
      deterioration or unusual behavior. Another lag time was observed between admission to the ER&#xD;
      and operation. This lag time was probably attributable to the good neurologic condition of&#xD;
      some infants on admission. Less than half of the infants were operated on immediately on&#xD;
      arrival or within 1 hour of presentation to the ER. This may suggest a rather subacute&#xD;
      presentation of EDH in infants compared with children and adults. It can be explained either&#xD;
      by better compliance of the infant cranium and brain, which delayed the appearance of severe&#xD;
      symptoms, or by underestimation of the injury by the parents and the doctor as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoring Method for Infants Several Children's Coma Scales have been suggested in the past&#xD;
      [1,7-11,21] to improve the neurologic evaluation of children compared with adults. When&#xD;
      applied to infants, however, these scoring methods may be disappointing. An anatomic&#xD;
      difference of skull size and flexibility, as well as the opened sutures and fontanels in&#xD;
      infants, make the dynamics of the intracranial compartment different from that of older&#xD;
      children. They may be more fragile but also more compliant. The pathophysiology of the&#xD;
      evolving intracranial bleeding, in our case the EDH, thus may be different in both the form&#xD;
      and the timing of clinical symptoms. [13,22-24]&#xD;
&#xD;
      One reason why application of CCS may be inaccurate and problematic for infants is that most&#xD;
      suggested Children's Coma Scales include parameters that are difficult to interpret and&#xD;
      score. Examples are infants' interaction with the examiner, restlessness or consolability,&#xD;
      and the difficult evaluation of sound and cry. The problem is greater than in older children&#xD;
      because infants' psychomotor development is variable (each infant has a different speed and&#xD;
      level) and verbal communication is incomplete-considerations that may influence the CCS&#xD;
      applied. We think that in this age group, therefore, objective parameters, which are clear&#xD;
      and evident to any examiner, should be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The New Trauma Infant Neurologic Score IN 1999 new approach and scoring system was proposed&#xD;
      and reported by Beni Adani et all (Ref 25), that is not necessarily a tailored or revised&#xD;
      Glasgow Coma Scale but that uses a different concept in evaluating infants. Unlike different&#xD;
      versions of the Glasgow Coma Scale, we include objective parameters such as the presence of&#xD;
      lateralizing signs, pupillary abnormalities, and scalp injuries, all of which are easy to&#xD;
      define. Being, in our opinion, more accurate in evaluating infants, this scale may help in&#xD;
      the early diagnosis of intracranial disorders in apparently neurologically intact infants and&#xD;
      may improve the estimation of prognosis in infants with apparently low CCS. We first&#xD;
      presented the Trauma Infant Neurologic Score (TINS) at the International Neurotrauma&#xD;
      Symposium in 1997 (Table ). In our opinion, TINS should include: (1) Mechanism of trauma (T);&#xD;
      (2) whether or not the infant is intubated (I), because intubation makes proper neurologic&#xD;
      assessment difficult; (3) three neurological (N) parameters (alertness vs. coma, lateralizing&#xD;
      signs, and pupillary abnormalities); and (4) scalp injuries (S). The TINS suggested is simple&#xD;
      to apply, short, and clear, scaling from 1 to 10 points. For each &quot;bad&quot; parameter, the infant&#xD;
      earns one point. Because TINS is applied for trauma cases, the minimal score is 1 point (for&#xD;
      minor trauma) (see Table 3). For severe mechanism of trauma (2 points), we include falls from&#xD;
      more than 1 m, penetrating injuries, motor vehicle crashes, and severe blow injuries to the&#xD;
      head. The maximal TINS, which is the worst possible, would be 10. Based on our preliminary&#xD;
      experience from unpublished data , we assume that TINS &lt; 4 is predictive of a good prognosis,&#xD;
      TINS of 4 to 7 indicates moderate disability, and TINS &gt; 8 would suggest poor prognosis. As&#xD;
      for guidelines for CT in an infant with trauma, TINS of 2 or more would be the indication, in&#xD;
      our opinion for CT. Of course, for patients at high risk (infants with hematologic or&#xD;
      oncologic diseases), CT is performed in all cases. We think that TINS is more than another&#xD;
      Glasgow Coma Scale score for children, because it emphasizes the unique aspect of clinical&#xD;
      presentation and vulnerability of infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usefulness and reliability of the suggested TINS is still to be determined in prospective&#xD;
      studies of infants with head trauma and intracranial injuries. Using a different concept in&#xD;
      building this score for infants, however, we hope to provide a better clinical and prognostic&#xD;
      tool for this particular population.&#xD;
