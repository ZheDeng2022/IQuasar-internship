    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective cross-sectional study of women who have completed&#xD;
      therapy for primary breast cancer within 5 years of diagnosis and are at increased risk for&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo screening bone marrow aspirate to test for presence of disseminated&#xD;
      tumor cells (DTCs) Patients who harbor DTCs will be offered the opportunity for enrollment&#xD;
      into a clinical trial of therapy targeting DTCs to prevent recurrence (separate protocols).&#xD;
