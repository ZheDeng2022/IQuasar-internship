      The improvement of the care pathway of oncology patients through Clinical Pharmacy activities&#xD;
      for outpatients (such as pharmaceutical consultation) should be implemented and evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve the care pathway of patients on anticancer oral therapies, the&#xD;
      investigators suggest in this research project to integrate into the medical care a &quot;Clinical&#xD;
      Pharmacy follow-up&quot; for the patient at the hospital in the form of &quot;pharmaceutical&#xD;
      consultations&quot;. These pharmaceutical consultations carried out in coordination with the&#xD;
      hospital clinical teams also aim to make the link between the hospital and community&#xD;
      pharmacists. These pharmaceutical consultations were initiated in Marseille and Grenoble&#xD;
      University Hospitals in order to know the special needs of patients under oral&#xD;
      chemotherapies. However, the impact of these pharmaceutical consultations in a population of&#xD;
      patients receiving ambulatory oral therapy remains unknown and needs to be evaluated using&#xD;
      objective criteria such as the rate of adverse events which the consequences are considerable&#xD;
      both for the patient and the society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observations prompted us to establish a randomized controlled study with the objective&#xD;
      of assessing the impact of the Clinical Pharmacy consultations in cancer patients treated&#xD;
      with oral anti-cancer therapies on the general care management: occurrence of serious adverse&#xD;
      events (primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This bicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, open-label, two-parallel group&#xD;
      study is performed to assess the efficacy of pharmaceutical consultations in the experimental&#xD;
      group (full clinical medication review) and pharmaceutical interviews in the control group&#xD;
      (Patient Therapeutic Education for oral anticancer drugs only). Depending on the result of&#xD;
      the randomization the patient will find himself in one of those 2 parallel arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: standard course + short pharmaceutical interviews (therapeutic education)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group: standard course + long pharmaceutical consultations (including full&#xD;
           clinical medication review and therapeutic education)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: therapeutic education through short pharmaceutical interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients allocated in the control group will have a &quot;classic&quot; course of treatment. They&#xD;
      will receive the best medical care and will be offered to participate in the therapeutic&#xD;
      education program in place in the participating centers including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An educational assessment consisting on evaluating the patient's educational needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group workshops entitled &quot;Disease and drugs&quot;, &quot;Dietary and sports activity&quot;, &quot;Psychology&#xD;
           Workshop&quot; during which the patient will be able to participate in order to get all the&#xD;
           information he needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual therapeutic education sessions to specifically and personally highlight&#xD;
           certain non-pharmaceutical educational needs identified at the time of the educational&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, in the control arm, a systematic &quot;short pharmaceutical interview&quot; with an average&#xD;
      duration of 15 minutes will be proposed to patients at the initiation of treatment, at D15&#xD;
      after the prescription (considered as the date of inclusion) at M1 and then every 3 months&#xD;
      (M3, M6, M9 and M12):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosage, including the maximum dosage for modular taken drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  User precautions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The necessary information to drug use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any special precautions to be taken and any information relevant to the good&#xD;
           understanding of the treatment by the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological analyzes necessary for the initiation, monitoring, and pursuit of certain&#xD;
           treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: Clinical Pharmacy through Long Pharmaceutical Consultations In this&#xD;
      experimental group, patients will receive the same course of treatment as the patients in the&#xD;
      control group, including the D0 short pharmaceutical interview, with the same prerogatives of&#xD;
      acceptance or rejection of participation in the TPE program. Short pharmaceutical interviews&#xD;
      from D15 to M12 will be replaced by long pharmaceutical consultations of 30 to 60 minutes.&#xD;
      The latter consisting in a full clinical medication review and incorporating the pedagogic&#xD;
      aspects addressed in the short pharmaceutical interviews but for all therapeutic drugs taken&#xD;
      by the patient. Additional consultations are possible on the request of the oncologist and/or&#xD;
      patient. The consultations carried out at the request of the oncologist and/or the patient&#xD;
      will be counted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the pharmaceutical consultation focuses on a complete clinical medication&#xD;
      review including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishment of the patient profile: medical history, drug allergies and intolerance,&#xD;
           comorbidities, age, understanding capacities, organizational capacityâ€¦&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishment of the list of current treatments (cancer treatment, treatment of&#xD;
           comorbidities, self-medication, other products). The effective use of drugs will be&#xD;
           discussed with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of health behaviors:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concerning self-medication (reasons, active ingredients, doses, etc.) and&#xD;
                alternative medicine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Addictions (smoking, alcohol...)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Drug adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  List and grade (NCI version 4) of clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The biological data will be obtained on the basis of biological test results&#xD;
                addressed to the oncologist and all other test results provided by the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical signs will be obtained from patient questioning The second part of the&#xD;
                consultation is to achieve firstly a pharmaco-therapeutic analysis of the treatment&#xD;
                (level 3 pharmaceutical analysis according to the criteria of the French Society of&#xD;
                Clinical Pharmacy) in order to detect problems with drugs as classified by the&#xD;
                French Society of Clinical Pharmacy (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third step of the consultation consists on providing &quot;pharmaceutical interventions&quot;&#xD;
      following the pharmaco-therapeutic analysis (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These pharmaceutical interventions might concern the prescribers, the other caregivers, or&#xD;
      the patient himself. These interventions will be done in the absolute respect for the French&#xD;
      Code of Public Health. All these interventions will be documented, tracked, and evaluated,&#xD;
      particularly in terms of acceptance by prescribers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Both centers have the necessary number of patients needed to ensure the proper&#xD;
      recruitment required for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The annual throughput of the AP-HM is about 300 patients. Targeted diseases as part of this&#xD;
      research project are gastrointestinal tumors (GIST, colorectal), neuroendocrine, renal,&#xD;
      gynecological, urological (prostate) and skin (melanoma) cancers. The annual throughput of&#xD;
      Grenoble University Hospital is more than 70 patients. Targeted diseases are renal tumors,&#xD;
      breast and colorectal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects to be included required is determined from the primary endpoint,&#xD;
      namely the rate of adverse events of grade III-IV. Data from the current practice in the main&#xD;
      center (AP- HM) and from the literature estimate this rate at 35%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of adverse events related to drugs being preventable, the investigators estimate&#xD;
      a decrease of 20 points in this rate in the experimental arm, that is to say a rate of 15%.&#xD;
      166 subjects (83 per group) are needed for a power of 90% and an alpha risk of 5%. To&#xD;
      compensate the potential lost of the out of sights (estimated around 15%), the investigators&#xD;
      will include 190 subjects in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was determined to obtain 90% power to detect a 20 percent difference in&#xD;
      between the 2 groups, as this difference is considered to be clinically significant. In&#xD;
      accordance with previous studies (26-31), the investigators hypothesized that the occurrence&#xD;
      of the primary endpoint will be at 35% in the control group. With the threshold for&#xD;
      statistical significance set at a p-value of 0.05 (two-sided alpha), these calculations&#xD;
      showed that 166 patients are needed (83 per group). Assuming that potentially 15% of patients&#xD;
      will be lost to follow-up, a total of 190 individuals need to be included.&#xD;
