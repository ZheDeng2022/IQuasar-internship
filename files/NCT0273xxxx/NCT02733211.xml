  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MD-Logic Automated Insulin Delivery System is intended for patients with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus for subcutaneous infusion of insulin and the continuous measurement of interstitial&#xD;
      glucose to aid in the management of their diabetes. The product automatically adjusts basal&#xD;
      insulin delivery and delivers correction boluses in response to real-time glucose&#xD;
      measurements by CGM to maintain blood glucose within the desired range, to improve metabolic&#xD;
      control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is an open-label, two-center, randomized, cross-over study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of night closed-loop control using the MD-Logic automated insulin&#xD;
      delivery system compared to sensor augmented pump therapy in poorly controlled patients with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes at home The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of 4 weeks glucose control using the MD-Logic System in individuals with poorly&#xD;
      controlled type 1 diabetes at patient's home&#xD;
