  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective of the study is to project the incidence rate of perioperative hypothermia&#xD;
      under general anesthesia in patients who go under minimum 1 hour long elective surgery in at&#xD;
      least 25 hospitals/medical centers in Turkey .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine the patient risk factors associated with perioperative&#xD;
      hypothermia, to determine the surgery risk factors associated with perioperative hypothermia,&#xD;
      to determine the other risk factors associated with perioperative hypothermia, intraoperative&#xD;
      infusion volume and effect of warming, intraoperative irrigation volume and effect of&#xD;
      warming, intraoperative blood infusion volume and effect of warming, to determine&#xD;
      complications related to perioperative hypothermia, to improve patient temperature management&#xD;
      awareness and processes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild hypothermia during perioperative period is very common, and the percentage accounts for&#xD;
      about half of all patients undergoing operations, which is directly related to the following&#xD;
      three major adverse events that significantly increase their risks: 1) cardiac complications,&#xD;
      2) hemorrhage, 3) infection complications , particularly in patients with high risk factors&#xD;
      (ASA grade III, IV). Furthermore, the decrease in body temperature may also lead to the&#xD;
      following situations: 1) prolongation in retention time in post-anesthetic ICU (PACU), 2)&#xD;
      decrease in the thermal comfort for patients, and thus affecting the satisfaction degree of&#xD;
      patients and increasing cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the viewpoint of patient safety, body surface temperature is only a vital sign.&#xD;
      Therefore, in order to prevent hypothermia during perioperative period, core temperature&#xD;
      monitoring must be carried out from the very beginning of the operation. The heat loss during&#xD;
      operations should be minimized. Active warming measurements should be taken for high risk&#xD;
      patients during the entire procedures of operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the literature have reported high incidence rate of hypothermia during perioperative&#xD;
      period of selective operations, there's no detailed information about perioperative&#xD;
      hypothermia prevalence in Turkey. Actually there are only a few studies about patient warming&#xD;
      effectiveness. A small scale study done by Kocaeli University in Turkey in 2013 shows the&#xD;
      post operative hypothermia incidence as 45.7%. Another study and survey done by Cerrahpasa&#xD;
      Medicine Faculty shows even among healthcare professionals there is great variance about the&#xD;
      perception and results of hypothermia. Those facts drives investigators to gather more&#xD;
      clinical evidence about perioperative hypothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the supervision of Turkish Anesthesiology and Reanimation Society and coordination of&#xD;
      Prof Dr Hulya Bilgin from Uludag University Medicine Faculty Anesthesiology and Reanimation&#xD;
      Clinic it is aimed to gather evidence about hypothermia prevalence patients who go under&#xD;
      minimum 1 hour elective surgery under general anesthesia. So with the results of such a study&#xD;
      it is aimed to improve the standard protocols regarding patient temperature management,&#xD;
      patient warming management and also to avoid the complications and costs related to&#xD;
      hypothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to further obtain information on the current status of temperature monitoring and&#xD;
      perioperative warming practice in most parts of the country, to project incidence rate of&#xD;
      perioperative hypothermia in most parts of the country, explore the relationship between&#xD;
      perioperative hypothermia and postoperative clinical outcome, and to provide evidence for the&#xD;
      improvement of perioperative body temperature management guidelines in accordance with&#xD;
      characteristics of the current Turkish healthcare status, investigators will conduct surveys&#xD;
      in department of anesthesiology over certain regions of Turkey to carry out a large scale&#xD;
      prospective study. In the study, investigators will search the incidence rate of&#xD;
      perioperative hypothermia in the surveyed areas, explore the causes of hypothermia, base on&#xD;
      which it is expected to enable to project perioperative hypothermia incidence rate, to verify&#xD;
      the effectiveness of perioperative hypothermia risk assessment questionnaire for patients&#xD;
      under general anesthesia, and to provide guidance and evidence for the clinical practice of&#xD;
      perioperative warming care.&#xD;
