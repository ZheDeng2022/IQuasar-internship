    <textblock>
      This will be an open label study in two parts. In the first part, F901318 (dose 2 mg/kg IV&#xD;
      over 4 hours, Day 1) will be followed by F901318 (2 mg/kg IV over 4 hours) given on Day 8,&#xD;
      after dosing with fluconazole 800 mg daily for 1 day (Day 4) and 400 mg daily orally for 4&#xD;
      days (Days 5 to 8). Up to twenty subjects will be included in two cohorts which will undergo&#xD;
      the same dosing schedules of fluconazole and F901318 and undergo the same procedures. The&#xD;
      first cohort will consist of 12 subjects studied in two groups of six subjects each. If there&#xD;
      is clearly a difference in F901318 kinetics detectable before and after dosing with&#xD;
      fluconazole in this first cohort, the second cohort will not be studied. If there is no clear&#xD;
      difference, the second cohort will also be studied to give a final result. In this cohort,&#xD;
      based on the pharmacokinetic findings in cohort 1, the dose of F901318 may be increased to up&#xD;
      to 4 mg/kg to establish a dose suitable for phase 2 evaluation. PK sampling for plasma&#xD;
      F901318 will continue from before the first dose up to and including 72 hours after dosing.&#xD;
      PK sampling for fluconazole will continue from before the first dose and up to 72 hours after&#xD;
      the fifth dose. A follow up visit will be conducted 7 +/- 2 days after discharge from the&#xD;
      clinical unit following completion of blood sampling following the second dose of F901318 and&#xD;
      the fifth dose of fluconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study will take place if no appreciable change in the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of either F901318 or fluconazole has been observed in either the first or the second cohorts&#xD;
      in the first part of the study. This second part will enrol 12 subjects. These subjects will&#xD;
      receive fluconazole 800 mg daily for one day (Day 1) and 400 mg daily orally for 4 days (Days&#xD;
      2 to 5) in combination with F901318 which will be given in a dose of up to 4 mg/kg IV bid for&#xD;
      one day (Day 1) followed by 7 doses of intravenous F901318 up to 2.5 mg/kg bid (Days 2 to 5).&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic profiles of F901318 and fluconazole will be obtained during dosing and over a&#xD;
      72-hour period following the final dose of both compounds.&#xD;
