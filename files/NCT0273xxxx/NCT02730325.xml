      The effects of serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) will be evaluated&#xD;
      and compared to matching placebo in two distinct patient populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Hospitalized ulcerative colitis (UC) patients who tested positive for Clostridium&#xD;

      The effects of serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) will be evaluated&#xD;
      and compared to matching placebo in two distinct patient populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Hospitalized ulcerative colitis (UC) patients who tested positive for Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile (C. difficile) at time of admission and are receiving vancomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the effect of SBI on time (# of days) to resolution of diarrhea, defined as a&#xD;
      consecutive 24 hour period with only formed bowel movements (Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) ≤ 4)&#xD;
      in this patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ability of SBI to decrease the incidence of recurrent C. difficile&#xD;
           infection (CDI) following successful treatment with vancomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on UC status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on nutritional status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SBI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on subjects' quality of life (QOL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of SBI in fecal microbiome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the length of hospitalization (time of hospitalization to time of discharge)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Hospitalized UC patients who tested negative for C. difficile at time of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the effect of SBI on time (# of days) to resolution of diarrhea, defined as a&#xD;
      consecutive 24 hour period with only formed bowel movements (Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) ≤ 4)&#xD;
      in this patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI in decreasing the incidence of CDI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on UC status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on nutritional status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SBI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on subjects' QOL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of SBI in fecal microbiome&#xD;
