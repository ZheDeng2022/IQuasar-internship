      It has been shown previously that gene expression profiling signature (a set of dysregulated&#xD;
      genes) can be used for molecular classification, diagnosis, and prognosis of several types of&#xD;
      cancers. In This study the hypothesise that resistant tumor may be due to genetic mutations&#xD;
      and/or other alternative pathways that could be the reason to overcome the Sorafenib and&#xD;
      still proliferate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives To evaluate the primary and secondary potential mechanisms by which HCC&#xD;
      patients on Sorafenib treatment would be resistant to therapy and also identify the favorable&#xD;
      genetic makeup of patients responding to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cDNA microarray analysis on the MAP kinase pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mRNA quantification of genetic expression (RT-PCR) for identification of upregulated&#xD;
           genes, and confirmed by corresponding proteomic testing (by Mass Spectroscopy) in the&#xD;
           serum for potential serum markers. Secondary Objectives Progression free survival: Time&#xD;
           to disease progression in patients in Saudi Arabia with HCC receiving Sorafenib:&#xD;
           [defined as time, in weeks, from the baseline visit to progression of the disease or&#xD;
           death from any cause] will be diagnosed using the RECIST criteria based on a trimestrial&#xD;
           abdominal CT evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival rates and Predictors of survival:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Survival defined as the time from baseline visit to death from any cause [in&#xD;
                weeks].&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Variables identified in multivariate regression analysis from overall treated&#xD;
                patients independently associated with survival till study completion or death.&#xD;
                Justification and Value to the Kingdom Sorafenib in the treatment of advanced HCC&#xD;
                is a recent development. Since the only current effective treatment for advanced&#xD;
                HCC is resection or transplantation and the list for these procedures are&#xD;
                ever-growing due to the confounding effect of the lack of infrastructure in the&#xD;
                Kingdom, selecting treatment for patients who are more likely to respond to&#xD;
                Sorafenib treatment The Long-Term Comprehensive National Plan for Science,&#xD;
                Technology and Innovation will help to reduce costs of managing HCC. Among Saudi&#xD;
                Arabia population, there are a unique set of patients here (e.g. non-alcohol&#xD;
                related HCC, genotype 4 HCV patients and genotype D HBV patients, high percentage&#xD;
                of obese patients i.e. NASH) which is different from other parts of the world.&#xD;
                There is increasing incidence of HCC in Saudi Arabia. Due to available expertise in&#xD;
                management of HCC patients in the participating institutions in the study, this&#xD;
                project will represent a bridge for the transfer of technology so that our research&#xD;
                staff and doctors will have more expertise in carrying out these techniques&#xD;
                independently. This study will also run in parallel to the on-going initiative to&#xD;
                start a HCC biobanking establishment which will provide the samples needed to carry&#xD;
                out our genetic studies in future. Finally, since the use of Sorafenib (at present,&#xD;
                the only approved treatment for advanced HCC) in the treatment of advanced HCC is a&#xD;
                new field, the findings of our study will have important implications in the&#xD;
                management of HCC, both locally and internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCC is the third most common cancer in Saudi Arabia. In 2001, HCC was the second most common&#xD;
      cancer affecting Saudi males and the eighth most common cancer affecting females. Most of&#xD;
      patients (90%) present at a more advanced stage when symptoms prevail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high prevalence of HCC in the Kingdom, it is pertinent to study why some patients&#xD;
      are resistant to Sorafenib compared to others. Elucidation of the differences in mechanisms&#xD;
      among responders and non-responders to Sorafenib therapy will enable physicians to make&#xD;
      better decisions in terms of treating Saudi HCC patients.&#xD;

      Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem, accounting for more&#xD;
      than 626,000 new cases per year worldwide. It is the third highest cause of cancer-related&#xD;
      death globally. In the west, the disease is diagnosed in 30 to 40% of all patients at early&#xD;
      stages and is amenable to potentially curative treatments, such as surgical therapies&#xD;
      (resection and liver transplantation) and locoregional procedures (radio-frequency ablation).&#xD;
      There are no clear epidemiological studies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that gives the real&#xD;
      incidence of HCC in Saudi population, however the Saudi Cancer registration have labelled it&#xD;
      as among the top five cancers in the country. Sorafenib has emerged as the treatment of&#xD;
      choice in the treatment of advanced HCC and has demonstrated an anti-angiogenic and&#xD;
      anti-proliferative effect. It is a kinase inhibitor that decreases tumor cell proliferation&#xD;
      in Vitro. Sorafenib has been shown to inhibit multiple intracellular (CRAF, BRAF, and mutant&#xD;
      BRAF) and cell surface kinases (KIT, FLT-3, RET, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3 and PDGFR-B).&#xD;
      Several of these kinases are thought to be involved in tumor cell signaling, angiogenesis and&#xD;
      apoptosis. In a phase 3 international, multi-center, randomised, doubleblind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial in patients with unresectable hepatocellualr carcinoma Sorafenib&#xD;
      showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo for overall survival (HR: 0.69,&#xD;
      p=0.00058). Final analysis of time to tumor progression also was significantly longer in the&#xD;

      The Long-Term Comprehensive National Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation Sorafenib&#xD;
      arm. This benefit was calculated in months because of the quick emergence of resistance in&#xD;
      many patients. Therefore, individualizing the treatment to patients with most expected&#xD;
      response and avoiding it in patients with resistant cancers has stimulated this research to&#xD;
      evaluate why some patients develop resistance to this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature review Epidemiology Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cause&#xD;
      of cancer worldwide with an annual incidence of over 711,000 new cases, and the third most&#xD;
      common cause of cancer death with an annual mortality of 679,000 patients. Most commonly HCC&#xD;
      develops in cirrhosis, irrespective of the etiology. In the western world, chronic alcohol&#xD;
      abuse and nonalcoholic stratohepatitis are about the as important etiologic factors for&#xD;
      cirrhosis as chronic hepatitis c. In chronic hepatitis C it is estimated that about 20% of&#xD;
      patients will eventually develop cirrhosis after 20-30 years of infection. Once cirrhosis is&#xD;
      established, the annual risk of developing HCC is estimated to be between 3 and 4 %, largely&#xD;
      irrespective of the etiology of cirrhosis. Diagnosis of HCC HCC is mostly asymptomatic in&#xD;
      early stage disease. Without proper surveillance programs of cirrhotic patients, diagnosis is&#xD;
      only established in advanced stage disease. The efficacy of surveillance by Ultrasound (and&#xD;
      to a lesser extent by alpha-fetoprotein measurement) has been established in prospective&#xD;
      trials in the west as well in the east. surveillance by experienced sonographers makes&#xD;
      curative treatment possible treatment possible in up to 75% of patients,while there is no&#xD;
      curative treatment without proper surveillance. Surveillance is recommended for the following&#xD;
      groups of patients: Hepatitis B carriers Asian males &gt; 40 years, Asian females &gt;50 years, All&#xD;
      cirrhotic hepatitis B carriers, Family history of HCC, Africans over age 20. For&#xD;
      non-cirrhotic hepatitis B carriers not listed above the risk of HCC varies depending on the&#xD;
      severity of the underlying liver disease, the Long-Term Comprehensive National Plan for&#xD;
      Science, Technology and Innovation inflammatory activity. Patients with high HBV DNA&#xD;
      concentrations and those with ongoing hepatic inflammatory activity remain at risk for HCC.&#xD;
      Non-hepatitis B cirrhosis Hepatitis C, Alcoholic cirrhosis, Genetic hemochromatosis, Primary&#xD;
      biliary cirrhosis. Although the following groups have an increased risk of HCC no&#xD;
      recommendations for or against surveillance can be made because a lack of data precludes an&#xD;
      assessment of whether surveillance would be beneficial - Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency&#xD;
      ,Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, Autoimmune hepatitis. Once a lesion is detected by&#xD;
      ultrasound, the diagnosis can be established radiologically in lesions with typical&#xD;
      appearance above 1 cm in diameter. Biopsy is mandated only in cases with atypical&#xD;
      presentation on imaging. Staging of HCC Staging of HCC can be done using several systems.&#xD;
      currently, the most widely used staging system is the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)&#xD;
      staging system , which takes the underlying liver disease, tumor characteristics, as well as&#xD;
      the general performance status into account . This staging system is popular as it is&#xD;
      directly linked to treatment, making treatment decisions easy. Advanced stage HCC: the&#xD;
      current role of medical therapies In western countries, about 30 % of patients are identified&#xD;
      with an HCC in BCLC stage 0 or A, either through surveillance or by chance. For those&#xD;
      patients curative options can be applied, which currently involve only surgical or&#xD;
      interventional treatments. However , curatively treated patients , except for those who&#xD;
      underwent transplantation, will have a tumor recurrence in 70 to 80 % of cases within 5 years&#xD;
      of therapy and will eventually progress to BCLC B or BCLC C stage disease. Another 20 % of&#xD;
      patients are diagnosed at very advanced stages BCLC D, being either symptomatic from the&#xD;
      decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C) or having an advanced tumor. Those patients have a&#xD;
      very short survival, which cannot be influenced by any therapeutic intervention and are only&#xD;
      eligible to receive best supportive care. Currently, the domain of medical therapies for HCC&#xD;
      is in the setting of advanced stage BCLC C. Conventional chemotherapy of any kind has never&#xD;
      shown any meaningful therapeutic benefit, particularly in overall survival in randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials in adult patients and cannot be recommended for the treatment of HCC today.&#xD;
      Conventional cisplatin-based chemotherapy, Technology and Innovation without doxorubicine&#xD;
      only has a place in the treatment of childhood hepatoblastoma, which is a distinctly&#xD;
      different disease entity. In hepatoblastoma cisplatin-based chemotherapy does improve&#xD;
      survival and can even provide a cure in over 80% of patients when combined with resection.&#xD;
      Medical treatment of HCC changed dramatically in 2007 , when the first data from the&#xD;
      successful use of targeted agents in advanced stage HCC, in particular tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors, were presented. Up-regulated signaling through the mitogen-activated protein&#xD;
      kinase (MAPK) intracellular signal transduction pathway plays a crucial role in the&#xD;
      development of hepatocellular carcinoma , as does tumor angiogenesis .The MAPK pathway&#xD;
      comprises Raf ,MAPK kinase (MEK ) and extracellular signal-regulated Kinase (ERK), and is a&#xD;
      mediator of tumor proliferation, differentiation and survival. The identification of pivotal&#xD;
      pathways, such as the MAPK cascade, led to the development of targeted treatments, such as&#xD;
      Sorafenib. Sorafenib is an orally active multikinase inhibitor that inhibits cell surface&#xD;
      tyrosine kinases, as well as downstream intracellular Raf kinases in the MAPK cascade.&#xD;
      Sorafenib is widely available for the use in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      and has been reviewed in this indication previously. Recently, Sorafenib was also approved in&#xD;
      the US and the EU for use in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, the first systemic&#xD;
      drug to be approved in this indication. Indeed, current US treatment guidelines recommend&#xD;
      Sorafenib as the first-lone treatment option in patients with unresectable HCC who are&#xD;
      Child-Pugh class A. Receptor tyrosine Kinases inhibited by Sorafenib include vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, Platelet-derived growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (PDGFR)-B, cKIT, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3) and RET. Intracellular&#xD;
      Raf serine/threonine kinase isoforms inhibited by Sorafenib include Raf-1(or C-Raf), wild&#xD;
      -type B-Raf and Mutant B-Raf. These kinases are involved in tumor cell proliferation and&#xD;
      tumor angiogenesis. In vitro, dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation was seen with&#xD;
      Sorafenib in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2. Moreover,&#xD;
      dose dependent induction of apoptosis was seen after Sorafenib exposure, as assessed by TUNEL&#xD;
      (terminal deoxynucleotide transferase d-uridine triphosphate nick end labeling) staining.&#xD;
      Inhibition by Sorafenib of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in PCL/PRF/5 and HepG2 cells was&#xD;
      shown by, among other things, the inhibition of MEK and ERK phosphorylation. Sorafenib&#xD;
      demonstrated Protocol number: 1.0 dated 01Aug2013 Short title: HCC - Sorafenib study&#xD;
      Confidential Page 14 The Long-Term Comprehensive National Plan for Science, Technology and&#xD;
      Innovation dose-dependent antitumor activity in murine xenograft model of PCL/PRF/5 human&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Significant tumor growth inhibition of 49% and 78% was seen in mice&#xD;
      receiving oral Sorafenib 10 or 30 mg/kg/day for 16 or 21 days ( both P 16 weeks and 48&#xD;
      (35.0%) had progressive disease (the remaining 32 patients [23.4%] were not available for&#xD;
      independent review). With Sorafenib, the median time to progression was 4.2 months&#xD;
      (investigator assessment) or 5.5 months (independent assessment), and the median overall&#xD;
      survival duration was 9.2 months. Phase III trial The clinical efficacy of oral Sorafenib was&#xD;
      examined in patients with advanced HCC in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      multi center, phase III trial (the SHARP study) (22). Inclusion criteria were histologically&#xD;
      proven, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, with at least one measurable untreated lesion, an&#xD;
      ECOG performance status of 0-2, Child-Pugh class A and no prior systemic treatment . 902&#xD;
      patients were screened and 602 were randomized to receive oral Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily&#xD;
      (n=299) or placebo (n=303). The median duration of treatment was 23 weeks in Sorafenib&#xD;
      recipients and 19 weeks in placebo recipients. Prior to randomization, patients were&#xD;
      stratified according to macroscopic vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread, ECOG&#xD;
      performance status and Geographical region. In terms of baseline characteristics, mean&#xD;
      patient age was 65.5 years; 87% of patients were male; 87.5% of patients were from Europe;&#xD;
      96.5% of patients were Child-Pugh class A; 54%, 38.5% and 7.5% of patients had an ECOG&#xD;
      performance status of 0, 1, 2 at baseline; 17.5% and 82.5% of patients had Barcelona Clinic&#xD;
      Liver Cancer Group stage B and C cancer; and 70% of patients had vascular invasion and/or&#xD;
      extrahepatic spread . The primary endpoints were overall survival and time to symptomatic&#xD;
      progression (defined as the time from randomization to a 4-point decline from baseline in&#xD;
      patient response to the Functional Assessment Of Cancer Treatment Hepatobiliary Symptom index&#xD;
      [FHSI-8] confirmed at next visit , deterioration to ECOG performance status 4, or death). The&#xD;
      time to progression (assessed by independent central review) was a pre-specified secondary&#xD;
      endpoint. Tumor response rates were assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST). Analyses were conducted in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (22).&#xD;
      Sorafenib significantly improved survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      in the SHARP trial (22). The median duration of survival was 10.7 months with Sorafenib and&#xD;
      7.9 months with placebo, yielding a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69 (95% CI 0.55, 0.88; P =&#xD;
      0.00058). Following the second planned interim analysis, the SHARP study was terminated early&#xD;
      on the basis of this survival result. At the time of study termination, there was no&#xD;
      significant difference between Sorafenib and placebo recipients in the time to symptomatic&#xD;
      progression (assessed using FHSI-8 criteria). The median time to progression (assessed by&#xD;
      independent central review) was significantly longer in patients receiving Sorafenib than&#xD;
      those receiving placebo (5.5 vs. 2.8 months), with an HR of 0.58(95% CI 0.44, 0.74; P Overall&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study procedures All laboratory tests will be conducted as normal with additional specific&#xD;
      tests to be performed in Liver Disease Research Center (LDRC), or the Proteomics Lab,&#xD;
      KSU-Riyadh. Blood will be collected in three 7ml tubes with each biopsy. cDNA microarray&#xD;
      analysis will be done on the pathways acted on by Sorafenib, namely the MAP kinase pathway.&#xD;
      The analysis will be done at LDRC, KSU-Riyadh. • Tissue samples will be obtained in all&#xD;
      patients from the tumor under imaging guidance • Tumor tissue biopsies will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline and at end-of-study/when study endpoint is met o A minimum of 3 cm of tumor tissue&#xD;
      will be obtained (2-3 needle passes). o Transportation of samples to the LDRC will be done on&#xD;
      dry ice. o Tissue obtained will be snap frozen at -800C until processing. o Tissue will be&#xD;
      tested for genes involved in the RAF pathway. o Genetic expression from the fresh tumor&#xD;
      tissue will be quantified using RT-PCR for mRNA quantification. Once upregulated genes are&#xD;
      identified, their corresponding proteomic expression will be tested in the serum for&#xD;
      potential serum markers. Proteomic testing will be performed using Mass Spectroscopy.&#xD;
      Additional specific blood tests will be performed in LDRC. Blood will be collected in two 7&#xD;
      ml EDTA tubes (purple top) and one plain tube (red top). Blood samples will be collected at&#xD;
      the same time with the liver biopsy. Blood once collected will be transported immediately to&#xD;
      LDRC on dry ice and stored at -80oC. Samples will be thawed and data analysed when the&#xD;
      individual patient has met study end-point or at study completion, as relevant. Liver biopsy&#xD;
      samples will also be transported on dry ice to LDRC and snap-frozen at -80oC for subsequent&#xD;
      analysis. Blood and tissue will be collected and transported by pre-arrangement with LDRC&#xD;
      staff, and will be coordinated by the SOLID registrar (Nouf Alanezi) and/or the study CRC in&#xD;
      KAMC-Riyadh. All patient-related data, including demographic, clinical, laboratory, and&#xD;
      radiological data will be collected in the comprehensive HCC eCRF of the SOLID registry where&#xD;
      appropriate. As a feature of the registry, all patient-related data is encoded in order to&#xD;
      remove any patient identifiers. All blood samples stored for end-of-study investigations will&#xD;
      be barcoded and the stickers tagged to the SOLID registry identifiers for easy retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects The study is expected to run for about 3 years and patients will be followed&#xD;
      for a period of 24 months. All consecutive patients presenting with HCC satisfying study&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be approached for participation. At an average, about&#xD;
      200 patients with HCC are evaluated annually in the multi study centres. We anticipate that&#xD;
      60 patients would be eligible for the study of whom 40 would be recruited for the study. A&#xD;
      total of 40 patients will be recruited from 2 - 3 centers in KSA (KSU, LDRC; KAMC-Riyadh). Of&#xD;
      these 15 patients will be recruited from King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh. Recruitment is&#xD;
      planned to be completed in the first year of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment and removal of subjects Patients will be followed for a period of 24&#xD;
      months. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until&#xD;
      resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. Patients are to continue therapy with&#xD;
      Sorafenib until • Disease progression • Until a criterion is met for stopping therapy like o&#xD;
      Concurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment o Unacceptable adverse&#xD;
      events(s) o Patient decides to withdraw from the study o General or specific changes in the&#xD;
      patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of&#xD;
      the investigator. In the event of radiologic progression, patients may continue to receive&#xD;
      the study drug. Decisions about continuing study medication will be made at the discretion of&#xD;
      the investigator, based on the investigator's judgment about the patient's clinical status.&#xD;
      In general, it is suggested that patients remain on Sorafenib if, in the opinion of the&#xD;
      investigator, the patient may be benefiting from continuing on study drug Removal of subjects&#xD;
      and the reason of the removal will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment description No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than&#xD;
      Sorafenib may be administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy. Sorafenib&#xD;
      will be given at the dose of 2 tablets of 200mg (400 mg) to be taken twice a day in the&#xD;
      morning and in the evening without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). If&#xD;
      a dose reduction is necessary, the Sorafenib dose may be reduced to 200 mg twice a day. If&#xD;
      additional dose reduction is required, the dose may be reduced to a single 400 mg dose every&#xD;
      other day. Reported adverse events, potential risks, and appropriate dose modifications for&#xD;
      are described below. Informed Consent: If a patient is found to meet the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      and expresses an interest in participation, Other treatment options will also be discussed&#xD;
      with the patient prior to completing informed consent. No study related procedures will be&#xD;
      conducted prior to the patient signing the informed consent. The subject will be provided&#xD;
      with a copy of the Patient Information Sheet and will be given the opportunity to ask any&#xD;
      question or seek clarification.&#xD;
