      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a pathologic process that contributes to, but is not&#xD;
      the sole cause of, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in aging men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to intervene is frequently used as an end point after failure of different&#xD;
      medical therapies. These medications are able to delay this point. Failed medical treatment&#xD;
      either due to refractory LUTS or in patients who are not willing to make a lifetime&#xD;
      commitment to medical therapy represents one indication to intervene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine retention secondary to BPH with failed voiding trial without catheter is an indication&#xD;
      for intervention in healthy individuals as well as recurrent hematuria, secondary vesical&#xD;
      stones and recurrent urinary tract infection. Renal deterioration secondary to BPH is an&#xD;
      indication of intervention after proper evaluation of the bladder function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For years, surgical treatment for BPH was transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for&#xD;
      small to moderate sized prostate and open prostatectomy (OP) for markedly enlarged one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser prostatectomy was introduced as a less invasive modality for treatment of BPH&#xD;
      overcoming the disadvantages and limitations of the traditional standard TURP and OP. It&#xD;
      seems to be advantageous as it is less invasive than OP. Furthermore, using physiological&#xD;
      saline as an irrigant, with higher safety profile in morbid patients who have to be on&#xD;
      anticoagulants or antiplatelet during surgery. It is used to tackle larger prostate glands&#xD;
      beyond the limits of TURP. It is not infrequent to be done as day surgery with shortened&#xD;
      catheterization time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eventually it seems to be cost effective, however the remaining concern as in all minimally&#xD;
      invasive surgeries (MIS) is the durability and reoperation rates. Despite the significant&#xD;
      advantages known with laser prostatectomy techniques particularly HoLEP, adoption of these&#xD;
      procedures in urologic community is limited and one of the causes is the high initial cost&#xD;
      investment for laser capital equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HoLEP entails dissection of the whole median and lateral prostatic lobes off the surgical&#xD;
      capsule via a retrograde approach starting at the apex. The enucleated lobes were pushed to&#xD;
      the bladder followed by hemostasis of the prostate bed then intravesical morcellation of the&#xD;
      enucleated adenoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 15 years, different technical modifications have come out to the procedure.&#xD;
      However all the current reports use 100 watt laser power (High power HoLEP: HP-HoLEP) for the&#xD;
      laser assisted enucleation technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Khan et al 2015, reported on the feasibility of using low power (LP-HoLEP) for safe and&#xD;
      effective HoLEP. The authors cut significantly on the initial cost of laser capital&#xD;
      equipment. They used 50-watt holmium laser machine to accomplish the enucleation procedure&#xD;
      with reasonable efficacy. Nevertheless, there are no randomized studies assessing safety,&#xD;
      efficacy and cost saving associated with LP-HoLEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Work&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare safety and efficacy of LP-HoLEP vs HP-HoLEP in treatment of&#xD;
      infra-vesical obstruction secondary to BPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BPH surgical candidates presented to the outpatient clinic of the prostate unit in the&#xD;
      urology department (Urology &amp; nephrology center, Mansoura University) will be assessed to&#xD;
      evaluate if these patients are eligible to the study inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BPH surgical candidates are patients presented with LUTS secondary to BOO (bladder outlet&#xD;
      obstruction) due to BPH who failed medical treatment, IPSS (international prostate symptom&#xD;
      score) score &gt;15, peak urinary flow rate (Qmax) &lt;15 ml/sec, recurrent attacks of urine&#xD;
      retention with failed trial voiding, patients with hematuria of prostatic origin with failed&#xD;
      medical treatment and patients with vesical stone secondary to BPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative work up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be thoroughly evaluated by medical history and physical exam, digital&#xD;
      rectal exam (DRE), prostate specific antigen (PSA), urinalysis and urine culture,&#xD;
      international index of prostate symptom score (IPSS), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)&#xD;
      measurement of prostatic volume and biopsy whenever indicated, measurement of post-void&#xD;
      residual assessment (PVR), and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). Patients with positive urine&#xD;
      culture will be treated accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to the study groups on the day of the surgery after&#xD;
      signing the informed consent for participation in the study. The randomization process will&#xD;
      be performed using computer-generated random tables in a 1:1 ratio. A stratified-blocked&#xD;
      randomization across two strata derived from predetermined size grouping (40-80 ml and more&#xD;
      than 80 ml) and two strata derived from preoperative indication (catheterized and&#xD;
      non-catheterized) were done. This method ensures parity among the two treatment groups. In&#xD;
      each stratum, given two possible block lengths of four and eight respectively, with a random&#xD;
      number generator giving numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, the investigators&#xD;
      selected a block length of four for random numbers lower than 0.5 or a block length of eight&#xD;
      otherwise. Variation of the block sizes prevented the surgeon from guessing what the next&#xD;
      treatment will be; it makes it difficult (although not impossible) to break the treatment&#xD;
      code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (50 patients): Patients will be managed with HP-HoLEP. Group 2 (50 patients):&#xD;
      Patients will be managed with LP-HoLEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of coexisting urinary bladder stone, Holmium laser cystolithotripsy will be done&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HP-HoLEP: (Energy=2 Joule, Rate=50 Hertz) for adenoma enucleation &amp; reduced to&#xD;
           (Energy=1.5, Rate=30) for apical dissection &amp; hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LP-HoLEP: (Energy=2 Joule, Rate=25) throughout the whole procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HoLEP can be divided into four phases: inspection, enucleation, hemostasis and morcellation.&#xD;
      Briefly, a plane was created between the adenoma and the surgical capsule early after the&#xD;
      first incision of the gland from the bladder neck to the level of the verumontanum. The gland&#xD;
      was enucleated in two or three lobes depending on the anatomy and the prominence of the&#xD;
      grooves on either side of the middle lobe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Two-lobe technique starts with a 5- or 7-O'clock incision in a groove between the median&#xD;
      lobe and one lateral lobe (the deeper groove) with enucleation of one lateral lobe, followed&#xD;
      by the median and the remaining lateral lobe as a single unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three-lobe technique involves a 5- and 7- O'clock incisions with enucleation of the&#xD;
      median lobe and subsequent enucleation of one lateral lobe followed by the other lateral&#xD;
      lobe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If bleeding is encountered, the laser fiber can be defocused slightly from the bleeding point&#xD;
      to achieve hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furosemide (20 mg/hour, intravenously) is administered after one hour of surgery, to correct&#xD;
      for any fluid absorption and to enhance urine flow. After hemostasis, the morcellator is&#xD;
      introduced and the prostatic lobes are morcellated and removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen in follow-up at 2-4 weeks, 4 months, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validated questionnaires will be utilized to assess the patients' sexual function both at&#xD;
      base line and at different follow-up visits. Different aspects of the sexual function will be&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who may have no symptomatic improvement after the procedure or who may have&#xD;
      subsequent deterioration, cystoscopy will be performed to rule out the development of a&#xD;
      urethral stricture or bladder neck contracture. Treatment will be planned accordingly for the&#xD;
      present finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of this clinical trial will be operative outcome measures including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative time; which is the time from insertion of the resectoscope till the time of&#xD;
      catheterization, operative efficacy; which is the number or grams of the resected prostate&#xD;
      tissue weight divided by operative time, enucleation efficacy (study endpoint); which is the&#xD;
      number of grams of the resected prostate tissue divided by enucleation time, laser / prostate&#xD;
      ratio; which is the amount of the joules of laser energy spent to remove one gram of the&#xD;
      prostate tissue and the peri-procedure blood changes: Hg deficit, Hct deficit, Na changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These parameters include; time to catheter removal, duration of hospital stay and&#xD;
      complications (intraoperative, early postoperative during first 30 days after the procedure,&#xD;
      late postoperative).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, urinary outcome measures (IPSS; international prostate symptoms score, QOL;&#xD;
      quality of life, Q-max; peak flow rate, PVR; post voiding residual) and sexual outcome&#xD;
      measures (Changes in the IIEF-15; international index of erectile function-15) will be&#xD;
      depicted and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cumulative health resources related cost analysis of both procedures from a local&#xD;
      institutional perspective (actual cost). Costs linked to the medical staff will not be&#xD;
      included because they were assumed to be identical between the 2 groups, similarly routine&#xD;
      clinic visits will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' flow diagram (CONSORT CHART):&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each group, the numbers of participants who will be randomly assigned, receive intended&#xD;
      treatment, and will be analyzed for the primary outcome. Losses and exclusions will be&#xD;
      described in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will test the non-inferiority of LP-HoLEP to HP-HoLEP in&#xD;
      accomplishing the transurethral enucleation procedure with comparable enucleation efficacy&#xD;
      pertaining the advantages of lower cost and potential minimal postoperative dysuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1 statistical error less than 5% and type 2 statistical error less than 20% were&#xD;
      considered. Furthermore, based on previous report, enucleation efficacy using LP-HoLEP was&#xD;
      reported as 0.68 + 0.4, 95%CI 0.61-0.75 gm/min (7) with an acceptable non-inferiority margin&#xD;
      of 0.2gm/min was considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the previous factors, a sample size of 100 patients (50 in each group) was&#xD;
      estimated&#xD;
