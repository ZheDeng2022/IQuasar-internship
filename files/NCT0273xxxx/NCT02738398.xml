        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients, at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with NSCLC diagnosis who have been referred for a clinical FDG PET/CT staging&#xD;
             scan as part of their standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide&#xD;
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior&#xD;
             to study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to tolerate additional imaging time in the opinion of the investigator or&#xD;
             treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only individuals (aged 18 or over) who can understand and give informed consent will&#xD;
             be eligible to participate in this study. Individuals who are considered to be&#xD;
             mentally disabled will not be recruited for this study. All subjects must be able to&#xD;
             give informed consent. We will not be using specific methods to assess decisional&#xD;
             capacity. Economically disadvantaged persons will not be vulnerable to undue&#xD;
             influence, as this study offers no compensation and there is no additional cost&#xD;
             associated with the additional study imaging time. All individuals will be told that&#xD;
             their choice regarding study participation will in no way change their access to&#xD;
             clinical care or their ability to undergo the standard clinical FDG PET/CT scan. This&#xD;
             should negate any undue influence or coercion. Children, fetuses, neonates, or&#xD;
             prisoners are not included in this research study&#xD;
