      A Phase III Double Blinded, Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate Efficacy of Protection&#xD;
      Against HPV-16 and 18 Related Diseases, Immunogenicity and Safety of Recombinant Human&#xD;
      Papillomavirus Virus-like Particle Vaccine (Type 16 and 18 L1 Proteins, Yeast) in Healthy&#xD;
      Females Aged 18-30 Years.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled study. The study&#xD;
      vaccine is recombinant human papillomavirus bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine (Yeast), the&#xD;
      placebo is aluminium phosphate diluent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study planned to enrol 12000 healthy female aged 18-30 in 10 study sites. Each&#xD;
      participants will received a three-dose schedule of vaccine or placebo randomly but with the&#xD;
      proportion controlled as 1:1 for vaccine group and placebo group. After each inoculation, the&#xD;
      immediate reaction will be observed for 30 minutes, and the local and systemic reaction will&#xD;
      be systematically observed for 7 days. After the first inoculation, adverse event will be&#xD;
      collected until one month after the final inoculation, while serious adverse event will be&#xD;
      collected until 6 months after the final inoculation. Blood samples will be collected before&#xD;
      the first inoculation, and one month after the final injection, blood samples will also be&#xD;
      collected in a group of participants containing 800 people to detect antibody titer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visit will be conducted 14 times: month 0, month 0 + 8 days, month 2, month 2 + 8&#xD;
      days, month 6, month 6 + 8 days, month 7, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30, month 36,&#xD;
      month 48, month 60. When cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) is indicated,&#xD;
      the participant will receive standard treatment and drop out from the study.&#xD;

    <description>Among the 14 follow-up visits which will be conducted during the study, 9 visits are gynecological follow-up visits. In these gynecological visits, cervical samples will be collected to conduct HPV DNA detection and cytological detection to evaluate whether occurred cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and what grade of neoplasia occurred.</description>
