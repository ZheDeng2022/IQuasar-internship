  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by intense fear of becoming fat despite&#xD;
      the obvious thinness and extreme behaviors for weight loss. The result is a massive weight&#xD;
      loss and / or pathological thinness. The care of anorexia is difficult and few treatments&#xD;
      have proved to be effective in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulation technique that uses an&#xD;
      electrical current of low intensity. It allows to modulate the corticospinal excitability:&#xD;
      two electrodes, an anode (excitatory) and a cathode (inhibitory), are positioned on the skull&#xD;
      according to the region which is desired to influence the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although tDCS was shown to no noticeable side effects, it is first necessary to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and safety of this technique in these physically frail patients. A recent pilot&#xD;
      study suggests the acceptability, safety and efficacy of tDCS program in patients with&#xD;
      anorexia nervosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these preliminary data and the extreme seriousness and vulnerability of patients with&#xD;
      resistant anorexia, the investigators want to assess the risk / benefit ratio for the use of&#xD;
      this technique in patients suffering from resistant anorexia nervosa. The current data are&#xD;
      too preliminary to consider a randomized controlled trial, the investigators hope, initially,&#xD;
      replicate the data from this pilot study in a second sample with a more rigorous and&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment methodology .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During stimulation, the anode will be placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and&#xD;
      the cathode on the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stimulation of 2 milli-Ampere is&#xD;
      applied for 25 minutes each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 sessions will be conducted twice a day respecting a period of four hours between sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tDCS sessions will start maximum 15 days after the inclusion visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two intermediate control visits will be conducted. One after the first week of tDCS, the&#xD;
      other immediately after the last session of tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main assessment visit will be carried out one month (+/- 5 days) after the last session&#xD;
      of tDCS. Finally a reminder visit will be performed 6 months (+/- 3 weeks) after the last&#xD;
      session of tDCS to assess the stability over time of the potential effects observed.&#xD;
