      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schistosomiasis is a chronic infection. It is caused by parasitic worms called Schistosoma&#xD;
      haematobium (Sh) that are spread by snails that live in rivers. It can lead to liver problems&#xD;
      or bladder cancer. Praziquantel (PZQ) is a drug used to treat this infection. After taking&#xD;
      it, some people develop increased resistance to reinfection with Sh. Some people with Sh&#xD;
      infection can be infected with another worm called Mansonella perstans (Mp). Mp is spread&#xD;
      through a biting insect called a midge. It rarely causes symptoms. However, researchers think&#xD;
      that Mp infection could affect the body s response to PZQ treatment for or risk of&#xD;
      reinfection with Sh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out the effects of Mp infection on the response to PZQ treatment for Sh infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women ages 14-80 who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Live in Tieneguebougou, Bougoudiana, or surrounding villages in Mali&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are not pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have Sh infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have no other chronic medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stool samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be treated with a single dose of PZQ by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After receiving PZQ, participants will return to the clinic for blood and urine tests at&#xD;
           the following times:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours later&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  5, 7, 9, and 14 days later&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1, 3, and 6 months later&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are infected with Sh at the 6-month visit will get another treatment with&#xD;
      PZQ.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic filarial infection is associated with downregulation of immune responses to both&#xD;
      helminth and non-helminth antigens. Praziquantel (PZQ) treatment of schistosomiasis is&#xD;
      associated with a dramatic interleukin-5 (IL-5)-dependent increase in eosinophilia that is&#xD;
      correlated with resistance to reinfection. We hypothesize that chronic filarial infection&#xD;
      with Mansonella perstans (Mp) may attenuate post-treatment eosinophilia and thus impact&#xD;
      resistance to reinfection. To address the first part of this question, we plan to compare&#xD;
      post-PZQ reactions and reinfection rates in 20 subjects with schistosomiasis and Mp infection&#xD;
      to those in 20 subjects with schistosomiasis and no evidence of filarial infection in an area&#xD;
      coendemic for both infections in Mali. Signs and symptoms, complete blood counts,&#xD;
      intracellular and serum cytokine levels, and markers of eosinophil activation will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, 4 and 8 hours, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 14 days post-treatment and&#xD;
      compared between the two treatment groups. Schistosoma haematobium reinfection rates will&#xD;
      also be compared at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (SCREENING):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known to be pregnant (by history)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Chronic medical conditions, including but not limited to diabetes, renal or hepatic&#xD;
             insufficiency, immunodeficiency, psychiatric disorder, seizure, that in the&#xD;
             investigators judgments are deemed to be clinically significant&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of hypersensitivity reaction to PZQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Weight less than 20 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA (INTERVENTIONAL STUDY):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. S. haematobium infection documented at screening and within 14 days prior to the&#xD;
             baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject agrees to storage of samples for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (INTERVENTIONAL STUDY):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy (by urine beta-HCG)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Chronic kidney or liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hgb &lt;10 mg/dL&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Any condition that in the investigator s opinion places the subject at undue risk by&#xD;
             participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION OF CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women will be excluded from this study since it involves administration of&#xD;
        medications contraindicated in pregnancy. Children less than 14 years old will be excluded&#xD;
        because of the amount of blood required for the immunologic studies. The age of consent in&#xD;
        Mali is 18 years of age, so children aged 14 to 17 years will sign an assent form in&#xD;
        addition to the consent form to be signed by a parent or tutor. However, married women&#xD;
        between the ages of 14 and 17 will sign consent as adults in view of the laws governing&#xD;
        emancipation of women in Mali. Subjects who do not participate in this study will receive&#xD;
        PZQ as part of the national schistosomiasis control program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation of Women:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Pregnancy: The effects of praziquantel on the developing human fetus are unknown&#xD;
        (pregnancy category B). For this reason, females of&#xD;
&#xD;
        childbearing-age must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to receiving&#xD;
        praziquantel. Since the half-life of praziquantel is short (3-4 hours), contraceptive&#xD;
        measures will not be required post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Breast feeding: Praziquantel is known to be present in breast milk for up to 3 days&#xD;
        following a single dose and is not approved for use in children under the age of 4 years.&#xD;
        Consequently, women will be asked to suspend breastfeeding after treatment with PZQ for 3&#xD;
        days. Formula will be provided for breastfed children affected by their mother s&#xD;
        participation during this time to ensure adequate nutrition. Depending on the age of the&#xD;
        child, formula may be given. A pediatric nurse will be present during this time to provide&#xD;
        assistance and counsel to the mothers.&#xD;
