    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced anaemia (CIA) is a significant health problem for patients with cancer&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy, causing fatigue and reducing quality of life (QoL). Up to 75% of&#xD;
      cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy reportedly experience&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate anaemia (defined by a haemoglobin level of 9 to 11 g/dL). In clinical&#xD;
      trials, erythropoietins (EPOs) have been shown to increase haemoglobin levels and improve&#xD;
      anaemia and QoL in cancer patients. However, recent meta-analyses have highlighted possible&#xD;
      safety issues regarding EPO exposure. Preclinical studies have pointed towards the role of&#xD;
      EPO in augmenting tumorigenesis, metastasis, risk of thrombosis, and drug resistance in&#xD;
      certain tumor types (e.g., breast cancer), as it can activate important antiapoptotic&#xD;
      pathways targeted by current antineoplastic therapies, thus counteracting their effects.&#xD;
      Current guidelines in western countries and China recommend restricted usage of EPOs and&#xD;
      reduction / prevention of blood transfusions in the treatment of cancer-induced anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the inadequate response to erythropoietic therapy has not been well-characterized&#xD;
      through rigorous studies and hence remains poorly handled in routine clinical practice. A&#xD;
      major cause for not responding to EPO treatment is likely functional iron deficiency (FID),&#xD;
      which is defined as a failure to provide iron to the erythroblasts despite sufficient iron&#xD;
      stores. Patients with FID require supplementation of usable iron to optimize response to&#xD;
      erythropoietic therapy, which might not be accomplished with oral iron. In a recent&#xD;
      prospective, open-label trial, patients receiving epoetin alfa for CIA who were treated with&#xD;
      IV iron dextran had a significantly greater Hb response compared with those receiving oral&#xD;
      iron. Meanwhile, in patients with CIA and no iron deficiency, IV iron supplementation&#xD;
      significantly reduced treatment failures to darbepoetin without additional toxicity. However,&#xD;
      whether that IV iron supplementation increases the risk of disease progression, incidence of&#xD;
      thrombosis and heart failure as well as iron overload, is under careful investigation. Though&#xD;
      the association between IV iron and serious AEs and mortality remains unclear, Zitt et al.&#xD;
      found that the use of IV iron was associated with a 22% reduction in mortality. Therefore,&#xD;
      investigators designed this multicentre, randomized trial to investigate EPOs in combination&#xD;
      with IV iron with regard to an increase of Hb levels in patients who have inadequate&#xD;
      responses to initial treatment with routine doses of EPOs.&#xD;
