      A study to determine the efficacy and safety of rituximab in Pakistani patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have been inadequately controlled with standard disease&#xD;
      modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled subjects with inadequately-controlled RA had their disease activity level assessed&#xD;
      before initiation of therapy and at intervals of 6 months and 12 months thereafter.&#xD;
      Standardized disease activity scores like the Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS 28) were used&#xD;
      for determining remission or otherwise of the disease. The American College of Rheumatology&#xD;
      (ACR) 20, 50 and 70 response scores and the European League of Associations for Rheumatology&#xD;
      (EULAR) Response Criteria for RA were used to determine the percentage improvement in the&#xD;
      individual subject's condition at the same intervals. The former utilizes a set of&#xD;
      assessments to determine if, after a given therapy, there has been a 20, 50 or 70%&#xD;
      improvement in the aggregate scores as compared to the baseline and the latter utilizes&#xD;
      calculated improvements in the DAS 28 score to determine if the response to treatment has&#xD;
      been good, moderate or none. Both of these have been validated and approved for use by the&#xD;
      ACR and EULAR respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study enrollment period was from 1st January 2010 till 31st December 2010. Observation&#xD;
      period was 12 months from the enrollment date for each subject. The final results are being&#xD;
      reported here.&#xD;

    <description>Rituximab was administered as an intravenous infusion as per approved protocol on Day 1 and day 14. The protocol stipulated the administration of intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg and oral pheniramine maleate 43.5 mg as pre-medication. The Rituximab itself was given as a 1 gm infusion slowly over a period of 4-6 hours.&#xD;
This was done either by a specialist nurse or a trained doctor.</description>
