    <textblock>
      In Colorado, marijuana is currently used for both recreational and medicinal purposes. The&#xD;
      major active drug is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The most common route of use is through&#xD;
      inhalation of the combustion products of the dried, buds/flowers from the female plant either&#xD;
      rolled in paper (joint) or burned through a screen in a dry or water filled pipe (bong).&#xD;
      Increasingly THC is consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The side effects of the inhalation of burned leaves are controversial. The purpose of this&#xD;
      proposal is to establish a prospective cohort of heavy marijuana users to evaluate positive&#xD;
      and negative long term medical effects of marijuana use. As marijuana has also been reported&#xD;
      for use to help treat insomnia, a sub-study will focus on how marijuana is used for sleep&#xD;
      disorders and disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll individuals that use marijuana to learn more about long-term health&#xD;
      effects. The study involves one visit where participants will complete questionnaires,&#xD;
      breathing tests, blood and urine collection. There is a sub-study where eligible participants&#xD;
      will also complete an at-home sleep monitoring test. Participants will be contacted multiple&#xD;
      times a year for long-term follow-up.&#xD;
