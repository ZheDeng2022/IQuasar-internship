      This will be a phase II trial testing if the combination of SBRT and L19-IL2 improves the&#xD;
      progression free survival in patients with limited metastatic non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC). Treatment will be divided in two cohorts: patients eligible for ablative&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiotherapy to all metastatic sites (treatment with curative intent) and&#xD;
      patients not eligible for stereotactic body radiotherapy to all sites (life prolongation).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IMMUNOSABR will include 138 patients. The trialpopulation will be divided in two cohorts:&#xD;
      patients eligible for ablative stereotactic body radiotherapy to all metastatic sites&#xD;
      (treatment with curative intent) and patients not eligible for stereotactic body radiotherapy&#xD;
      to all sites (life prolongation).In this single stage phase II trial we aim to demonstrate&#xD;
      absolute increase in progression free survival at two years. . PFS will be determined as the&#xD;
      time between randomization and disease progression, according to RECIST 1.1, death due to any&#xD;
      cause or last patient contact alive and progression-free. Patients will be randomized between&#xD;
      control (no L19-IL2) and experimental arms (with L19-IL2) in a 1:1 ratio. The accrual period&#xD;
      will be 29 months (or 2.41 years) and the minimum follow-up will be 24 months (or 2 years),&#xD;
      making the total study duration 53 months (or 4.41 years). Comparison between control and&#xD;
      experimental arms will be done using the Log-Rank statistic. This test for superiority will&#xD;
      be one-sided with a desired type I error of 0.10 and power of 0.80. The randomization&#xD;
      allocation is 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint and power calculation For the ablative cohort: the expected 2-year PFS is&#xD;
      20% in the control arm (arm A) and 40% in the experimental arm ( arm B). The study is&#xD;
      therefore powered to test for a difference in PFS at 2 years of 20%. The null hypothesis (H0)&#xD;
      is that there is no difference in PFS between arm A and arm B. This results in a sample size&#xD;
      of 72 patients evenly divided over two arms with 36 patient per arm. Considering a dropout&#xD;
      rate of 10% from current experience, the actual amount of patients will be 40 per arm or 80&#xD;
      in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the non-ablative cohort: the expected 2-year PFS is 10% in the control arm (arm C) and&#xD;
      30% in the experimental arm (arm D) The study is therefore powered to test for a difference&#xD;
      in PFS at 2 years of 20%. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no difference in PFS&#xD;
      between arm C and arm D. This resuls in a sample size of 52 patients evenly divided over two&#xD;
      arms with 26 patient per arm. Considering a dropout rate of 10% from current experience, the&#xD;
      actual amount of patients will be 29 per arm or 58 in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of patients needed for the trial is the sum of the amount of patients in the&#xD;
      ablative cohort (80 patients) and the amount of patients in the non-ablative cohort (58&#xD;
      patients): 138 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints Simple univariate comparisons of outcome and toxicity will be made&#xD;
      between both treatment arms in each cohort using Chi-square tests for categorical data and&#xD;
      independent samples t-tests for scale data. Secondary study parameter(s): Overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) will be assessed using survival tables and Kaplan-Meier curves. OS will be calculated&#xD;
      from the day of randomisation. Abscopal response, which can only be measured in the&#xD;
      non-ablative cohort (with at least one non-irradiated target lesion) will measured as best&#xD;
      response between experimental and standard treatment arms. Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30&#xD;
      version 3.0 and QLQ-LC13 questionnaires) will be recorded at regular intervals. Average&#xD;
      changes in quality of life will be reported in terms of absolute differences in scores, and&#xD;
      also in terms of minimally clinically relevant changes.&#xD;
