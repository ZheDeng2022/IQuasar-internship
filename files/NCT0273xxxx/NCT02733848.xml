  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia is an increasingly recognized complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)&#xD;
      that is poorly understood and difficult to treat. Investigators hypothesize that after RYGB&#xD;
      some patients have incomplete carbohydrate absorption in the small intestine which leads to&#xD;
      inconsistent glucose levels and hypoglycemia during oral consumption of a meal. Investigators&#xD;
      further hypothesize that pancreatic enzyme supplementation with (Creon) during meals and&#xD;
      snacks will improve carbohydrate absorption and lead to more stable glucose levels in&#xD;
      patients with post-RYGB hypoglycemia.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: Evaluate the feasibility and safety of Creon in the treatment of post-RYGB&#xD;
      hypoglycemia as add-on therapy to a diet higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: Evaluate utility of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in monitoring&#xD;
      hypoglycemia as an adjunct to standard venous blood testing using a glucometer in post-RYGB&#xD;
      hypoglycemia.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Creon</intervention_name>
    <description>Creon is a porcine derived pancreatic enzyme supplement that comes in in fixed dose combinations of lipase, protease, and amylase, respectively. Dosing is based on lipase per kilograms per meal (i.e. lipase units/kg/meal). Subjects will be started at a dose of 500 units of lipase/kg/meal and snacks at week 4 and continued until week 8. A follow-up visit at week 6 will assess patient for tolerance to Creon and need for dosage adjustment.&#xD;
Formulations come in different fixed dose combinations as follows:&#xD;
Creon: Lipase 3000 USP units, protease 9500 USP units, and amylase 15,000 USP units&#xD;
Creon: Lipase 6000 USP units, protease 19,000 USP units, and amylase 30,000 USP units&#xD;
Creon: Lipase 12,000 USP units, protease 38,000 USP units, and amylase 60,000 USP units&#xD;
Creon: Lipase 24,000 USP units, protease 76,000 USP units, and amylase 120,000 USP units&#xD;
Creon: Lipase 36,000 USP units, protease 114,000 USP units, and amylase 180,000 USP units</description>

    <description>A registered dietician will meet with the subject and take a thorough review of the patient's dietary history. The subject will then be counseled on a lower carbohydrate and higher protein diet. This diet will be continued for the entire 12 week of the study. The registered dietician will reinforce dietary recommendations by phone on week 2, 4 and 8, respectively.</description>

    <intervention_name>Placebo</intervention_name>
    <description>Placebo will be given to the patient in single blind fashion with the subject unaware but PI aware of study drug assignment from week 8-12. Placebo tablets will be given with meals and snacks similar to CREON to maintain patient blinding to study drug assignment. A follow-up visit on week 10 to review patient tolerance, side effects and possible drug adjustment.</description>
