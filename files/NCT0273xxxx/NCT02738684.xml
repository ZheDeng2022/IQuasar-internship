    <textblock>
      This project aims to do a small sample exploratory study, to predict EGFR-TKI targeted&#xD;
      therapy gefitinib' s efficacy in late stage lung adenocarcinoma patients (phase IIIB or IV),&#xD;
      who have negative tissue EGFR gene mutation, positive plasma free nucleic acid EGFR gene.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results of the study will clarify that if the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) EGFR mutation&#xD;
      could be used as a screening method for EGFR-TKI targeted therapy for late stage lung cancer&#xD;
      patients, as well as a standard for the therapy efficacy. This study can be used as a&#xD;
      standard to assess gefitinib' s efficacy after 8 weeks of treatment in IIIB or stage IV lung&#xD;
      cancer through tumor tissue negative, ctDNA positive EGFR mutation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants in this research must meet the following criteria: histologic diagnosed&#xD;
             of lung adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Late stage (stage IIIB or IV) lung adenocarcinoma according to the International Union&#xD;
             against cancer (UICC) the latest version of standard cancer TNM staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  tumor tissue EGFR mutation negative, and ctDNA EGFR mutation positive correlated with&#xD;
             EGFR TKI sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants should have signed and dated on the official informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not less than 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 1 lesion can be exactly measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose plasma free nucleic acids EGFR mutation test were positive, and willing&#xD;
             to use gefitinib for therapy by their own expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients already received EGFR-TKI treatment previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have pressure on the spinal cord or brain metastases, no symptom, conditions&#xD;
             stabled, do not need to use steroid medications for 4 weeks before the start of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinical evidence of any symptoms of severe or uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension, for example, researchers believe that patients with uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension and active bleeding will affect the study reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled nausea or vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal disease,&#xD;
             unable to swallow drugs or underwent major bowel resection may affect the full&#xD;
             absorption of gefitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;

             check shows average correction QT period (QTc) &gt;470 msec; clinical abnormal symptom of&#xD;
             rhythm, conduction, and static ECG, for example completely left beam conduction block,&#xD;
             III degrees conduction block, II degrees conduction block, PR period &gt;250 msec,&#xD;
             various factors with risks of extended QTc or rhythm disorders, for example,&#xD;

             direct relatives has long QT syndrome or sudden unexplained death in less than 40&#xD;
             years old, drug combination that may prolong the QT interval.&#xD;

             been pregnant or breast feeding, or positive pregnancy test prior to study (urine or&#xD;
             serum).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients don't agree with the study processes, constraints and requirements, and were&#xD;
