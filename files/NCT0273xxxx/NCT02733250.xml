      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dose of nab-paclitaxel to be safely&#xD;
      administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced inoperable non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. The study is also aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the combination&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, open-label, proof of concept study of nab-paclitaxel administered in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study will assess the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of nab-paclitaxel in&#xD;
      combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg administered on day 1 of each 21 day&#xD;
      cycle). Dose escalation for nab-paclitaxel will be conducted according to the &quot;3+3 design&quot;&#xD;
      until the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study will evaluate the administration of pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg&#xD;
      every 3 weeks in combination with nab-paclitaxel at the RP2D. Determining the RP2D will&#xD;
      classify the treatment combination as safe and allow for an expansion of the study&#xD;
      population, which will ultimately lead to further assessments of safety and tolerability as&#xD;
      well as an evaluation of the anti-tumoral effect of the proposed treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using Simon's optimal 2-stage design for Phase II clinical trials, we determined that a&#xD;
      sample size of 36 patients would be adequate to test the proposed hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy analysis of overall response rate (ORR) will be interpreted as follows:&#xD;
      1) if less than 9 partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) are recorded, the&#xD;
      combination of nab-paclitaxel and pembrolizumab provides less than additive effects and is&#xD;
      not likely to be clinically superior compared to pembrolizumab alone based on an ORR&#xD;
      assessment; 2) however, if 9 or more PR or CR are recorded, the treatment combination&#xD;
      warrants further clinical study. This could take the form of an extended phase II (to reach&#xD;
      the 97 patients calculated from the model) or a phase III study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression (as per RECIST 1.1), unacceptable adverse&#xD;
      event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,&#xD;
      investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, investigator's noncompliance with trial&#xD;
      treatment or procedures requirements, the subject receives 24 months of uninterrupted&#xD;
      treatment or 35 administrations of study medication (whichever is later), or administrative&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Safety follow-up will be maintained up to 90 days following the administration of the last study-drug dose.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety analysis will be based on subjects who experienced toxicities as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03. Safety will be assessed by quantifying the toxicities and grades experienced by subjects who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab and nab-paclitaxel, including serious adverse events (SAEs) and event of clinical interest (ECIs).</description>

    <description>Phase I will determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of nab-paclitaxel when given in combination with pembrolizumab. Escalation for nab-paclitaxel will be conducted following a &quot;3+3&quot; design. First cohort of 3 patients will receive nab-paclitaxel on Days 1 and 8 at a dose of 100 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) in combination with pembrolizumab at 200 mg IV every 3 weeks. If no dose limiting toxicities (DLT) occur, the dose of nab-paclitaxel will be escalated to 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 every 3 weeks. The dose of pembrolizumab will remain the same. If no DLTs occur, dose level 2 will be defined as the RP2D. In the Phase II, pembrolizumab will be administered at 200 mg IV every 3 weeks and nab-paclitaxel will be administered at the RP2D.</description>
