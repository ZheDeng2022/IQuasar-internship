    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a masked, two center, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of nasal and oral inhalation of 75 mg aztreonam in subjects&#xD;
      with CF and lung infection due to PA. The study will involve two sites: Virginia Commonwealth&#xD;
      University Medical Center (VCU) and Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS). Potential&#xD;
      subjects will be identified in each site's CF clinic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety of nasal aztreonam administered&#xD;
      using the Pari Sinus Nebulizer combined with oral Cayston aerosol therapy compared to placebo&#xD;
      on clinical and laboratory endpoints such as risk of antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa (PA), time to pulmonary infection exacerbation, nasal quality of life, pulmonary&#xD;
      function, nasal and lower airway cultures, and properties of mucus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P. aeruginosa (PA) is a primary cause of lung infections in persons with cystic fibrosis (CF)&#xD;
      (1). Over the past decade, studies have shown that aerosolized antibiotics can reduce lower&#xD;
      respiratory bacterial load, decrease exacerbations of pulmonary disease, and in many patients&#xD;
      improve pulmonary function. Cayston (aztreonam) oral aerosol using the PARI Altera Nebulizer&#xD;
      System was approved by the FDA in February 2010 for CF patients 7 years of age or older with&#xD;
      PA (2). In 2011, 35.8% or patients in the National CF Patient Registry used Cayston for&#xD;
      treatment (3). Bacterial cultures suggest that the upper airways and lower airways of CF&#xD;
      patients are cross-infected by PA and that the paranasal sinuses can act as a bacterial&#xD;
      reservoir (4). There is improved post-transplanation patient survival for recipients that&#xD;
      undergo sinus surgery and daily nasal washes to reduce bacterial load (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine CF care does not generally include upper airway assessment. There are no published&#xD;
      studies evaluating the effect of aerosol antibiotics to treat nasal and sinus infections in&#xD;
      CF in combination with oral inhaled aerosol therapy to treat the lower airway disease.&#xD;
      However Mainz and colleagues published a case report that suggested that sinonasal&#xD;
      administration of tobramycin using the Pari Sinus nebulizer (Pari Corp, Starnberg, Germany)&#xD;
      delayed PA lower respiratory infection in a 12 year-old with CF who had chronic mucopurulent&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis (5) and studies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suggest that treating&#xD;
      upper airways can also improve coexistent lower airway disease.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Sinus and Nasal QoL Questionnaire (SNOT-20) on Day 140 and Day 168</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 140 and Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 20 (SNOT-20) is a validated health-related QOL questionnarie designed to determine the impact of sinonasal dysfunction. Patients will assess nasal symptoms, emotion, and activity on a scale of worsening symptoms scored 1 through 7 to provide a quantifiable score capable of disease severity. It has been shown as a responsive measure of health-related quality of life and suitable for use in outcomes studies and routine clinical care. Survey responses from Day 140 and Day 168 will be compared to the SNOT20 survey responses from previous visits (V1, V2, and V4)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cystic Fibrosis QoL Score (CFQ-R) on Day 140</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 140</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ-R is a validated patient-reported outcome measuring health-related quality of life for children and adults with CF. The CFQ-R contains both general and CF-specific scales. The CFQ-R was administered at Visits 1, 6, and 7. The endpoint was change in CFQR on day 140 compared to V1 and V5.</description>

        <description>The Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 20 (SNOT-20) is a validated health-related QOL questionnarie designed to determine the impact of sinonasal dysfunction. Patients will assess nasal symptoms, emotion, and activity on a scale of worsening symptoms scored 1 through 7 to provide a quantifiable score capable of disease severity. It has been shown as a responsive measure of health-related quality of life and suitable for use in outcomes studies and routine clinical care. Survey responses from Day 140 and Day 168 will be compared to the SNOT20 survey responses from previous visits (V1, V2, and V4)</description>

        <title>Number of Protocol-defined Pulmonary Exacerbations Treated With Oral Anti-pseudomonal Antibiotics</title>
        <description>Protocol-Defined Pulmonary Exacerbation includes events that are characterized by change or worsening pulmonary symptoms (increased cough, increased sputum production and chest congestion, decreased appetite and exercise tolerance), loss of weight, and lung function decline that prompt initation of antibiotic therapy. Protocol-defined exacerbations in subjects that warrant treatment with oral antibiotics will be determined from the medical record during the course of this study.</description>
