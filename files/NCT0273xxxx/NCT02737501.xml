  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of brigatinib to that of crizotinib in&#xD;
      ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) participants naive to&#xD;
      ALK inhibitors, as evidenced by progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase III, randomized, open-label, comparative, multicenter,&#xD;
      international study is to compare the efficacy and safety of brigatinib to that of crizotinib&#xD;
      in ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC participants who have not previously been&#xD;
      treated with an ALK inhibitor. Participants will be stratified by the presence of CNS&#xD;
      metastases at baseline and prior chemotherapy used for locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      disease. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either brigatinib, 90 mg&#xD;
      orally once daily (QD) for 7 days, then a 180 mg orally QD, or crizotinib, 250 mg orally&#xD;
      twice daily (BID). Participants will receive treatment until disease progression, intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity, consent withdrawal, or death. Crossover from crizotinib to brigatinib is also&#xD;
      permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total estimated duration of the study is at least 4.5 years, including 1.5 years to&#xD;
      accrue participants, with at least 3 years for treatment and follow-up.&#xD;

CR defined as disappearance of all extranodal target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis for target lesions and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis), normalization of tumor marker level for non-target lesions. PR: at least a 30% decrease in SLD of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. PD: SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study, SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 37 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study drug (i.e., occurs after the first dose of study drug) is also an AE. TEAEs are defined as AEs starting/worsening on or after the first dose of study treatment and no later than the earliest of 30 days after the last dose of the treatment to which the participant was assigned, or the day before start of brigatinib therapy in crossover participant.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life as Assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL: perceived quality of participant's life, includes self-reported multidimensional measures of physical and mental health. Patient-reported symptoms (PROs) and HRQoL will be collected by administering the european organisation for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) quality of life (QLQ)-C30 questionnaire. EORTC-QLQ-C30 contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/QOL scale. The 30 items have 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale. Raw scores are converted into overall score ranging from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate better QOL. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response (DOR)</title>
        <description>Duration of response as assessed by BIRC, is defined as the time interval from the date that the criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented. CR is defined as disappearance of all extranodal target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis for target lesions and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis), normalization of tumor marker level for non-target lesions. PR is at least a 30 % decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD is SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest), the SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, and for non-target lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study drug (i.e., occurs after the first dose of study drug) is also an AE. TEAEs are defined as AEs starting/worsening on or after the first dose of study treatment and no later than the earliest of 30 days after the last dose of the treatment to which the participant was assigned, or the day before start of brigatinib therapy in crossover participant.</description>

        <description>HRQoL: perceived quality of participant's life, includes self-reported multidimensional measures of physical and mental health. Patient-reported symptoms (PROs) and HRQoL will be collected by administering the european organisation for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) quality of life (QLQ)-C30 questionnaire. EORTC-QLQ-C30 contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/QOL scale. The 30 items have 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale. Raw scores are converted into overall score ranging from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate better QOL. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
