  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ewing's sarcoma characterized by the t(11; 22) (q24; q12) translocation at several but&#xD;
      prioritized breakpoint sites, resulting in the EWS/FLI1 fusion gene is the second most&#xD;
      frequently diagnosed primary malignant bone tumor in the US with an annual incidence, from&#xD;
      birth to age 20, of 2.9 cases per million population. The survival rate for patients with&#xD;
      high-risk recurrent disease (relapse &lt; 2 years) is &lt; 10% at 5 years. Moreover, of patients&#xD;
      who progress after second line treatment, eighty percent do not achieve a second complete&#xD;
      response and of these patients &lt; 10% survive one year. Refractory patients to both frontline&#xD;
      and second line therapy have even worse prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EWS/FLI1 gene is well known as the driver gene of Ewing's sarcoma. We designed a novel&#xD;
      pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1 LPX which has demonstrated sufficient specificity, safety and&#xD;
      efficacy in animal testing to justify Phase I testing. Clinical safety (no ≥ grade 3 product&#xD;
      related toxic effect) and target specific activity has been observed with other bi-shRNA&#xD;
      products involving 147 cancer patients (698 separate dose administrations)&#xD;
      (BB-Investigational New Drug (IND) 14205; BB-IND 14938). Moreover, safety has been observed&#xD;
      with IV delivery of pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1 LPX in murine and swine testing via multidose&#xD;
      IV administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study testing of pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1 LPX will involve patients (≥age 8) with advanced&#xD;
      Ewing's sarcoma. The first 3 subjects enrolled onto the study as well as the first subject&#xD;
      enrolled into each dose cohort must be 16 years of age or older. pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1&#xD;
      LPX will be given via intravenous infusion. Patients will be accrued in 3- patient dose&#xD;
      escalation cohorts using the following escalation schema (50%→33%→25%→25%→25%) at a starting&#xD;
      IV dose of 0.04 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 1 of 3 subjects within a dose cohort experiences a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), that dose&#xD;
      cohort will be expanded to six subjects provided no further subjects experience a DLT. If no&#xD;
      further subjects experience a DLT, dose-escalation may continue. If ≥2 subjects within a dose&#xD;
      cohort experiences a DLT, this will define the DLT dose level and the Maximum Tolerated Dose&#xD;
      (MTD) will have been exceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preceding dose level will be expanded to a total of 6 subjects and, if ≤1 subject&#xD;
      experiences a DLT, that dose level will be considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If no&#xD;
      further subjects experience a DLT, dose-escalation may resume per escalation schema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the presumptive MTD is reached, an additional 6 subjects will be treated at that dose,&#xD;
      designated the expanded MTD dose cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum for pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis will be collected on Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1&#xD;
      (C1W1D1), Cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      1, Week 6, Day 4; and Cycle 2, Week 1, Day 1 at following time points (±10%):30 minutes prior&#xD;
      to administration and at the following time points after initiation of study agent&#xD;
      administration: 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours&#xD;
      and 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum for cytokine analysis will be collected on Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 at following time&#xD;
      points (±10%): 2 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours. Serum for cytokine analysis will also be&#xD;
      collected on Cycle 2, Week 1, Day 1 and Cycle 3, Week 1, Day 1, at following time points&#xD;
      (±10%): 30 minutes prior to administration and at 6 hours after initiation of study agent&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood for analysis of RNA mechanism will be collected prior to administration of the study&#xD;
      agent and 48 hours after study agent administration (with a 10% window). Blood for RNA will&#xD;
      be collected at the first and last dose of each cycle (e.g. C1W1D1, C1W6D4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis will be collected at Cycle 1 Week 1 Day 1,&#xD;
      Cycle 1 Week 3 Day 1, Cycle 2 Week 1 Day 1 prior to product infusion and every even cycle&#xD;
      thereafter at Week 1 Day 1 prior to product infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If available, a biopsy or pleural fluid will be collected 1 to 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Week&#xD;
      1 Day 1 and 72 hours after the last dose of Cycle 1.&#xD;
