      Many studies have shown that acute cerebral dysfunction can impair cardiac function and&#xD;
      autonomic control of blood pressure, heart rate and vascular tone, however, the size of the&#xD;
      stroke is rarely reported. Involvement of the insular cortex seems to predispose to cardiac&#xD;
      damage and autonomic dysfunction. However, it is not clear whether cardiac dysfunction is&#xD;
      merely a marker of large strokes or location of the stroke is critical.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      On one hand structural cardiac anomalies and arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation can give&#xD;
      rise to thrombi that are dislodged as emboli to the brain and cause stroke. On the other hand&#xD;
      acute emotional stress or cerebral events can cause acute cardiac dysfunction with left&#xD;
      ventricular failure in the absence of cardiac causes. The extreme variant of stress&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy is known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patients are presenting with chest pain,&#xD;
      electrocardiographic changes similar to acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment&#xD;
      elevation, T-wave inversion, or QT prolongation, and elevated cardiac biomarkers such as CK&#xD;
      and troponin. When coronary angiography is performed coronary arteries are normal, but the&#xD;
      left ventricle shows mostly apical and midventricular dyskinesia and apical ballooning or&#xD;
      rarely basal akinesia and apical hyperkinesia. The exact pathogenesis is unknown. Presumably&#xD;
      high catecholamine levels resulting from the extreme emotional stress or acute cerebral&#xD;
      events cause severe peripheral vasospasms resulting in myocardial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been known for many decades that myocardial damage such as small patchy necroses and&#xD;
      subendocardial hemorrhages and cardiac arrhythmias can occur after subarachnoid or&#xD;
      intracerebral haemorrhage. Greenhout and Reichenbach and Weidler observed abnormally&#xD;
      increased autonomic activity or an imbalance between parasympathetic and sympathetic input to&#xD;
      the heart. Systematic analyses of heart and brain interactions were first performed by JW&#xD;
      Norris and coworkers in Toronto. They examined cardiac enzymes in 230 acute stroke patients&#xD;
      and found raised CK-MB in 25 (11%). They also found that catecholamine concentrations in&#xD;
      stroke patients were higher than in controls, that patients with higher CK levels had higher&#xD;
      norepinephrine levels, more often arrhythmias and such elevated CK and norepinephrine levels&#xD;
      were more common in hemispheric compared to brain stem strokes. DiAngelantonio et al assessed&#xD;
      cardiac troponin I levels on admission of 330 stroke patients. When troponin I levels were&#xD;
      elevated the odds for in-hospital death or non-fatal cardiac events were increased. These&#xD;
      results were corroborated in a systematic review of 15 similar studies. According to this&#xD;
      review troponin was elevated in 18.1% of 2901 stroke patients. Patients with elevated&#xD;
      troponin levels had an odds ratio of 3.0 (95% CI 1.5-6.2) for showing electrocardiographic&#xD;
      changes and an odds ratio for death of 2.9 (95% CI 1.7-4.8). Hakan Ay and coworkers addressed&#xD;
      the question whether stroke in specific brain areas are more prone to cardiac damage. In a&#xD;
      case control study they analysed diffusion weighted MR images of patients with elevated&#xD;
      troponin T levels (cTnT) and patients with normal levels to identify voxels with diffusion&#xD;
      restriction that are associated with troponin elevation. Brain regions that were a priori&#xD;
      associated with cTnT elevation included the right posterior, superior, and medial insula and&#xD;
      the right inferior parietal lobule. Among patients with right middle cerebral artery&#xD;
      infarction, the insular cluster was involved in 88% of patients with and 33% without cTnT&#xD;
      elevation (odds ratio: 15.00; 95% CI: 2.65 to 84.79). Their findings indicate that the right&#xD;
      insula is associated with elevated serum cardiac troponin T level indicative of myocardial&#xD;
      injury. In an additional MR study using diffusion and perfusion imaging the same group of&#xD;
      researchers found that infarctions encompassing the insula is associated with increased&#xD;
      conversion of ischemic but potentially viable penumbral tissues into infarction. Unlike Ay et&#xD;
      al Laowattana and coworkers found left insular stroke associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      adverse cardiac outcome and decreased cardiac wall motion compared to stroke in other&#xD;
      locations and TIA. According to their findings left insular lesions show decreased&#xD;
      parasympathetic tone and right insular lesions increased sympathetic drive. This results in&#xD;
      abnormal fluctuations in blood pressure, abnormal circadian blood pressure patterns, higher&#xD;
      norepinephrine levels and elevated blood pressure in acute stroke. Furthermore, baroreflex&#xD;
      sensitivity has been found to be reduced after stroke, i.e. autonomic adjustment of heart&#xD;
      rate and vascular tone to sudden blood pressure changes was compromised. Sykora et al&#xD;
      demonstrated that baroreflex impairment in acute stroke is not associated with carotid&#xD;
      atherosclerosis but with insular involvement. In their study both insulae seemed to&#xD;
      participate in processing the baroreceptor information with the left insula being more&#xD;
      dominant. Other authors found that there might be a hemispheric dominance of autonomic&#xD;
      control and that impairment of cardiovascular autonomic control increases with higher NIHSS&#xD;
      scores. The reason for the neuroanatomic correlation of insular strokes and myocardial injury&#xD;
      and that middle cerebral artery stroke involving the insula are more prone to growth as found&#xD;
      by Ay et al is not known. A hypothesis focuses on the tight connections of the insular cortex&#xD;
      to the limbic system. Phylogenetically the limbic system belongs to the oldest parts of the&#xD;
      brain. It encompasses a group of gyri and nuclei and interconnections in the center of the&#xD;
      brain such as amygdala, hippocampus, gyrus cinguli, fornix, anterioventral thalamic nuclei,&#xD;
      and hypothalamus. The main functions of the limbic system is controlling the endocrine and&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system, emotional life and behavior, olfaction, pleasure, and short and&#xD;
      long term memory and learning. Dysautonomia after stroke is independent whether stroke is&#xD;
      ischemic or hemorrhagic. Similarly, excitation of the cortex in epilepsy can result in&#xD;
      cardiac dysfunction. Epilepsy can cause ictal tachycardia and bradycardia and ECG changes,&#xD;
      even if brain imaging does not show any structural abnormality. In addition, more than a&#xD;
      third of epilepsy patients show ictal bradycardia that would merit insertion of a permanent&#xD;
      pacemaker. Sudden unexpected death is increased five fold in epilepsy, and especially&#xD;
      patients with treatment refractory generalised tonic clonic seizures are at risk. One of the&#xD;
      main reasons might be brain heart interactions with asystole. To summarize, many studies have&#xD;
      shown that acute cerebral dysfunction can impair cardiac function and autonomic control of&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart rate and vascular tone, however, the size of the stroke is rarely&#xD;
      reported. Involvement of the insular cortex seems to predispose to cardiac damage and&#xD;
      autonomic dysfunction. However, it is not clear whether cardiac dysfunction is merely a&#xD;
      marker of large strokes or location of the stroke is critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed research is to answer the question whether both size of stroke and&#xD;
      location are independent predictors of impairment of cardiac function in acute stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective analysis of patients of the Bernese Stroke Data Base who all had a&#xD;
      full MRI examination at admission. All acute stroke patients will be screened for Troponin&#xD;
      elevations, abnormal electrocardiograms or both. Patients with primary cardiac causes or&#xD;
      other reasons for troponin elevations or ECG changes will be handled separately. The study&#xD;
      patients will be compared to at least 200 control stroke patients without troponin elevations&#xD;
      and without ECG changes. Infarct location, vessel occlusions and volumes of diffusion&#xD;
      restriction and perfusion deficit will be assessed on MR images. In a multivariable analysis,&#xD;
      the investigators will find out whether Troponin elevations and ECG abnormalities are&#xD;
      associated with infarct location or infarct size or both. In addition, the investigators will&#xD;
      perform a voxel based analysis for correlation of infarct location and troponin elevations&#xD;
      and ECG abnormalities.&#xD;
