  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health anxiety is a prevalent, disabling disorder associated with extensive health care&#xD;
      expenditures. The lack of easily accessible, evidence-based psychological treatment combined&#xD;
      with delayed diagnostic recognition constitute barriers to receiving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop an internet-delivered treatment program, based on 'Acceptance and Commitment&#xD;
           Therapy' (ACT), for patients with health anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the feasibility and effectiveness of the treatment programme in a randomized,&#xD;
           controlled trial, comparing the treatment with an active control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods 150 patients aged 18 years and older can self-refer through a web-page to apply for&#xD;
      participation. Before inclusion patients will undergo a video-diagnostic interview. Patients&#xD;
      are randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either, 1) active treatment: consisting of&#xD;
      internet-based ACT (iACT) with 7 therapist-guided modules of self-help text, exercises,&#xD;
      patient videos and audio-files, or 2) active control condition: consisting of an&#xD;
      internet-based discussion forum (iFORUM) with 7 topics of discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will complete self-report questionnaires at baseline, before randomization, at 4&#xD;
      and 8 weeks into treatment, after end of treatment, and at 6-month follow-up.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe health anxiety (illness anxiety disorder) or hypochondriasis, according to the&#xD;
      psychiatric classification system ICD-10, is characterized by preoccupation with fear of&#xD;
      having a serious illness, which interferes with daily functions and persists despite medical&#xD;
      reassurance. Clinical significant health anxiety is prevalent in primary care with 0.8-9.5%,&#xD;
      and has a lifetime prevalence of 5.7% in the general population. It is a disabling disorder,&#xD;
      associated with extensive use of health care services and occupational disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier, health anxiety has been considered a chronic disease with poor treatment outcomes. A&#xD;
      recent review found effect of both medicine and psychotherapy, but patients may prefer&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic treatments. Despite the high prevalence, health anxiety is rarely diagnosed&#xD;
      within primary care, and there is limited access to evidence-based treatment for health&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An easily accessible, evidence-based treatment is needed for this debilitating condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet-based treatment is a new approach where patients receive access to a guided&#xD;
      self-help program. A meta-analysis has shown equal treatment effects of internet-based&#xD;
      treatment compared to &quot;face-to-face&quot; treatment for depressive- and anxiety disorders.&#xD;
      Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for health anxiety has shown to be&#xD;
      cost-effective. ACT is a new effective generation of cognitive-behavioral therapy, with an&#xD;
      emphasis on acceptance and value-based exposure that has shown good results for treating&#xD;
      health anxiety in a group setting. Internet-based Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for&#xD;
      health anxiety has shown promising results but low treatment completion. This may be due to&#xD;
      the comprehensive treatment modules and the text-based format. ACT is an experiential&#xD;
      behavioral therapy, and aims to activate patients with exercises, videos, audio-files and&#xD;
      less text material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most persons with health anxiety have high health care expenditure. However, some patients&#xD;
      with health anxiety avoid contact to the health care system, and may not receive proper&#xD;
      treatment. Patient self-referral is a new approach that may facilitate access to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop an internet-delivered treatment program for patients suffering from health&#xD;
           anxiety based on ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the feasibility and effectiveness of the treatment programme in a randomized,&#xD;
           controlled trial, comparing treatment with an active control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Primary hypothesis Patients with health anxiety treated with iACT will at 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up report a significant reduction in illness worry compared to the action control&#xD;
      condition iFORUM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with health anxiety treated with iACT compared to the active control condition&#xD;
      iFORUM will at 6-month follow-up report:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a reduction in physical symptoms and symptoms of anxiety and depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. increased health-related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. more expedient illness perceptions and increased acceptance of symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mediation analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. changes in illness perception and acceptance mediate the effect of iACT&#xD;

    <description>The online discussion forum consists of 7 themes touching upon the impact of health anxiety and the patients own coping strategies. The themes are activated consecutively over a period of 12 weeks. The discussion forum is text-based, and only patients will participate in the discussion. The written discussions will be reviewed by a professional for ethical reasons. The discussion forum aims to control for the effect of attention and contacts to the health care system. After 9 months patients in the discussion forum are offered active treatment, but not as part of the research project.</description>
