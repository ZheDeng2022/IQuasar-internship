    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective before &amp; after clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of&#xD;
      double stimulations during both the follicular and luteal phases in patients with poor&#xD;
      ovarian response undergoing IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol is approved by the Ethics Committee (Institutional Review Board) of Royan&#xD;
      institute. The study is conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki for medical&#xD;
      research. All participants provide informed consent after counseling for infertility&#xD;
      treatments and routine IVF/ICSI programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients who diagnosed as poor ovarian responders (POR) based on the Bologna criteria&#xD;
      are eligible for participation in this study. In order to define the poor response in IVF, at&#xD;
      least two of the following three features must be present: (i) advanced maternal age or any&#xD;
      other risk factor for POR; (ii) a previous POR; and (iii) an abnormal ovarian reserve test&#xD;
      (ORT). Two episodes of POR after maximal stimulation are sufficient to define a patient as&#xD;
      poor responder in the absence of advanced maternal age or abnormal ORT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage one of treatment protocol First stimulation performs by Clomiphene citrate (Ovumid®,&#xD;
      Iran Hormones Company) 25 mg/day with co-treatment of Letrozole (Letrofem®, Iran Hormones&#xD;
      Company) 2.5 mg/day are given from cycle day 3 onwards. Letrozole is only given for 4 days&#xD;
      and clomiphene citrate is continuously used before the trigger day. Patients start to inject&#xD;
      human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) (Menopur®, Ferring, Switzerland) 150 IU every other day&#xD;
      beginning on cycle day 6. When one or two dominant follicles (18 mm in diameter) observed,&#xD;
      the final stage of oocyte maturation will be induced with triptorelin 100 μg (Decapeptyl®;&#xD;
      Ferring GmbH, Germany) follows by ibuprofen 600 mg (Ibuprofen-Najo® , Coated Tablets, Najo&#xD;
      Company, Iran) is used on the day of oocyte maturation triggering and the day after. After&#xD;
      the first oocyte retrieval, human menopausal gonadotrophin and letrozole are administrated to&#xD;
      stimulate follicle development, and oocyte retrieval will be carried out a second time when&#xD;
      dominant follicles have matured. All highest-quality embryos (including grade 1 and grade 2,&#xD;
      eight-cell blastomere embryos) will be cryopreserved by vitrification method on the third day&#xD;
      after oocyte retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage two of treatment protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transvaginal ultrasound evaluation performs after oocyte retrieval to determine whether to&#xD;
      continue the second ovarian stimulation. The criterion for continued stimulation is the&#xD;
      presence of at least two antral follicles 2-8 mm in diameter. A total of 225 IU HMG&#xD;
      (Menopur®, Ferring, Switzerland) and letrozole 2.5 mg (Letrofem®, Iran Hormones Company) is&#xD;
      administered daily from the day of, or the day after, oocyte retrieval. The initial second&#xD;
      stage follicular monitoring is conducted 5-7 days later, and then for follow up every 2-4&#xD;
      days, by using a transvaginal ultrasound evaluation, to record the number of developing&#xD;
      follicles. Letrozole administration is discontinued when the dominant follicles reached&#xD;
      diameters of 12 mm, given that large follicles have redundant LH and FSH receptors, and good&#xD;
      response to exogenous hormone stimulations. Daily administration of medroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      acetate 10 mg (Progestrone®, 5mg bid; Aboureihan, Iran) is added beginning on stimulation day&#xD;
      12 for cases in which post-ovulation follicle size is smaller than 14 mm in diameter and&#xD;
      stimulation needed to continue for several more days. This performs to postpone menstruation&#xD;
      and avoid oocyte retrieval during menstruation, to prevent the risk of infection from the&#xD;
      procedure. When three dominant follicles reached diameters of 18 mm or one mature dominant&#xD;
      follicle exceeded 20 mm, the final stage of oocyte maturation is induced again with&#xD;
      triptorelin 100 μg (Decapeptyl®; Ferring GmbH, Germany) by injection. Again, ibuprofen 600 mg&#xD;
      (Ibuprofen-Najo® , Coated Tablets, Najo Company, Iran) is used on the day of oocyte&#xD;
      maturation triggering and the day after. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval was&#xD;
      conducted 32-36 h after GnRH agonist administration. All retrieved oocytes were treated same&#xD;
      as in the study stage one.&#xD;

      Data collection will be performed by using questionnaire to be filled as per the available&#xD;
      records and laboratory results. The mean of total number of retrieved oocytes and embryos&#xD;
      after the present protocol were compared with the mean of total number of retrieved oocytes&#xD;
      and embryos at previous routine cycle.&#xD;
