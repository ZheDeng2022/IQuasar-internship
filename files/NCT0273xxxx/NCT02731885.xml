  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, single-center, open-label, two-treatment, food-effect, randomized study in&#xD;
      40 healthy Caucasian male subjects in order to determine the impact of the food on the&#xD;
      absorption of the ABX464.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two different treatments are the followings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A = 50mg of ABX464 (two 25mg capsules) /Fasted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B = 50mg of ABX464 (two 25mg capsules) / Fed&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 - single dose assessments, two-period, two-treatment, cross-over: 20 subjects&#xD;
           will receive a single dose of 50mg of ABX464 in fed and fasted condition, separated by a&#xD;
           wash-out period of at least 45 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - multiple dose assessments: 20 subjects will receive 50mg of ABX464 every 3&#xD;
           days during 10 days in fasted or fed condition.&#xD;
