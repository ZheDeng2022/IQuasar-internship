      The primary study aims are to determine the clinical, behavioural and social predictors of&#xD;
      SMI development in youth, and to investigate whether neuroimaging can distinguish youth who&#xD;
      will develop SMI from those who will not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's secondary aims are to examine the proportions of the cohort that make transitions&#xD;
      between the different clinical stages of risk, and to determine the proportions that have&#xD;
      poor outcomes, defined as ongoing or increased symptoms, secondary substance misuse, poor&#xD;
      social or role functioning, i.e., non-participation in education, or employment, and new&#xD;
      self-harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will study a cohort of 240 youth (aged 14-25, male and female) that includes&#xD;
      youth with early mood symptoms or sub-threshold psychotic symptoms (symptomatic group;&#xD;
      n=160), youth at risk due to a family history of a SMI (family high risk (FHR); n=40), and&#xD;
      healthy controls (HC; n=40). From this cohort, clinical, social and cognitive data, as well&#xD;
      as imaging data will be gathered to create a multi-layered &quot;snapshot&quot; of these individuals&#xD;
      and provide full-level characterization. Investigators will use the full range of clinical&#xD;
      and imaging data generated from this cohort to develop novel prediction algorithms&#xD;
      incorporating key variables that predict the development of SMI.&#xD;
