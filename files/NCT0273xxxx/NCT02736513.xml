      Patients will receive AZD9291 at a dose of 80 mg once daily. Intracranial response will be&#xD;
      assessed with brain MRI scan, systemic evaluation will be done by PET-CT (Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography-Computed Tomography) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of isolated CNS progression which may or may not be accompanied by asymptomatic&#xD;
      systemic progression, AZD9291 dose will be escalated to 160 mg once daily. For patients whose&#xD;
      intracranial disease will progress further, brain radiotherapy (in the form of SRS or WBRT)&#xD;
      will be administered; treatment with AZD9291 will be interrupted and re-initiated at a&#xD;
      standard dose after the end of radiotherapy course in the absence of symptomatic systemic&#xD;
      progression. The treatment will be continued until symptomatic systemic progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or further intracranial progression following brain radiotherapy&#xD;
      administration (whichever occurs first). All patients will be followed until death or 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

      Patients will receive AZD9291 at a dose of 80 mg once daily. Intracranial response will be&#xD;
      assessed with brain MRI scan, systemic evaluation will be done by PET-CT scan. In case of&#xD;
      isolated CNS progression which may or may not be accompanied by asymptomatic systemic&#xD;
      progression, and having in mind the blood-brain-barrier as a possible pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      resistance mechanism here, AZD9291 dose will be escalated to 160 mg once daily. For patients&#xD;
      whose intracranial disease will progress further, brain radiotherapy (in the form of SRS or&#xD;
      WBRT) will be administered; treatment with AZD9291 will be interrupted and re-initiated at a&#xD;
      standard dose after the end of radiotherapy course in the absence of symptomatic systemic&#xD;
      progression. The treatment will be continued until symptomatic systemic progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or further intracranial progression following brain radiotherapy&#xD;
      administration (whichever occurs first). All patients will be followed until death or 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracranial outcomes will be assessed by modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST) and analyzed.&#xD;
      The added value of the increased dose (160 mg) after failure of the standard dose will be&#xD;
      assessed as well. Since only neurologically asymptomatic patients are planned to be enrolled,&#xD;
      it is important to use mRECIST criteria which allows small brain lesions to be assessed&#xD;
      (according to these criteria, ≥ 5mm tumors are considered measurable and up to 5 target&#xD;
      lesions are allowed) 1. Systemic response assessment will be done using RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
      Exploratory analysis of the outcomes will be performed according to the treatment setting (&#xD;
      treatment-naïve vs. acquired resistance setting) and EGFR mutation subtype. Additionally,&#xD;
      serum protein biomarker analysis will be performed in correlation with intracranial and&#xD;
      systemic response. Safety parameters will be monitored.&#xD;
