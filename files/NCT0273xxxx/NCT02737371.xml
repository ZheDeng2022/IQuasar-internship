    <textblock>
      Double blind, placebo controlled, ascending multiple (10) oral dose, sequential group study.&#xD;
      Twenty-four subjects will complete the study in 3 cohorts (Groups A to C), each group&#xD;
      consisting of 8 subjects. Each cohort will consist of 4 male and 4 female subjects. Each&#xD;
      subject will be dosed for 10 days and will be on study for approximately 7 weeks. Each&#xD;
      subject will participate in one treatment cohort only, residing at the Clinical Research Unit&#xD;
      (CRU) from Day -1 (the day before dosing) to Day 15 (120 hours post the last dose). The dose&#xD;
      will range between 2 and 10 mg/kg daily, given as either a single daily dose or as two doses&#xD;
      divided over the 24-hour dosing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will return for a post-study visit 8 to 10 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts will be dosed at least at 3 weekly intervals. There will be a review of the safety&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetic data of each cohort prior to each dose escalation.&#xD;

      Male and female healthy subjects conforming to the selection criteria will be invited to take&#xD;
      part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit (Visit 1) After giving fully informed, written consent, subjects will attend&#xD;
      the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo screening within 28 days prior to the first dose administration. Prior&#xD;
      to the screening visit, subjects will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refrain from vigorous exercise for 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abstain from alcohol for 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will sign the consent form in the presence of a CRU physician prior to any&#xD;
           screening procedures being performed. The information recorded for all subjects,&#xD;
           regardless of their suitability for the study, will be retained and archived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information and procedures will be recorded and performed as part of the&#xD;
      screening assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethnic origin, sex, age, height, weight, and BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs: supine blood pressure, supine pulse rate, and oral body temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting 12 lead ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine drugs of abuse screen, cotinine and alcohol breath test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test, which must be negative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting clinical laboratory and serology investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All females will be asked to give the approximate date of the last menstrual period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ophthalmological assessments (Performed at a second screening visit in subjects who have&#xD;
           been shown at the first screening visit to meet eligibility criteria for the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 28 days after screening, subjects will attend the clinic. Subjects will be admitted to&#xD;
      the research unit at approximately 09:00 hours in the morning the day before dosing (Day -1).&#xD;
      Urine will be subjected to a screen for drugs of abuse and detection of any of these&#xD;
      substances which will disqualify the subject from the study. A physical examination, check of&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, clinical laboratory evaluations, pregnancy test where relevant&#xD;
      and which must be negative, oral temperature and body weight will be performed. Subjects will&#xD;
      be asked whether they have experienced any adverse events or taken any concomitant medication&#xD;
      since their previous visit. Supper will be served starting at approximately 19.30 hours and a&#xD;
      snack at approximately 21.00 hours after which they will fast overnight and until 4 hours&#xD;
      post dose. Water will be allowed ad libitum throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, the total first urine void of the morning for each subject will be collected into a&#xD;
      polyethylene container and, from this, a sample will be taken for urinalysis and pre-dose /&#xD;
      baseline F901318 concentration. Within one hour before dosing commences ( 1 hour), blood will&#xD;
      be drawn for laboratory safety assessments (haematology and clinical chemistry), and pre-dose&#xD;
      baseline F901318 and metabolites concentration. Supine and standing blood pressure and pulse&#xD;
      rate in duplicate, body temperature and a 12-lead ECG will be recorded. The subjects will&#xD;
      also be connected to continuous ECG recording from -1 hour) until at least 12 hours after the&#xD;
      start of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked whether they have experienced any adverse events overnight. Any&#xD;
      concomitant medications will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be dosed. This will be an oral suspension washed down with 250 mL of&#xD;
      phosphate buffer. Subjects will be dosed with regular intervals between each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After dosing, the following measurements and observations will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples for analysis of F901318 plasma concentration will be drawn at 15min, 30&#xD;
           min, 45min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 16 hours after dosing on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days 2 to 9, pharmacokinetic blood samples will be drawn within 15 minutes prior to&#xD;
           dosing and 2 and 4 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 10, blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be drawn within 15 minutes of&#xD;
           the commencement of dosing and 15min, 30 min, 45min,1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12,&#xD;
           24, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours following dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be analysed and reviewed before each dose escalation.&#xD;
           After the first dose level administration, the dose level and the timing of each blood&#xD;
           sample may be adjusted for the subsequent dose escalation. The basis for this decision&#xD;
           will depend upon the pharmacokinetic profiles obtained from the preceding group of&#xD;
           subjects. All changes will be documented in a file note. The number of samples or volume&#xD;
           of blood drawn must not be increased without prior approval of the relevant ethics&#xD;
           committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If it appears that Cmax may exceed the stopping criteria, the daily dose for that cohort&#xD;
           will be divided into to two halves given 6-12 hours apart with the exception of Day 10&#xD;
           on which a single morning half dose will be given. The changes will be made on the basis&#xD;
           of pharmacokinetic predictions using data obtained from previous cohorts. In that case,&#xD;
           blood and urine sampling times will be adjusted accordingly and documented in a note to&#xD;
           file. The number of blood samples drawn for pharmacokinetics will not exceed 68 without&#xD;
           approval of the relevant ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be drawn for metabolite measurements 4 and 8 hours after the morning&#xD;
           dose on Day 1 and within 15 minutes prior to and 4 and 8 hours after the dose on Day 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be collected for safety measurements (haematology and clinical chemistry) and&#xD;
           a urine sample will be obtained for urinalysis on Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 in the&#xD;
           15 minutes prior to the morning dose and 24, 48 and 72 hours after the dose on Day 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete urine collections for analysis of F901318 urine concentration will be made for&#xD;
           the following intervals in relation to dosing: 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24 hours on Day 1 and&#xD;
           0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-16, 16-24, 24-48, 48-72, 72-96 and 96-120 hours after the dose on Day&#xD;
           10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supine and standing pulse rate and blood pressure and body temperature (vital signs)&#xD;
           will be recorded 30, 60 and 120 minutes, 4, 8 and 12 hours after dosing on Day 1, prior&#xD;
           to (within 30 minutes) dosing on Days 2 - 10 and 4 hours after dosing on Days 2 - 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained 1, 4, 8, and 12 hours after dosing on Day 1 and within&#xD;
           30 minutes before and 4 hours after dosing on Days 3, 6 and 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The continuous ECG recording will cease 12 hours after dosing on Day 1. It may be&#xD;
           extended to 24 hours at the discretion of the PI. A further continuous recording will be&#xD;
           obtained from one hour prior to and for 12 hours after the dose on Day 10. It also may&#xD;
           be extended to 24 hours at the discretion of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spontaneously reported adverse events and concomitant medications will be noted&#xD;
           throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lunch will be served approximately 4 hours after each morning dose but after all the 4&#xD;
           hour observations and blood sampling have been completed and a main meal will be served&#xD;
           approximately 8 hours and a snack approximately 11.5 hours after each morning dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ophthalmological evaluation will be conducted 24 hours post Day 10 dosing (+/- 4 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pregnancy test will be performed on Day 15 in females of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may leave the Research Unit on Day 15, unless they have experienced adverse events&#xD;
      that, in the opinion of the Investigator, warrant further observation and/or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed up 8-10 days after the last dose of study drug with a&#xD;
      post-study visit.&#xD;
