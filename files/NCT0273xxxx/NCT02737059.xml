  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study was being done to study the effect of codeine and Naloxegol for 3 days&#xD;
      compared to placebo on the movement of food through the colon of healthy individuals. Codeine&#xD;
      is a commonly used pain-relieving drug that often causes constipation as an unwanted side&#xD;
      effect. Naloxegol is a medication recently approved by the FDA for treatment of constipation&#xD;
      induced by Codeine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study was that Naloxegol reduces the retardation of small bowel and&#xD;
      colonic transit induced by codeine in healthy participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase&#xD;
      I study of the effects of naloxegol, a novel mu-opioid antagonist, on gastrointestinal and&#xD;
      colonic transit in the presence or absence of the mu-opiate, codeine. There is a need to&#xD;
      develop effective medications for the treatment of opiate-induced constipation and other&#xD;
      motility disorders. Currently available opiates are complicated by addictive potential and&#xD;
      induction of troublesome constipation.&#xD;

    <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool.</description>
