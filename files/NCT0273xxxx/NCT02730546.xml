      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best way to give pembrolizumab with&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery and to see how well it works in&#xD;
      treating adult patients with gastroesophageal junction or gastric cardia cancer that has&#xD;
      spread from where it started to nearby tissue and can be removed by surgery. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting&#xD;
      certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.&#xD;
      Giving pembrolizumab, combination chemotherapy, and radiation therapy before surgery may make&#xD;
      the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab when combined with radiotherapy&#xD;
      plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in locally advanced gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)/cardia&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab when&#xD;
      combined with oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil (mFOLFOX6) (without&#xD;
      radiation) in locally advanced GEJ/cardia adenocarcinoma. (Phase Ib) (re-initiated) III. To&#xD;
      evaluate the pathological complete response (pathCR) rate of pembrolizumab when combined with&#xD;
      radiotherapy plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in locally advanced GEJ/cardia adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
      (Phase II) IV. To determine the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      when combined with mFOLFOX6 (without radiation) in locally advanced GEJ/cardia&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. (Phase II) (only if Phase Ib is re-initiated)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine progression-free survival (PFS), determine time to relapse (TTR),&#xD;
      disease-free survival (DFS), complete resection with no tumor within 1 mm of the resection&#xD;
      margins (R0) rate, and overall survival (OS) of pembrolizumab when combined with radiotherapy&#xD;
      plus carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS), pathCR rate, time to relapse (TTR),&#xD;
      disease-free survival (DFS), R0 rate, and overall survival (OS) of pembrolizumab when&#xD;
      combined with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil (FOLFOX) chemotherapy. (only if Phase&#xD;
      Ib is re-initiated)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify tissue and/or circulating biomarkers that are associated with pathCR, DFS, and&#xD;
      other clinical outcomes in patients with locally advanced GEJ/cardia adenocarcinoma treated&#xD;
      with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine differences in pre-treatment vs post-treatment tissue expression of immune&#xD;
      markers, including programmed death ligand (PDL)1 and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (cluster&#xD;
      of differentiation [CD]8+, forkhead box P3 [FOXP3]+ regulatory t cells [Tregs], CD45RO,&#xD;
      granzyme B), in patients treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify immune markers in pretreatment tissues that correlate with pathCR and&#xD;
      long-term outcome in patients treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore whether an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumor molecular profile is&#xD;
      associated with pathCR and long-term outcome in patients treated with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      pembrolizumab-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore whether a microsatellite-unstable (MSI) tumor molecular profile is associated&#xD;
      with pathCR and long-term outcome in patients treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      days -7, 15, and 36 and carboplatin IV and paclitaxel IV over 1-96 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22&#xD;
      and 29. Patients also undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days per week for 4 weeks&#xD;
      and 3 days (23 fractions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with progressive disease receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes, paclitaxel IV&#xD;
      over 1-96 hours, and carboplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2-4 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT (RE-INITIATED): Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1 and 22 and oxaliplatin IV over 2-6 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 15 minutes to 2&#xD;
      hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on days 1, 15, and 29. Treatment repeats every 21&#xD;
      days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with progressive disease receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22,&#xD;
      oxaliplatin IV over 2-6 hours, leucovorin calcium over 15 minutes to 2 hours, and&#xD;
      fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on days 1, 15, and 29. Treatment repeats every 41 days (6&#xD;
      weeks) for 1-3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGERY: Within 5-8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy or 3-6 weeks after completion&#xD;
      of chemotherapy for patients receiving chemotherapy alone, patients undergo curative-intent&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUVANT TREATMENT: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 21 days.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;
