  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to test the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of the combination&#xD;
      biotherapy regimen consisting of nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone in patients&#xD;
      with advanced but operable melanoma. Evaluation of the presence of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T&#xD;
      cells as well as that of PDL1 expression and IDO expression will be associated with clinical&#xD;
      response (pathologic and/or radiologic). The study will test the radiologic/clinical&#xD;
      preoperative response rate, recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). It will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of neoadjuvant nivolumab and neoadjuvant nivolumab-ipilimumab. Up to 66&#xD;
      patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
