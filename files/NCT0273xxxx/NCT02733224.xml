      we intend to evaluate the association between non-adherence to Lenalidomide in Multiple&#xD;
      Myeloma (MM) patients and overall response rates and time to progression (TTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence will be measured in several ways, including by electronic monitoring, which is the&#xD;
      gold standard method.&#xD;

      Study Hypothesis: We hypothesize that non-adherence to lenalidomide in MM patients is&#xD;
      associated with decreased overall response rates and shorter time to progression (TTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To evaluate the association between non-adherence to lenalidomide in MM&#xD;
      patients and the overall response rate at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: 1) To evaluate the prevalence of non-adherence to lenalidomide in MM&#xD;
      patients, and independent risk factors thereof. 2) To validate the utility of questionnaires&#xD;
      assessing adherence in identifying MM patients at risk for lenalidomide non-adherence.3) To&#xD;
      assess the association between non-adherence to lenalidomide and long-term response, measured&#xD;
      as time to progression (TTP) at 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Lenalidomide-based regimens are a key component of the armamentarium for initial&#xD;
      treatment in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. Real-life data shows CR rates that&#xD;
      are comparable to or slightly higher 1than those seen in prospective clinical trials. This&#xD;
      variable response is a result of differences in clinical settings and patient and disease&#xD;
      characteristics, but in theory, also may be due to variable adherence to lenalidomide. The&#xD;
      development of oral anticancer therapies, such as lenalidomide, represents a significant step&#xD;
      forward in oncology care by providing patients with convenient treatment of proven clinical&#xD;
      efficacy, but also presents healthcare professionals with the challenge of monitoring and&#xD;
      maintaining patients' adherence to this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-adherence may be defined, for example, as non-perfect adherence (i.e. less than 100%),&#xD;
      another cutoff with proven clinical significance, or simply as a numerical value representing&#xD;
      the percentage of medication taken, relative to that recommended. This definition, together&#xD;
      with the method used to measure adherence, can greatly influence reported rates of&#xD;
      non-adherence in any given clinical setting. Taking all these limitations into account,&#xD;
      reported rates of non-adherence to oral anti-cancer regimens across empirical studies average&#xD;
      approximately 25% 2,3.Accordingly, using pharmacy refill data, a recent retrospective study&#xD;
      demonstrated that 33% of newly diagnosed MM patients were non-adherent to lenalidomide&#xD;
      treatment (defined as adherence &lt; 80%)4. This is the only study, assessing adherence to&#xD;
      lenalidomide in MM patients, which we are aware of.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using electronic monitoring (EM), Marin et al prospectively demonstrated that poor adherence&#xD;
      to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib, in CML, adversely impacts molecular and&#xD;
      cytogenetic response 5,6.This landmark study provided proof of concept that non-adherence to&#xD;
      oral anti-cancer in hematological malignancies may be associated with poor responses and&#xD;
      decreased survival. Our study group is currently analyzing data from our prospective&#xD;
      interventional study aimed at improving adherence to TKIs in CML (NCT01768689).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of this evidence, in an era that has witnessed the advent of effective oral agents&#xD;
      for MM, understanding the prevalence, characteristics and clinical implications of&#xD;
      non-adherence to these agents is key to providing high-quality care for these patients.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, research regarding adherence to oral agents in MM (e.g. thalidomide,&#xD;
      lenalidomide, pomalidomide) is still in its infancy, and there are no data indicating whether&#xD;
      a similar association between adherence and treatment response exists in this field.&#xD;
      Moreover, there is a paucity of data regarding the prevalence of non-adherence and risk&#xD;
      factors thereof, in the above context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective multi-center observational (non-interventional) cohort study.Patients will be&#xD;
      managed routinely according to the local protocol at each center for the treatment of&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. Study period: From initiation of lenalidomide therapy for a period of 18&#xD;
      months. Setting and location: Institute of hematology, Sheba medical center and Hematology&#xD;
      Institute at the Davidoff cancer center, Rabin medical center, Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Patients diagnosed with active MM starting induction treatment with the&#xD;
      lenalidomide with or without dexamethasone, as any line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key exclusion criteria: Treatment with any additional anti-myeloma drugs, during study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics and confounders: Patient characteristics (demographics,&#xD;
      comorbidities); Disease-related characteristics (duration, myeloma stage and risk, details&#xD;
      regarding previous therapy and response, functional status, quality of life); Other drugs&#xD;
      (Number of drugs, pills and potential interactions with lenalidomide). We will use an&#xD;
      adaptation of the questionnaire from the &quot;BRIGHT&quot; study (which assesses barriers to&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medication adherence in heart transplant recipients) to assess barriers to&#xD;
      adherence in this patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of adherence: Adherence to lenalidomide treatment will be measured continuously&#xD;
      throughout the study period, by several means: 1) Electronic monitoring (EM) will be used&#xD;
      throughout the first 5 months of the study period. This is considered the gold standard for&#xD;
      measuring adherence, reflecting adherence more objectively than questionnaires and&#xD;
      pill-counting. The microelectronic monitoring system (MEMS), a specific type of EM, consists&#xD;
      of an electronic device Ô¨Åtted in the cap of a normal-looking medication bottle that&#xD;
      automatically records each time the bottle is opened. Adherence measured with this device was&#xD;
      associated with treatment response in the landmark study in CML by Marin et al. 2) Pill&#xD;
      counting for first five months. 3) Questionnaires: The physician visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (physician VAS) and an adaptation of the &quot;Basel assessment of adherence with the&#xD;
      Immunosuppressive Regimen Scale&quot; (BAASIS), will be assessed at predefined time points&#xD;
      throughout the 18 months of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measure: Response to treatment (Overall response) 4 weeks&#xD;
      after finishing five months of electronic adherence monitoring (i.e. at 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Primary analysis: Incidence of the primary outcome measure in patients with&#xD;
      electronically measured adherence of above 90% versus those below 90%, as measured for 5&#xD;
      consecutive months after study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analysis: 1) Analyze the association of each of the baseline characteristics /&#xD;
      confounders and adherence-barriers questionnaire to electronically-measured adherence and&#xD;
      look for independent risk factors for non-adherence. This will be stratified to line of&#xD;
      treatment. 2) Validation of study questionnaires compared to electronically measured&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) A long-term analysis which will look at an association between TTP at 18 months and both&#xD;
      initial adherence measure electronically (first 5 months) and long term overall adherence&#xD;
      measured by BAASIS questionnaire (18months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prior study7, the ORR (i.e. PR and better) was 68% in the Rd arm, after 4 cycles. A&#xD;
      prior study in CML showed a profound effect of adherence above 90% on optimal treatment&#xD;
      response (RR=11) 5. As no data exists regarding the effect of adherence on outcome in our&#xD;
      study population we utilized a RR which was conservative (&lt;2), relative to the data from CML.&#xD;
      We assumed an 80% ORR at 6 months in the adherent group and 45% ORR at 6 months in the&#xD;
      non-adherent group (defined by a cutoff of 90% adherence). Prior data8 suggested the&#xD;
      adherent/non-adherent ratio in patients receiving lenalidomide induction for myeloma is 7:3,&#xD;
      and we assumed a similar ratio of 2:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above data, we calculated that 43 patients in the adherent arm and 22 patients&#xD;
      in the non-adherent arm will have a power of 0.8 (with a type I error of 0.05) to reject the&#xD;
      null hypothesis that there is no difference in ORR between these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the required sample size is 67.&#xD;
