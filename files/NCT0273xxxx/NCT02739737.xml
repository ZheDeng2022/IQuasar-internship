  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No consensus exists among biomedical journals on the subject of blinding during the peer&#xD;
      review process. Some journals attempt to remove all identifiers of authorship from potential&#xD;
      manuscripts before delivering to referees for peer review while others prefer to leave the&#xD;
      authorship transparent. Although peer review remains the gold standard for manuscript&#xD;
      evaluation, the lack of a standardized blinding process between editorial offices may be a&#xD;
      source of publication bias and make comparisons of manuscripts published in different&#xD;
      journals more difficult to interpret.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proponents of a blinded peer review system believe that knowledge of authorship may leave&#xD;
      referees vulnerable to biases about those authors' previous research, perceived expertise,&#xD;
      institution, nationality, or gender. This shifts judgment away from the merits of the&#xD;
      scientific work and introduces pre-conceived notions about the identity and background of the&#xD;
      author into the review process. Conversely, supporters of transparent authorship argue that&#xD;
      knowledge of author identity makes it easier for the referee to provide more appropriate&#xD;
      critiques. Open author identification allows referees to compare the current manuscript to&#xD;
      previously published work by the author, and to recognize or identify potentially important&#xD;
      conflicts of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose an experimental study to address the question of whether&#xD;
      blinding affects the likelihood a reviewer will recommend acceptance of a study being peer&#xD;
      reviewed. The investigators plan to work in partnership with a journal to have a fabricated&#xD;
      manuscript peer reviewed by a large number of reviewers; the authors will send this &quot;test&quot;&#xD;
      manuscript out either in blinded form (authors' names/institutions not shown to reviewers) or&#xD;
      in open form, with the names of several well-known, well-regarded authors and their&#xD;
      institutions visible to peer reviewers. The manuscripts will otherwise be identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The partnering journal, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research allows both open and&#xD;
      blinded peer review, regularly employing both approaches (authors can choose what kind of&#xD;
      review they prefer when they submit to CORR), and so the reviewers are unlikely to be&#xD;
      troubled by seeing a manuscript in either format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to determine whether the identification of a manuscript&#xD;
      with a prominent group of authors (open authorship) will affect the likelihood that reviewers&#xD;
      will recommend the manuscript for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators plan to purposely place several errors in the manuscript, and&#xD;
      tally how often reviewers detect these mistakes, to determine whether reviewers read the work&#xD;
      of prominent authors less critically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also compare the reviewers' grading of the (identical) methods&#xD;
      section, to determine whether the identification of a manuscript with prominent authors&#xD;
      results in higher reviewer grades for methodological rigor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study tests the following specific hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The visibility of prominent author names and institutions on test manuscripts will be&#xD;
           associated with increased likelihood that the manuscript will be recommended for&#xD;
           publication by peer reviewers. (Primary Study Endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The visibility of prominent author names and institutions will be associated with a&#xD;
           decreased likelihood that purposefully placed &quot;errors&quot; in the experimental manuscript&#xD;
           will be detected by the reviewers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The visibility of prominent author names and institutions will be associated with&#xD;
           increased scores given by reviewers for the methods section, despite the fact that the&#xD;
           methods sections of the experimental manuscript will be identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All elements of the research protocol were approved by the University of Washington Human&#xD;
      Subjects Review Committee, including the study's opt-out design for reviewer recruitment,&#xD;
      since it was considered important that reviewers not know that the paper they evaluated was&#xD;
      part of a study. To minimize the potential for harm, the authors chose as the topic of the&#xD;
      fabricated test manuscript an intervention that could not be immediately put into practice at&#xD;
      reviewers' own centers (a particular team-training process in the operating room). In&#xD;
      addition, participating reviewers were informed which paper was the test manuscript at the&#xD;
      completion of data collection, so that they did not pursue this sort of team training based&#xD;
      on the results of the fabricated study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce the risk of an observer (Hawthorne) effect, it was important to minimize the&#xD;
      likelihood that participant reviewers would learn of the study while it was in progress. To&#xD;
      this end, the investigators elected not to pre-register the study in a trial registry.&#xD;
