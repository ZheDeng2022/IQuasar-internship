    <textblock>
      ABIFOOD study is a randomized open-labelled, phase I study to evaluate food effect in the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters of abiraterone acetate (AA) at reduced doses, versus AA in fasting&#xD;
      conditions at conventional doses, in castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients&#xD;
      who have progressed to docetaxel.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abiraterone acetate (AA) has been approved for the treatment of mCRPC after docetaxel&#xD;
      progression at doses of 1.000 mg per day taken in fasting conditions. However, it has been&#xD;
      described both the significant food-effect on bioavailability up to 5 to 10 times folder&#xD;
      increase depending on the fat content of the diet. These data come from the analysis of a&#xD;
      small number of patients in phase I studies conducted in the early stages of drug development&#xD;
      and some exploratory study in healthy subjects. There is not prospective randomized study&#xD;
      that has analyzed the real impact of the normal diet in the bioavailability of the drug (not&#xD;
      a fatty diet like has been used in initial studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the particular epidemiology of mCRPC (relatively frequent pathology), and taking into&#xD;
      account recent data which indicates positive results of AA treatment in patients who had not&#xD;
      previously received chemotherapy, a significant use of this drug is anticipated in the&#xD;
      uro-oncology community in the coming years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precise definition of dose according to the food-effect on bioavailability may be&#xD;
      critical not only from a purely medical perspective and / or pharmacological but even for its&#xD;
      socioeconomic impact in our health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study is to prove that AA administered in reduced doses with standard&#xD;
      diet presents a suitable pharmacokinetic profile which would achieve therapeutic levels in&#xD;
      blood, so that regimens lower than currently approved in association with food can be used in&#xD;
      future studies on efficacy.&#xD;
