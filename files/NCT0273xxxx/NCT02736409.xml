    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double- blind extension study of Oral Budesonide Suspension (OBS) in&#xD;
      adults and adolescents (11 to 55 years of age, inclusive) with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)&#xD;
      who have completed participation in the SHP621-301 induction study (NCT02605837). The primary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the maintenance of efficacy of OBS over 36 weeks. Maintenance of&#xD;
      efficacy will be measured by the peak eosinophilic count and Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire&#xD;
      (DSQ) score.&#xD;

    <description>Relapse (Yes/No) was defined as meeting both the eosinophil histology relapse criterion and the dysphagia symptom relapse criterion. Eosinophil histology relapse was defined as an eosinophil count of greater than or equal to(&gt; or =) 15 per high-power field (eos/hpf) from at least 2 of 3 levels of the esophagus. Dysphagia symptom relapse was defined as having at least 4 days of dysphagia (with answer 'Yes' for question 2 in DSQ [Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire]) in the 2-week period prior to the scheduled visit, as determined by the DSQ.</description>

    <description>Endoscopic findings with separate evaluations of the proximal and distal esophagus were recorded with respect to 5 categories: 1) exudates or plaques (grade 0-2); 2) fixed esophageal rings (grade 0-3); 3) edema (grade 0-2); 4) furrows (grade 0-2); and 5) strictures (grade 0-1). An endoscopy score for each category was calculated and summed for each anatomic location (proximal and distal). The minimum and maximum endoscopy score was 0 and 10 points respectively for each location (proximal and distal) and the total endoscopy score was the sum of the scores for the proximal and distal locations (maximum total score of 20 points respectively). The higher score indicated worse appearance. A negative change from baseline indicates that appearance improved.</description>

If a participant answered 'Yes', he/she advanced to Questions 3 (did you have to do anything to make the food go down or get relief) and 4 (extent to which the participant experienced pain while swallowing). DSQ + pain score was calculated by summing the scores of responses to questions 2, 3, and 4 by using following formula: DSQ + pain score= ([sum of points from questions 2+3+4 in the daily DSQ] ×14)/ Number of diaries reported with non-missing data. Scale range was 0 - 2 for question 2, 0 - 4 for question 3 and 0 - 4 for question 4, with higher values representing a worse outcome. Scale range for DSQ + pain score was 0 - 140, with higher values representing a worse outcome. A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>

        <description>Relapse (Yes/No) was defined as meeting both the eosinophil histology relapse criterion and the dysphagia symptom relapse criterion. Eosinophil histology relapse was defined as an eosinophil count of greater than or equal to(&gt; or =) 15 per high-power field (eos/hpf) from at least 2 of 3 levels of the esophagus. Dysphagia symptom relapse was defined as having at least 4 days of dysphagia (with answer 'Yes' for question 2 in DSQ [Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire]) in the 2-week period prior to the scheduled visit, as determined by the DSQ.</description>

        <description>Dysphagia symptom response with respect to the baseline of induction study (SHP621-301 [NCT02605837]) was defined as 30% reduction in DSQ combined score (questions 2+3) at Week 12 and Week 36 of current study from baseline of the induction study. DSQ contain 4 questions, all participants used a diary and responded to Q1 (did you eat solid food), Q2 (did food pass slowly or get stuck). If participant's answer to Q2 was No, then diary ended for that day. If participant answered Yes,he/she advanced to Q3 (did you have to do anything to make food go down or get relief) and Q4 (extent to which participant experienced pain while swallowing). DSQ combined score= ([sum of points from Q2+3 in daily DSQ] × 14)/Number of diaries reported with non-missing data. Scale range was 0-2 for Q2 and 0-4 for Q3. Scale range for DSQ combined score was 0-84. Higher values representing worse outcome. Negative change from baseline indicates symptoms decreased.</description>

        <description>Endoscopic findings with separate evaluations of the proximal and distal esophagus were recorded with respect to 5 categories: 1) exudates or plaques (grade 0-2); 2) fixed esophageal rings (grade 0-3); 3) edema (grade 0-2); 4) furrows (grade 0-2); and 5) strictures (grade 0-1). An endoscopy score for each category was calculated and summed for each anatomic location (proximal and distal). The minimum and maximum endoscopy score was 0 and 10 points respectively for each location (proximal and distal) and the total endoscopy score was the sum of the scores for the proximal and distal locations (maximum total score of 20 points respectively). The higher score indicated worse appearance. A negative change from baseline indicates that appearance improved.</description>

        <title>Change From Current Study (SHP621-302 [NCT02736409]) Baseline in Total Endoscopy Score at Week 12 and Week 36</title>
        <description>Endoscopic findings with separate evaluations of the proximal and distal esophagus were recorded with respect to 5 categories: 1) exudates or plaques (grade 0-2); 2) fixed esophageal rings (grade 0-3); 3) edema (grade 0-2); 4) furrows (grade 0-2); and 5) strictures (grade 0-1). An endoscopy score for each category was calculated and summed for each anatomic location (proximal and distal). The minimum and maximum endoscopy score was 0 and 10 points respectively for each location (proximal and distal) and the total endoscopy score was the sum of the scores for the proximal and distal locations (maximum total score of 20 points respectively). The higher score indicated worse appearance. A negative change from baseline indicates that appearance improved.</description>

        <description>Eight histopathologic epithelial features (basal layer hyperplasia, eosinophil peak, abscesses, surface layering, dilated intercellular spaces, surface alteration, dyskeratotic epithelial cells, lamina propria fibrosis) are scored on a 4-point scale (0=normal, 3=worst) for both the severity of the abnormality (i.e., grade) and the amount of tissue affected by the abnormality (i.e. stage). Thus each of the 3 levels had a minimum score of 0 and maximum possible score of 24, and a possible total grade or stage score of 72 for a maximum combined score of 144. Combined total score ratio (TSR) =(proximal TSR + mid TSR + distal TSR)/N, where N is the number of non missing sections for TSR. A negative change from baseline indicates that epithelial inflammation decreased.</description>

        <description>Dysphagia symptom response from the baseline of SHP621-301, was defined as &gt;or=50% reduction in DSQ combined score (questions [Q] 2+3) from baseline of the induction study at Week 12 and 36 of current study. DSQ contained 4Q, all participants used diary, and responded to Q1(did you eat solid food) and Q2(didfood passslowly or get stuck). If participant's answer to Q2 was 'No', then diary ended for that day. If a participant answered 'Yes', he/she advanced to Q3(did you have to do anything to make food go down or get relief) and 4(extent to which participant experienced pain while swallowing). DSQ combined score= ([sum of points from Q2+3 in daily DSQ]×14)/ Number of diaries reported with non-missing data. Scale range was 0-2 for Q2 and 0-4 for Q3, with higher values representing a worse outcome. Scale range for DSQ combined score was 0-84, with higher values representing a worse outcome.

          <description>Overall binary response II was defined as if participant had peak eosinophil count of &lt;=6/HPF across all esophagus levels and achieved a minimum of 30% reduction in DSQ combined score from baseline at Week 12 and Week 36. DSQ combined score= ([sum of points from questions 2+3 in the daily DSQ]×14)/ Number of diaries reported with non-missing data. Scale range was 0 - 2 for question 2 and 0 - 4 for question 3, with higher values representing a worse outcome. Scale range for DSQ combined score was 0 - 84, with higher values representing a worse outcome. A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>

        <title>Change in the DSQ + Pain Score (Questions 2+3+4) From Induction Study (SHP621-301 [NCT02605837]) Baseline at Week 36 of Current Study</title>
        <description>DSQ contained 4 questions, all participants used a diary, and responded to Questions 1 (did you eat solid food) and 2 (did food pass slowly or get stuck). If the participant's answer to Question 2 was 'No', the diary ended for that day. If a participant answered 'Yes', he/she advanced to Questions 3 (did you have to do anything to make the food go down or get relief) and 4 (extent to which the participant experienced pain while swallowing). DSQ + pain score was calculated by summing the scores of responses to questions 2, 3, and 4 by using following formula: DSQ + pain score= ([sum of points from questions 2+3+4 in the daily DSQ] ×14)/ Number of diaries reported with non-missing data. Scale range was 0 - 2 for question 2, 0 - 4 for question 3 and 0 - 4 for question 4, with higher values representing a worse outcome. Scale range for DSQ + pain score was 0 - 140, with higher values representing a worse outcome. A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>

        <title>Change in the DSQ Pain Score (Question 4) From Current Study (SHP621-302 [NCT02736409]) Baseline at Week 36</title>
        <description>DSQ contained 4 questions, all participants used a diary, and responded to Questions 1 (did you eat solid food) and 2 (did food pass slowly or get stuck). If the participant's answer to Question 2 was 'No', the diary ended for that day. If a participant answered 'Yes', he/she advanced to Questions 3 (did you have to do anything to make the food go down or get relief) and 4 (extent to which the participant experienced pain while swallowing). DSQ pain score was calculated by summing the scores of responses to Question 4 only. DSQ pain score=(sum of points from questions 4 in the daily DSQ)*14 days/Number of diaries reported with non-missing data. Scale range was 0 - 4 for question 4, with higher values representing a worse outcome. Scale range for DSQ pain score was 0 - 56, with higher values representing a worse outcome. A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>

        <description>The sites for DXA measurement were the lumber spine (L1-L4 preferred) and total body less head. DXA scans for bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition measurements were done only for adolescent participants aged 11-17 years based on the age group in the SHP621-301 study and were completed throughout the SHP621-302 study even if participants turned 18 years. Baseline of SHP621-301 is determined at Week 0 in the SHP621-301 study. Here in this outcome measure DXA measurement of L1-L4 were reported. Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from a reference population in the same age range and with the same sex. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean.</description>

        <title>Change in DXA Imaging Results (Location: Whole Body) From Baseline of Induction Study (SHP621-301 [NCT02605837]) at Week 36 of Current Study</title>
        <description>The sites for DXA measurement were the lumber spine (L1-L4 preferred) and total body less head. DXA scans for bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition measurements were done only for adolescent participants aged 11-17 years based on the age group in the SHP621-301 study and were completed throughout the SHP621-302 study even if participants turned 18 years. Baseline of SHP621-301 is determined at Week 0 in the SHP621-301 study. Here in this outcome measure DXA measurement of whole body (except head) were reported. Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from a reference population in the same age range and with the same sex. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean.</description>
