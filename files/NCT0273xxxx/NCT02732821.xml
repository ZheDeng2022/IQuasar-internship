    <textblock>
      This study is performed to assess the efficacy and outcomes of Gastric Per Oral Endoscopic&#xD;
      Myotomy &quot;G-POEM&quot; in patients presenting with gastroparesis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis is a chronic digestive disorder best defined as severe nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      bloating, and abdominal pain in the setting of objectively delayed gastric emptying without&#xD;
      mechanical gastric outlet obstruction. The most common etiology is idiopathic. Some of the&#xD;
      identifiable etiologies include diabetes and post-surgical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic techniques to reduce pyloric tone mainly consisted of Botulinum toxin injection&#xD;
      but failed to demonstrate significant symptom improvement compared to placebo. Another&#xD;
      endoscopic method was transpyloric stenting which yielded symptomatic relief but is prone to&#xD;
      stent migration and therefore is unlikely to provide a viable long term solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical pyloroplasty has shown to be effective in reducing gastroparesis symptoms, but is&#xD;
      associated with a risk of leakage and potential further narrowing of gastric outlet. It also&#xD;
      carried all the risks of general anesthesia and requires advanced laparoscopic suturing&#xD;
      skills. Therefore, the development of a less invasive reliable method of improving gastric&#xD;
      emptying is highly desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An endoscopic submucosal myotomy technique may be applied to divide the pyloric sphincter&#xD;
      without surgical access. Such endoscopic technique may provide the benefits of a natural&#xD;
      orifice procedure, and improve gastric emptying in gastroparetic patients. Gastric Per-Oral&#xD;
      Endoscopic Myotomy (G-POEM) is feasible and can be performed by using techniques similar to&#xD;
      those of esophageal per-oral endoscopic myotomy. Endoscopists who are experienced in&#xD;
      esophageal per-oral endoscopic myotomy should be able to perform G-POEM because both use&#xD;
      similar techniques, principles, and equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators theorize that a subset of patients with refractory gastroparesis, diabetic&#xD;
      gastroparesis or post-surgical gastroparesis, may respond to endoscopic pyloromyotomy.&#xD;

    <description>Improvement in patients symptoms as evaluated by the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.&#xD;
The GCSI consists of three sub-scales: nausea/vomiting (three items), post-prandial fullness/early satiety (four items) and bloating (two items). Each item is rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (none) to 5 (very severe). Subscales are the average of different sets of items and are reported as a number between 0 to 5.&#xD;
Efficacy will be defined as a decrease in the GCSI score average below 2.</description>

    <description>Improvement in patients symptoms will be assessed using symptom severity score at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.&#xD;
Symptoms will be recorded with a standardized gastroesophageal symptom assessment tool using a scale of 0-4 with higher ordinal values representing the greater frequency of symptoms for nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) symptoms.</description>

    <description>Improvement in patient's quality of life as reflected by Short Form 36 questionnaire at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after the procedure.&#xD;
The SF-36 general health questionnaire consists of 36 questions evaluating the patient's perception of their quality of life (QoL) in the following eight subscales: physical functioning (PF), role limitations due to physical problems (RP), role limitations due to emotional problems (RE), energy/fatigue (EF), emotional well-being (EW), social functioning (SF), bodily pain (BP) and general health (GH). Subscale scores range from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best and 0 being the worst quality of life.</description>

    <description>Improvement in patients symptoms as evaluated by gastroparesis specific symptom assessment (PAGI-SYM questionnaire).&#xD;
PAGI-SYM is a 20-item self-reported questionnaire which evaluates the symptom severity of upper gastrointestinal disorders across six subscales (nausea/vomiting, fullness/early satiety, bloating, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain and heartburn/regurgitation). These are summarized by individual subscale scores and a total score. Each item is rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (none) to 5 (very severe). Subscales are the average of different sets of items and are reported as a number between 0 to 5.</description>
