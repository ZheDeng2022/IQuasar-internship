  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIa, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded superiority treatment&#xD;
      study in males and non-pregnant females, 18 to 65 years of age who are in good health. This&#xD;
      study is designed to compare placebo to once daily doses of 6mg auranofin for adults with&#xD;
      amebiasis or giardiasis. A sample size of 68 subjects enrolled with amebiasis (34 per arm)&#xD;
      and 68 with giardiasis (34 per arm); Power based on 60 subjects with amebiasis and 60 with&#xD;
      giardiasis completing the study.Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment&#xD;
      group with auranofin (6 mg orally once daily for 5 days for giardiasis or 7 days for&#xD;
      amebiasis) compared to a placebo group receiving similar but not identical placebo capsules.&#xD;
      Projected duration of subject participation will be approximately 30 days of face to face&#xD;
      visits, including the pre-enrollment screening period of up to 4 days. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      it will take approximately 3.5 years to finish the study. Primary objectives are: 1) to&#xD;
      compare the proportion of subjects with stools positive by rapid Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) and&#xD;
      positive antigen detection EIA for E. histolytica at enrollment with resolution of diarrhea&#xD;
      (less than 3 loose stools/24 hrs) by Day 7 for E. histolytica infections. 2) to compare the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects with stools positive by rapid EIA and positive antigen detection EIA&#xD;
      for Giardia at enrollment with resolution of diarrhea (less than 3 loose stools/24 hrs) by&#xD;
      Day 5 for Giardia infections.&#xD;

      vs. subsequent strain; 7) to compare the time to resolution of diarrhea (less than 3 loose&#xD;
      stools/24 hours). Secondary objectives for Giardia infections are: 1) to compare the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects with parasitological response (no detection of trophozoites on&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all&#xD;
             study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or non-pregnant non-lactating females 18-65 years of age, inclusive. Females of&#xD;
             reproductive potential currently using effective contraceptive methods are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Amebiasis or giardiasis identified by rapid Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) and positive&#xD;
             antigen detection EIA of stool&#xD;
&#xD;
             - if a subject is infected with both E. histolytica and Giardia, they will be enrolled&#xD;
             in the E. histolytica study arm. Once the Entamoeba study arm is fully enrolled, any&#xD;
             subsequent dual infected subjects will be enrolled in the Giardia arm. If a subject is&#xD;
             infected with both Giardia and Cryptosporidium, they will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has diarrhea (defined as three or more loose stools) in the past 24 hrs, but is&#xD;
             assessed to be clinically stable and in otherwise good health&#xD;
&#xD;
             - as determined by medical history and targeted physical examination, if indicated&#xD;
             based on medical history, to evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical&#xD;
             diagnoses or conditions that would affect the assessment of eligibility and safety of&#xD;
             subjects. Existing medical diagnoses or conditions (except those in the Subject&#xD;
             Exclusion Criteria) must be deemed as stable chronic medical conditions. A stable&#xD;
             chronic medical condition is defined as no change in prescription medication, dose, or&#xD;
             frequency of medication in the last 3 months (90 days) and health outcomes of the&#xD;
             specific disease are considered to be within acceptable limits in the last 6 months&#xD;
             (180 days). Any change due to change of health care provider, insurance company, or&#xD;
             that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will&#xD;
             not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription&#xD;
             medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site&#xD;
             principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a&#xD;
             violation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn)&#xD;
             medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate&#xD;
             sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety. Topical, nasal, and&#xD;
             inhaled medications, vitamins, and contraceptives are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Vital signs (oral temperature, pulse, and blood pressure) are all within normal&#xD;
             protocol-defined ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Laboratory tests (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate transaminase (AST),&#xD;
             alanine transaminase (ALT), white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin) are all&#xD;
             within protocol-defined ranges. Subjects will be eligible for enrollment with the&#xD;
             following laboratory values: blood urea nitrogen less than or equal to 30 mg/dL,&#xD;
             creatinine less than or equal to 133 umol/L, AST or ALT less than or equal to 70.0&#xD;
             U/L, white cell count between 3.5 and 13.0 inclusive (10^9/L), platelets between 131&#xD;
             and 550 (10^9/L), hemoglobin between 11.0 and 18.0 gm/dL inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Urinalysis with no greater than trace protein. If a high protein is confirmed to be&#xD;
             due to menstruation, it should be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of reproductive potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 72&#xD;
             hours of starting study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Female subjects who are surgically sterile via tubal sterilization, bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy or hysterectomy who have been postmenopausal for greater than 1 year are&#xD;
             not considered to be of reproductive potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Female subjects participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must be&#xD;
             using and continue to use highly effective contraception for a total of 4 months after&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Highly effective methods of contraception are defined as having low failure rates&#xD;
                  (i.e. less than 1 percent per year) when used consistently and correctly and may&#xD;
                  include, but are not limited to, abstinence from intercourse, monogamous&#xD;
                  relationship with a vasectomized partner, male condoms with spermicide, diaphragm&#xD;
                  with spermicide, intrauterine devices, and licensed hormonal methods. Females on&#xD;
                  effective forms of birth control will continue while on the study and for the&#xD;
                  follow-up period of 4 months total. The method and compliance of birth control&#xD;
                  used will be confirmed and documented at all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known intolerance of auranofin or gold compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women of reproductive potential not using effective&#xD;
             contraception or who plan to become pregnant or breastfeed at any given time during&#xD;
             the study or within 3 months of study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of metronidazole within the past 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the&#xD;
             subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the&#xD;
             requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Concurrent participation in other investigational protocols or receipt of an&#xD;
             investigational product within the previous 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of alcohol or drug abuse within the last five years.&#xD;
