    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study is&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy of letrozole-palbociclib combination against letrozole-placebo&#xD;
      combination in women with ER+ advanced or relapsed endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are stratified according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of prior lines of therapy (primary advanced disease vs. 1st relapse vs. ≥2&#xD;
           relapses)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurable vs. evaluable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prior use of MPA/Megace&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization 1:1 randomization The patients with prior MPA/Megace treatment will be capped&#xD;
      to a maximum of 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to one of the two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: (comparator) letrozole-placebo combination therapy until progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: (experimental arm): Letrozole- palbociclib combination therapy until progression&#xD;
