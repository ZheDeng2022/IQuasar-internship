  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent years, women with infertility have become more and more and thus assisted reproductive&#xD;
      technology has been applied in a broad range. And the quantities of twin pregnancies are&#xD;
      larger and larger. However, complicated twin pregnancy subsequently increased including&#xD;
      selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR), twin growth discordance, twin transfusion&#xD;
      syndrome (TTTS) and intrauterine fetal death (IUFD). The occurrence of complicated twin&#xD;
      pregnancy has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in twin and mother.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, twin pregnancy, especially monochorionic type has suffered from higher rate of&#xD;
      chromosomal anomalies and structural anomalies. Therefore, it is important that more&#xD;
      attention should be paid to the prediction, clinical evaluation and the occurrence of&#xD;
      chromosomal anomalies and structural anomalies in complicated twin pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, prenatal ultrasound has been acknowledged as the best method for prenatal diagnosis&#xD;
      and evaluation in twin pregnancy. By means of the application of prenatal ultrasound, the&#xD;
      detection of fetal chromosome, and secondary correlation analysis, the investigators try to&#xD;
      build prenatal ultrasound monitoring system of twin pregnancy and provide evidences for the&#xD;
      choice of intervention and delivery time, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
      twin and improve perinatal short and long outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are as below: (1) primary goal: the prediction of complicated twin&#xD;
      pregnancy by using prenatal ultrasound; (2) primary goal: the clinical evaluation of&#xD;
      perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancy by using prenatal ultrasound; (3) secondary goal: the&#xD;
      analysis of the correlation between prenatal ultrasound and fetal anomalies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an observational prospective cohort study. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      complicated twin pregnancy (sIUGR, TTTS, IUFD, twin growth discordance). The main exposed&#xD;
      factors are discordance of crown-rump length more than 20%, discordance of nuchal&#xD;
      translucency more than 20%, either of twin with abnormal amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios or&#xD;
      oligoamnios), either of twin with abnormal umbilical artery flow (elevated resistance index,&#xD;
      absent or reverse diastolic flow), either of twin with abnormal middle cerebral artery flow&#xD;
      (more than 1.5Mom), either of twin with abnormal ductus venous flow (absent or reverse&#xD;
      a-wave). Meanwhile, some demographic data are to be collected and confounding factors are to&#xD;
      be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with twin pregnancy who are examined in the department are enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      Ultrasound will be done in 11-13+6 weeks, 16-18 weeks, 22-24 weeks, 30-32 weeks and 37-39&#xD;
      weeks, and perinatal outcomes are to be collected, including the diagnosis of complicated&#xD;
      twin pregnancy, when it happens, ultrasound indices, delivery mode, delivery time, birth&#xD;
      weight, neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When there are indications for the detection of fetal chromosome, women are probably advised&#xD;
      to have this examination, such as non-invasive DNA, amniocentesis, umbilical cord screening,&#xD;
      as appropriate, and written informed consent will be achieved from every patient.&#xD;
