      Objectives: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) therapy may cause a measureable change in bacterial&#xD;
      species of the gut. The primary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether a measureable change in bacterial species representation follows the&#xD;
           institution of DMF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether a specific pattern of change in the microbiota phylotype with DMF&#xD;
           therapy correlates to onset and severity of gastrointestinal disturbances (heartburn,&#xD;
           nausea, flatulence, and diarrhea).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine whether any instability of microbiota phylotype representation persists&#xD;
           following the institution of DMF or whether stabilization relates to resolution of&#xD;
           gastrointestinal disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine whether there is a correlation between a pre-existing functional bowel&#xD;
           disorder and development or severity of gastrointestinal disturbances and of peripheral&#xD;
           eosinophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Double-blinded, prospective, single-center pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: Individuals 18 years or older, with a confirmed diagnosis of a relapsing&#xD;
      form of multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Groups: This study will be an open-label prospective study design with respect to&#xD;
      MS immunomodulatory therapy choice. Study group will be defined as subjects with a relapsing&#xD;
      form of multiple sclerosis, as defined by the McDonald criteria, choosing to begin DMF&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label prospective study design with respect to MS immunomodulatory&#xD;
      therapy choice. Study group will be defined as subjects with a relapsing form of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis as defined by the McDonald criteria choosing to begin dimethyl fumarate (DMF)&#xD;
      therapy. Blinding of the principal investigator and study subject to microbiota analysis&#xD;
      results will be maintained until the planned end of study. Subjects who receive at least one&#xD;
      dose of DMF and subsequently discontinue therapy will be invited to complete the study on&#xD;
      alternative immunomodulatory therapy or no therapy. Data from subjects who have received at&#xD;
      least one dose of DMF and who withdraw early from the study will be included in analysis as&#xD;
      last visit carried forward. A goal has been set to enroll 25 subjects for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut microbiota will be characterized using a commercial service, Second Genome, utilizing&#xD;
      bacterial DNA extraction from stool samples and 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplification,&#xD;
      followed by high-throughput sequencing. Taxonomic profiling on the Illumina MiSeq system is&#xD;
      cycled to generate paired 250-bp reads in Second Genome's protocols. These longer read&#xD;
      lengths provide high-quality full length-reads of the gene to ensure the most accurate&#xD;
      classification available through sequencing technologies. Next generation sequencing has&#xD;
      emerged as a powerful tool for investigating microbial communities in large sample sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial stool samples will be collected from each subject, and sent to Second Genome for&#xD;
      analysis. The first stool sample will be collected prior to the initial dose of DMF, with&#xD;
      subsequent collections at defined time points over the course of the study. A more intensive&#xD;
      analysis will focus on the first 12 weeks of treatment, a time during which development and&#xD;
      resolution of gastrointestinal side effects typically take place on therapy.&#xD;
      Treatment-emergent flushing severity will be recorded during this time using a 5-point Likert&#xD;
      scale flushing severity survey. Gastrointestinal (G.I.) symptoms will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire, a validated, self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire that includes 15 questions, which assess severity of G.I. symptoms using a&#xD;
      7-point Likert scale in five domains: indigestion, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain and&#xD;
      reflux. The severity of symptoms reported in the GSRS increases with increasing score. Other&#xD;
      variables which potentially may alter the gastrointestinal microbiota and secondarily DMF&#xD;
      tolerance will be assessed, including the identification of subjects predisposed to&#xD;
      functional bowel disorders via use of the Rome III functional bowel survey, a validated&#xD;
      clinical tool to identify at-risk individuals, diet composition, antibiotic exposure, steroid&#xD;
      treatments for neurological relapses, use of prebiotic , probiotic, or vitamin D supplements,&#xD;
      and H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, as gut pH changes impact the gut flora&#xD;
      composition.Additional data on mood change over 24 weeks of DMF therapy, using the Hamilton&#xD;
      Anxiety Measurement (HAM) Rating Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Depression&#xD;
      Scale, will be collected and correlated to DMF-emergent G.I. disturbances, and to changes in&#xD;
      bacterial and archaeal species in the gut flora.&#xD;
