  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been few published studies that examine the efficacy and safety of endovascular&#xD;
      treatments on patients with pulsatile tinnitus with venous stenosis. Despite the limited&#xD;
      experience with venous sinus stenting to treat pulsatile tinnitus, preliminary results show&#xD;
      that venous sinus stenting could represent a viable alternative for refractory pulsatile&#xD;
      tinnitus patients with venous sinus stenosis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of this procedure in a controlled fashion, using strict inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, and long-term clinical and imaging follow-up. The investigators hope to&#xD;
      provide robust data regarding the safety and efficacy of venous sinus stenting for patients&#xD;
      with pulsatile tinnitus.&#xD;

      WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Screening process - not experimental:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pulsatile tinnitus, evidence of narrowing of the large veins of the brain, and&#xD;
      failure of prior conservative treatment will be considered for enrollment. All patients will&#xD;
      undergo the standard of care evaluation for tinnitus by a specialist physician for diseases&#xD;
      of the ear (Ear, Nose and Throat [ENT] physician or otorhinolaryngologist). If it is&#xD;
      determined that the narrowing of the large veins of the brain (&quot;dural venous sinuses&quot;) is the&#xD;
      most likely etiology for the tinnitus, then the possibility of enrollment in the trial will&#xD;
      be discussed. Imaging studies of the head and temporal bone will be performed in order to&#xD;
      further confirm venous sinus stenosis as the etiology of the pulsatile tinnitus and to rule&#xD;
      out other possible causes. Additionally, patients will answer the questions listed on the&#xD;
      Tinnitus Handicap Inventory questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening process, investigators will review the results of tests that are not&#xD;
      experimental and are performed as part of participants' routine care. In other words, these&#xD;
      tests are performed regardless of participation in the study and are termed &quot;standard&#xD;
      procedures&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Participating in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating in the trial means that the participants will undergo an experimental procedure&#xD;
      called &quot;venous sinus stenting&quot; to open up the narrowing in the vein that is causing the&#xD;
      tinnitus. This procedure requires taking two blood thinners called aspirin and Plavix. Both&#xD;
      blood thinners will be initiated 1 week prior to the procedure and continued for 1 month&#xD;
      after the procedure. At that time the Plavix will be stopped and aspirin will be continued&#xD;
      for 11 more months (total of 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Direct Retrograde Cerebral Venography (DRCV) and Manometry: A DRCV is a non-experimental&#xD;
      procedure to look at the veins of the brain. This procedure is done by inserting a catheter&#xD;
      (soft plastic tube) through a vein in the groin (upper leg) and guide it though the veins all&#xD;
      the way to the neck. It is done under local anesthetic and moderate sedation. After placing&#xD;
      the catheter in the neck, a special dye (contrast) is injected through this catheter into the&#xD;
      veins, while X-ray cameras take multiple pictures of the veins. Then, a smaller catheter is&#xD;
      further advanced to the area of narrowing and by this catheter investigators will measure the&#xD;
      blood pressure at that point. This helps us to identify the severity of the narrowing. If the&#xD;
      pressure before and after the narrowing is significantly different, then the investigators&#xD;
      will continue with the placement of the stent in order to reopen the narrowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Venous Sinus Stenting (experimental): Venous sinus stenting is the experimental procedure&#xD;
      being tested in this protocol and consists of placing a stent into the narrowed veins of the&#xD;
      brain. The participants will be placed under general anesthesia because it is important to&#xD;
      not move at all during the procedure. A catheter will be inserted through the upper part of&#xD;
      the leg (groin area) and guided through the veins all the way to neck. Then, a balloon will&#xD;
      be advanced through the catheter and positioned across the stenosis. The balloon will be&#xD;
      carefully inflated for a few seconds. This process is called angioplasty and will partially&#xD;
      re-open the narrowing, making placement of the stent easier. The balloon will be removed and&#xD;
      then the stent will be advanced through the catheter in neck across the stenosis and&#xD;
      carefully deployed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Post-procedure Care: After the procedure, participants will stay in the intensive care unit&#xD;
      for 24 hours for observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Follow-up period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no experimental procedure or test during the follow-up period. The following&#xD;
      office visits and standard tests will be performed to evaluate the effects of the study&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Office visits: Office visits and neurological evaluation will be performed at 1, 6, 12, and&#xD;
      24 months after study intervention. At this time, participants will also fill the Tinnitus&#xD;
      Handicap Inventory Questionnaire. The visits will be about 45 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Audiometric assessment: An audiometric assessment will be performed at 3 months after the&#xD;
      stenting procedure in order to assess inner ear function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Non-invasive imaging studies: Magnetic Resonance Venogram (MRV) is a special Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan with injection of a dye through a vein in the arm that will&#xD;
      allow investigators to check whether the stent is still open without new narrowing. It will&#xD;
      be performed 12 months after the venous sinus stenting procedure. If there is clinical&#xD;
      concern about stent patency, an expedited or intermediate MRV will be performed. If MRV is&#xD;
      contraindicated, Computed Tomographic Venogram (CTV) will be performed instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of the study, the participants need to take antiplatelet drugs (&quot;blood&#xD;
      thinners&quot;) that are necessary to prevent formation of clot in the stent. This is a standard&#xD;
      precaution for every stent procedure. The participants will take two drugs (called aspirin&#xD;
      and Plavix) for 1 month and then aspirin alone for 11 more months (total time on aspirin is&#xD;
      12 months). It is essential that the drugs are taken every day as prescribed. As these drugs&#xD;
      are dangerous during pregnancy, if the participant is a woman of childbearing age, then&#xD;
      should discuss this issue with her physician, and avoid becoming pregnant during the 12&#xD;
      months that these drugs are needed.&#xD;
