    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well obinutuzumab works in combination with ibrutinib in&#xD;
      treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma that has returned (relapsed) or that does not&#xD;
      respond to treatment (refractory). Obinutuzumab binds to a protein called cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation (CD)20, which is found on B cells and some types of leukemia and lymphoma&#xD;
      cells and help the immune system kill cancer cells. Ibrutinib blocks a protein called&#xD;
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), which may help keep cancer cells from growing. Giving&#xD;
      obinutuzumab in combination with ibrutinib may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Best overall response of complete response/partial response (CR/PR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Toxicity defined as any adverse event (AE) grade 3 and higher. II. Progression free&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Gene expression profiling using Lymph5Cx test. II. Sequencing using the ion torrent&#xD;
      platform (76 gene panel for known mutations in lymphoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Sequencing of BTK and phospholipase-C gamma (PLC) to evaluate for mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Minimal residual disease testing (MRD by flow cytometry and targeted sequencing post&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of&#xD;
      cycle 1, and day 1 of cycles 2-6. Patients also receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD)&#xD;
      on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving partial response (PR) continue to&#xD;
      receive obinutuzumab IV every 2 months and ibrutinib PO QD for up to 2 years in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
