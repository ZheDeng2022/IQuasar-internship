  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks the activity of kinases involved in&#xD;
      angiogenesis (VEGFR 1,2,3 and TEK), oncogenesis (KIT, Ret Proto-Oncogene (RET), Raf-1&#xD;
      Proto-Oncogene, Serine/Threonine Kinase (RAF1) and BRAF) and tumour growth (PDGFR and FGFR).&#xD;
      Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines frequently express high levels of vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and in vivo preclinical studies evaluating Regorafenib have&#xD;
      shown promising activity in ovarian cancer. In the clinic, anti-angiogenesis therapy with&#xD;
      bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody to VEGF) has already emerged as an important cornerstone&#xD;
      in the management of ovarian cancer both as part of frontline adjuvant treatment and as&#xD;
      second-line therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrent disease. Whilst Regorafenib has been FDA&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed&#xD;
      prior bevacizumab, it's role in the management of ovarian cancer remains to be defined.&#xD;
