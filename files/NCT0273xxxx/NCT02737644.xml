  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a nested case-control study and the purpose is to describe the status of key&#xD;
      nutrients(eg.folic acid and vitamins) supplementation among pregnant women in Shanghai, to&#xD;
      find out the association between the level of serum key nutrients during peri-conceptional&#xD;
      period and the incidence of congenital heart defects (CHD) in newborn, and to provide better&#xD;
      preconception care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Congenital heart defects (CHD) are among the most common major congenital anomalies with an&#xD;
      incidence of about 8-12/1,000 live births worldwide. The mechanism of CHD is still unclear.&#xD;
      Many studies indicated that the level of key nutrients (eg.folic acid and vitamins) during&#xD;
      peri-conceptional period might affect the incidence of CHD, but the evidence is limited. The&#xD;
      study aimed to explore the association between serum key nutrients during peri-conceptional&#xD;
      period and the incidence of CHD in newborn. All couples attending pre-pregnancy physical&#xD;
      examination from 11 districts (Minhang District, Huangpu District, Xuhui District, Changning&#xD;
      District, Jingan District, Putuo District, Yangpu District, Jiading District, Pudong&#xD;
      District，Songjiang District, Qingpu District) in Shanghai from March 2016, are recruited and&#xD;
      their blood samples and questionnaires about the supplementation of key nutrients are&#xD;
      collected. During the gestation, venous blood of pregnant women at all of three trimesters is&#xD;
      taken. Besides, questionnaires about the supplementation of key nutrients at the first&#xD;
      antenatal visit are also obtained. The level of serum folic acid, vitamin A and vitamin B12&#xD;
      at preconception and during gestation are measured. Finally, investigators identifies those&#xD;
      whose newborns developed CHD during follow-up as the cases. Then, investigators selects four&#xD;
      controls for each case from the rest of the cohort by matching on constitutional determinants&#xD;
      of CHD such as age and sex. Participants are identified by national identification number&#xD;
      during the follow up. The level of serum key nutrients is compared in cases and controls.&#xD;
      Univariate and multivariate association analyses will be performed to identify risk factors&#xD;
      to CHD by using multivariate logistic regression model.&#xD;
