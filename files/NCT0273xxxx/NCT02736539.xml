      This study is designed as a randomized double-blinded treatment trial among travelers' to&#xD;
      geographical areas with moderate-severe rates of traveler's diarrhea. Travelers will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive CBS 2004 or masked placebo to be taken daily while traveling. The test&#xD;
      article or placebo will be taken starting 7 days prior to travel.&#xD;

          9. Subject has a concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with or for which&#xD;
             treatment could interfere with the conduct of the study, or could in the opinion of&#xD;
