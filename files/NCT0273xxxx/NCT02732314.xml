  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 13 week randomized, double blind, parallel group, in home use study among&#xD;
      approximately 60 male and female subjects, ages 12 to 65 years old inclusive, with atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis (AD) SCORAD &gt;16. Treatment group assignments will be balanced by disease severity,&#xD;
      age, and body location of AD lesions. The study will consist of a 1 week washout phase and 12&#xD;
      week treatment phase. During the washout phase, subjects will be provided with a bar soap for&#xD;
      bathing and showering and must refrain from using any other products on their body (excluding&#xD;
      the face) including topical corticosteroids, ointments, lotions, sunscreens, etc. During the&#xD;
      treatment phase, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 test legs. Throughout the treatment&#xD;
      phase, the subjects will be required to use only the provided bar soap for bathing and&#xD;
      showering and will apply their test product twice per day, once in the morning and once in&#xD;
      the evening. No additional creams, moisturizers, lotions or cleansers other than those&#xD;
      provided will be permitted for the duration of the study. Normal facial or hair care products&#xD;
      are permitted, however, they must not contain anti-bacterial ingredients (e.g. antidandruff&#xD;
      shampoo, acne products, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCORAD, EASI and PGA will incorporate whole body assessments. However, at the Baseline visit,&#xD;
      subjects will have an active inflammatory lesion site and adjacent non-lesion,&#xD;
      non-inflammatory site identified and marked for all instrumental and biopsy evaluations at&#xD;
      Baseline and subsequent visits. Instrumental evaluations, imaging, expert visual grading and&#xD;
      self-assessments will be performed throughout the study. Tolerability will be evaluated by&#xD;
      incidence of AE's (defined per CTCAE), exacerbation of AD lesions, application site&#xD;
      reactions/infections, and lab evaluations throughout the study. There will be additional&#xD;
      consumption and compliance checks as well as dermatologic evaluations to ensure the subject's&#xD;
      condition does not become extensively worse at each visit. A subset of subjects will have 2mm&#xD;
      punch biopsies collected from the designated lesion and non-lesion sites at 3 time points&#xD;
      throughout the study. The subset of subjects will be determined by subject willingness to&#xD;
      participate in the biopsy portion as well as dermatologic evaluation and determination of&#xD;
      biopsy candidacy.&#xD;
