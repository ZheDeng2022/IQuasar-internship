  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-centre, non-randomized study to investigate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of GSK3191607, administered as a single intravenous (IV) dose in healthy&#xD;
      male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six subjects will be administered an IV microdose of radio-labeled [14C]-GSK3191607. The&#xD;
      study will provide an early readout on human pharmacokinetic parameters. The results of this&#xD;
      study will be used to estimate the potential duration of anti-parasite effect in humans,&#xD;
      define predicted clinical oral doses, and hence inform about the compound's potential safety&#xD;
      margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in the study for up to 8 weeks, and will have a screening&#xD;
      visit, one treatment period, eight outpatient visits, and a follow-up visit.&#xD;
