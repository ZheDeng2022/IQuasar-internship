  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a complex and chronic eye disease which damages the optic nerve. One of the main&#xD;
      risk factors for the progression of glaucoma is IOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to examine if Salovum, an anti-secretory factor (AF), can reduce the&#xD;
      level of the intraocular pressure (IOP) in the eye of patients affected by glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-secretory factor (AF) is an endogenous protein which controls the transport of water and&#xD;
      ions across the cell membrane. AF plays an important part in the immune system and has an&#xD;
      anti-secretory and anti-inflammatory effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that Salovum can restore a normal salt-water balance in the&#xD;
      eye, which in turn would lower the IOP. This would eliminate or reduce the risk of subsequent&#xD;
      visual impairments/neurological damage.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to examine if Salovum, an anti-secretory factor (AF), can reduce the&#xD;
      level of the intraocular pressure (IOP) in the eye of patients affected by glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma is a complex and chronic eye disease which damages the optic nerve. Beginning at the&#xD;
      periphery of the vision field, it often progresses very slowly, which means that the patients&#xD;
      consult a doctor only when damages have become very large. Glaucoma requires a lifelong&#xD;
      medical treatment. Regardless of the medical treatment, damaged nerve fibers will never&#xD;
      regenerate. An early onset of the medical treatment is crucial to avoid the progression of&#xD;
      the disease which, if not treated, would also affect the central vision, resulting in&#xD;
      patients with severe handicap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main risk factors for glaucoma is elevated IOP and treatment is aimed to reduce&#xD;
      its progression by IOP lowering. About 10-15 % of glaucoma patients following a medically&#xD;
      correct treatment respond poorly or not at all to the medicines, leading to a progressive&#xD;
      loss of the visual field and an increasingly defective eyesight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-secretory factor (AF) is an endogenous protein which has been characterized in vivo and&#xD;
      in vitro. AF is a part of the proteasome and controls the transport of water and ions across&#xD;
      the cell membrane. AF plays an important part in the immune system and has an anti-secretory&#xD;
      and anti - inflammatory effect in vivo along with complementary substances, primarily c3C.&#xD;
      Researchers have chemically characterized and cloned AF's cDNA and shown that the active part&#xD;
      (anti-secretory and anti-inflammatory) is located in the amino terminal portion of the&#xD;
      protein. The exact mechanisms behind AF's regulatory effect on the secretory / inflammatory&#xD;
      progress, however, is largely unknown, but AF is probably involved in the liquid transport&#xD;
      mechanisms in the cell pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AF has been detected in most of the body tissues, plasma, breast milk, bile and faeces. In&#xD;
      healthy individual, AF occurs principally in an inactive form, but AF can be activated by a&#xD;
      disease, e.g. the toxin-induced diarrhea. The transition from inactive to active AF&#xD;
      contributes to the normalization of the intestinal secretion and diarrhea decreases or&#xD;
      ceases. In human beings, AF therapy has reduced disease symptoms such as ulcerative colitis,&#xD;
      Crohn's disease, Meniere's disease, mastitis (inflammation of the mammary gland ) and during&#xD;
      diarrhea conditions of different genesis. AF treatment has been particularly successful in&#xD;
      the treatment of children's diarrhea and is routinely used in Pakistan. No side effects of&#xD;
      therapy have so far been reported. Experiences in rats have also shown that AF is effective&#xD;
      in lowering the pressure in the tissue tumors (breast cancer), lowering the elevated&#xD;
      intracranial pressure that arises in connection with virus-induced inflammation of the brain&#xD;
      (herpesvirus type 1), reducing the pressure caused by mechanical brain damage that mimic&#xD;
      stroke (frost damage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By giving egg-producing hens special feed, hens' own production of AF is stimulated. The high&#xD;
      content of AF is specifically reflected in the egg yolk with a level about 10,000 times&#xD;
      higher than in normal eggs. The AF enriched egg yolk is subjected to spray-drying and sealed&#xD;
      in bags containing 4 gr each. This product is named Salovum and has been registered as a food&#xD;
      for specific medical purposes through the regulatory authorities in the EU. However, Salovum&#xD;
      cannot be used in patients with diagnosed or suspected with egg allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that Salovum can restore a normal salt-water balance in the&#xD;
      eye, which in turn would lower the IOP. This would eliminate or reduce the risk of subsequent&#xD;
      visual impairments/neurological damage. It is in this context important to point out that the&#xD;
      intake of Salovum counts as food and does not in any way interfere with the conventional&#xD;
      medical management of glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty glaucoma patients who despite adequate medication need additional IOP lowering will be&#xD;
      recruited. Participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups with 25 patients each and will&#xD;
      be treated according to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  one group begins with Salovum during 2 weeks and then take a placebo for another 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  one group begins with placebo for 2 weeks and then takes Salovum 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage: Salovum is dissolved in juice or water and may give rise to a certain satiety. Each&#xD;
      bag contains 4 gr of dried egg yolk. The first 2 days, the patients will take one bag of&#xD;
      Salovum or placebo 6 times a day , then a bag 5 times daily for 3 days and finally a bag 4&#xD;
      times daily for 9 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eye which has the highest IOP will be selected. If both eyes have the same IOP, the right&#xD;
      eye will be chosen. IOP will be measured according to Goldmann applanation tonometry five&#xD;
      times during the study period. IOP will be measured three times per session and all three&#xD;
      measurements will be used for statistical analysis. IOP will also be measured with a&#xD;
      self-tonometer by the patients themselves 5 times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will get more detailed information about handling the self-tonometer from study&#xD;
      staff. All results will be stored at St Erik Eye Hospital in a computer system with limited&#xD;
      access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, patients will continue to take their glaucoma treatment as usual. Except&#xD;
      for drinking Salovum and measuring their IOP, no new routine will encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study will compare placebo (egg yolk with a low level of AF) with active treatment&#xD;
      (Salovum with a high dose of AF) within a sick patient population, no healthy subjects will&#xD;
      be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an IOP lowering effect is achieved with Salovum, the investigators will discuss with the&#xD;
      patient how treatment should be continued. If no effect is obtained, patients will continue&#xD;
      with their usual medical treatment only.&#xD;
