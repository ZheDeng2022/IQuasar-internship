  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will evaluate nutrition requirements for missions at high altitude (i.e. &gt;7800&#xD;
      feet above sea level) and the information obtained can be used to optimize nutrient content&#xD;
      specifications for combat rations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether loss of lean body mass resulting from negative calorie balance over a&#xD;
           22-d period at high altitude can be prevented by increasing dietary protein intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the efficacy of carbohydrate (glucose and fructose) supplementation on aerobic&#xD;
           exercise performance at sea level, acute exposure to high altitude, and in response to&#xD;
           22-d period of negative calorie balance at high altitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine cognitive function, sleep patterns, and behavioral responses to high altitude&#xD;
           and underfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine appetite and eating behavior in response to high altitude and sustained&#xD;
           underfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Examine the effects of high altitude, negative calorie balance, dietary intake&#xD;
           manipulations on gut health.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Twenty-four, normal to overweight (body mass index of 18.5-29.9 kg/m2), physically active&#xD;
      adult civilians or active duty military personnel will be recruited for the 44-d protocol,&#xD;
      22-d at sea level and 22-d at high altitude (HA). During the 22-d sea level phase, volunteers&#xD;
      will receive dietary counseling to maintain baseline weight and consume protein at levels&#xD;
      consistent with recommendations for periods of low physical activity (1.0 g/kg/d). During the&#xD;
      22-d at HA, all meals and beverages (water ad libitum) will be prepared and provided to&#xD;
      volunteers by research staff. Physical activity will be increased at HA and calorie intake&#xD;
      will be reduced 40% to create a state of negative calorie balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in total body, lean body, and fat mass will be assessed at sea level and after a 22-d&#xD;
      energy deficit at HA. Regulation of muscle mass will be assessed using stable isotope&#xD;
      methodology, muscle biopsies, and various molecular techniques, to directly measure muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis, whole body protein balance, and the cellular mechanisms that regulate&#xD;
      these processes. Furthermore, exercise testing, substrate oxidation rates, and expired carbon&#xD;
      dioxide labeled with the stable isotope of carbon dioxide (one extra neutron) will be used to&#xD;
      assess total, exogenous, and endogenous carbohydrate oxidation and performance capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive cognitive/behavioral test battery will be performed at sea level and HA.&#xD;
      Sleep will be assessed by actigraphy. Eating behavior and appetite will be assessed at sea&#xD;
      level, acute HA, and after the 22-d energy deficit at HA using validated measures. Gut health&#xD;
      will be assessed using sugar absorption tests and the bacterial composition of the gut will&#xD;
      be characterized using advanced molecular techniques.&#xD;
