  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the equivalence of closed triple therapy&#xD;
      Fluticasone Furoate (FF)/Umeclidinium (UMEC)/Vilanterol (VI) to open triple therapy (FF/VI +&#xD;
      UMEC), with a comparison of both triple therapies to dual therapy (FF/VI) on lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase III, 4-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study&#xD;
      comparing FF/UMEC/VI (100 micrograms [mcg]/62.5 mcg/25 mcg) delivered via a single ELLIPTA®&#xD;
      inhaler ('closed' triple) + matching placebo ELLIPTA inhaler, FF/VI + UMEC delivered via two&#xD;
      ELLIPTA inhalers ('open' triple) and FF/VI via a single ELLIPTA inhaler + matching placebo&#xD;
      ELLIPTA inhaler, all once daily. The total duration of subject participation will be&#xD;
      approximately 7 weeks, consisting of a 2-week run-in period, 4-week treatment period and a&#xD;
      1-week follow-up period.&#xD;

      ELLIPTA is a registered trade mark of the GSK group of companies.&#xD;
