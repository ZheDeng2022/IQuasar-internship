  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic arterial hypertension is a disease with high prevalence in several countries,&#xD;
      including Brazil. Many studies have correlated hypertension with accelerated loss of&#xD;
      cognitive function, especially executive functions. There is some evidence that working&#xD;
      memory (WM) is compromised in these populations. However, some computerized training has been&#xD;
      developed to rehabilitate the WM, and among them the investigators highlight the Cogmed.&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Cogmed training in the performance&#xD;
      of WM and attention of hypertensive patients, as well as the impact of training in the&#xD;
      structure and brain function.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention group will be composed of hypertensive participants with cognitive decline that will be submitted to the training program (Cogmed) for approximately 10 weeks. Across training, task difficulty was adjusted as a function of individual performance.</description>

    <description>In the control group, hypertensive patient will be submitted to a set of online games available on the internet and previously determined. In this way, the control group will receive the same motivation, as well as will be engaged in computerized activities, in the same way as the experimental group. The difference is that these varied games do not provide any type of intense and adaptive training, at the same time as they do not stimulate any specific cognitive function.</description>

    <description>The Cogmed is computer software designed to train visuospatial and audio-verbal working memory, and other functions associated with working memory: attention, focus and impulsiveness. It has three versions adapted to different age groups: Cogmed for younger children, about 4-7 years, which are not yet so familiar with numbers and letters; Cogmed for children over 7 years and adolescents; and Cogmed for youth and adults over 18 years. In this study we will use the version for youth and adults over 18 years.</description>
