      This is a prospective, nonrandomized, single-arm study using the Zilver PTXTM stent in&#xD;
      patients with Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) disease (total occlusions or significant&#xD;
      stenosis).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular therapy is widely used for the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD).&#xD;
      Primary nitinol stenting for superficial femoral artery (SFA)) lesions has been shown to be&#xD;
      superior to balloon angioplasty alone. Zilver PTX a paclitaxel -eluting nitinol stent has&#xD;
      been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for femoro-popliteal artery use.&#xD;
      Previous study have reported safety and effectiveness of the Zilver PTZ in patients with de&#xD;
      novo or re-stenotic lesions of the femoro-popliteal artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical Coherence tomography (OCT) is a novel intravascular imaging modality with a unique&#xD;
      and fine resolution of 10 µm at the level of a red blood cells providing detailed images of&#xD;
      vascular wall following stent implantation for evaluation of optimal stent apposition and&#xD;
      expansion as well as intraluminal clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients with symptomatic critical limb ischemia (CLI) and claudication without CLI&#xD;
      (Rutherford class 2-6) and identifiable SFA disease on angiogram requiring percutaneous&#xD;
      peripheral intervention (PPI)will be enrolled in this study. We would like to study the&#xD;
      vessel apposition and expansion immediately after initial implantation as well as evaluation&#xD;
      of late stent malapposition and neointimal hyperplasia at the 12 months follow up after&#xD;
      Zilver PTXTM stent implantation using intravascular OCT imaging. Follow up visits will take&#xD;
      place at 1 month, 6 month, 12 month and 13 month after the procedure.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with lower extremity claudication and Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) due to&#xD;
             significant SFA stenosis (60%≤99%) or total occlusions (100%) that affects the quality&#xD;
             of life despite medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of significant SFA disease involving the most symptomatic limb by noninvasive&#xD;
             vascular testing with the use of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ABI: &lt;0.9 (If ABI&gt;1.4, SFA systolic acceleration time should be &gt; 140&#xD;
                  milliseconds);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  TBI: &lt;0.6;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) confirming at least a 60% SFA stenosis; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) confirming at least a 60% SFA stenosis&#xD;
