  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if emtricitabine is safe in children infected with HIV&#xD;
      and to determine the best dose.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children are placed into 1 of 4 treatment groups based on age: Group 1, 3 months to 24&#xD;
      months; Group 2, 25 months to 6 years; Group 3, 7 years to 12 years; Group 4, 13 years to 17&#xD;
      years. They receive baseline evaluations. Antiretroviral-naive patients receive emtricitabine&#xD;
      plus stavudine plus lopinavir/ritonavir. Antiretroviral-experienced patients replace&#xD;
      lamivudine with emtricitabine. Patients return to the clinic for follow-up visits at Weeks 2&#xD;
      and 4 and then every 4 weeks until Week 48. Safety is evaluated using adverse events, which&#xD;
      are reviewed at every clinic visit. Clinical laboratory data and full-profile&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine are evaluated at some visits. After the Week 48 study&#xD;
      evaluations are completed, individual patients may continue to receive study medication (as&#xD;
      provided by the sponsor) until commercially available, if certain criteria are met.&#xD;
