  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to establish the mechanism(s) of progression of primarily spinal&#xD;
      syringomyelia (PSS). Our preliminary study of syringomyelia emphasized syringomyelia&#xD;
      associated with craniocervical junction abnormalities (CCJAS), such as the Chiari I&#xD;
      malformation. This new protocol will expand the scope of our investigation to include&#xD;
      primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS), which is defined as syringomyelia not associated with&#xD;
      craniocervical junction abnormalities (CCJAS). Etiologies of primarily spinal syringomyelia&#xD;
      include 1) intradural scarring which is post-traumatic, post-inflammatory, or post-operative,&#xD;
      2) intradural-extramedullary masses such as arachnoid cysts or meningiomas, and 3)&#xD;
      extramedullary-extradural spinal lesions such as cervical spondylosis or spinal deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is the following: Primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS), results from&#xD;
      obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the spinal subarachnoid space; this&#xD;
      obstruction affects spinal CSF dynamics because the spinal subarachnoid space accepts the&#xD;
      fluid that is displaced from the intracranial subarachnoid space as the brain expands during&#xD;
      cardiac systole; in the case of primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS), a subarachnoid block&#xD;
      effectively shortens the spinal subarachnoid space, reducing CSF compliance and the capacity&#xD;
      of the spinal theca to dampen the subarachnoid CSF pressure waves produced by the brain&#xD;
      expansion during cardiac systole; the exaggerated spinal subarachnoid pressure waves occur&#xD;
      with every heartbeat and act on the spinal cord above the block to drive CSF into the spinal&#xD;
      cord and create a syrinx. Presyringomyelia, a recently described state of spinal cord edema&#xD;
      associated with progressive myelopathy and obstruction in CSF flow, is a precursor stage to&#xD;
      syringomyelia that is consistent with this hypothesis. Because of the importance of this&#xD;
      condition to the pathophysiology of syringomyelia, we will also study patients with&#xD;
      presyringomyelia in this protocol. After a syrinx is formed, the enlarged subarachnoid&#xD;
      pressure waves compress the external surface of the spinal cord, propel the syrinx fluid, and&#xD;
      promote syrinx progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many neurosurgeons at prominent academic centers routinely use syrinx shunts to treat&#xD;
      primarily spinal syringomyelia. This study should provide data that a surgical procedure that&#xD;
      opens the spinal subarachnoid space corrects the underlying pathophysiology and resolves the&#xD;
      syrinx and that invasion of the spinal cord is unnecessary.&#xD;

      Objective: The goal of this study is to establish the mechanism(s) of progression of&#xD;
      primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS), the type of syringomyelia that is associated with&#xD;
      pathology in the spinal column and not at the craniocervical junction. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      when a lesion obstructs the spinal subarachnoid space, it shortens the segment of spinal&#xD;
      canal that dampens the CSF pressure waves that are produced with each heartbeat and creates&#xD;
      enlarged spinal subarachnoid pressure waves that act on the spinal cord above the block to&#xD;
      drive CSF into the spinal cord and create a syrinx. After a syrinx is formed, enlarged&#xD;
      subarachnoid pressure waves compress the external surface of the spinal cord, propel the&#xD;
      syrinx fluid, and promote syrinx progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Subjects will have primary spinal syringomyelia associated with 1)&#xD;
      intradural scarring which is post-traumatic, post-inflammatory, or post-operative, 2)&#xD;
      intradural-extramedullary masses such as arachnoid cysts or meningiomas, and 3)&#xD;
      extramedullary-extradural spinal lesions such as cervical spondylosis or spinal deformity, or&#xD;
      4) an intramedullary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Subjects will have testing before and after standard surgical therapy of&#xD;
      syringomyelia. Testing includes measurement of CSF pressure, neurologic examination,&#xD;
      CT-myelography, and MR scanning. Results of CSF pressure measurements before surgery will be&#xD;
      compared to measurements from normal controls that were previously studied. The effect of&#xD;
      surgery on CSF pressure, neurologic examination, CT-myelography, and MRI scans will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is cervical CSF pulse pressure, which is the&#xD;
      amplitude of the CSF pressure wave, compared to normal values. Secondary outcomes measures&#xD;
      include change in CSF pulse pressure, neurologic examination, CT-myelography, and MRI scans&#xD;
      between before and after surgery.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible to participate in this research study, the subject must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have syringomyelia documented by MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have evidence of neurological deterioration related to syringomyelia or spinal cord tumor.&#xD;
        Prior surgery for syringomyelia does not result in exclusion from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be able to comprehend the risks of testing and therapy and to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will not eligible to participate in this research study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        They are pregnant (because X-rays might injure a fetus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        They cannot have an MRI scan as determined by a radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        They have a problem with bleeding that cannot be corrected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        They are unable to understand the risks of the testing and surgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Their blood test for HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) is positive, because a positive HIV&#xD;
        test would increase your risk of infection from research testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        They have syringomyelia which developed after meningitis, because we have found that&#xD;
        laminectomy and duroplasty is ineffective in this setting&#xD;
