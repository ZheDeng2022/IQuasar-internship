  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the possible effectiveness of levetiracetam in patients with bipolar&#xD;
      illness who have not responded adequately to standard treatments. Levetiracetam was recently&#xD;
      approved to treat seizures. Other drugs in the same class as levetiracetam, including&#xD;
      carbamazepine and valproate, are widely recognized as substitute medications for lithium or&#xD;
      are used as an adjunct to it, and other anticonvulsants have also shown promise in improving&#xD;
      bipolar symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with bipolar illness whose manic, depressed or unstable moods are not adequately&#xD;
      controlled by their current treatment and who have not responded previously to two standard&#xD;
      treatments (i.e., lithium, valproate, carbamazepine or neuroleptics) may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take levetiracetam starting at 500 mg daily. If this dose is well&#xD;
      tolerated, it will be increased to 500 mg twice a day. Every 3 days, doses may be increased&#xD;
      until the target dose of 3000 mg/day is reached. Higher doses, not to exceed 4000 mg/day, may&#xD;
      be tried in patients who do not respond fully to the lower doses. Patients and observers will&#xD;
      use standard ratings to evaluate the patients' response to therapy during the 8-week study.&#xD;
      If, after 8 weeks, the results appear promising, patients may continue treatment for an&#xD;
      additional 6 months to evaluate longer-term effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost all of the approved anticonvulsant compounds (with the exception of gabapentin and&#xD;
      tiagabine) have now been suggested to have acute antimanic or more long-term mood stabilizing&#xD;
      properties. Carbamazepine and valproate have gained a widely recognized role in treatment&#xD;
      algorithms of bipolar illness, and lamotrigine has shown promising antidepressant effects.&#xD;
      Levetiracetam (Keppra® (Registered Trademark)) is the most recently approved anti-epileptic&#xD;
      drug available, and deserves pilot exploration in bipolar illness for a variety of reasons.&#xD;
      These include: its positive side-effects profile; it is a derivative of the nootropic agent&#xD;
      piracetam which has memory-enhancing properties in animal studies; it likely has a unique&#xD;
      mechanism of action since it is not active on most of the traditional excitatory and&#xD;
      inhibitory neurotransmitter systems; it is not active on traditional anticonvulsant models&#xD;
      such as pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or maximum electroshock (MES) seizures, but is able to stop&#xD;
      both the development and completed phase of amygdala-kindled seizures; and it is not&#xD;
      metabolized by hepatic enzymes and thus has few adverse pharmacokinetic interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose pilot exploration of levetiracetam as an adjunctive agent in patients with bipolar&#xD;
      illness who are inadequately responsive to routine psychopharmacological agents for bipolar&#xD;
      illness. At the NIMH we will study a maximum of 10 acutely depressed, 10 manic, and 10&#xD;
      cycling patients enrolled in Protocol 97-M-0039. We would start at Levetiracetam doses of 500&#xD;
      mg/day, and not to exceed 4000 mg/day. Response will be based primarily on the percentage of&#xD;
      patients showing &quot;much&quot; or &quot;very much&quot; improvement on the GCI-BP score in each of the three&#xD;
      groups as augmented by the percentage decrement on cross-sectional scales such as the&#xD;
      Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) in&#xD;
      conjunction with prospective ratings on the NIMH-LCMp. Should preliminary evidence of&#xD;
      efficacy be observed in this open add-on clinical trial, more systematic controlled studies&#xD;
      will then be designed for confirmation of promising target areas of efficacy.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients meeting DSM -IV criteria for bipolar I, bipolar II, bipolar NOS, and&#xD;
        schizoaffective illness-bipolar type will be eligible for study. They will be enrolled in&#xD;
        approved Protocol #97-M-0039 and thus will not have H.I.V. and will have provided consent&#xD;
        for all of the rating forms utilized in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with inadequate response to two standard agents (i.e., lithium, valproate,&#xD;
        carbamazepine, or neuroleptics) in the treatment of bipolar illness will be eligible for&#xD;
        open adjunctive levetiracetam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If serum creatinine is above normal, a creatinine clearance will be preformed; this must be&#xD;
        above 85 in order for a patient to be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of child-bearing age who are not on an active method of birth control or who are&#xD;
        likely to become pregnant will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Men or women with significant renal disease will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the depressed phase, patients will have an IDS score of 18 or greater, an LCM&#xD;
        depression score of low moderate or greater, and a GCI-BP severity score of moderate or&#xD;
        greater for more than 2 weeks, i.e., the DSM-IV durational criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the hypomanic/manic phase, patients will have an YMRS score of 8 or greater, an LCM&#xD;
        mania rating of mild or greater, and a CGI-BP severity score of moderately ill or greater&#xD;
        for 7 days or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Those in the cycling group would meet the severity criteria for depression and mania. They&#xD;
        would have four or more mood &quot;switches,&quot; and have an overall illness rating on the CGI-BP&#xD;
        severity score of moderate or greater.&#xD;
