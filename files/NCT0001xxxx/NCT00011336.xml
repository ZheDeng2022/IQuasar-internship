      Primary Objectives: Determine the association between level of spinal cord injury (SCI) with&#xD;
      chronic respiratory symptoms, measures of pulmonary function, and respiratory illness, both&#xD;
      cross-sectionally and longitudinally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: None&#xD;

      Study Abstract: This study is using a standardized method to assess respiratory function in&#xD;
      SCI in order to determine the association between level of SCI with chronic respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms, measures of pulmonary function, and respiratory illness, both cross-sectionally and&#xD;
      longitudinally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A community-based mail survey was made of 1147 subjects (42% response rate; 2 mailings,&#xD;
      n=485). Additional subjects injured &gt;1 year ago underwent testing at the West Roxbury VAMC&#xD;
      (FVC, FEV1, TLC and subdivisions, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP/MEP), and&#xD;
      completed a health questionnaire based on the ATS DL-78 respiratory questionnaire. Between&#xD;
      10/94-9/98, a cross-sectional cohort of 361 subjects with chronic SCI were tested. Multiple&#xD;
      logistic regression was used to examine predictors of respiratory symptoms and chest illness&#xD;
      determined from the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the community-based mail survey, SCI with complete cervical injury (CC) the odds&#xD;
      reporting ?any wheeze? relative to lower SCI levels (odds ratio (95%CI)) was 3.34&#xD;
      (1.75-6.40), p&lt;0.001, and for ?persistent wheeze? was 2.41 (1.11-5.22), p=0.023. The odds of&#xD;
      reporting chronic cough or phlegm were not increased (p=0.40 and 0.07 respectively). Active&#xD;
      cigarette smoking was the strongest predictor of respiratory symptoms. In a subset of&#xD;
      subjects tested at our VAMC, the odds of CC SCI of reporting chest illness resulting in time&#xD;
      off work, indoors at home, or in bed over 3 years before questionnaire completion relative to&#xD;
      incomplete injury was 3.00 (1.12-8.01), p=0.029. For 1 PPD current smokers the risk of chest&#xD;
      illness was 3.91 (1.71-8.95), p=0.001, for subjects who smoked post injury but quit within&#xD;
      the previous 10 years the odds was 3.00 (1.00-8.97), p=0.05. For other former smokers the&#xD;
      odds were not significantly increased. Subjects who reported ?persistent wheeze? were nearly&#xD;
      3 times as likely to have reported a chest illness (p=0.036). After using a wheelchair, 31%&#xD;
      of CC subjects reported breathlessness, compared to 15% with complete high thoracic, and 11%&#xD;
      of lower injuries (p=0.04 trend). Subjects who were not wheelchair athletes, even when lung&#xD;
      function and SCI level were noted, were twice as likely not to report breathlessness compared&#xD;
      to athletes (p=0.032). Subjects with SCI were able to produce reproducible spirometry.&#xD;
      Analysis of the effect of SCI level on lung function is in progress, as are analyses&#xD;
      examining predictors of chest illness in the workers tested to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed a method to assess respiratory function in SCI. Using these methods,&#xD;
      complete cervical SCI have been found to experience more wheeze and breathlessness than&#xD;
      others with SCI, and are more likely to report a chest illness. However, active cigarette&#xD;
      smoking was the most important predictor of chest illness and respiratory symptoms rather&#xD;
      than injury level or completeness. Therefore, it is likely that SCI based smoking cessation&#xD;
      programs would result in significantly reducing respiratory morbidity in this population. The&#xD;
      introduction of exercise programs might also result in a decreased prevalence of&#xD;
      breathlessness in complete cervical SCI.&#xD;
