      This study uses positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to study how serotonin works in&#xD;
      alcoholics. Serotonin is a chemical that allows brain cells to communicate. There is evidence&#xD;
      that people with alcoholism have altered serotonin; their brains begin to make and break down&#xD;
      serotonin more slowly than people who do not drink. PET scans use radioactive substances&#xD;
      injected into the body. A special camera detects the radiation emitted by the radioactive&#xD;
      fluid and a computer processes the radioactivity into images of the brain, which show the&#xD;
      activity of brain chemicals like serotonin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with alcohol dependency may participate in this study. Candidates are screened with a&#xD;
      medical history, including questions about alcohol and drug use, physical examination, blood&#xD;
      tests, breath alcohol tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), urine test for illicit drugs and, for&#xD;
      women, a pregnancy test, and a stool test for hidden blood. They also undergo magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and complete questionnaires on their alcohol and&#xD;
      drug history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diet low in tryptophan. Tryptophan is an amino acid from which serotonin is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain MRI before starting the study to make sure brain structure is normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to collect a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A&#xD;
           local anesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones&#xD;
           (vertebrae) in the lower back. About 2 tablespoons of fluid is collected through the&#xD;
           needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arterial catheter (plastic tube) placed in an artery in the wrist area for drawing blood&#xD;
           samples. The skin is numbed with a local anesthetic for placement of the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous (IV) catheter placed in a vein for injecting the radioactive isotope used in&#xD;
           the PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two PET scans - baseline and active.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amino acid drink (orange flavored) before the active PET scan. The drink lowers&#xD;
           tryptophan levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amino acid capsules - 23 amino acid capsules are taken with the orange drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic analysis to help understand serotonin and alcoholism. A blood sample is&#xD;
           collected for DNA testing and possibly establishment of a cell line (collection of cells&#xD;
           that are grown in the laboratory from an original tissue specimen) for other genetic&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are admitted to the intensive care unit for the lumbar puncture and arterial line&#xD;
      procedures. After these procedures are complete, the patient is transferred by stretcher to&#xD;
      the PET suite for scanning. During the two scans, blood samples are drawn from the artery and&#xD;
      a small amount of CSF is collected each hour of the study. Each PET scanning session lasts&#xD;
      about 3 hours. The study lasts 36 hours, during which time the subject remains in bed.&#xD;

      This research concerns the study of serotonin (5-HT) synthesis, metabolism (turnover), and&#xD;
      release. We hypothesize that neuronal 5-HT turnover and release is altered in alcoholic&#xD;
      individuals, and that this plays a role in alcohol seeking behavior. We wish to determine the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether there are differences in 5-HT turnover and release in alcoholics compared to&#xD;
           healthy research comparison participants, before and after Acute Tryptophan Depletion&#xD;
           (ATD);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether putative differences in 5-HT turnover are governed primarily by genetic&#xD;
           variation in the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) in alcoholics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Whether 5-HTT genetic variation correlates with [(18) F]-FCWAY/5-HT(1A), binding, and&#xD;
           cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration, before and&#xD;
           after ATD; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) differs at baseline and after ATD in alcoholics&#xD;
           and healthy research comparison participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the underlying biochemistry of 5-HT neurometabolism, we will use two&#xD;
      experimental strategies, Acute Tryptophan (TRP) Depletion (ATD) and positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) imaging, to investigate 5-HT neurochemistry. We will deplete plasma TRP,&#xD;
      using ATD, while simultaneously collecting CSF 5-HIAA and performing intermittent plasma&#xD;
      sampling via indwelling catheters. TRP is the amino acid (AA) precursor needed for 5-HT&#xD;
      synthesis. 5-HIAA is the principal metabolite of 5-HT. It is a neurochemical marker of&#xD;
      neuronal 5-HT metabolism. PET will allow indirect measurements of synaptic 5-HT concentration&#xD;
      by measuring binding of [(18)F]-FCWAY, a 5-HT (1A)-receptor antagonist. rCBF will be measured&#xD;
      with [(15)O]-water imaging. Studies will be performed before and after ATD. Individuals will&#xD;
      be genotyped for the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT). Plasma TRP and Large Neutral Amino Acids&#xD;
      (LNAAs), and CSF TRP and 5-HIAA concentrations will be measured using High Performance Liquid&#xD;
      Chromatography (HPLC).&#xD;

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have met standard DSM-IV R criteria for alcohol dependence and limited number&#xD;
        psychiatric conditions that characterize patients with mood disorders that are difficult to&#xD;
        separate from their alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age and sex matched healthy research comparison participants. The healthy research&#xD;
        comparison participants need to be free of medical, neurological, and psychiatric illness.&#xD;
        They should be medication free at the time of study. They should not meet criteria for&#xD;
        alcohol or substance abuse, and cannot have a history of such use placing them in&#xD;
        questionable diagnostic categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The age range of study participants is from 18 to 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects from a diverse racial, ethnic, and gender backgrounds will be included in the&#xD;
        study. This is because alcohol dependence manifests itself differently in different racial&#xD;
        and gender groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant medical problems, e.g., active GI bleed, cancer, active hepatitis B infection&#xD;
        or other medical diseases associated with liver pathology other than hepatitis C or&#xD;
        alcoholism (e.g. Hemochromatosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other psychiatric illnesses represent diagnostic categories not eligible for this study.&#xD;
        Examples of these include Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, acute or chronic&#xD;
        psychotic illness (e.g. Schizophrenia), and Substance Induced Mood Disorders (i.e.&#xD;
        secondary to illicit drug dependence; e.g. heroin, cocaine, crack, PCP, and other illicit&#xD;
        substances that affect brain function).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intravenous drug use within the past three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Drug or medication use, strongly associated with liver dysfunction, CNS effects, or&#xD;
        impaired GI absorption (e.g. high doses of acetaminophen, neuroleptic medications, and&#xD;
        narcotic medications).&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of significant GI surgery (e.g. Roux en Y procedure, partial gastrectomy), which&#xD;
        would interfere with normal GI absorption of dietary constituents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Coagulation defects or lack of dual circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Severe iron deficiency anemia, marked low hematocrit or hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy: a positive pregnancy test will preclude further participation in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability to give a clinical history or informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis: patients with positive HIV&#xD;
        status/AIDS will be excluded form the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals may be excluded from entering the study at the discretion of the Principal&#xD;
        Investigator, Dr. Williams, based on his clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who have had an adverse reaction that mimics any of the anticipated adverse&#xD;
        events in response to a pharmacological challenge study or to a prescribed medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cranial mass.&#xD;
