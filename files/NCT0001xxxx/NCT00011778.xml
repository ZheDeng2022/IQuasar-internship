  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effects of the experimental drug PS-341 plus radiation&#xD;
      therapy in patients with head and neck cancer. PS-341 can slow or halt the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells grown in culture or in mice. In addition, the drug appears to enhance the effectiveness&#xD;
      of radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with head and neck cancer that cannot be treated&#xD;
      adequately with surgery and cannot be cured with standard radiation and chemotherapy may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Patients whose cancer has spread to the brain may not participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment begins participants are evaluated with CT or MRI scans of the head, neck and&#xD;
      chest area to determine the extent of the cancer; an electrocardiogram and blood tests; and a&#xD;
      neurocardiovascular evaluation that includes measuring blood pressure in different body&#xD;
      positions and involves injections of phenylephrine and nitroglycerine. Some patients may&#xD;
      undergo a procedure in which a tube is inserted into the larynx (voice box), bronchi&#xD;
      (breathing tubes) and esophagus (food tube) and tissue samples removed. This procedure is&#xD;
      done under general anesthesia in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive radiation treatments Monday through Friday and injections of PS-341 twice a&#xD;
      week during the radiation therapy. After 3 weeks of treatment, PS-341 injections are stopped&#xD;
      for 2 weeks. Some patients continue to receive radiation treatments during the 2-week break,&#xD;
      and others do not, depending upon when they enter the trial. The total duration of radiation&#xD;
      treatment varies from 6 to 8 weeks, depending on whether the patient received radiation in&#xD;
      the region of the head and neck cancer before entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have a blood sample drawn before and after each new PS-341 injection to measure the&#xD;
      drug action in the blood and to see how strong and how long the effects on the blood last.&#xD;
      They are seen in the clinic at least once a week for a history and physical examination. A&#xD;
      blood sample is collected at each visit to look for toxic effects of PS-341. Near the end of&#xD;
      treatment, the neurocardiovascular evaluation is repeated, and if the results are abnormal,&#xD;
      it is repeated again 3 months after treatment is completed. X-rays or MRI scans are done 12&#xD;
      weeks after radiation therapy has ended and then every few months after that to determine the&#xD;
      extent of disease. Patients whose tumor is accessible are asked to undergo a biopsy (removal&#xD;
      of a small piece of tumor tissue) on the first and second day after receiving the first&#xD;
      PS-341 dose to examine the effect of the drug on the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PS-341 dose is increased in successive groups of at least 3 patients until the highest&#xD;
      dose that can be given safely with radiation is reached. Patients who develop severe side&#xD;
      effects from the drug temporarily stop taking it to allow the side effects to improve. If&#xD;
      needed, the dose may be decreased. Radiation therapy may also be stopped temporarily in&#xD;
      patients who develop severe effects on the mouth, throat or skin. Side effects may be treated&#xD;
      with increased fluid (by mouth, stomach tube, or vein), anti-nausea or anti-diarrhea&#xD;
      medications, pain medications and medications to boost red or white cell counts or platelets.&#xD;
      The drug Florinef may be given to help regulate body fluids and blood pressure.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates the degradation of important regulatory&#xD;
           proteins and transcription factors that control the cell cycle and cell death.&#xD;
           Proteasome inhibition can lead to block of different phases of the cell cycle, and block&#xD;
           expression of genes that prevent cell death induced by radiation or other cytotoxic&#xD;
           therapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In preclinical studies, proteasome inhibitor PS-341 has demonstrated cytotoxic,&#xD;
           radiosensitizing, and anti-tumor activity against squamous cell carcinomas of the head&#xD;
           and neck (SCCHN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective of this phase I dose escalation clinical study is to determine the&#xD;
           maximum tolerated dose of PS-341 to be given concomitant with radiation in patients with&#xD;
           recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives include detection of 20S proteasome inhibition, cell cycle block,&#xD;
           apoptosis and inhibition of transcription factor NF-kappaB activation in tumor tissue&#xD;
           biopsies following PS-341 and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent or recurrent SCCHN,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible for local primary or re-irradiation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance less than or equal to 2, life expectancy &gt; 3 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function (PLT &gt; 100, 000/microL, neutrophils &gt; 1500/mciroL, serum&#xD;
           creatinine &lt; 1.5 times the upper limits normal (ULN), serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the&#xD;
           ULN, serum transaminases &lt; 2.5 times the ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No systemic chemotherapy within the past 4 weeks and recovered from chemotherapy&#xD;
           toxicity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &gt; 6 months since prior radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I dose escalation, standard 3+3 statistical design, up to 51 subjects,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PS-341 will be given in escalating doses of 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2 mg/m(2) in cohorts of 3 or&#xD;
           more patients by IV bolus on M, Th (or T, F), and radiation will be given in 1.8 Gy&#xD;
           fractions M-F to 60 Gy in previously radiated or 72Gy in previously unirradiated&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation and/or drug will be given in two courses split by a two week rest to allow&#xD;
           recovery from combined modality therapy.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must meet the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with histologically confirmed SCCHN which is persistent or recurrent and&#xD;
        unresectable; or patients presenting with or developing distant metastases following&#xD;
        standard curative measures, and who have local regional disease amenable to radiation or&#xD;
        re-irradiation therapy are eligible. Patients with a history of treatment for other prior&#xD;
        malignancy will be eligible, provided they remain disease-free more than 2 years after&#xD;
        initial treatment, or were treated for non-melanoma skin cancer, or in situ cervical&#xD;
        cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because of greater potential for acute toxicity in previously irradiated patients, patients&#xD;
        will be stratified based on whether they have received prior radiation. Stratum A: Prior&#xD;
        radiation therapy (greater than 6 months) with or without prior surgery or chemotherapy.&#xD;
        Stratum B: No prior radiation therapy, but greater than or equal to 4 weeks after surgery&#xD;
        or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than 18 years of age. Because no dosing or toxicity data are currently&#xD;
        available on the use of PS-341 in patients less than 18 years of age, children are not&#xD;
        included in this study. Further, SCCHN in patients less than 18 years of age is exceedingly&#xD;
        rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than 50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Life expectancy greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        absolute neutrophil count is greater than 1,500/microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
        platelets are greater than 100,000/microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
        total bilirubin is less than 1.5 times the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) is less than 2.5 times the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        serum creatinine is less than 1.5 times the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        or&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with creatinine levels&#xD;
        equal to or greater than 1.5 times the ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of PS-341 on gametogenesis and the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
        therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, men and women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
        must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control) prior to study&#xD;
        entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
        suspect she is pregnant while she or a participating spouse are enrolled in this study, she&#xD;
        should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because the potential risk of toxicity in nursing infants secondary to PS-341 treatment of&#xD;
        the mother is unknown but may be harmful, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
        mother is treated with PS-341.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have had surgery, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy within 4 weeks, or&#xD;
        radiotherapy to the head and neck within 6 months prior to entering the study. For&#xD;
        palliative radiation at the sites, at least one month must elapse between the end of&#xD;
        radiation and the beginning of therapy under this protocol and toxicities must have&#xD;
        resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients undergoing therapy with other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of&#xD;
        their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that&#xD;
        would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the past 6&#xD;
        months, unstable angina pectoris, or unstable cardiac arrhythmia, requiring assessment for&#xD;
        clinical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study because PS-341 is an&#xD;
        investigational agent with unknown effects on the fetus and nursing infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-positive patients are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic&#xD;
        interactions with medication necessary to control HIV or its complication and owing to&#xD;
        uncertain interaction of PS-341 with immune function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with postural hypotentsion due to severe baroreceptor dysfunction after previous&#xD;
        radiation and/or surgery defined as a) postural hypotension that cannot be corrected with&#xD;
        volume repetition to systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg and absence of&#xD;
        orthostatic changes or symptoms; b) postural hypotension that cannot be corrected with&#xD;
        volume repletion to systolic blood pressure greater than 120 mm Hg with orthostatic changes&#xD;
        and absence of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with hyponatremia not correctable to greater than or equal to 130 mEq/L will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
