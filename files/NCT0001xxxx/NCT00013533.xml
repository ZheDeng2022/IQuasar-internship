      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogeneic blood and marrow stem cell transplantation (BMT) plays an important role in&#xD;
           the curative treatment of a number of pediatric malignancies. Unfortunately, the success&#xD;
           of conventional allogeneic BMT is limited in part by the multiple toxicities associated&#xD;
           with myeloablative preparative regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-myeloablative pre-transplant regimens are associated with less toxic side effects&#xD;
           than standard BMT. Recently, a novel immunosuppressive, non-myeloablative pre-transplant&#xD;
           chemotherapy regimen has been shown to facilitate complete donor engraftment in an adult&#xD;
           trial at the NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this&#xD;
      treatment approach in pediatric patients with hematopoietic malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;

      allowed), weight greater than or equal to 15 kilograms, and who meet standard donation&#xD;
      criteria will be considered. The same donor from a prior BMT is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG Performance Status: 0, 1, or 2. and life expectancy: greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver Function: Serum direct bilirubin less than 2.0 mg/dL and serum ALT and AST values less&#xD;
      than or equal to 2.5x upper limit of normal. (Values above these levels may be accepted if&#xD;
      due to malignancy.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal Function: Age adjusted normal serum creatinine or Cr clearance greater than or equal to&#xD;
      60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).&#xD;
&#xD;

           bone marrow derived stem cells will be collected from the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction/Consolidation chemotherapy: 1 to 3 cycles will be given every 22 days&#xD;
           depending on disease response, CD4 count, and toxicities.&#xD;
