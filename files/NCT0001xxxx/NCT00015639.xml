    <textblock>
      Plasma histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) binds to platelets in the presence of zinc (1). This&#xD;
      binding is totally blocked by a monoclonal antibody directed against platelet membrane CD36.&#xD;
      Therefore, CD36 is assumed to carry the platelet binding site for HRG (2). Because CD36 also&#xD;
      has a variety of other ligands, including polyanionic lipids, it is also possible that it&#xD;
      contains the binding site for heparin (also polyanionic) and might be involve in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Demonstrating absent HRG or heparin binding&#xD;
      to platelets lacking CD36 would confirm that the binding sites for either or both of these&#xD;
      ligands are located on this membrane protein. Because 3% to 11% of healthy Japanese are&#xD;
      reported to lack CD36 on their platelets, this population is a practical source of cells for&#xD;
      examining the physiologic role(s) for CD36. Therefore, we will recruit blood donors from the&#xD;
      Japanese community on the NIH campus. Their platelets will tested for the presence of CD36.&#xD;
      Recruitment will be closed after two individuals have been identified whose platelets lack&#xD;
      CD36 and who are willing to donate 30 cc of blood on 4 or 5 subsequent occasions for binding&#xD;
      studies with radiolabeled HRG and heparin.&#xD;
