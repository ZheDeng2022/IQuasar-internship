  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an antibiotic called Fansidar on&#xD;
      autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). Patients with ALPS have enlarged lymph&#xD;
      glands, spleen and/or liver, abnormal blood cell counts and overactive immune function.&#xD;
      Current treatments are aimed at suppressing the immune system and improving symptoms, such as&#xD;
      anemia (low red blood cell count) and low white blood cell and platelet counts. These&#xD;
      treatments, however, are only partially effective and may have complications. Fansidar is a&#xD;
      combination of two drugs, sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine, that is used to treat or prevent&#xD;
      parasitic infections such as malaria. Recently a child with ALPS who was treated with&#xD;
      Fansidar for a different illness had a marked shrinkage of the lymph organs. This study will&#xD;
      examine whether Fansidar can shrink the lymph glands or spleen in patients with ALPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ALPS between the ages of 4 and 70 years who have had lymph gland enlargement&#xD;
      for at least 1 year and are not allergic to sulfa drugs may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination and blood tests.&#xD;
      Females of reproductive age will have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, with blood tests&#xD;
      and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lymph nodes. For the CT scan, the patient lies on&#xD;
      a table during an X-ray scan of the neck, part of the chest, and, if the spleen has not been&#xD;
      removed, the stomach area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When these baseline tests are completed, patients will be given Fansidar pills to take once a&#xD;
      week for 12 weeks. The dosage will be increased after 2 weeks and again after 4 weeks. At 2,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks after starting the treatment and 2 weeks after the last dose, patients&#xD;
      will have blood drawn to check for possible side effects of therapy. Women will have a repeat&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test at week 6 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within a week before completing treatment or after completing treatment, patients will return&#xD;
      to NIH for a history, physical examination, blood tests and CT scan. Patients who responded&#xD;
      well to treatment will be offered to return to NIH again 3, 6 and 12 months later to repeat&#xD;
      the evaluations. If ALPS symptoms recur during this time, patients will be offered another&#xD;
      12-week course of Fansidar and the procedure, including the 3, 6 and 12-month evaluations&#xD;
      will be repeated again. If symptoms recur again, patients will be asked to resume Fansidar&#xD;
      for 6 months or longer, with doses adjusted as needed. During this time, patients will be&#xD;
      seen at NIH every 12 weeks for evaluation and blood will be drawn by the patient's private&#xD;
      physician every 6 weeks or 2 and 4 weeks after the dose is increased to check for side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome is an inherited disease associated with a defect&#xD;
      of lymphocyte apoptosis, lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity. Although, there are treatments&#xD;
      for many of its autoimmune complications, there currently is no safe and effective therapy&#xD;
      for this syndrome itself. Recently investigators in Europe serendipitously found that a child&#xD;
      with ALPS type I had significant clinical improvement while on pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine&#xD;
      (Fansidar) for Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this finding, we propose to conduct a pilot study to obtain information on safety&#xD;
      and initial data on efficacy of the drug combination Fansidar for the treatment of ALPS. Six&#xD;
      to 8 individuals, with ALPS who report no allergy to sulfa drugs will be treated for up to 3&#xD;
      months with weekly Fansidar at escalating doses adjusted by weight. The effect of Fansidar&#xD;
      treatment on lymph node and/or spleen size will be assessed by CT scanning. The effect of&#xD;
      treatment on other laboratory features of ALPS will also be assessed. Evaluating the effects&#xD;
      of Fansidar on these clinical and laboratory parameters will allow us to determine if this&#xD;
      drug demonstrates sufficient activity to warrant further study in a larger randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
