  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine tongue strength and endurance, how the tongue applies pressure during&#xD;
      swallowing, and how the chin muscles react during swallowing in healthy volunteers and in&#xD;
      patients with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). The information from this study may be&#xD;
      helpful in developing better treatments for people with swallowing problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers who have no history of speech, swallowing or breathing problems and&#xD;
      patients who have difficulty swallowing because of a neurologic disorder, musculoskeletal&#xD;
      disease or head and neck cancer that caused tongue weakness and dysphagia may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Such medical conditions may include stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, Gaucher's disease,&#xD;
      leukodystrophy, cerebral palsy, myositis, or mouth, throat or neck cancer. Volunteers who&#xD;
      have not participated in a NIH protocol for 1 year will be screened with a brief medical&#xD;
      history and physical examination. Dysphagic patients not currently enrolled in a NIH protocol&#xD;
      will also have a brief medical history and physical examination. In addition, they will have&#xD;
      a modified barium swallow to determine the nature and degree of their swallowing difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a 15-minute examination of movements of their tongue, lips and jaw and&#xD;
      will fill out a questionnaire about their swallowing ability. They will then begin the tongue&#xD;
      pressure test. To monitor and record tongue pressure, a thin rubber strip with air-filled&#xD;
      pressure bulbs will be attached to the roof of the mouth with dental adhesive. The pressure&#xD;
      bulbs are connected to an external pressure-reading device. In addition, a small plastic pad&#xD;
      with adhesive backing will be placed under the chin. Electrodes (wires) attached to the pad&#xD;
      record chin muscle activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the pressure bulbs and chin electrodes in place, the patient will perform tongue&#xD;
      pressure tasks to test tongue strength, how long the patient can maintain a certain tongue&#xD;
      pressure, and how fast tongue pressure drops. The tasks include saliva swallows, water&#xD;
      swallows and cup-drinking.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The tongue enacts complex mechanical events during swallowing, the most important of which is&#xD;
      the propulsion of a bolus from the oral cavity to the pharynx. Successful bolus transport&#xD;
      requires the tongue to interact with other oral structures, especially the hard palate, to&#xD;
      generate sufficient impulsive force or pressure gradients that drive the bolus toward the&#xD;
      oropharynx. Our knowledge of deglutitive lingual pressure dynamics is at best incomplete. The&#xD;
      available data on oral tongue pressure phenomena are based exclusively on commanded single&#xD;
      swallows. Oral pressure changes during other important everyday eating activities (e.g., cup&#xD;
      drinking) have not been studied to date. Past investigations revealed that rapid sequential&#xD;
      swallowing during continuous drinking, in contrast to commanded discrete swallows, had unique&#xD;
      tongue-palate contact patterns, surface electromyographic response characteristics, and hyoid&#xD;
      displacement profiles. Given the different biomechanical properties and motor strategies, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that oral lingual pressure profiles for sequential swallowing are also different,&#xD;
      that sequential swallows require less impulsive force, and that selected dysphagic patients,&#xD;
      especially those whose swallowing deficits are associated with reduced tongue strength, will&#xD;
      perform sequential swallows more efficiently than they do discrete swallows. This protocol,&#xD;
      therefore, proposes to test these hypotheses in healthy individuals of different ages, and in&#xD;
      patients with reduced tongue strength and oral-oropharyngeal dysphagia associated with&#xD;
      neurologic disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, or head and neck cancer. Our goals are to:&#xD;
      (a) acquire a better and more complete understanding of normal tongue pressure phenomena as a&#xD;
      function of swallowing tasks, (b) characterize the interrelationship between task-induced&#xD;
      lingual pressure differences and result of clinical diagnostic tests of swallowing function&#xD;
      in patient populations, and (c) differentially identify the profiles of dysphagic patients&#xD;
      who can and those who cannot benefit from sequential swallowing as a&#xD;
      compensatory/rehabilitative strategy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. be at least 21 years of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. have no speech, swallowing, or respiratory problems;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. be in good general health;&#xD;
