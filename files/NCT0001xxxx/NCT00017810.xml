  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial is designed to determine the efficacy of a dietary&#xD;
      intervention to reduce the frequency of bowel movements and improve stool consistency as&#xD;
      compared with subjects assigned to a control group. The study enrolled HIV patients with a&#xD;
      history of three or more episodes of diarrhea for 3 weeks or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of a combined behavioral dietary&#xD;
      intervention using normal foods (Condition 1: treatment) with HIV self-care (Condition 2:&#xD;
      control) to reduce the frequency and improve the consistency of bowel movements after 3 weeks&#xD;
      and 24 weeks of study intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty to fifty percent of individuals with HIV can be expected to have diarrhea at some&#xD;
      point during their illness. Diarrhea can be a chronic condition in HIV disease wherein three&#xD;
      or more daily episodes of loose, watery stools are experienced for 4 weeks or more. Chronic&#xD;
      diarrhea has been associated with significant morbidity, weight loss, and severe&#xD;
      malnutrition. Researchers have reported that patients with chronic diarrhea experience a&#xD;
      marked decrease in quality of life in comparison with HIV patients without diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of nutrition management for patients with chronic diarrhea is to ensure that&#xD;
      adequate caloric consumption meets the metabolic needs of such individuals and to provide&#xD;
      symptomatic relief. HIV infection, regardless of stage, causes an increase in resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure because of the response of the body to the viral infection. Proper nutrition&#xD;
      management can therefore assist in preventing further nutritional imbalances.&#xD;
