  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying how well monoclonal antibody therapy with peripheral stem cell&#xD;
      transplant works in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of&#xD;
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry&#xD;
      cancer-killing substances to them. Peripheral stem cell transplant may allow the doctor to&#xD;
      give higher doses of monoclonal antibodies and kill more cancer cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of IDEC-Y2B8 when administered with rituximab in&#xD;
      vivo purging and autologous stem cell rescue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain correlative laboratory data of in vivo purging with rituximab in patients with&#xD;
      0-35% marrow involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan&#xD;
      (IDEC-Y2B8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART I: Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1&#xD;
      hour on day 25. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning on day&#xD;
      26 and continuing until autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART II: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of the fourth rituximab infusion, patients&#xD;
      receive indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 1 followed by dosimetry&#xD;
      imaging on days 1, 2, 4, and 7. Patients then receive IDEC-Y2B8 IV over 10 minutes once&#xD;
      between days 8-15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial 3 patients receive the same dose of IDEC-Y2B8 and then subsequent cohorts of 3-5&#xD;
      patients receive escalating doses of IDEC-Y2B8 until the maximum tolerated dose is&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART III: All patients undergo PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) beginning after residual bone&#xD;
      marrow radioactivity resolves. G-CSF is administered SC beginning 1 day after PBSCT and&#xD;
      continuing until blood counts recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
