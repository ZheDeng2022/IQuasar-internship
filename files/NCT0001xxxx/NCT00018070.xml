    <textblock>
      This study will try to identify and treat feeder vessels in age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;
      The macula is the part of the retina in the back of the eye that determines central or best&#xD;
      vision. In macular degeneration, leaking blood vessels under the macula lead to loss of&#xD;
      central vision. These vessels branch out tree-like from one or more feeder vessels. Instead&#xD;
      of treating all the abnormal branching vessels, this study will try to find and close only&#xD;
      the feeder vessels, thereby depriving the abnormal vessels of nutrition. The vessels will be&#xD;
      closed with laser beam treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 50 years of age and older with macular degeneration and visual acuity worse than 20/50&#xD;
      in the study eye and the same or better vision in the other eye may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates will undergo fluorescein angiography to try to locate feeder vessels. For&#xD;
      this procedure, a yellow dye is injected into an arm vein. The dye travels to the blood&#xD;
      vessels in the eyes, and pictures of the retina are taken using a camera that flashes a blue&#xD;
      light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina,&#xD;
      indicating possible blood vessel abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before laser treatment, participants will have a complete eye examination, including&#xD;
      measurement of visual acuity, evaluation of the front part of the eye with a slit lamp&#xD;
      microscope, examination of the retina with an ophthalmoscope, and measurement of eye pressure&#xD;
      using a tonometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the laser treatment phase of the study, participants will have indocyanine green&#xD;
      angiography-a procedure similar to fluorescein angiography, but using a green dye-to&#xD;
      photograph the retina and identify feeder vessels. If feeder vessels are located, laser beam&#xD;
      treatment will begin. For this procedure, the eye is anesthetized with numbing drops. A&#xD;
      special contact lens is then placed on the eye for the laser treatment. The number of&#xD;
      treatments depends on how well the individual patient responds, but usually between two and&#xD;
      eight treatments are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indocyanine green angiogram will be repeated after the laser beam treatment to determine&#xD;
      if the feeder vessels have been successfully closed. If the vessels remain partially open, a&#xD;
      repeat application will be done, followed by another indocyanine green angiogram to check the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be checked in the clinic after 1 week to see if additional treatment is needed.&#xD;
      If so, re-treatment will be done in a week. If no re-treatment is required, follow-up visits&#xD;
      will be scheduled 2, 3, and 6 weeks after treatment, 3 and 6 months after treatment, and&#xD;
      every 6 months after that for 2 years to evaluate treatment results. The evaluations will&#xD;
      include fluorescein angiograms and other examinations that were done before starting&#xD;
      treatment. If abnormal vessels are still present or growing, repeat treatments will be&#xD;
      applied following the same procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the most common cause of blindness in&#xD;
      patients over the age of 60. Most vision loss in this disease results from sequelae of&#xD;
      choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) formation. CNVM is usually composed of well-formed&#xD;
      neovascularization and occult (less well-formed) neovascularization. While clinical trials&#xD;
      have shown that some patients, mostly those with well-formed CNVM, may benefit from laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation or photodynamic therapy, at present there is no treatment for patients who&#xD;
      have combined CNVM lesions (both well-formed and occult) whose area of occult&#xD;
      neovascularization is greater than 50% or who have other presentation of CNVM such as&#xD;
      pigment-epithelial detachment or neovascular fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal histopathology of patients with choroidal neovascularization has revealed that areas&#xD;
      of CNVM are usually fed by a few smaller choroidal feeder vessels originating from the&#xD;
      choroid or choriocapillaris. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that closure of these feeder&#xD;
      vessels would infarct the large CNVM complex. Until recently, identification of these feeder&#xD;
      vessels has been difficult but new high speed indocyanine imaging of the choroid (Phi-motion)&#xD;
      indocyanine green angiography (ICG) has allowed for more precise detection of these vessels.&#xD;
      We will test this hypothesis by utilizing Phi-motion ICG to identify choroidal feeder vessels&#xD;
      in patients with CNVM not amenable to approved treatments. If feeder vessels are identified,&#xD;
      then pulse-diode laser photocoagulation will be used to attempt closure of these vessels. The&#xD;
      study is designed to provide information on the feasibility of standardizing this procedure&#xD;
      and estimating its potential efficacy. The primary outcome will be a greater than 50%&#xD;
      reduction in the area of leakage from the neovascular component as determined by fluorescein&#xD;
      angiogram. Secondary outcomes will include a complete resolution of leakage measured by&#xD;
      fluorescein angiography, the number of repetitive laser treatments undergone, the number of&#xD;
      patients eligible by fluorescein angiogram but without identifiable feeder vessels, and the&#xD;
      number of patients with vision loss, from baseline, of 15 letters or more, 30 letters or&#xD;
      more, or are reduced to less than 5 letters read. All adverse events regardless of severity&#xD;
      or relatedness to the therapy will be collected and summarized. Assessment of all outcomes&#xD;
      will be made at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post laser treatment, and 24 months&#xD;
      after enrollment. This study will give investigators some insight into this technology and&#xD;
      the feasibility of this treatment in patients with various forms of neovascular AMD. In&#xD;
      addition, the results of the study will provide the foundation for larger studies of this&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. To participate in this study, the patient must understand and sign the protocol&#xD;
                  informed consent.&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. In at least one eye, diagnosis of AMD defined by the presence of drusen larger&#xD;
                  than 63 microm and the presence of choroidal neovascularization under the fovea&#xD;
                  determined by the Principal Investigator and defined as any one of the following&#xD;
                  fluorescein angiographic features:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Early stippled hyperfluorescence of flat retinal pigment epithelium with&#xD;
                       ill-defined boundary and little or mild leakage in the late frames of the&#xD;
                       fluorescein.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Irregular elevation of the retinal pigment epithelium that does not exhibit&#xD;
                       discrete or bright hyperfluorescence in the early transit phase of the&#xD;
                       angiogram. Stippled hyperfluorescence may be present. Late frames may show&#xD;
                       persistent fluorescein staining or leakage within a sensory retinal&#xD;
                       detachment overlying this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Early well-defined lacy hyperfluorescence with late frames that show&#xD;
                       persistent fluorescein staining or leakage.&#xD;

                    4. Early filling of fluorescein beneath the retinal pigment epithelium with&#xD;
                       progressive filling during the study and persistent leakage/staining of the&#xD;
                       space. This may be associated with a &quot;notch&quot; at the borders, areas of more&#xD;
                       localized leakage at the edge or irregular filling of the area with discrete&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Decreased vision, in the study eye, due to retinal disease not attributable to CNVM,&#xD;
