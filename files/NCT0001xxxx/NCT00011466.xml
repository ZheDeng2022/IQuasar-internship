  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific nutrient deficiencies have been described in children with ADHD including zinc,&#xD;
      magnesium, calcium, and essential fatty acids. In addition, children with ADHD have been&#xD;
      noted to behave and concentrate better in some studies when the ratio of protein compared&#xD;
      with carbohydrate in their diets was increased, however, this was anecdotal information noted&#xD;
      from studies designed to study other factors, so its not clear if the increased protein is&#xD;
      actually the cause of the improved behavior. In our clinical practice, we have noted a high&#xD;
      incidence of what appears to be carbohydrate &quot;craving&quot; among children with ADHD, which can&#xD;
      put children at risk for obesity, diabetes type II, and additional dysregulation of mood and&#xD;
      concentration. Carbohydrate craving is a well-documented phenomenon in adults, particularly&#xD;
      those with certain patterns of obesity, mood disorders, or those undergoing smoking cessation&#xD;
      programs. It has not been studied in children, however. Thus, this initial study was designed&#xD;
      to determine 1) whether or not children with ADHD have different patterns of nutrient intake&#xD;
      compared with children in the same family and children in families without a child with ADHD,&#xD;
      2) if the described nutrient deficiencies are due to decreased intake, and 3) whether there&#xD;
      is an increased occurrence of carbohydrate craving, based on parents' perceptions, eating&#xD;
      patterns, and actual intake, among children (or certain subgroups of children) with ADHD. The&#xD;
      information gained from this study will be used to design additional studies to test&#xD;
      causative hypotheses and intervention strategies.&#xD;

      Three day prospective diet records will be completed on 25 children aged 5-13 with ADHD,&#xD;
      their sibling controls, and 25 children from control families without ADHD in order to assess&#xD;
      their protein, carbohydrate, fat, calorie, and multiple specific nutrient intakes. In&#xD;
      addition, a questionnaire will be completed on each child describing several aspects of&#xD;
      eating behavior, food choices, and gastrointestinal, allergic, and infectious concomitants.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Children with ADHD (combined or hyperactive-impulsive subtype) by Parent and Teacher Rating&#xD;
        Scales, history, and interview who do not have a medical or neurologic problem that&#xD;
        influences eating, who are not on medication for ADHD or another medication that may&#xD;
        influence eating, aged 5-13 years with a sibling in the same age range meeting the same&#xD;
        criteria but without ADHD. This sibling must have a normal Parent Rating Scale and not have&#xD;
        been held back in school or been on medication or diagnosed with a learning, developmental,&#xD;
        or neuropsychiatric disorder. Controls must meet the same criteria, and may not have a&#xD;
        first-degree relative with ADHD. All participants must have a normal intellect, and may not&#xD;
        have an autistic spectrum disorder or major depression.&#xD;
