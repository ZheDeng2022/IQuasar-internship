      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune&#xD;
      response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients&#xD;
      who have stage IV or recurrent melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety of immunization with autologous in vitro-treated tumor cells and&#xD;
           dendritic cells in combination with sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with stage IV or&#xD;
           recurrent melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the frequency of conversion of delayed tumor hypersensitivity tests in&#xD;
           patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with this&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with measurable melanoma treated&#xD;
           with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to presence of measurable disease at study&#xD;
      initiation (yes vs no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo tumor cell harvest. Patients with multiple persistent sites of metastatic&#xD;
      disease after harvest may receive systemic therapy (biologic therapy and/or chemotherapy)&#xD;
      during tumor cell line expansion over approximately 4 months. The tumor cell line is&#xD;
      expanded, irradiated, and treated with interferon gamma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to obtain&#xD;
      dendritic cells (DC). The PBMC are treated with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 for 7&#xD;
      days to produce DC. The DC are then cultured with the treated tumor cells for 18 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo delayed tumor hypersensitivity tests intradermally 1 week prior to&#xD;
      vaccination and again at week 4. Patients receive vaccine therapy comprising autologous&#xD;
      treated tumor cells and dendritic cells suspended in GM-CSF subcutaneously weekly for 3&#xD;
      weeks. Vaccine therapy continues monthly for an additional 5 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-80 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
