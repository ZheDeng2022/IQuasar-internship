  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of the drug flumazenil on brain excitability and the&#xD;
      drug's relationship to a natural brain chemical called GABA. Flumazenil is commonly used in&#xD;
      hospitals to reverse the effects of a group of drugs called benzodiazepines, one of which is&#xD;
      Valium. Benzodiazepines act by enhancing the effects of GABA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 21 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will&#xD;
      be screened with a medical history and physical and neurological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) four times on two different&#xD;
      days, before and after receiving an intravenous (through a vein) infusion of either&#xD;
      flumazenil or placebo (an inactive sugar solution), as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS study 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug or placebo infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS study 2 - 15 minutes after infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS study 3 - 60 minutes after infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS study 4 - 120 minutes after infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      In transcranial magnetic stimulation, a very brief electrical current is passed through an&#xD;
      insulated coil wire placed on the scalp. These currents stimulate the cortex (outer part of&#xD;
      the brain). They may cause muscle, hand, or arm twitching if the coil is near the part of the&#xD;
      brain that controls movement, or they may affect other reflexes or movements. During the&#xD;
      study, subjects may be asked to make movements, do simple tasks or tense muscles. To record&#xD;
      the electrical activity of muscles, electrodes will be taped to the skin over the muscles&#xD;
      tested. In some cases, the studies will be videotaped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flumazenil will be infused through a catheter (thin plastic tube) attached to a needle placed&#xD;
      in an arm vein. On one day, subjects will receive a 1-mg injection of flumazenil followed by&#xD;
      a continuous infusion of 0.5 mg of the drug for about 30 minutes. On the other day, they will&#xD;
      receive placebo, administered in the same manner.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of flumazenil on cortical&#xD;
      excitability in healthy human volunteers. Flumazenil acts as a potent benzodiazepine&#xD;
      (BZP)-specific antagonist by competing at the central synaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)&#xD;
      receptor site. However, the relationship between GABA and flumazenil without BZPs is not well&#xD;
      known. We plan to determine if intravenous (IV) administration in therapeutic dosage alters&#xD;
      cortical excitability as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The long-term&#xD;
      plan is to identify a pharmacological method to reduce cortical inhibition that might be&#xD;
      useful in stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;
