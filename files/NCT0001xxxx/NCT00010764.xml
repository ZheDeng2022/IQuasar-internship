  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM), one of the most common rheumatic conditions, is a condition of unknown&#xD;
      etiology characterized by widespread muscle pain and stiffness. Treatment is generally&#xD;
      unsatisfactory and most randomized, controlled treatment trials have been unable to&#xD;
      demonstrate a sustained effective intervention. A single, brief trial of electroacupuncture&#xD;
      demonstrated remarkable improvement among patients with FM, although lasting effects were not&#xD;
      evaluated. Nonetheless, the recently published National Institutes of Health Consensus&#xD;
      Development Statement on Acupuncture says &quot;musculoskeletal conditions such as fibromyalgia,&#xD;
      myofascial pain ....are conditions for which acupuncture may be beneficial&quot;. Thus, 96&#xD;
      patients will be recruited from a referral clinic for fatigue for a 12 week (24 treatments)&#xD;
      trial. These patients will be randomized into 3 control groups and 1 &quot;true&quot; acupuncture&#xD;
      group. The control groups will consist of a group receiving acupuncture treatment for an&#xD;
      unrelated condition (morning sickness), a group receiving needle insertion at non-channel,&#xD;
      non-point locations, and a &quot;true&quot; placebo group. This latter group will have acupuncture&#xD;
      needle guides tapped on the skin, then needles tapped. Thus, the specific aims of this study&#xD;
      are to 1) evaluate the short and long term efficacy and side effects of a 12 week randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial of bi-weekly acupuncture in the treatment of FM; 2) establish the most&#xD;
      useful and scientifically sound control group for studies of acupuncture using FM as a model&#xD;
      for conditions characterized by chronic pain; 3) use both subjective and objective measures&#xD;
      of overall health and pain to determine the optimal time length of treatment; and 4) examine&#xD;
      the concordance of allopathic and acupuncture-based measures of outcome. For the purposes of&#xD;
      this study, subjects will be asked to complete a unique set of study measures at enrollment,&#xD;
      at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and then again at 1 and 6 months post-treatment. Our primary outcomes&#xD;
      will be patient global assessment, subjective pain, and mean number of tender points.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be pain threshold, analgesic use, physician global assessment,&#xD;
      functional status, sleep, psychological distress, and fatigue. Thus, this trial will have&#xD;
      both immediate and longer term implications for the scientific study of acupuncture as well&#xD;
      as the clinical care of the estimated 5 million patients with FM in the US. From a&#xD;
      methodological point of view, the proposed trial will establish the most appropriate methods&#xD;
      for choosing a control group should larger trials be conducted, suggest the optimum duration&#xD;
      of treatment, and evaluate the utility of diverse allopathic and alternative outcome&#xD;
      measures. Of equal importance, however, this research will test and potentially establish the&#xD;
      effectiveness of acupuncture.&#xD;
