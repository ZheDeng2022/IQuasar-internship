      The purpose of this study is to attempt to identify possible dangerous interactions between&#xD;
      cocaine and methylphenidate (MPD). Additional objectives are to determine: a) if MPD reduces&#xD;
      the craving and high for cocaine; b) if there are pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      interactions between cocaine and MPD; and c) the relationship between cocaine and&#xD;
      benzoylecgonine (BE) levels in plasma and BE levels in urine.&#xD;

      This study was conducted to evaluate the cardiovascular risk of prescribing up to 90 mg of&#xD;
      methylphenidate (MPD) daily for treating cocaine dependence. This within-subject study was&#xD;
      completed in an inpatient setting. It was non-blinded for MPD dose and single-blinded for&#xD;
      cocaine dose. Each patient was given intravenous cocaine at 0, 20 and 40 mg while at three&#xD;
      different steady state levels of MPD (0, 60 and 90 mg). Seven non-treatment seeking cocaine&#xD;
      addicts, who were recruited from the community, completed the study. There were no cardiac&#xD;
      rhythm abnormalities noted except for sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia. There were no&#xD;
      incidences of seizures or myocardial ischemia. In a repeated measures ANOVA, MPD was shown to&#xD;
      have an independent positive effect on heart rate (p=0.0001) but not on SBP or DBP. There was&#xD;
      no cocaine by MPD interaction for any vital sign. Peak systolic blood pressure (SBP) and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for any patient up to 60 minutes after infusion was 169 mm and&#xD;
      108 mm, respectively. The first occurred when 60 mg of MPD and placebo cocaine were given and&#xD;
      the second when no MPD and placebo cocaine were given. Peak heart rate for any patient up to&#xD;
      60 min after infusion was 143/min at 60 mg of MPD and 40mg of cocaine. The number of adverse&#xD;
      events reported when cocaine and MPD were given together was less than the number reported&#xD;
      when either drug was given alone. The adverse events reported when cocaine and MPD were given&#xD;
      together included headache, nervousness, and lightheadedness. Subjective ratings of drug&#xD;
      effect revealed that MPD did not enhance patients' response to, or desire for, cocaine. MPD&#xD;
      appears to be a safe drug to use in cocaine addicts who continue to use cocaine at the&#xD;
      dosages tested.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. currently use cocaine by smoked or intravenous route of administration and confirmed&#xD;

             subjects will have a serum pregnancy test performed prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. be capable of providing written informed consent to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
