  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of the drug pirfenidone (Deskar) in improving heart&#xD;
      function in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Stiffening of the heart muscle&#xD;
      in patients with HCM impairs the heart's ability to relax and thus fill and empty properly.&#xD;
      This can lead to heart failure, breathlessness and excessive fatigue. The heart's inability&#xD;
      to relax may be due to scarring, or fibrosis, in the muscle wall. This study will test&#xD;
      whether pirfenidone can reduce fibrosis, improve heart relaxation and reduce abnormal heart&#xD;
      rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women 20 to 75 years old with HCM may be eligible for this study. Participants will&#xD;
      undergo a physical examination, blood tests, and other tests and procedures, described below,&#xD;
      to assess heart function. When the tests are completed, patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two treatment groups. One group will take a pirfenidone capsule and the other will&#xD;
      take a placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredient) twice a day with meals for 6&#xD;
      months. For the pirfenidone group, the dose of drug will be increased gradually from 400 to&#xD;
      800 milligrams. At the end of 6 months, all patients will repeat the physical examination and&#xD;
      heart tests that were done before starting medication. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) - electrodes are attached to the heart to record the heart's&#xD;
           electrical activity, providing information on the heartbeat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram - a probe held against the chest wall uses sound waves to produce images&#xD;
           of the heart, providing information on the function of the heart chambers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour Holter monitor - a 24-hour recording of the electrical activity of the heart&#xD;
           monitors for abnormal heartbeats or conduction abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - Radiowaves and a strong magnetic field are used to&#xD;
           produce images of the heart, providing information on the thickness and movement of the&#xD;
           heart muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radionuclide angiogram - a radioactive tracer is injected into a vein and a special&#xD;
           camera is used to scan the heart, providing information on the beating motion of the&#xD;
           heart. Scans are obtained at rest and after exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac (heart) catheterization - a catheter (thin plastic tube) is inserted into a&#xD;
           blood vessel in the groin and advanced to the heart to record pressures and take&#xD;
           pictures inside the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrophysiology study - a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and&#xD;
           advanced to the heart to record electrical activity, providing information on abnormal&#xD;
           heart rhythms. This procedure is done at the time of the heart catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac biopsy - a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and advanced to&#xD;
           the heart to remove a small sample of heart muscle for microscopic examination. This&#xD;
           procedure is done at the end of the heart catheterization.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias are important causes of morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in HCM. These abnormalities are believed to be in part due to myocardial&#xD;
      fibrosis which frequently complicates HCM. Several studies indicate that pirfenidine can&#xD;
      safely inhibit progression or cause regression of fibrotic lesions. We therefore propose to&#xD;
      perform a six-month study that examines the ability of pirfenidone to improve LV diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, exercise performance, and electrophysiologic abnormalities in symptomatic&#xD;
      patients with severe HCM.&#xD;
