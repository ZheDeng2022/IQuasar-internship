  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if 2 doses of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV)&#xD;
      followed by 1 dose of Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPV) in HIV-infected children on&#xD;
      anti-HIV therapy is helpful and safe in fighting pneumococcal infections in this group of&#xD;
      children. This study will also look at the protection provided by childhood vaccination&#xD;
      against measles, pertussis, and hepatitis B virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumococcal infections are the most common AIDS-related infection in HIV-infected children.&#xD;
      PCV may help reduce the chances of HIV-infected children getting pneumococcal infections.&#xD;
      This study will look at whether pneumococcal vaccines are safe and effective in HIV-infected&#xD;
      children receiving HAART. It will look at whether HIV-infected children are protected by&#xD;
      childhood vaccines received previously and if more doses are safe and improve protection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent opportunistic infection observed&#xD;
      in HIV-infected children. PCVs are immunogenic and efficacious in normal children and offer&#xD;
      hope of reducing pneumococcal infections in HIV-infected children. The degree to which&#xD;
      children on HAART are protected by prior immunizations and are responsive to new&#xD;
      immunizations is still largely undefined. This study is designed to answer whether PCV&#xD;
      immunizations are safe and effective. The immune responses to prior immunizations and&#xD;
      responsiveness to booster doses of vaccines against measles, pertussis, and hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      of children on HAART will also be examined. Answers to these questions will determine whether&#xD;
      these children are likely to be protected against these clinically relevant pathogens and&#xD;
      whether they should routinely receive booster doses of these vaccines after a period of&#xD;
      HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are stratified on the basis of CD4 percentage and age. Patients that previously&#xD;
      received a primary hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) series receive an HBV immunization at entry.&#xD;
      Other vaccinations may be given (based on age and/or CD4 cell measurement, and immunization&#xD;
      status) for PCV at entry and 2 months, and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and PPV at 4&#xD;
      months. Some patients may be administered DTaP at a 6-month visit on the basis of age,&#xD;
      previous immunization history, and negative tetanus antibody status. Follow-up visits are&#xD;
      done at 8, 12, and 24 months. Blood samples are collected at all clinic visits for assessment&#xD;
      of HIV RNA, immune responses against pneumococcus, measles, pertussis, and hepatitis B virus,&#xD;
      as well as for laboratory evaluations.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are 2 to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) under 60,000 copies/ml within 30 days&#xD;
             of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been on their current anti-HIV drugs for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received 4 or more doses of a pertussis vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received 1 or more doses of measles vaccine unless a CD4 percent or CD4 number&#xD;
             ruled out taking the vaccine. (This reflects a change in the CD4 requirement.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expect to be able to complete all study injections and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a negative pregnancy test if able to have children and use effective methods of&#xD;
             birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have parent or guardian's consent if under 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received an approved hepatitis B vaccine series. Not required for study entry,&#xD;
             but children who have received this vaccine will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (This study was changed to allow patients who became HIV infected after birth, have a&#xD;
             viral load between 30,000 and 60,000 copies/ml, and who have been on their current&#xD;
             anti-HIV drugs for 3 to 6 months.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any other disease or previous surgery that would interfere with study treatment.&#xD;
