      This study will examine and compare the effects of intense exercise on the release of&#xD;
      catecholamines in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and in healthy persons.&#xD;
      Catecholamines are hormones (adrenaline and noradrenaline) that are produced by the adrenal&#xD;
      glands and released into the blood stream during stress, such as trauma, illness, intense&#xD;
      exercise, or low blood sugar. The study will also assess exercise tolerance in patients with&#xD;
      CAH, compared with healthy persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CAH between the ages of 10 and 40 years who are managing well on standard&#xD;
      treatment (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids) may be eligible for this study. Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers that match the enrolled patients in age, sex, race and body fat will be recruited&#xD;
      as control subjects. All candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination and electrocardiogram (EKG). Body fat will be measured using an instrument called&#xD;
      a Bod Pod. The body fat measurement has two parts: first, the subject sits quietly in a large&#xD;
      egg-shaped capsule for about 2 to 3 minutes; then the subject breathes into a plastic tube&#xD;
      for one minute, followed by three quick panting breaths. Women will have a urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test; pregnant women cannot participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo three exercise sessions on separate consecutive mornings after&#xD;
      fasting overnight. Before each test, patients (not healthy volunteers) will take either an&#xD;
      additional morning dose of hydrocortisone or a placebo (a lookalike pill with no active&#xD;
      ingredient). Before each test a thin catheter (plastic tube) will be placed into an arm vein&#xD;
      through a needle. A numbing cream can be applied to make the needle stick hurt less. Blood&#xD;
      will be drawn through this intravenous (IV) line before, during and after the exercise tests.&#xD;
      The first test is a maximal exercise test to determine the individual's maximum exercise&#xD;
      fitness capacity. The second two and third tests are a standardized exercise tests. Before&#xD;
      the two standardized tests, patients (not healthy volunteers) will take either an additional&#xD;
      morning dose of hydrocortisone or a placebo (a lookalike pill with no active ingredient). All&#xD;
      tests are done on a stationary bicycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal Exercise Test - The subject pedals on a stationary bicycle for about 10 minutes.&#xD;
      After a 3-minute warm-up, the workload is increased continuously until either the subject can&#xD;
      no longer continue or the physician stops the test for medical reasons. During the exercise,&#xD;
      heart rate and heart activity are monitored with an EKG, and the subject wears a nose clip&#xD;
      and mouthpiece connected to a breathing tube to measure oxygen use. Blood is drawn before and&#xD;
      during the test, totaling no more than 2 tablespoons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized Exercise Test - The subject pedals on a stationary bicycle for 20 minutes, while&#xD;
      wearing the nose clip and mouthpiece to measure oxygen use. For the first 5 minutes, the&#xD;
      subject pedals at a speed that elicits 50 percent of maximal effort (determined by the&#xD;
      maximal exercise test); the next 10 minutes are at 70 percent of maximal effort; and the last&#xD;
      5 minutes are at 90 percent. Blood samples drawn before, during (at 15 and 20 minutes) and&#xD;
      after exercise (at 30, 40 and 60 minutes) total less than 1/2 cup. Heart rate and heart&#xD;
      activity are monitored during the test with an EKG, and temperature is measured before and at&#xD;
      the end of the test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) denotes a family of inherited disorders with defects in&#xD;
      the cortisol biosynthesis. CAH has been traditionally considered a disease restricted to the&#xD;
      adrenal cortex. However, recently observed abnormal adrenomedullary structures in three&#xD;
      adrenalectomized patients with classic CAH, as well as low baseline urinary and plasma&#xD;
      epinephrine levels in children with CAH suggest that this condition is associated with marked&#xD;
      morphological and functional abnormalities of the adrenal medulla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adrenal medulla synthesizes and secretes catecholamines, mainly epinephrine.&#xD;
      Catecholamines influence virtually all tissues. Yet, the clinical implications of epinephrine&#xD;
      deficiency in humans are not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term intense exercise is a natural, quantifiable stimulus of the adrenal cortex and&#xD;
      medulla as well as of the sympathetic nervous system. We would like to employ a standard&#xD;
      cycle ergometer exercise protocol to study the adrenomedullary and systemic sympathetic&#xD;
      function of patients with CAH. This protocol has been run by the Clinical Center&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Medicine Department (RMD) for 10 years. No serious adverse effects have been&#xD;
      observed or reported in adults and children with a healthy cardiovascular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this protocol is to evaluate adrenomedullary and systemic sympathetic function&#xD;
      and exercise tolerance in patients with CAH and in appropriately matched healthy controls&#xD;
      using the above standardized cycle ergometer test. Subjects with CAH will exercise with and&#xD;
      without doubling their morning dose of hydrocortisone to evaluate whether impairments - if&#xD;
      present - can be corrected by a &quot;stress dose&quot; of hydrocortisone. We hypothesize that subjects&#xD;
      with CAH have a reduced epinephrine reserve and impaired exercise tolerance, which can at&#xD;
      least partially, be corrected by an increase in exogenous hydrocortisone. We will also&#xD;
      determine whether the systemic sympathetic nervous system compensates for the adrenomedullary&#xD;
      deficiency as observed in states of acquired adrenal insufficiency. The results of this study&#xD;
      will increase the understanding of the physiologic interactions between adrenal cortex and&#xD;
      adrenal medulla.&#xD;
