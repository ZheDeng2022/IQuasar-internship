  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the best ways to collect, process and store umbilical cord blood&#xD;
      from babies with sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait and unaffected babies. Sickle cell&#xD;
      disease is an abnormality of the hemoglobin in red blood cells that causes the cells to&#xD;
      change shape and clump together, preventing their normal flow in the bloodstream. This&#xD;
      impairs blood flow to various organs, and the resulting oxygen deprivation causes organ&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cord blood is rich in stem cells (cells produced in the bone marrow that mature to different&#xD;
      types of blood cells), which may prove useful in new sickle cell therapies. However, cord&#xD;
      blood from babies with sickle cell trait, sickle cell disease and normal babies may act&#xD;
      differently under laboratory conditions, so it is important to learn how best to work with&#xD;
      blood from all three groups of babies for future use in possible treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women between 18 and 45 years of age who are at risk of having an infant with sickle&#xD;
      cell disease and normal volunteers who are pregnant and not at risk for this disease may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Potential participants will be counseled about donating her infant s&#xD;
      blood in order to make an informed choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women who participate in the study will provide a medical history and have blood&#xD;
      collected from the umbilical cord and placenta (afterbirth) after the baby s delivery. The&#xD;
      blood will be tested for various infectious diseases, processed, frozen and stored for&#xD;
      research purposes. In addition, blood from women with babies at risk for sickle cell disease&#xD;
      will be tested for the presence of the sickle cell gene, tissue typed, and used for research&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sickle cell disease If cord blood tests show the baby has sickle cell disease, the blood&#xD;
           will be frozen for an indefinite period of time for possible use in future treatment of&#xD;
           the child. This treatment could include stem cell transplantation or gene therapy,&#xD;
           treatments are not currently considered routine for sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sickle cell trait or normal hemoglobin If cord blood tests show the baby has sickle cell&#xD;
           trait or is unaffected, the blood will be processed and stored for up to 3 years, during&#xD;
           which time it may possibly be used to treat a currently living or future sibling with&#xD;
           sickle cell disease. After 3 years, the participant may agree to either have the blood&#xD;
           discarded, given to research or moved to another facility for continued storage at the&#xD;
           participant s expense, if there is a storage fee. Alternatively, if there is no&#xD;
           anticipated future need for the collected blood, or if it does not meet standards needed&#xD;
           for future treatment, it will be used in NIH-approved research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and their family doctor or the baby s pediatrician will be contacted twice a&#xD;
      year for information about changes in the baby s health. Participants may also be asked&#xD;
      permission to perform new tests developed by researchers.&#xD;

      Umbilical cord blood is a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for transplantation or&#xD;
      gene therapy. Our goal is to procure umbilical cord blood (UCB) from newborns at risk for&#xD;
      sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait, and related disorders as well as normal newborns and&#xD;
      store clinical grade cord blood units (CBU) for future use in clinical transplantation or&#xD;
      gene therapy. Cord blood units will be collected from an indefinite number of subjects until&#xD;
      50 CBU from newborns with homozygous sickle cell disease have been cryopreserved. Maternal&#xD;
      subjects will be identified as being at risk to have an infant with sickle cell disease, will&#xD;
      be between the ages of 18 and 45 years, and will meet specified medical history criteria.&#xD;
      Mothers will have to deliver at INOVA Fairfax Hospital (collection provider site) and the CB&#xD;
      will be collected by NCBP collectors ex utero, will be transported to the NCBP CB facility&#xD;
      and will be processed, tested and stored. Frozen CBU will be transferred to the NIH for&#xD;
      clinical transplantation or gene therapy studies upon NIH request.&#xD;

        This is a pilot feasibility study for which umbilical cord blood samples will be collected&#xD;
        and transported to the NIH Clinical Center for our developmental research. Pregnant women&#xD;
        whose babies are at risk for sickle cell anemia will be identified and referred to the NIH&#xD;
        Research Coordinator for evaluation and entry into the study. The NIH Research Coordinator&#xD;
        is experienced in performing patient education and counseling concerning sickle cell&#xD;
        disease, and obtaining informed consent.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Maternal subjects in active labor will be enrolled at the discretion of her&#xD;
                  physician. (Note: in rare cases that a mother is identified as a potential&#xD;
                  candidate for the study during labor, it is at the discretion of her physician&#xD;
                  whether she could be in a condition to discuss about the study and provide&#xD;
                  informed consent (then IFH has to obtain the Informed Consent). After labor and&#xD;
                  delivery, the study will be discussed again with the mother.)&#xD;
