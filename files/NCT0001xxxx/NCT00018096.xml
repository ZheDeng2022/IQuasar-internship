  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, we hypothesize that polymorphisms of genes expressed by the airway epithelia&#xD;
      in asthmatics following specific airway challenges predispose individuals to the development&#xD;
      of asthma. To test this hypothesis, we identify the genes that are differentially expressed&#xD;
      by airway epithelial cells following challenge with stimuli that induce acquired (house dust&#xD;
      mite) or innate (LPS) immune responses, and then determine whether polymorphisms in these&#xD;
      genes are associated with the development of asthma in a separate, well characterized,&#xD;
      familial cohort of asthmatics. This is a powerful approach that is designed to identify novel&#xD;
      genes that are associated with both asthma pathogenesis (differentially expressed in the&#xD;
      exposure-response study) and asthma susceptibility (genetically associated with asthma in a&#xD;
      linkage/association study).&#xD;

      The overall goal of this project is to identify genes that are involved in the development of&#xD;
      airflow obstruction and airway inflammation in asthmatics, and to determine whether&#xD;
      polymorphisms in these differentially expressed genes predispose individuals to develop&#xD;
      asthma. Asthma is a complex genetic disorder that is caused by a number of unique gene-gene&#xD;
      and gene-environment interactions. The search for asthma susceptibility genes has been&#xD;
      complicated by the broad clinical phenotype of asthma, the polygenic inheritance pattern of&#xD;
      this disease, and the substantial role of environmental exposures in the development and&#xD;
      progression of asthma. Inhaled environmental agents induce several biologic responses in&#xD;
      asthmatics; including the induction of acquired and innate immunity that leads to acute and&#xD;
      chronic forms of airway inflammation and airway remodeling. Acquired immune responses to&#xD;
      protein antigens, such as house dust mite allergen, often induce type 2 T lymphocyte-driven&#xD;
      responses (Th2) which appear to be important in atopic asthma. Recent studies by our group&#xD;
      and others demonstrate that innate immunity, initiated by inhalation of bacterial and viral&#xD;
      pathogens, organic dusts, endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), air pollution particulate&#xD;
      matter, and ozone, can also cause acute and chronic forms of airflow obstruction, airway&#xD;
      inflammation, and even airway remodeling. Emerging evidence indicates that both acquired and&#xD;
      innate immune responses in the lung may be influenced by polymorphic genes. For instance,&#xD;
      functional polymorphisms in the IL-4 receptor gene are thought to preferentially stimulate&#xD;
      acquired Th2 immune responses to inhaled allergens, and we have recently shown that common&#xD;
      co-segregating mutations in TLR4 (a transmembrane receptor for LPS) are associated with&#xD;
      diminished airway responsiveness to inhaled LPS. These observations suggest that&#xD;
      environmental challenges can be used to narrow the phenotype of asthma and investigate&#xD;
      genetic susceptibility in biologically specific forms of asthma.&#xD;
