  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if there are any bad effects when BufferGel or PRO&#xD;
      2000/5 Gel are applied to the penis of HIV-infected men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbicides are products to be used by women for placing into the vagina to prevent passing&#xD;
      HIV from 1 person to another during sex. Studies have shown 2 investigational microbicides,&#xD;
      BufferGel and PRO 2000/5 Gel, to be safe and acceptable for women and HIV-negative men. It is&#xD;
      important to see if the side effects of these products are the same in men as those in women&#xD;
      and to see if there is any difference in the side effects between circumcised and&#xD;
      uncircumcised men.&#xD;

      Topical microbicides are products designed to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV and&#xD;
      other disease pathogens. Studies have shown that nonoxynol-9, a detergent microbicide, can&#xD;
      cause mucosal erosion and ulceration and increased risk of HIV infection. Attention has been&#xD;
      given to developing non-detergent topical microbicides, such as BufferGel and PRO 2000/5 Gel.&#xD;
      Studies have shown these products to be safe and acceptable for vaginal use [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      08/20/01: &quot;however, none of the clinical studies to date have investigated the effects on the&#xD;
      penile epithelium and urethral mucosa&quot; has been replaced with: Phase I trials also have been&#xD;
      conducted to assess the safety of BufferGel and PRO 2000/5 Gel (P) on the penile epithelium&#xD;
      and urethral mucosa. In 1 trial, HIV-uninfected men applied either PRO 2000/5 or a gel&#xD;
      containing the inactive ingredients of PRO 2000/5 for 7 days. A few patients reported mild&#xD;
      symptoms of genital itching, tingling, irritation, dryness, discoloration, or flaking of the&#xD;
      dried gel. In a similar trial comparing BufferGel and K-Y Jelly, a few patients reported&#xD;
      similar symptoms.] It is important to determine whether the frequency and severity of adverse&#xD;
      events experienced by men is comparable to that observed among women. It is also important to&#xD;
      determine whether these adverse events are similar between circumcised and uncircumcised men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are assigned randomly to 1 of 6 possible sequences of product use. Patients complete&#xD;
      3 weeks of nightly product application (7 consecutive nights each of BufferGel, PRO 2000/5&#xD;
      Gel, and placebo gel) separated by a one-week washout between product-use periods. Patients&#xD;
      apply the gel to the shaft and glans of the penis at bedtime, leave on for a minimum of 6&#xD;
      hours, and wash off the next morning. Patients maintain a diary of product application and&#xD;
      removal, side effects, and use of other medications. Follow-up evaluations, including a&#xD;
      genital exam and urine testing, are performed after each product-use and washout period. [AS&#xD;
      PER AMENDMENT 08/20/01: Digital photographs will be taken of any observed abnormality or&#xD;
      normal area that is needed for clinical decision making and/or documentation purposes.] In&#xD;
      addition, adherence is assessed, the patient diary is reviewed, and product acceptability&#xD;
      questionnaires are administered after each product-use period. Patients receive monetary&#xD;
      compensation for participation.&#xD;
