    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety of a new genetically engineered antibody called hLL2&#xD;
      (epratuzumab) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It will also evaluate&#xD;
      whether hLL2 can lessen overall disease activity in SLE or kidney damage in patients with&#xD;
      lupus nephritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with mild to moderately active SLE may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates will be screened with blood and urine tests, a chest X-ray,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG), tuberculin skin test, and screening tests for certain cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive weekly infusions of hLL2 for 4 weeks. The drug is given through&#xD;
      a catheter (small plastic tube) placed through a needle in an arm vein. Each infusion takes&#xD;
      about 2 hours, after which the patient is observed in the clinic for 1 to 2 hours before&#xD;
      being discharged from the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 3 patients in the study will receive the lowest of three different doses used in&#xD;
      the study. If this dose is well tolerated, the next 5 patients will receive a higher dose. If&#xD;
      the second dose is tolerated, the last 5 patients will be given the highest dose. If any&#xD;
      serious problems are encountered at a dose, patients in the next group will receive either&#xD;
      the same or lower dose before being advanced to the next level. Patients in the first group&#xD;
      will continue taking prednisone at their regular dose. All other patients will have their&#xD;
      prednisone tapered gradually, if their condition permits. Patients who have a disease flare&#xD;
      may have their prednisone increased for up to 2 weeks, followed by a gradual taper. If the&#xD;
      flare is severe or does not respond to the increased prednisone, the patient will be taken&#xD;
      off the study and treated to control the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at various intervals for up to 8 weeks after the last dose.&#xD;
      Several of the screening tests will be repeated throughout the study. No more than 500 ml of&#xD;
      blood-the equivalent of a single blood donation-will be collected during a 2-month period.&#xD;
      Participants may also be asked to undergo the following optional procedures before starting&#xD;
      treatment, 1 week after the last dose and 8 weeks after the last treatment dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspiration - to collect cells from the bone marrow. The hip area is&#xD;
           anesthetized and a special needle is used to draw bone marrow from the hipbone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tonsil biopsy - The area to be biopsied is numbed with a local anesthetic and small&#xD;
           pieces of tissue will be removed with a special type of forceps. (The procedure may be&#xD;
           done under general anesthetic.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen - The patient lies on a table within a&#xD;
           metal cylinder (the MRI scanner) for about 30 to 40 minutes while images are obtained&#xD;
           with the use of a strong magnetic field and radio waves.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerance of hLL2 (epratuzumab), a humanized&#xD;
      anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-lymphocytes play a major role in initiating and maintaining the underlying&#xD;
      immunopathological mechanisms of SLE. In addition to producing autoantibodies, they also&#xD;
      serve as antigen presenting cells and are able to disrupt peripheral T lymphocyte tolerance.&#xD;
      Furthermore, B lymphocyte depletion ameliorates disease activity in animal models of SLE.&#xD;
      Therefore, targeted depletion of B-lymphocytes may be of therapeutic benefit in human SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      hLL2 (epratuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to CD22, a surface antigen&#xD;
      expressed exclusively on B-lymphocytes. Clinical studies in patients with B cell lymphomas&#xD;
      have shown that epratuzumab is safe and well tolerated across a wide range of doses. Although&#xD;
      the exact mechanism is unknown, indirect evidence suggests that the antibody is depleting&#xD;
      target B lymphocytes. Epratuzumab is made available by Immunomedics, Inc., and will be used&#xD;
      under an investigator (NIH)-initiated IND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open-label, Phase I study, up to 20 patients with moderately active SLE may be&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients will be treated with weekly infusions of hLL2 in one of three different&#xD;
      dosing groups [(240 mg/m(2), 360 mg/m(2), 480 mg/m(2)] for 4 weeks, and followed for 8 weeks&#xD;
      after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of hLL2 in patients with&#xD;
      SLE. In addition to safety data, clinical and laboratory data will also be collected for&#xD;
      preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of hLL2 in SLE and to assess the effect of hLL2&#xD;
      on B and T lymphocytes in the lymphoid organs and the peripheral blood. If the treatment is&#xD;
      safe and there is preliminary evidence of efficacy, this regimen could be used in controlled&#xD;
      trials in the future.&#xD;
