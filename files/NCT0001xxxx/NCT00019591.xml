      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response that will kill cancer cells.&#xD;
      Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or without&#xD;
      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the frequency of immunologic response in patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
           metastatic colorectal cancer treated with ras peptide-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine with&#xD;
           or without interleukin-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the tumor response and survival time in patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
           cancer treated with vaccine plus interleukin-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer&#xD;
           treated with adjuvant vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to extent of disease.&#xD;
      Patients with prior locally advanced disease are assigned to treatment group A, while those&#xD;
      with metastatic disease are assigned to treatment group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Patients are vaccinated against influenza on day -6. Patients undergo&#xD;
           collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) on day -4. The PBMC are cultured&#xD;
           with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 for 5 days and CD40 ligand for 24 hours and&#xD;
           then pulsed for 2 hours with the appropriate peptide to form a vaccine. Patients receive&#xD;
           ras peptide-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine IV over 5 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, 43, and&#xD;
           57.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Patients undergo collection of PBMC and receive vaccination as in group A.&#xD;
           Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously on days 2-6 and 9-13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment in both groups repeats every 2 weeks for up to 5 vaccinations in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed on days 75, 90, 120, and 365.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.&#xD;
