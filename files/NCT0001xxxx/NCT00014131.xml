      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a patient's white blood cells and tumor cells may make the body&#xD;
      build an immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients&#xD;
      who have recurrent or stage III or stage IV kidney cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety of immunization with in vitro-treated autologous tumor cells and&#xD;
           dendritic cells with sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with stage III or IV or recurrent&#xD;
           renal cell cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the frequency of conversion of delayed tumor hypersensitivity tests in these&#xD;
           patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of these patients treated with this&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients who still have measurable&#xD;
           disease at the time they are treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to measurable disease at the time vaccine therapy&#xD;
      is initiated (yes vs no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo tumor cell harvest. Patients with multiple persistent sites of metastatic&#xD;
      disease following harvest receive systemic therapy (biologic therapy and/or chemotherapy)&#xD;
      during tumor cell line expansion. Over 2-4 months, the tumor cell line is expanded, treated&#xD;
      with interferon gamma, and irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The PBMC&#xD;
      are incubated over 7 days with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 to produce dendritic&#xD;
      cells (DC). The DC are incubated over 2-3 days with the irradiated tumor cells from the&#xD;
      autologous tumor cell line for antigen loading of the DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo delayed tumor hypersensitivity testing 1 week prior to vaccination and again&#xD;
      at week 4. Patients receive vaccine therapy comprising autologous treated tumor cells and DC&#xD;
      suspended in GM-CSF subcutaneously weekly for 3 weeks. Vaccine therapy continues monthly for&#xD;
      5 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
