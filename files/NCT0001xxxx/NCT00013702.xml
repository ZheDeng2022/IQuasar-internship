    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of adding the experimental drug&#xD;
      adefovir dipivoxil to lamivudine for treating hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients with liver cirrhosis. Adefovir inhibits HBV by interfering with&#xD;
      replication of the virus's genetic material. In some people, the drug has been active against&#xD;
      strains of HBV that are resistant to lamivudine; it may also have some activity against HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 21 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis B infection and liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis who have received lamivudine treatment for at least 1 year may be eligible for this&#xD;
      48-week study. Candidates will be screened with a complete medical history, blood tests and a&#xD;
      24-hour urine collection. Blood tests include HLA typing (a test of genetic markers on white&#xD;
      blood cells that permit specialized immunology studies). Within 4 weeks, candidates who&#xD;
      appear eligible for the study will have a physical examination and medical history, an&#xD;
      abdominal ultrasound (imaging test using sound waves) to check for cancer of the liver, chest&#xD;
      X-ray and electrocardiogram (EKG). Blood and urine tests will also be done, and women who can&#xD;
      become pregnant will have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the study criteria and decide to participate will then start treatment with&#xD;
      one 10-mg adefovir pill per day by mouth. In addition, patients will continue to take all&#xD;
      other medications prescribed by their doctor. Follow-up clinic visits will be scheduled as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 21 - Blood will be drawn for specialized immunology tests and to&#xD;
           measure blood levels of HIV and HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 - Blood and urine (single sample)&#xD;
           tests will be done to determine the side effects of adefovir and its effect on the HBV&#xD;
           infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 48 or early termination (end of study) - Blood tests (including tests for hepatitis&#xD;
           C and D), abdominal ultrasound and a 24-hour urine collection to evaluate kidney&#xD;
           function will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monthly visits beyond week 48 - Based on the HBV response to treatment and the&#xD;
           availability of the drug from the sponsor, patients may be offered to extend their&#xD;
           treatment with adefovir. Those who continue will have monthly follow-up visits for blood&#xD;
           and urine (single sample) tests.&#xD;

      Patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) who&#xD;
      have advanced liver disease (decompensated cirrhosis by Child-Pugh score and no known cause&#xD;
      of hepatitis other than HBV), a HBV viral load of at least 1 million copies/mL blood, and at&#xD;
      least one year of therapy with lamivudine will be treated with open-label adefovir dipivoxil&#xD;
      10 mg daily and lamivudine 150 mg bid to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this regimen in&#xD;
      this patient group and to obtain specimens for studies of immune responses to HBV in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients. Additionally the kinetics of viral load response to adefovir will be&#xD;
      assessed. Specimens will be stored for possible use in evaluating HBV and HIV resistance to&#xD;
      adefovir. L-carnitine supplementation will be used only if low serum carnitine levels are&#xD;
      documented. Patients will be followed for HBV viral load response to adefovir for 48 weeks&#xD;
      with possible extension. The primary study endpoints will be HBV viral load at week 24&#xD;
      (per-protocol patients) and DAVG at week 24 (intent-to-treat patients). Adefovir will be&#xD;
      discontinued for toxicity; there will be no dose reduction. Up to 30 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
