      The purpose of this study is to compare an herbal supplement, nonfood-derived vitamins, and&#xD;
      placebo for the care of cardiovascular disease in high risk older African Americans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD) morbidity and mortality. In response to the health disparity between older African&#xD;
      Americans and whites, national mandates have called for new research on innovative approaches&#xD;
      to CVD prevention in this high risk population. Oxidative stress has recently been implicated&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic CVD. Available evidence from epidemiological studies,&#xD;
      clinical trials, and laboratory mechanistic studies indicate that antioxidant interventions&#xD;
      may be useful in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic CVD in high risk older&#xD;
      populations. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that dietary or food sources of&#xD;
      antioxidant nutrients may be more clinically effective than conventional nonfood-derived&#xD;
      vitamin supplementation. Surveys indicate relatively high rates of complementary and&#xD;
      alternative medicine (CAM) use, including herbal medicines, in older African Americans. Yet,&#xD;
      with the exception of the previous clinical trials of the present Center team, there have&#xD;
      been few controlled studies on CAM therapies in older African Americans and no previous&#xD;
      controlled studies on efficacy and mechanisms of herbal antioxidants for the prevention of&#xD;
      CVD in this high risk population. Preliminary studies have found that a CAM herbal&#xD;
      preparation (MAK) derived from traditional Vedic medicine demonstrates potent antioxidant and&#xD;
      anti-atherogenic effects in laboratory and pilot human studies. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of this traditional CAM herbal preparation in older African Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a controlled clinical trial at field site, Howard University Medical Center in&#xD;
      Washington, DC, involving 138 older African American men and women (55 years of age and&#xD;
      older) with documented atherosclerotic CVD who will be randomized to supplementation with&#xD;
      either the traditional CAM herbal preparation (MAK 4+5), conventional vitamin cocktail (E+C)&#xD;
      or placebo for 12 months. Clinical and mechanistic outcomes include carotid artery&#xD;
      atherosclerosis (IMT), endothelial dysfunction (brachial artery reactivity), oxidized LDL,&#xD;
      traditional CVD risk factors (BP, lipids, diet, exercise, smoking, weight) and quality of&#xD;
      life. Participants will continue usual care. The results of this clinical study will provide&#xD;
      much needed understanding of the basic and clinical effects of a traditional herbal&#xD;
      antioxidant preparation on pathophysiological mechanisms of atherosclerotic CVD in this high&#xD;
      risk group. This will facilitate translation of research findings on CAM into clinical&#xD;
      practice for prevention of disease in this underserved and understudied population of high&#xD;
      risk older African Americans.&#xD;
