  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are testing a new combination of medicines, to determine if they could be used to treat&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis (CF). Subjects with CF who have two copies of the most common mutation&#xD;
      (change) found in patients with CF called DF508. CF is caused by a lack of chloride movement&#xD;
      in the nose, sinuses, lungs, intestines, pancreas and sweat glands. We are conducting this&#xD;
      study to determine the safety of using a combination of two medicines, Phenylbutyrate and&#xD;
      Genistein, to improve the ability of the cells lining the nose to regulate movement of salt&#xD;
      (chloride) and water in people with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenylbutyrate has been extensively used to treat patients with rare metabolic diseases&#xD;
      (which are very different from CF), Phenylbutyrate is an investigational drug for the purpose&#xD;
      of this study. Genistein is a naturally occurring substance that is found in food products&#xD;
      such as soy and tofu, but is also an investigational drug for this study. Both drugs may be&#xD;
      able to restore normal chloride movements in body organs and glands. We will be studying salt&#xD;
      and water in the nose movement by a technique called nasal transepithelial potential&#xD;
      difference (NPD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized to receive either the Phenylbutyrate or placebo tablets for 1&#xD;
      week, with a 2 out of 3 chance of receiving Phenylbutyrate at a standard adult dose, with&#xD;
      visits on study days 1, 4, and 7. The study will last an additional 2 weeks to determine&#xD;
      whether the effects of the Phenylbutyrate or Placebo persist for any length of time, with&#xD;
      visits on study days 14 and 21. Every participant will receive the Genistein during the NPD&#xD;
      on days 1 and 7. The dose of Genistein used will not be escalated and will be the same for&#xD;
      every participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations at each visit will include a history, and physical exam and mental status&#xD;
      exam, blood and urine tests, and lung function tests. The main physiologic outcome of the&#xD;
      trial will be the assessment of salt and water transport NPD. In this way, we will assess&#xD;
      whether genistein enhances the effect of phenylbutyrate to improve chloride transport in the&#xD;
      nose by topical application of genistein to the nasal mucosa during the NPD procedure on&#xD;
      study days 1 and 7.&#xD;
