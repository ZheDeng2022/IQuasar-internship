    <textblock>
      This study compares air pollution exposures of residents in a South Baltimore community next&#xD;
      to major industry with those in a comparison community with much less industry nearby.&#xD;
      Parents and children as well as adults alone will be included. Air levels of 3 chemicals that&#xD;
      have been found in increased amounts in the community as well as two urinary breakdown&#xD;
      products of benzene will be measured. Participants will limit the amount of sorbate preserved&#xD;
      foods they eat as this preservative interferes with one of the benzene breakdown products.&#xD;
      Benzene air and urine exposure measurements will be compared in each community as well as&#xD;
      between communities. By including children and parents we will gather exposure information on&#xD;
      children who may be more sensitive that adults to these types of pollution. Lastly, by&#xD;
      restricting the amount of food preserved with sorbates, we can decide if this improves the&#xD;
      use of ttMA for people exposed to benzene from air pollution.&#xD;

      The current study focuses on an environmental exposure assessment of a South Baltimore&#xD;
      community residing near a heavily industrialized area. Exposure differences between this&#xD;
      community and a reference community that is demographically similar to South Baltimore but&#xD;
      has limited industrial impact will be assessed. Participants will include both parent child&#xD;
      study pairs and adults. Outdoor, indoor and personal 72 hour badge monitoring for benzene,&#xD;
      1,3-butadiene and carbon tetrachloride will be performed. Two urinary biomarkers for benzene&#xD;
      exposure, trans,trans-muconic acid (ttMA) and s-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) will be&#xD;
      measured at 3 daily time points over the 3 day period. Past work indicates that ingestion of&#xD;
      sorbate preserved foods causes substantial interference with the benzene biomarker, ttMA.&#xD;
      Therefore, participants will restrict their intake of sorbate preserved foods during the&#xD;
      study. On the day of greatest dietary restriction, a 24 hour benzene personal air measurement&#xD;
      will be obtained. Data analysis will include correlations of benzene badge exposure&#xD;
      measurements and urinary biomarkers. Air and biomarker benzene exposure data will be compared&#xD;
      between communities. Linear regression modeling will be used to determine important&#xD;
      explanatory factors of the biomarkers. The inclusion of parent child study pairs will also&#xD;
      allow correlation of benzene air levels and urinary biomarkers between parents and children.&#xD;
      This will provide exposure information on a potentially susceptible subpopulation, e.g.&#xD;
      children, and allow assessment of potential for age-related differences in benzene&#xD;
      metabolism. Finally, we will be able to determine if dietary restriction is practical and&#xD;
      results in greater specificity of ttMA as a benzene biomarker.&#xD;
