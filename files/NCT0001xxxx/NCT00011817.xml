  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study offers evaluation and treatment for patients with inherited (genetic) eye&#xD;
      diseases. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments; rather, patients will receive&#xD;
      current standard of care treatments. The purpose of the study is twofold: 1) to allow&#xD;
      National Eye (NEI) Institute physicians to increase their knowledge of various genetic eye&#xD;
      diseases, identify possible new avenues of research in this area, and maintain their clinical&#xD;
      skills; and 2) to establish a pool of patients who may be eligible for new studies as they&#xD;
      are developed. (Participants in this protocol will not be required to join a new study; the&#xD;
      decision will be voluntary.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adults with genetic eye diseases may be eligible for this study. Candidates will&#xD;
      be screened with a medical and family history, thorough eye examination and blood test. The&#xD;
      eye examination includes measurements of eye pressure and visual acuity (ability to see the&#xD;
      vision chart) and dilation of the pupils with eye drops to examine the lens and retina (back&#xD;
      part of the eye). Patients may also undergo additional diagnostic tests needed to determine&#xD;
      eligibility for other NEI studies, including routine laboratory testing, imaging,&#xD;
      questionnaires, a physical examination, and other standard and specialized tests and&#xD;
      procedures as needed. In addition, patients will have special photographs taken of the eye to&#xD;
      document the clarity or opacity of the eye lens. They will also undergo a procedure called&#xD;
      electroretinography to assess the eye's response to bright lights. For this procedure, the&#xD;
      eye is numbed with anesthetic drops and a contact lens is placed in the eye. The patient&#xD;
      looks inside a large, hollow sphere and sees flashes of light, first in darkness and then in&#xD;
      light. The contact lenses sense small electrical signals generated by the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who need medical care will be given appropriate standard medical treatment. Those&#xD;
      who are found eligible for a research study will be recommended for participation in that&#xD;
      study and taken off this one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed at least 3 years. Follow-up visits are scheduled according to&#xD;
      the standard of care for the individual patient's eye problem. Patients in this protocol will&#xD;
      probably have 1 to 3 follow-up visits per year.&#xD;

      This &quot;Evaluation and Treatment Protocol&quot; will allow the geneticists and ophthalmic genetic&#xD;
      specialists at the NEI to identify, follow and provide &quot;standard of care&quot; treatment to&#xD;
      patients with genetic eye disease. The primary purpose of the protocol is to accumulate a&#xD;
      cohort of patients with genetic eye disease for possible participation in NEI studies. A&#xD;
      secondary purpose is to provide long-term follow-up and treatment for a variety of genetic&#xD;
      eye diseases so that the genetic specialists at NEI will be better able to identify research&#xD;
      hypotheses about these diseases in addition to maintaining their clinical skills. The&#xD;
      availability of cohorts of patients with a spectrum of genetic disorders will be valuable for&#xD;
      the training of fellows in ophthalmic genetics, an important mission of the NEI. Finally, the&#xD;
      ability to provide long-term follow-up and care will also facilitate referral efforts for new&#xD;
      NEI protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genetic specialists at the National Eye Institute will be free to choose those genetic&#xD;
      conditions that interest them. However, the total number of patients that can be enrolled in&#xD;
      the protocol will be restricted. This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments.&#xD;
      Any evaluations or treatment under this protocol will be based on the current standard of&#xD;
      care for each genetic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for&#xD;
      potential eligibility in any new NEI clinical studies as they are developed. If eligible,&#xD;
      patients may be asked to participate in the new protocol. However, they will not be required&#xD;
      to enter any protocol and their decision to participate will be entirely voluntary. No more&#xD;
      than 150 patients will be accepted in this &quot;Evaluation and Treatment Protocol.&quot;&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are initially screened for NEI protocols under the NEI screening protocol or from&#xD;
        closeout of another protocol. Some of these patients will have a genetic eye disease that&#xD;
        NEI staff wishes to follow and treat. Such patients can then be enrolled in this evaluation&#xD;
        and treatment protocol. Each study participant must have the ability to understand and sign&#xD;
        an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from this study if they are unable or unwilling to give informed&#xD;
        consent or they are unwilling to be followed and treated at the NEI clinical center for at&#xD;
        least the next 3 years.&#xD;
