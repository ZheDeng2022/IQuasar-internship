    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody therapy in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not&#xD;
      responded to previous hormone therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop&#xD;
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as&#xD;
      bevacizumab may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
      Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine time to objective progression, response rate (objective and PSA response) and&#xD;
      duration of response in men with hormone refractory prostate cancer treated with&#xD;
      estramustine, docetaxel and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the toxicity of this regimen in men with hormone refractory prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To study the relationship of baseline VEGF levels in urine and plasma and changes in&#xD;
      these levels to response and duration of response to treatment with bevacizumab, docetaxel&#xD;
      and estramustine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour&#xD;
      followed by bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at least every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate with&#xD;
             progressive systemic (metastatic) disease despite castrate levels of testosterone due&#xD;
             to orchiectomy or LHRH agonist (which must be continued); castrate levels of&#xD;
             testosterone must be maintained&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of enrollment, patients must have evidence of metastatic disease, either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measurable disease (with any PSA) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-measurable disease with PSA &gt;= 5 ng/ml; patients with PSA &gt;= 5 ng/ml only are&#xD;
                  not eligible DEFINITION OF MEASURABLE DISEASE/TARGET LESIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest&#xD;
                  diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 20 mm with conventional techniques: 1) physical&#xD;
                  exam for clinically palpable lymph nodes and superficial skin lesions, 2) chest&#xD;
                  X-ray for clearly defined lung lesions surrounded by aerated lung OR those&#xD;
                  lesions measured as &gt;= 10 mm with a spiral CT scan or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measurable lesions (up to a maximum of 10 in number) representative of all organs&#xD;
                  involved to be identified as target lesions; the sum of the longest diameters&#xD;
                  (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as baseline sum LD&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If measurable disease is confined to a solitary lesion then its neoplastic&#xD;
                       nature will need to be confirmed by histology&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Ultrasound may not be used to measure tumor lesions that are not easily&#xD;
                       accessible clinically DEFINITION OF NON-MEASURABLE DISEASE/NON-TARGET&#xD;
                       LESIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-target lesions include all other lesions, including small lesions with&#xD;
                  longest diameter &lt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or &lt; 10 mm with spiral CT&#xD;
                  scan and truly non-measurable lesions, which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Bone lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  CNS lesions, leptomeningeal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Irradiated lesions, unless progression documented after RT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have demonstrated evidence of progressive disease since the most recent&#xD;
             change in therapy; progressive disease is defined as any one of the following&#xD;
             (measurable disease, bone scan, or PSA progression):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  MEASURABLE DISEASE PROGRESSION: Objective evidence of increase &gt; 20% in the sum&#xD;
                  of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions from the time of maximal&#xD;
                  regression or the appearance of one or more new lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  BONE SCAN PROGRESSION: Appearance of one or more new lesions on bone scan&#xD;
                  attributable to prostate cancer along with a PSA &gt;= 5 ng/ml will constitute&#xD;
                  progression&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PSA PROGRESSION: An elevated PSA (at least &gt;= 5 ng/ml) which has risen serially&#xD;
                  from baseline on two occasions each at least one week apart. If the confirmatory&#xD;
                  PSA (#3) value is less (i.e., #3b) than screening PSA (#2) value, then an&#xD;
                  additional test for rising PSA (#4) will be required to document progression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure despite standard androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Flutamide and megestrol acetate (any dose) must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to registration; bicalutamide and nilutamide must be discontinued at least 6 weeks&#xD;
             prior to registration. If improvement following antiandrogen withdrawal is noted,&#xD;
             progression must be established using the criteria above; primary testicular androgen&#xD;
             suppression (e.g., with an LHRH analogue) should not be discontinued&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 4 weeks since any hormonal therapy, including ketoconazole,&#xD;
             aminoglutethimide, systemic steroids (any dose), megestrol acetate (any dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, including estramustine or suramin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior anti-angiogenesis agents, including thalidomide and bevacizumab&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  &gt;= 8 weeks since the last dose of strontium-89 or Samarium&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy prior to initiating protocol treatment must&#xD;
             have received bisphosphonates for at least 1 month and have progressive disease&#xD;
             despite this therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CTC (ECOG) performance status: 0-2&#xD;
