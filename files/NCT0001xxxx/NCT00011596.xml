      To date, conventional rehabilitation is not able to restore normal, safe, gait for many&#xD;
      individuals with stroke. We have identified nine gait component deficits which respond to the&#xD;
      FNS-IM intervention. This study will test a refined treatment protocol of 3 months duration&#xD;
      to restore volitional gait by restoring those nine gait components simultaneously. In&#xD;
      addition, we will incorporate into the treatment protocol a promising non-invasive technique&#xD;
      of partial body weight-supported (BWS) gait training on a treadmill. BWS and FNS-IM have the&#xD;
      potential to provide additive effects for the patient and restore volitional gait more&#xD;
      quickly and more completely than would otherwise be possible with one technique alone.&#xD;

      Stroke is the third leading cause of disability in the United States. To date, conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation is not able to restore normal, safe, gait for many individuals with stroke. We&#xD;
      have identified nine gait component deficits which respond to the FNS-IM intervention. This&#xD;
      study will test a refined treatment protocol of 3 months duration to restore volitional gait&#xD;
      by restoring those nine gait components simultaneously. In addition, we will incorporate into&#xD;
      the treatment protocol a promising non-invasive technique of partial body weight-supported&#xD;
      (BWS) gait training on a treadmill. BWS and FNS-IM have the potential to provide additive&#xD;
      effects for the patient and restore volitional gait more quickly and more completely than&#xD;
      would otherwise be possible with one technique alone. Therefore, our first hypothesis is&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS I: BWS combined with FNS-IM, simultaneously applied to nine critical gait&#xD;
      components, will restore volitional normal, safe gait to patients with chronic stroke within&#xD;
      3 months. An advantage of BWS gait training is that it is non-invasive. Consequently, we must&#xD;
      demonstrate the additive advantage of FNS-IM technique alone. Therefore the second hypothesis&#xD;
      is: HYPOTHESIS II: FNS-IM plus BWS will restore volitional gait more quickly and completely&#xD;
      for patients with chronic stroke compared with BWS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of thirty six chronic stroke patients will be randomly divided into two treatment&#xD;
      groups (1) FNS-IM plus BWS; (2) BWS alone. Outcome measures for hypothesis testing will be&#xD;
      threefold : 1) Gait normality (kinematics of nine gait components); 2) Safety (number of&#xD;
      falls); 3) Functionality (gait speed, walking endurance, and CHART, a handicap measure of&#xD;
      mobility and activity level). Data will be collected every four weeks during the three months&#xD;
      of treatment. Maintenance of gains will be monitored at two additional data collections at&#xD;
      six months and one year following the end of the treatment period. Results of this study have&#xD;
      the potential to provide the following clinically applicable information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. For patients with stroke, a refined treatment protocol of 3 months duration for&#xD;
      restoration of normal, safe, volitional gait which is practical within the current healthcare&#xD;
      milieu. 2. A definitive recommendation regarding the most effective treatment for chronic&#xD;
      stroke patients: (1) BWS plus FNS-IM or (2) BWS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Build stimulators and electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtain measures pre and post intervention for the two groups (FNS-IM + BWS; and BWS&#xD;
           alone) to detect gains in: a) gait pattern; b) safety; c) functional capability; and d)&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analyze data for the group receiving FNS-IM + BWS, in order to test&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis I.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Produce therapy protocols for FNS-IM and BWS intervention, and treatment progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Test Hypothesis II by comparing the two treatment groups (BWS vs BWS + FNS-IM).&#xD;
