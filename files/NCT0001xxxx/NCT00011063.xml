    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the herbal remedy ginkgo biloba may affect the body's elimination&#xD;
      of other medicines. Many people take ginkgo biloba to improve memory, mental alertness and&#xD;
      overall feeling of well being. Since this product is considered a food supplement and not a&#xD;
      drug, it is not subject to the rigorous pre-market testing required for prescription and&#xD;
      over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. As a result, information has not been collected on possible&#xD;
      interactions between ginkgo biloba and other medications. This study will look at how ginkgo&#xD;
      biloba affects the elimination of phenytoin-a medication used to treat patients with&#xD;
      seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal healthy volunteers 21 years of age or older may be eligible for this 40-day study.&#xD;
      Candidates will provide a medical history and undergo a physical examination and routine&#xD;
      blood tests. Women of childbearing age must use a reliable form of birth control other than&#xD;
      oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For at least 2 weeks before the study and throughout its duration, study participants may not&#xD;
      have any of the following: 1) medications that can affect platelet function (e.g., aspirin,&#xD;
      Motrin, Advil, Nuprin, ibuprofen, etc.); 2) alcoholic beverages; 3) grapefruit and grapefruit&#xD;
      juice; and 4) all medications except those given by study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1 of the study, subjects take one 500-mg dose of phenytoin at 8:00 A.M.. On an empty&#xD;
      stomach. (Subjects fast the night before taking the phenytoin and are allowed to eat&#xD;
      breakfast 2 hours after the dose). Blood samples are drawn just before dosing and again at&#xD;
      0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 32, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the dose. Blood drawn on&#xD;
      this first study day is collected through a catheter (small plastic tube) placed in a vein to&#xD;
      avoid multiple needlesticks. After the 12-hour sample is collected, the subject goes home and&#xD;
      then returns to the clinic for the remaining blood draws, which are taken by direct&#xD;
      needlestick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the blood sampling is completed, subjects begin ginkgo therapy. The NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
      provides participants a supply of 60-mg capsules of ginkgo to take twice a day (at 8 A.M. and&#xD;
      8 P.M..) for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4 weeks, subjects are given a second dose of&#xD;
      phenytoin as described above and repeat the blood sampling procedure. Subjects continue&#xD;
      taking ginkgo during this second phenytoin study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gingko biloba is a complementary or alternative medication used for purported cognitive&#xD;
      enhancing effects. Despite its widespread use there is limited data regarding potential for&#xD;
      drug interactions. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of administration of&#xD;
      ginkgo for 4 weeks on single dose phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Eight healthy volunteers will&#xD;
      take a single 500mg dose of phenytoin capsules orally with serial blood samples collected&#xD;
      over 96 hours for determination of phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Following the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      study subjects will begin taking 2, 60mg capsules (120mg total) of ginkgo twice daily for 28&#xD;
      days. Following 28 days of ginkgo subjects will then again undergo phenytoin pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      evaluations with blood samples obtained over 96 hours for determination of phenytoin&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics. The ratio of geometric means for phenytoin pharmacokinetic parameter values&#xD;
      and 90% confidence intervals about the ratio of log transformed parameter values will be&#xD;
      calculated. Confidence intervals falling within the 80-125% range will characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameter values before and after ginkgo to be equivalent.&#xD;
