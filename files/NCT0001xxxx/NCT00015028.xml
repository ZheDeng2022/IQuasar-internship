      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of a buprenorphine/naloxone&#xD;
      sublingual tablet formulation as an office-based therapy for opiate-dependence treatment. The&#xD;
      developmental objective for this combination product is an expansion of therapeutic options&#xD;
      for the treatment of opiate dependence.&#xD;

      This multicenter pivotal clinical trial was comprised of two phases. The first phase, which&#xD;
      was four weeks in length, was double-blind placebo controlled and was primarily used to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone. The second phase, lasting 48 weeks, was&#xD;
      primarily conducted to determine the safety of buprenorphine/naloxone.&#xD;
