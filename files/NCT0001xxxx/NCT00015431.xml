      This study will determine whether people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) with&#xD;
      and without gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have gut abnormalities (inflammation or loss of&#xD;
      function) and changes in immune system cells and chemicals in the blood and gut. People with&#xD;
      CVID have decreased levels of serum immunoglobulin IgG and IgA. Patients have sinus, lung and&#xD;
      other infections, and many also have stomach and intestinal problems, such as chronic&#xD;
      diarrhea, inability to absorb nutrition from food, and intestinal infections caused by&#xD;
      bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CVID patients with gastrointestinal symptoms 10 years of age and older may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study; CVID patients without gastrointestinal symptoms 18 years of age and older will be&#xD;
      enrolled as control subjects. Candidates will be screened with a review of their medical&#xD;
      records, a medical history and physical examination, HIV blood test, stool sample, and&#xD;
      hydrogen breath test. The breath test measures the amount of hydrogen in the breath after&#xD;
      drinking sugar water, showing the digestive effects of bacteria in the upper intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for several days to undergo the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine and stool samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  48-hour stool fat collection measures the amount of undigested fat in the stool to&#xD;
           determine the ability of the gut to digest and absorb fat in the diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  D-Xylose absorption test measures the ability of a sugar compound to travel across the&#xD;
           lining of the intestine to determine the ability of the gut to absorb nutrients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper endoscopy a thin flexible lighted tube is advanced through the mouth to evaluate&#xD;
           the esophagus, stomach and beginning of the small intestine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lower endoscopy a thin lighted tube is advanced through the rectum to evaluate the colon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of GI abnormalities associated with changes in immune response in CVID&#xD;
      patients will help in developing and testing new treatments for this disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized&#xD;
      by decreased serum immunoglobulin IgG and IgA levels. In addition to chronic or recurrent&#xD;
      sinopulmonary infections, many patients develop gastrointestinal manifestations that can be&#xD;
      disabling or fatal. Data suggest that these gut abnormalities have a primary immune basis,&#xD;
      implicating T cells primarily, and are not related to the infectious complications of CVID.&#xD;
      Currently there is no standard therapy for the associated gastrointestinal disease outside of&#xD;
      empiric nutritional intervention for weight loss and non-specific anti-diarrheal agents. In&#xD;
      addition there is no data about the prevalence of gastrointestinal abnormalities in CVID&#xD;
      patients who have no overt gastrointestinal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to characterize the gastrointestinal abnormalities that&#xD;
      occur in CVID patients and correlate this with the immunophenotype and cytokine secretion of&#xD;
      peripheral blood and lamina propria lymphocytes and monocytes. CVID patients with&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms of malabsorption/maldigestion and chronic diarrhea will be targeted&#xD;
      for study. We will also include a group of patients without gastrointestinal symptoms to&#xD;
      provide an estimate of background prevalence and severity of gut abnormalities. Subjects will&#xD;
      undergo a standard immunologic workup including peripheral blood lymphocyte marker&#xD;
      phenotyping and cytokine responses as well as tests of gastrointestinal absorption,&#xD;
      examination of gut histology by endoscopic biopsy, and measurement of gut mucosal cytokine&#xD;
      expression. Analysis variables will include clinical (weight, stool frequency, results of gut&#xD;
      absorption tests), laboratory (lymphocyte and cytokine assays), and gut abnormalities&#xD;
      (histology scores and specific lesions).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have a verifiable diagnosis of common variable immune deficiency specifically a&#xD;
        decrease both in IgG and at least one other Ig isotype to below two standard deviations of&#xD;
        normal control levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be age 10 years old or older for patients with gastrointestinal symptoms or age 18&#xD;
        years or older in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must be free of active sinopulmonary or other infection at time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have negative results on stool examination for culture of enteric pathogens&#xD;
        (Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Vibrio, E. Coli O157/H7), Clostridia&#xD;
        difficile toxin assay, enteric parasites and their ova (including Cryptosporidia,&#xD;
        Cyclospora, Microsporidia and Giardia (by stool EIA)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults who are unable to provide initial or on-going consent may participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absence of other antibody deficiency states including X-linked agammaglobulinemia, hyper&#xD;
        IgM syndrome, selective deficiency of IgG subclass, and Ig heavy chain gene deletions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of immunomodulating drugs within the following times prior to enrollment: daily&#xD;
        corticosteroids (4 weeks), azathioprine/6-MP, cyclosporine, methotrexate, or FK506 (3&#xD;
        months). The use of short-term or single dose corticosteroids as a pretreatment regimen for&#xD;
        IVIG is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Positive test for anti-HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant systemic or major disease including congestive heart failure, coronary artery&#xD;
        disease, cerebrovascular disease and pre-existing or recent onset CNS demyelinating&#xD;
        disorder, pulmonary disease, renal failure, organ transplantation, decompensated liver&#xD;
        disease, serious psychiatric disease, or malignancy that in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
        would preclude successful endoscopic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy, to avoid endoscopies without a strictly therapeutic intent in this relatively&#xD;
        high risk population.&#xD;
