      This study will evaluate the effects of hormone replacement therapy on patients with Turner&#xD;
      syndrome (TS)-a genetic disorder in females in which part or all of one X chromosome is&#xD;
      missing. Most girls and women with TS have underdeveloped ovaries-the female reproductive&#xD;
      organs that produce the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, and smaller amounts of&#xD;
      the male sex hormone, testosterone. These hormones affect muscle and bone strength, sex&#xD;
      drive, energy, and an overall sense of well being. Estrogen may also play a role in memory&#xD;
      and mood and have a protective effect against heart disease. Women with TS have a much higher&#xD;
      risk of developing osteoporosis (loss of bone density), high blood pressure, high cholesterol&#xD;
      and diabetes than women without this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Girls and women with Turner syndrome between the ages of 14 and 50 years may be eligible for&#xD;
      this 2-year study. Three months before beginning treatment, all patients will wear an&#xD;
      estrogen patch and take a progesterone tablet daily for 10 days each month. They will then be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups to compare the effects of estrogen alone&#xD;
      with estrogen plus testosterone on bone strength, muscle and fat mass and psychosocial well&#xD;
      being. Both groups will wear an estrogen patch and take oral progesterone. One group will&#xD;
      also wear a testosterone patch while the other group will wear a placebo patch (a patch that&#xD;
      does not contain any testosterone). Neither study participants nor the doctors will know who&#xD;
      is getting the testosterone until the study is complete. Patients will undergo the following&#xD;
      procedures before beginning treatment and at 6, 12 and 24 months after starting treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scans (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) to measure body composition and bone&#xD;
           thickness. Low radiation X-rays scan the whole body to measure fat, muscle and bone&#xD;
           mineral content..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the abdomen to measure the amount of fat around&#xD;
           the internal organs. The patient lies on a stretcher in a large tube surrounded by a&#xD;
           magnetic field during the scanning. The procedure uses a strong magnet and radio waves&#xD;
           to produce the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heel ultrasound to measure bone thickness. The heel is placed in a chamber and sound&#xD;
           waves pass through it to produce images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for diabetes and problems with carbohydrate&#xD;
           metabolism. The patient drinks a sugary substance. A small amount of blood is drawn&#xD;
           before taking the drink and four times afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests to measure blood counts, liver and kidney function, ovarian&#xD;
           hormones, growth factors, thyroid function, blood lipids, bone strength markers, and to&#xD;
           test for pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological testing for the effect of treatment on mood, self-esteem, quality of life,&#xD;
           social shyness, anxiety and sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive tests (at first inpatient visit and 1 and 2 years after starting&#xD;
           treatment) to measure nonverbal memory and visual-perceptual abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the hospital admissions, patients will be given a &quot;metabolic diet&quot; that contains&#xD;
      specific amounts of salt and carbohydrates to ensure accurate blood pressure and sugar&#xD;
      metabolism measurements. Patients will keep a record of their menstrual periods and physical&#xD;
      activity throughout the treatment period.&#xD;

      Turner Syndrome (TS) is characterized by ovarian dysgenesis and short stature resulting from&#xD;
      the partial or complete deletion of one X-chromosome. Adults with TS have excessive rates of&#xD;
      osteoporosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus and may have increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality as a result. These problems of adults with TS may be secondary to&#xD;
      deficiency of ovarian hormones or may result from halpo-insufficiency for as yet unknown&#xD;
      X-chromosome genes. There have been no prospective, controlled studies of the effects of&#xD;
      hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in TS, but available data suggest that conventional oral&#xD;
      HRT designed for postmenopausal women may not prevent osteoporosis and may aggravate&#xD;
      hypertension in this disorder. Of note, girls and women with TS are deficient in ovarian&#xD;
      androgens as well as estrogen, and have reduced muscle mass, which may contribute to&#xD;
      osteoporosis and insulin resistance. In addition, reduced androgens may contribute to the&#xD;
      impairment of self esteem and social interactions suffered by many with TS. In this study,&#xD;
      two different hormone regimens for TS will be compared in a randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind design. Both groups will receive transdermal estradiol (E2, 100 mcg/day) with&#xD;
      cyclic progesterone; one group will receive a physiological dose of testosterone (T) by&#xD;
      transdermal patch while the other group will receive a placebo patch. The treatment duration&#xD;
      is 2 years. Major outcome parameters include predicted improvements in bone mineral density,&#xD;
      body composition and psychosocial well-being. Essential information will be collected on the&#xD;
      effects of hormone treatments on insulin sensitivity and blood pressure in TS. This study&#xD;
      will help to optimize hormone replacement treatment for women with TS, and to clarify which&#xD;
      of the metabolic problems of TS are secondary to ovarian hormone deficiency, and which are&#xD;
      due to genetic factors.&#xD;
