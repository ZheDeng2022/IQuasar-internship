  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the relationship between bacterial products in lung infections in&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis and disease severity. It will examine plasma and lung tissue from cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cystic fibrosis and having certain genetic characteristics, who are between 9&#xD;
      and 65 years of age and any cystic fibrosis patient undergoing lung transplantation at INOVA&#xD;
      Fairfax Hospital in Fairfax, Virginia, may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who cannot undergo apheresis may be asked to provide up to an additional 100 cc (7&#xD;
      tablespoons) of blood for research to look at bacterial products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung specimens of participating transplant patients will be collected at INOVA Fairfax&#xD;
      Hospital. Patients who participate in the apheresis portion of the study will be admitted to&#xD;
      the NIH Clinical Center for 2 to 3 days. Apheresis is a procedure for collecting large&#xD;
      quantities of specific blood components. For this study, plasma-the liquid part of the&#xD;
      blood-will be collected. For the procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle in an&#xD;
      arm vein, similar to donating blood. The blood is separated into its components by&#xD;
      centrifugation (spinning), the plasma and white cells are extracted and collected in a bag,&#xD;
      and the red cells are returned to the body, either through the same needle or through another&#xD;
      needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the hospital stay, patients may also be asked to participate in other cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      studies involving blood tests, an echocardiogram (ultrasound test of the heart), urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test, and pulmonary function (breathing) tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are frequently colonized with a number of&#xD;
      bacterial pathogens. One of the most common organisms is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown the presence of the type III-secretion pathway within P. aeruginosa,&#xD;
      implicating these cytotoxins as virulence factors for this organism. To evaluate further the&#xD;
      effect of these cytotoxins on lung cells, we would like to collect plasma and tissue from&#xD;
      individuals with CF. Because larger quantities of plasma than can safely be obtained by&#xD;
      simple phlebotomy will be required, apheresis procedures performed in the Clinical Center&#xD;
      Apheresis Unit will be used. To obtain lung cells from patients with CF infected with P.&#xD;
      aeruginosa, tissue from explanted lungs will be collected in collaboration with INOVA Fairfax&#xD;
      Hospital. We intend to look for expression of the type- III proteins of P. aeruginosa by&#xD;
      measuring the immune response against components of the type- III pathway and their presence&#xD;
      in lung cells.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with CF with an identified mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrance&#xD;
        regulator (CFTR) (i.e., any of the known variants of the CFTR gene, such as the change in&#xD;
        F508 allele) who are between the ages of 18 years to 65 years will be included in the&#xD;
        apheresis portion of the study. Patients will have been or will be genotyped under another&#xD;
        protocol. Patients must be colonized or have a history of colonization with P. aeruginosa.&#xD;
        Patients may have cultured other organisms (e.g., Burkholderia cepacia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients undergoing lung transplantation will be included in the study. Based on data&#xD;
        from various CF registries, the mean age for patients receiving transplant is 26 years with&#xD;
        a range from 5 to 59 years. Any patient age 9 and over with CF undergoing transplantation&#xD;
        will be eligible for the explantation portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are no exclusion criteria for subjects in the transplant portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with CF will be excluded from the apheresis portion of the study if they are less&#xD;
        than 18 years, weigh less than 40kg, or demonstrate:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Cardiovascular instability;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Severe anemia (hematocrit less than 28 percent, hemoglobin less than10gm/ml);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Thrombocytopenia (Platelets less than 50,000);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Inadequate venous access in the upper extremities (No central venous catheters will be&#xD;
             used);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Severe coagulation disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Positive serology for hepatitis B, C, or HIV;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pulmonary hypertension;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Respiratory exacerbation requiring intravenous antibiotics;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any other condition which the physician or Apheresis Unit staff considers a&#xD;
             contraindication to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who are unable to provide adequate consent/assent will be excluded from the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
