  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Look AHEAD study is a multi-center, randomized clinical trial to examine the long-term&#xD;
      effects of a lifestyle intervention designed to achieve and maintain weight loss. The study&#xD;
      will investigate the effects of the intervention on heart attacks, stroke and&#xD;
      cardiovascular-related death in individuals with type 2 diabetes who are also overweight or&#xD;
      obese.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Look AHEAD is examining, in overweight volunteers with type 2 diabetes, the long-term effects&#xD;
      of an intensive lifestyle intervention program designed to achieve and maintain weight loss&#xD;
      by decreased caloric intake and increased physical activity. This program will be compared to&#xD;
      a control condition involving a program of diabetes support and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that the incidence rate of the first post-randomization occurrence&#xD;
      of a composite outcome, which includes&#xD;
&#xD;
      cardiovascular death (including fatal myocardial infarction and stroke), non-fatal myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, hospitalized angina, and non-fatal stroke,&#xD;
&#xD;
      over a planned follow-up period of up to 13.5 years will be reduced among participants&#xD;
      assigned to the Lifestyle Intervention compared to those assigned to the control condition,&#xD;
      Diabetes Support and Education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Look AHEAD will also test for reductions in the incidence of three secondary composite&#xD;
      outcomes and examine the effect of the intervention on cardiovascular disease risk factors,&#xD;
      diabetes control and complications, general health, and quality of life, and psychological&#xD;
      outcomes. The cost and cost-effectiveness of the Lifestyle Intervention relative to Diabetes&#xD;
      Support and Education will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Look AHEAD intensive lifestyle intervention ended September, 2012. Participants continue&#xD;
      to be followed to determine the long-term effects of the intervention on health outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The lifestyle intervention is implemented with individual supervision and group sessions and is aimed at achieving and maintaining at least a 7% decrease in weight from baseline and 175 minutes per week in physical activity. It is implemented during a four-year period with the most intensive application during the first year, less frequent attention during the next three years, and a minimum of twice yearly contacts during an extended follow-up period. To help participants achieve and maintain weight loss, a variety of diet strategies (e.g. prepared meals and liquid formula), exercise strategies, and optional weight loss medications are utilized based on a preset algorithm and participant progress.</description>
