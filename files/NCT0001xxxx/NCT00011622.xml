  <brief_summary>

      This proposal is a pilot study to describe the variations of blood sugar in pregnant women&#xD;
      with various degrees of glucose intolerance, and how they relate to standardized meals. Blood&#xD;
      sugar control during pregnancy is important to prevent complications for the newborn. The&#xD;
      variation and timing of the blood sugar measurements in gestational diabetics and how this&#xD;
      relates to the baby's outcome is controversial. We will use an FDA approved device called&#xD;
      Minimed Glucose Continuous Monitor, which is used in clinical practice for certain diabetics.&#xD;
      It is very small, similar to a beeper, and is connected to the patient through a small&#xD;
      plastic catheter subcutaneously. This measures blood sugar every five minutes for a total of&#xD;
      288 readings a day with minimum discomfort. The hypothesis of this study is that use of the&#xD;
      Minimed glucose monitor will provide information about variations of blood sugar in&#xD;
      gestational diabetics that is missed by capillary glucose monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our conclusions will allow us to compare blood glucose trends among the groups. After the&#xD;
      data is analyzed in this pilot study, we plan to design a bigger study involving more&#xD;
      subjects to study the impact of the blood sugar variations in the outcome of the newborn, and&#xD;
      to obtain generalizable results for the population in general.&#xD;

      We will coordinate the study through the CRC. The women will have to come in only twice, to&#xD;
      have the monitor placed and then taken off three days later. A blood sample will be collected&#xD;
      at each visit. Meals and snacks will be provided for each day of the study, specially&#xD;
      packaged, to supply an equivalent amount of calories for each subject. These will meet the&#xD;
      nutritional requirements for both the mother and the fetus. Women will do separate&#xD;
      fingerstick blood sugar measurements using a capillary glucometer four times a day, to ensure&#xD;
      the accuracy of the sensor's readings.&#xD;

        1. Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women, between 28 and 36 weeks of gestation. Gestational age will be&#xD;
             determined by a combination of the date of the last menstrual period and ultrasound,&#xD;
             done during the first or second trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous glucose challenge test and if abnormal, an oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 30 Kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy, if glucose between pregnancies was&#xD;
             normal.&#xD;
