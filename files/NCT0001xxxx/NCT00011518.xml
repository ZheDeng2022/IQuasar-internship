      This study is examining the relationship between ingested arsenic and bladder cancer in two&#xD;
      areas of California where a large percentage of the population was exposed to drinking water&#xD;
      containing arsenic at low to moderate levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Water supplies in many parts of the world contain naturally occurring arsenic. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that arsenic at high doses can cause cancer of the bladder. The risk at&#xD;
      lower doses is unknown. This study is examining the relationship between ingested arsenic and&#xD;
      bladder cancer in central Nevada and Kings County, California, two areas where a large&#xD;
      percentage of the population was exposed to drinking water containing arsenic at low to&#xD;
      moderate levels. Approximately 200 people with bladder cancer and 400 people without bladder&#xD;
      cancer will be included. Subjects are interviewed by telephone about past residences,&#xD;
      occupations, diet, drinking water consumption, and other lifestyle factors. Arsenic&#xD;
      measurements in well water have been collected from the appropriate state agencies and are&#xD;
      being matched with residences and drinking water consumption rates to estimate lifetime&#xD;
      arsenic exposures for each subject. People with bladder cancer will then be compared to those&#xD;
      without to see if people with cancer were more likely to have lived in areas with arsenic in&#xD;
      their drinking water.&#xD;
