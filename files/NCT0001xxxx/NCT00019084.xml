      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may make&#xD;
      the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's&#xD;
      white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment for advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of a vaccine made with the patients' white&#xD;
      blood cells mixed with tumor proteins in treating patients who have advanced cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether endogenous cellular immunity to a particular tumor-specific&#xD;
      mutated p53 or ras protein is present in patients with tumors expressing mutant p53 or ras.&#xD;
      II. Determine whether vaccination with antigen-presenting cells pulsed in vitro with&#xD;
      synthetic peptide corresponding to the tumor's p53 or ras mutation in the presence of&#xD;
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) can induce or boost patient cellular immunity to the mutated peptide in&#xD;
      this patient population. III. Assess the type and characteristics of the cellular immunity&#xD;
      generated. IV. Determine whether in vivo-primed T-cells generated against the p53 or ras&#xD;
      mutation, expanded in vitro with corresponding peptide, and infused with subcutaneous&#xD;
      interleukin-2 can enhance the activity of specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immune response&#xD;
      and/or tumor response in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment regimens. The first 5 patients accrued are&#xD;
      assigned to Regimen A. Three weeks after all 5 patients are enrolled, additional patients are&#xD;
      accrued and assigned to Regimen B. All patients undergo peptide hypersensitivity testing with&#xD;
      the peptide they will be treated with prior to each vaccination. Regimen A: Two days prior to&#xD;
      each vaccination, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are harvested. PBMC are incubated&#xD;
      for 48 hours with either patient-specific mutant p53 or ras peptide fragments and&#xD;
      sargramostim (GM-CSF). The antigen-presenting cells (APC) are irradiated prior to use. APC&#xD;
      are reinfused on day 0. Treatment repeats after 3 weeks and then every 6 weeks for a total of&#xD;
      4 vaccinations. Regimen B: Patients are vaccinated with APC as in Regimen A. PBMC are&#xD;
      harvested prior to the first APC vaccination and 1 week after the second, third, and fourth&#xD;
      APC vaccinations. PBMC are incubated for 7 days with either peptide the patient was&#xD;
      vaccinated with (mutant p53 or ras peptide fragments) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). The&#xD;
      peptide-activated lymphocytes (PAL) are reinfused over 1 hour 2 weeks after each APC&#xD;
      vaccination. Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously 5 days a week for 2 weeks beginning 4 hours&#xD;
      after each PAL infusion. Patients in both regimens with stable or responding disease continue&#xD;
      treatment every 6 weeks. Patients achieving complete response continue treatment for up to 1&#xD;
      additional year. Patients are followed at 1 and 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 70 patients (5 per Regimen A, 28-65 per Regimen B) will be&#xD;
      accrued for this study.&#xD;
