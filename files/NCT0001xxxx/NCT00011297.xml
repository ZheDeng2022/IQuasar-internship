  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a safe and useful medication for outpatient detoxification that is&#xD;
      as effective as benzodiazepines in the short-term, and more effective in the protracted&#xD;
      withdrawal period. Gabapentin (Neurontin) will be compared to a standard benzodiazepine,&#xD;
      lorazepam (Ativan), for its effectiveness in treating alcohol withdrawal.&#xD;
