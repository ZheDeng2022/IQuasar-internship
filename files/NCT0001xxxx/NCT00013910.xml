  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the mechanism of action of a new&#xD;
      investigational medication (drug), NNC 90-1170, which is being developed for the treatment of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (adult onset type of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NNC 90-1170 is a modified form of a hormone, Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (or GLP-1), which is&#xD;
      important for controlling insulin levels. Insulin, another hormone, is also important for&#xD;
      controlling blood glucose levels, which are higher than normal in people who have type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. This study will measure the effect of NNC 90-1170, active investigational drug, to&#xD;
      cause insulin to be released from the pancreas in response to increasing blood glucose&#xD;
      concentrations. These results will be compared to that of a group of healthy volunteers of&#xD;
      similar age and body weight who do not have diabetes. Also, various other hormones and&#xD;
      substances that are known to control blood sugar will be measured in blood samples that will&#xD;
      be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One dose of NNC 90-1170 will be given to subjects with type 2 diabetes only in this study,&#xD;
      and the effects of this dose will be compared to a placebo (inactive substance that looks&#xD;
      like the active drug). This is a crossover study, which means that subjects will be treated&#xD;
      both with NNC 90-1170 and with placebo. The order in which subjects will receive the&#xD;
      treatments will be determined by chance (randomly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a so-called &quot;double-blind&quot; study, meaning that neither&#xD;
      subjects nor study doctors will know the order in which subjects will be given each treatment&#xD;
      until the study is over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include approximately 15 healthy volunteers and 15 volunteers with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, and it will be conducted at 1 clinic (the University of Michigan Health System) in&#xD;
      the United States.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before any trial-related&#xD;
             activities. Trial-related activities are any procedures that would not have been&#xD;
             performed during normal management of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association&#xD;
             (ADA) criteria (6): fasting plasma glucose ?126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or 2-hour plasma&#xD;
             glucose ? 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with type 2 diabetes either newly diagnosed with at least 2 months of diet or&#xD;
             on oral anti-diabetic monotherapy for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age 30-75 years inclusive. Body Mass Index 24 to 35 kg/m2 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject must give signed and dated informed consent before any trial-related&#xD;
             activities. Trial-related activities are any procedures that would not have been&#xD;
             performed during normal management of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 30-75 years inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body Mass Index 24 to 35 kg/m2 inclusive. Must meet the ADA criteria for normal&#xD;
             glucose tolerance (6): fasting plasma glucose below 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) and 2-hour&#xD;
             plasma glucose &lt; 140 mg/mL (7.8 mmol/L) during an OGTT.&#xD;
