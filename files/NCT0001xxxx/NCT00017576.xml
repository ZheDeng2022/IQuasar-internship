      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Calcitriol may help carboplatin kill more cancer cells by making&#xD;
      tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carboplatin plus calcitriol in treating&#xD;
      patients who have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer&#xD;
      treated with calcitriol and carboplatin. II. Determine the palliative response in patients&#xD;
      with cancer-related pain treated with this regimen. III. Determine the response in patients&#xD;
      with bidimensionally measurable disease treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the duration&#xD;
      of prostate-specific antigen, palliative, and measurable disease responses in patients&#xD;
      treated with this regimen. V. Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
      VI. Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. VII. Determine the&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral calcitriol on day 1 and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day&#xD;
      2. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease&#xD;
      progression. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 4 weeks until disease&#xD;
      progression. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until disease progression and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-36 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
