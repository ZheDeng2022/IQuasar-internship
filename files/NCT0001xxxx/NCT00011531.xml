    <textblock>
      Many spinal cord injury (SCI) and otherwise debilitated patients develop pressure ulcers over&#xD;
      the course of their injury or disease. Despite enhanced wound care management, many pressure&#xD;
      ulcers do not heal completely and require surgical myocutaneous rotational flap coverage.&#xD;
      Even then they often recur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are: (1) to conduct a controlled comparative study of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of subatmospheric pressure dressing (SPD) in healing pressure ulcers versus&#xD;
      conventional saline wet-to-moist dressing techniques; (2) to establish indications and&#xD;
      contra-indications for use of SPD In treating pressure ulcers; and (3) to develop a&#xD;
      noninvasive, clinically usable optical digitizer and associated software for measurement of&#xD;
      wound geometry for standardized quantitative assessment and longitudinal monitoring of wound&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;

      Many spinal cord injury (SCI) and otherwise debilitated patients develop pressure ulcers over&#xD;
      the course of their injury or disease. Despite enhanced wound care management, many pressure&#xD;
      ulcers do not heal completely and require surgical myocutaneous rotational flap coverage.&#xD;
      Even then they often recur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: Subatmospheric pressure dressing (SPD) treatment applied to pressure ulcers will&#xD;
      either completely close them, or heal to a point allowing for skin graft coverage, more often&#xD;
      than 0.9% normal saline wet-to-moist dressing (WTMD) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are: (1) to conduct a controlled comparative study&#xD;
      of the effectiveness of subatmospheric pressure dressing (SPD) in healing pressure ulcers&#xD;
      versus conventional saline wet-to-moist dressing techniques; (2) to establish indications and&#xD;
      contra-indications for use of SPD In treating pressure ulcers; and (3) to develop a&#xD;
      noninvasive, clinically usable optical digitizer and associated software for measurement of&#xD;
      wound geometry for standardized quantitative assessment and longitudinal monitoring of wound&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHODS: 120 patients with stage III or IV pressure ulcers meeting the project&#xD;
      selection criteria will be recruited for the project. Patients will be randomly assigned in a&#xD;
      3:1 (SPD to WTMD) ratio to either the control group receiving 0.9% normal saline wet-to-moist&#xD;
      wound dressing and treatment, or to the subatmospheric pressure dressing group. All subjects&#xD;
      selected will be further stratified according to degree of wound severity, nutritional&#xD;
      status, and evidence of wound infection. The WTMD group will receive 0.9% NS moistened gauze&#xD;
      applied to the wound, which will be changed every 8 hours. The SPD group will receive SPD&#xD;
      dressing with the VACTM system set at a constant subatmospheric pressure of negative 125&#xD;
      mmHg. The SPD device and dressing will be left in place and changed every Monday, Wednesday,&#xD;
      and Friday. The subjects' pressure ulcers will be measured on day 0 and then on a weekly&#xD;
      basis. Ulcer surface shape, area, and coloration will be recorded with a digital camera and&#xD;
      also by tracing the ulcer perimeter on a flexible translucent plastic film with grid overlaid&#xD;
      on the wound. In addition, an optical laser scanner will used to record ulcer shape, area,&#xD;
      and coloration, and body/limb segmental volume in the region of the wound. Volume will also&#xD;
      be measured using alginate wound impressions to form RTV silicone molds for fluid&#xD;
      displacement measurement. The molds of the wounds will also be optically digitized and wound&#xD;
      perimeter, topical surface area, total 3-D surface area, and volume calculated using computer&#xD;
      image processing, planimetry, and volumetry software developed in the project. Local&#xD;
      body/limb segment volume will also be calculated to monitor edematous fluctuations. Based on&#xD;
      these measurements, the wound responses will be scored as described in Table 2 after one&#xD;
      month or at the time of the patient's withdrawal from the study. The association between&#xD;
      response level and treatment type will be analyzed using Chi-square test of association.&#xD;
      Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square and logistic regression will be used to control for prognostic&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
