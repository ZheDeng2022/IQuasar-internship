      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing&#xD;
      so they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of troxacitabine in treating patients who&#xD;
      have blast phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, in terms of achieving complete hematologic&#xD;
      remission, partial hematologic remission, hematologic improvement, partial response, or back&#xD;
      to chronic phase status, in patients with blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia treated&#xD;
      with troxacitabine. II. Determine the proportion of patients whose disease returns to chronic&#xD;
      phase and remains at that level for at least 3 months when treated with this drug. III.&#xD;
      Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the duration of&#xD;
      survival of patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive troxacitabine IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 14 months.&#xD;
