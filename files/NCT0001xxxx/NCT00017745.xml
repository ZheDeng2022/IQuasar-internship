  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Neuromuscular Diseases Section (NDS) is conducting research on certain inherited&#xD;
      myopathies and neuropathies, disorders that lead to disability and sometimes death. NDS,&#xD;
      along with other groups, has identified some disease-causing genes. The National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health Clinical Center proposes new research to identify additional hereditary&#xD;
      neuromuscular diseases and conduct genetic studies in order to localize, clone, and&#xD;
      characterize the diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expected 50 patients with known or suspected inherited myopathy or neuropathy and their&#xD;
      families will be recruited for this study. If travel to the Clinical Center is impossible,&#xD;
      investigators may come to them to do the tests. Ten to twenty cubic centimeters of blood will&#xD;
      be drawn for DNA extraction and genotyping. Some abnormal movements of muscle atrophy will be&#xD;
      documented by videotaping. If necessary, diagnostic laboratory and radiographic studies will&#xD;
      be done to confirm diagnosis. Because the diseases are hereditary, blood may also be drawn&#xD;
      from family members. The family will be counseled and the participants invited back annually&#xD;
      to investigate the progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be evaluated by a history and initial neurological exam. Up to another&#xD;
      20 mL of blood will be drawn for routine blood studies. Other medical care procedures may&#xD;
      include a chest x-ray, EKG and echocardiogram, CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging) scan, pulmonary function tests, and physical therapy assessment. Possible&#xD;
      research procedures may include MR spectroscopy, nerve conduction study, electromyography,&#xD;
      muscle or nerve biopsy, and lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers have decided not to inform the family if nonpaternity or adoption is&#xD;
      discovered by the DNA genotyping. Also, because a carrier of the disease gene may not&#xD;
      necessarily develop the disease, family members will not be informed if they are carriers.&#xD;

      The goal of this protocol is to identify families with inherited neuromuscular disorders,&#xD;
      evaluate disease manifestations to establish an accurate clinical diagnosis by using newest&#xD;
      technological advances and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Studies of&#xD;
      inherited myopathies in large families with good genealogical records are especially&#xD;
      valuable. Patients with diseases of known molecular basis will be genotyped to conduct&#xD;
      analysis of phenotype/genotype correlation. Patients with diseases of unknown or incomplete&#xD;
      genetic characterization will be studied with a hope of contributing to the identification of&#xD;
      specific disease-causing genes and to genetic mechanisms responsible for a specific disorder.&#xD;
