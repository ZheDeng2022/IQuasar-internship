    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how often people with sickle cell anemia develop&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension a serious disease in which blood pressure in the artery to the lungs&#xD;
      is elevated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women 18 years of age and older with sickle cell anemia may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Participants will undergo an evaluation at Howard University s Comprehensive Sickle&#xD;
      Cell Center in Washington, D.C. or at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,&#xD;
      Maryland. It will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood collection (no more than 50 ml., or about 1/3 cup) to confirm the diagnosis of&#xD;
           sickle cell anemia, sickle cell trait or beta-thalassemia (Some blood will be stored for&#xD;
           future research testing on sickle cell anemia.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  echocardiogram (ultrasound test of the heart) to check the pumping action of the heart&#xD;
           and the rate at which blood travels through the tricuspid valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this evaluation, a study nurse will contact participants twice a month for 2 months&#xD;
      and then once every 3 months for the next 3 years for a telephone interview. The interview&#xD;
      will include questions about general health and recent health-related events, such as&#xD;
      hospitalizations or emergency room visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease&#xD;
      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for&#xD;
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Acute pain crisis, acute chest syndrome&#xD;
      (ACS), and secondary pulmonary hypertension are common complications of sickle cell anemia.&#xD;
      Mortality rates of sickle cell patients with pulmonary hypertension are significantly&#xD;
      increased as compared to patients without pulmonary hypertension. Recent studies report up to&#xD;
      40% mortality at 22 months after detection of elevated pulmonary artery pressures in sickle&#xD;
      cell patients. Furthermore, pulmonary hypertension is thought to occur in up to 30% of clinic&#xD;
      patients with sickle cell anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine the prevalence and prognosis of secondary pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension in adult patients with sickle cell anemia, and to determine whether genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms in candidate genes contribute to its development or response to treatment.&#xD;
