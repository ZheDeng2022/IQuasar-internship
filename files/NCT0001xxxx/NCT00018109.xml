      To establish a collaborative group of clinical trial centers, with standardized equipment and&#xD;
      protocols, able to conduct both drug and gene therapy trials in DMD. To evaluate the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of glutamine and creatine monohydrate on muscle strength in children with&#xD;
      DMD. To validate the use of QMT (quantitative muscle strength testing) and gait analysis in&#xD;
      children with DMD as reliable tools to quantify muscle strength, monitor disease progression&#xD;
      and assess therapeutic response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common lethal inherited disorder worldwide.&#xD;
      Despite the exponential increase in our understanding of the disorder since the discovery and&#xD;
      characterization of the causative gene and its product dystrophin in 1987, current&#xD;
      therapeutic management remains largely supportive. Awaiting a final genetic cure to be&#xD;
      available in the future, further investments in developing better drug therapies for DMD&#xD;
      remain important. Not only because the uniform use of prednisone (the only drug proven to be&#xD;
      beneficial) is hampered by potential adverse effects, but also because it may very well be&#xD;
      the case that ultimately a combination of both gene and drug therapy will be needed to cure&#xD;
      Duchenne children. Here, we test two compounds that have shown promise in a 45-drug screen in&#xD;
      the mdx mouse model of Duchenne dystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of glutamine (0.6/kg/day) and creatine monohydrate (5g/day) on muscle strength&#xD;
      will be evaluated in a multi-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 3-arm study.&#xD;
      Ambulant children aged 5-10 years with an established DMD diagnosis will be studied. Patients&#xD;
      will undergo 2 screening evaluations within 2 weeks. Patients will be randomized into&#xD;
      treatment groups on the second screening visits, followed by a 6-month treatment period.&#xD;
      During the treatment period, patients will be evaluated at monthly intervals. The primary&#xD;
      endpoints are percentage change in average muscle strength score and QMT performance for&#xD;
      specific muscle groups. Secondary endpoints include timed function tests, functional grades&#xD;
      for arms and legs, and pulmonary function tests.&#xD;
