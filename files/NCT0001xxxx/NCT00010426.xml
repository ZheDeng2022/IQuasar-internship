      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the proportion of patients with cystinosis who experience a serious&#xD;
      adverse effect when treated with a new formulation of cysteamine hydrochloride for corneal&#xD;
      cystine accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the proportion of patients with a reduction in corneal crystal density of 1.00&#xD;
      unit when treated with this regimen.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study Patients are randomized to receive&#xD;
      the current formulation of cysteamine hydrochloride as drops in one eye and the new&#xD;
      formulation of cysteamine hydrochloride as drops in the other eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive the two formulations of cysteamine hydrochloride in their assigned eyes&#xD;
      every hour during waking hours daily for 6 months (safety study) or for 1 year (efficacy&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
