      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of meditation on older African Americans&#xD;
      with documented cardiovascular disease (CVD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in older African&#xD;
      Americans, and accounts for 40% of the disproportionate risk for mortality observed in&#xD;
      African Americans compared to white Americans. The majority of CVD patients experience acute&#xD;
      cardiac events, many sudden and unexpected, despite conventional treatment of their disease&#xD;
      and associated traditional risk factors. The pathophysiologic basis of these cardiac events&#xD;
      is not fully established, but substantial evidence indicates that psychosocial stress and the&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system have adverse effects on both vasomotor function and long-term&#xD;
      autonomic balance. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of acute&#xD;
      cardiac events-specifically, the roles that arterial vasomotor dysfunction and sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system imbalance play in the pathophysiology of such acute events-provide a platform&#xD;
      for a new mechanistic investigation of the interplay of psychosocial and environmental stress&#xD;
      and CVD. Preliminary evidence demonstrating elevated peripheral vasoconstriction due to&#xD;
      stress-mediated sympathetic nervous system response in African Americans further suggests&#xD;
      that these mechanisms are particularly relevant in this group.&#xD;
