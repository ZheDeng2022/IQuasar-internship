      The objectives of this protocol are to: 1) screen patients with various neuromuscular&#xD;
      disorders and facilitate their entry into appropriate research protocols; 2) help resolve&#xD;
      puzzling diagnostic neuromuscular problems and train fellows in the evaluation and treatment&#xD;
      of Neuromuscular Diseases; and 3) provide follow up to patients who finished their&#xD;
      participation in a previous study but they are not currently entered in another research&#xD;
      protocol. No investigational treatments will be performed on this protocol but the tissues&#xD;
      collected can be used for future research studies.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Research patients will be studied under this protocol if they fulfill the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have an identifiable neuromuscular disorder that may be suitable for a specific current or&#xD;
        future protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Present a diagnostic puzzle in spite of the previously performed diagnostic work-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have unusual manifestation of a more usual neuromuscular disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have a disorder useful for teaching purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should be referred by a physician who will continue their care after our&#xD;
        evaluation. A report of the patients' visit and tests, along with suggestions or&#xD;
        recommendations will be sent to each referring physician. There is a wide spectrum of&#xD;
        neuromuscular diseases to be studied, among them are: peripheral neuropathies, myopathies,&#xD;
        dystrophies, myasthenia, stiff person syndrome, muscle cramps, myotonias, motor neuron&#xD;
        diseases, post-polio syndrome, and certain demyelinating disorders affecting both the&#xD;
        central and the peripheral nervous system.&#xD;
