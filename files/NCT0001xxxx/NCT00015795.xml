  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate and compare the air stream during voice production in patients&#xD;
      with abductor spasmodic dysphonia and in normal volunteers. People with abductor spasmodic&#xD;
      dysphonia have uncontrolled muscle spasms during speech, resulting in a weak voice. A better&#xD;
      understanding of the abnormalities of this disorder may help in the development of more&#xD;
      effective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with abductor spasmodic dysphonia may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates will have a physical examination and medical history. (Patients will be&#xD;
      videotaped and voice-recorded during the medical interview for review by specialists who will&#xD;
      identify the type and severity of their speech disorder.) All candidates will also undergo a&#xD;
      procedure called flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy to record the movement of the vocal folds&#xD;
      during speech, breathing and other tasks such as singing, whistling and prolonging vowels.&#xD;
      For this test, the inside of the nose is sprayed with an anesthetic (lidocaine) to numb the&#xD;
      nasal cavity and a decongestant (oxymetazoline) to widen the nasal passage. Then, a thin&#xD;
      flexible tube called a nasolaryngoscope is passed through the nose to the larynx (voice box).&#xD;
      A camera attached to the eyepiece of the nasolaryngoscope records the movements of the vocal&#xD;
      folds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then have an airway interruption test to detect pressure changes in the&#xD;
      voice box during production of continuous sounds. A nose clip is placed over the subject's&#xD;
      nose and two sensor devices are placed on the neck to pick up changes in movement and&#xD;
      position of the vocal cords during voicing. A mouthpiece is placed in the mouth, and subjects&#xD;
      are asked to say &quot;ah&quot; continuously at a specified sound level. This voicing is repeated 33&#xD;
      times with periodic breaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients only will also be given an injection of botulinum toxin. These injections are&#xD;
      effective, in varying degrees, in about 60 percent of patients with abductor spasmodic&#xD;
      dysphonia. This study will use a different approach to botulinum toxin injections to test&#xD;
      their effect in patients with pressures higher than normal. Rather than inject the posterior&#xD;
      cricoarytenoid muscle or the cricothyroid muscle, as is typically done, the thyroarytenoid&#xD;
      muscle, which closes the voice box, will be injected on one side. A second one-sided&#xD;
      injection may be given after 2 or 3 weeks if no effect is seen after the first injection.&#xD;
      Speech will be recorded at each visit to measure any change in symptoms after the injection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Persons with abductor spasmodic dysphonia (ABSD) have difficulties with phonation onset after&#xD;
      voiceless consonants resulting in breathy breaks. Previously, ABSD was thought to involve&#xD;
      heightened activity of the laryngeal abductor muscle, the posterior cricoarytenoid. Botulinum&#xD;
      toxin injection of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle in this disorder, however, only&#xD;
      provides a partial benefit in about 50% of persons with ABSD. An electromyographic study of&#xD;
      the laryngeal muscles in ABSD found asymmetries in the adductor muscle (the thyroarytenoid&#xD;
      muscle) in ABSD. Thyroarytenoid (TA) activation levels differed between the two sides in&#xD;
      persons with ABSD. An electromyographic study of the laryngeal muscles in ABSD found&#xD;
      asymmetries in the adductor muscle (the thyroarytenoid muscle) in ABSD. Thyroarytenoid (TA)&#xD;
      activation levels differed between the two sides in persons with ABSD in comparison with&#xD;
      controls; the right TA showed greater activity than the left. This suggested that ABSD might&#xD;
      involve increased tone on one side of the larynx, and that treatment should address any such&#xD;
      asymmetry in muscle tone. We hypothesize that if TA muscle activity was greater on one side&#xD;
      in ABSD, then&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) phonation threshold pressures should be greater than normal in persons with ABSD, and&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) that treatment with botulinum toxin in those with phonation threshold pressures greater&#xD;
      than normal should show symptom reduction following injection of the TA muscles on one side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both normal volunteers and persons with ABSD will be studied. Phonation Threshold Pressure&#xD;
      (PTP) will be measured using the brief interruption of supraglottal airflow with a valve&#xD;
      during phonation into a tube. The electroglottographic signals will be used to determine when&#xD;
      vocal fold vibration ceases after the valve closes. The PTP will be measured as the&#xD;
      difference between an estimate of the subglottal pressure achieved after phonation offset&#xD;
      following valve closure, and the minimum subglottal vocal tract pressure at the point just&#xD;
      before vocal fold vibration ceases following the interruption of airflow. Persons with ABSD&#xD;
      who have higher phonation threshold pressures than normal will then receive an injection with&#xD;
      botulinum toxin injection into the thyroarytenoid muscle on one side based on movement&#xD;
      asymmetries observed on fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy. Blinded measures of symptom frequency&#xD;
      made before and after treatment will determine if symptoms are improved.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for inclusion of patients with ABSD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        General Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Symptoms present during speech and not apparent at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptoms less evident during whisper, singing or falsetto.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Symptoms which become worse with prolonged speaking, practice or anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Reflexive and emotional aspects of voice function are unaffected, such as coughing,&#xD;
             laughter or crying.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No surgical treatment for ABSD or injections with botulinum toxin in the last 9&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing to undergo a botulinum toxin injection in the thyroarytenoid muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnostic Characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prolonged vocal fold opening during voiceless consonants with excessive breathiness,&#xD;
             as individuals experience difficulties in closing the vocal folds to produce vowels&#xD;
             following voiceless consonants (p, t, k, s, f, h, th). Sounds such as &quot;s&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, or &quot;k&quot;&#xD;
             when coming just before open vowels such as &quot;ah&quot; and &quot;uh&quot; as in &quot;home&quot;, &quot;coffee&quot;, and&#xD;
             puppy&quot; are usually most affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Normal vocal fold movement control for non-speech tasks such as cough, throat&#xD;
             clearance and Valsalva maneuver during fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for inclusion for normal volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Persons without pulmonary, neurological, otolaryngological, psychiatric or speech,&#xD;
             voice and hearing problems as determined by medical history and examination by a&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Persons without a respiratory difficulties such as asthma, bronchitis, or chronic&#xD;
             obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No smokers or tobacco users.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: ABSD and Normal Volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        The Following individuals will be excluded fro participation in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any person with a history of respiratory difficulties such as asthma, bronchitis, or&#xD;
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any person with abnormalities of the larynx such as benign laryngeal disease,&#xD;
             laryngeal carcinoma, and laryngeal congenital anomaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any persons with reduction in vocal fold movement range during non-speech tasks, such&#xD;
             as whistling, which would suggest either vocal fold paralysis or cricoarytenoid joint&#xD;
             fixation or neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any person with a functional voice disorder such as whispering aphonia or complete&#xD;
             aphonia, or muscular tension dysphonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any person who report periods of symptom remission or are atypical of spasmodic&#xD;
             dysphonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any person with oropharyngeal abnormalities such as velopharyngeal insufficiency, or&#xD;
             neuromuscular disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Smokers and tobacco users.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any person who are currently under treatment for a major depression or&#xD;
             manic-depressive illness, schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder. However, a history of a&#xD;
             previous episode of a minor reactive depression would not exclude a person from&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
