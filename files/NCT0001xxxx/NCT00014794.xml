  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can be used to&#xD;
      measure blood flow to joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It will also compare&#xD;
      blood flow measurements using PET with measurements obtained with magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) to determine how useful MRI is in measuring blood flow to joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the joint damage in RA is caused by the synovium-the lining of the joint. In RA, the&#xD;
      synovium increases in size and destroys bone and cartilage. The synovium maintains its growth&#xD;
      by forming many new small blood vessels to nourish it. New drug treatments are being&#xD;
      developed to stop the growth of these new blood vessels. The effect of these treatments on&#xD;
      the synovium is usually measured by performing a biopsy-removing a small piece of synovium&#xD;
      for examination under a microscope. The biopsy requires inserting a needle into the joint to&#xD;
      withdraw the synovial tissue. This study will see if changes in blood flow can be assessed&#xD;
      accurately using noninvasive imaging procedures, such as PET scanning, instead of a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with rheumatoid arthritis who have at least one tender and&#xD;
      swollen knee due to synovitis may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened&#xD;
      with a medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a mold made of the knee to be studied and will have routine blood&#xD;
      tests. Women who are able to become pregnant will have a pregnancy test. All participants&#xD;
      will then undergo PET and MRI scanning as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET - A needle is used to insert a catheter (small plastic tube) into an arm vein for&#xD;
      injection of the radioactive substance H215O. The patient lies in a doughnut-shaped machine&#xD;
      (the PET scanner) and a quick scan is done to measure body thickness. Then, a separate scan&#xD;
      is taken following each of six or fewer injections of H215O. Each scan lasts about 13&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI - The patient lies on a stretcher that is moved into a cylinder containing a magnetic&#xD;
      field (the MRI scanner). A special coil is placed over the knee to improve the quality of the&#xD;
      images. Earplugs are worn to muffle the loud thumping sound produced by electrical switching&#xD;
      of the magnetic fields during the imaging. A contrast agent called gadolinium is injected&#xD;
      through a catheter into a vein to improve the quality of the images. An intercom system&#xD;
      permits the patient to communicate with the technician at all times during the procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the proliferative nature of rheumatoid synovial tissue, many new pharmaceuticals&#xD;
      are targeting angiogenesis inhibition as a means of halting synovial growth. Although&#xD;
      clinical markers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) activity may function as surrogate endpoints in&#xD;
      trials of these new agents, a non-invasive technique of assessing synovial blood flow would&#xD;
      be the ideal outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET imaging has been used to quantify blood flow to a variety of tissues, with significant&#xD;
      experience at this institution in the area of tumor blood flow analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of H2 (15)O PET for the&#xD;
      measurement of synovial blood flow in patients with RA. In 10 RA patients with active knee&#xD;
      synovitis, clinical and radiological (H2 (15)O PET and dynamic MRI) evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed. The feasibility of H2 (15)O PET will be evaluated by its reproducibility. We will&#xD;
      also evaluate the correlation of dynamic MRI with synovial blood flow measurement by H2 (15)O&#xD;
      PET.&#xD;
