    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bevacizumab in treating patients who have&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Bevacizumab may be an effective treatment for&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the 6-month progression-free survival rate in patients with relapsed&#xD;
      aggressive NHL treated with single agent bevacizumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate response rate and toxicity in patients with relapsed aggressive NHL treated&#xD;
      with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure tumor VEGF and VEGF receptor 1 and 2 expression (Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR) and to&#xD;
      explore the correlation between expression level and histology and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To measure pre-therapy, week 8 and time to progression biologic measures of VEGF activity&#xD;
      including plasma VEGF levels, urinary VEGF levels, and circulating number of endothelial&#xD;
      cells and explore the correlation with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for a maximum of 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years&#xD;

             lymphoma, aggressive histology of one of the following histologic subtypes;&#xD;
             transformed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients are not eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diffuse large (formerly Working Formulation Groups F, G, H)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  High-grade, Burkitt's or Burkitt-like&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Primary mediastinal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anaplastic large cell&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mantle cell&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: patients being registered to this study at first relapse must not be&#xD;
                  suitable for transplant or aggressive treatment at first relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease; all techniques used to measure disease must be&#xD;
             completed within 28 days prior to registration and must have been done after&#xD;
             completion of prior therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had a chest x-ray or CT scan of the chest and a CT scan of the&#xD;
             abdomen and pelvis within 28 days prior to registration and they must have been done&#xD;
             after completion of prior chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have either a unilateral or bilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy&#xD;
             within 42 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens (pre-induction and&#xD;
             autologous bone marrow transplantation will be considered as one prior therapy) for&#xD;
             lymphoma; this includes investigational agents and/or other antibody therapies; all&#xD;
             prior therapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to registration; due to&#xD;

             in combination for either the first or second relapse or as consolidation after&#xD;
             chemotherapy regimen without an intervening relapse, it will be considered part of the&#xD;
             combination regimen and counted as one prior therapy; patients must have recovered&#xD;

             that used to maintain patency of an indwelling IV catheter) or anti-platelet therapy &gt;&#xD;
             325 mg per day of aspirin&#xD;

             involvement with lymphoma) urine and unstained diagnostic paraffin slides must be&#xD;
             submitted for correlative studies)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a performance status of 0, 1 or 2 according to Zubrod criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have central nervous system involvement with lymphoma&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl&#xD;

             may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous&#xD;
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has&#xD;
             been disease-free for 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If day 1, 28, or 42 falls on a weekend of holiday, the limit may be extended to the&#xD;
             next working day; in calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or&#xD;
             measurement is done is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the&#xD;
             Monday 2 weeks later would be considered day 14; this allows for efficient patient&#xD;
             scheduling without exceeding the guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and give&#xD;
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number&#xD;
             must be provided to the statistical center in order to ensure that the current (within&#xD;
             365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been entered&#xD;
             into the database&#xD;
