      The purpose of this study is to determine what dose of a new timed-release tablet of the drug&#xD;
      propranolol will reduce secretion of the hormone melatonin in healthy volunteers. This study&#xD;
      will also determine whether suppressing melatonin will improve depressive symptoms in people&#xD;
      with seasonal affective disorder (SAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAD (sometimes referred to as winter depression) is a condition in which people experience&#xD;
      depression as a result of seasonal variations in light. Human brains have a circadian&#xD;
      pacemaker that regulates many body functions. As the seasons change and light duration&#xD;
      varies, the circadian pacemaker regulates seasonal behavior by transmitting a signal of day&#xD;
      length to the pineal gland, which secretes the hormone melatonin. Melatonin secretion&#xD;
      increases in the winter as the duration of light decreases. Evidence suggests that the&#xD;
      melatonin signal of seasonal change is present in people with SAD but not in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers; thus there is a possibility that seasonal changes which influence the duration of&#xD;
      melatonin secretion control the course of illness in individuals with SAD. This study will&#xD;
      determine whether propranolol can shorten the duration of melatonin secretion and mimic the&#xD;
      effect of summer days to improve symptoms of depression in people with SAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be admitted to the hospital for about 2 days. The volunteers will&#xD;
      receive either propranolol or placebo (an inactive pill) before going to bed and upon&#xD;
      awakening. Blood samples will be collected at various times throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with SAD will be interviewed periodically on an outpatient basis to determine&#xD;
      the onset of depression in the fall or winter. Two weeks after depressive symptoms arise,&#xD;
      participants will begin treatment with either propranolol or placebo. At the beginning of the&#xD;
      treatment, participants will be hospitalized for about 2 days and will have blood collected&#xD;
      at various times. During the hospital stay, participants will continue treatment with either&#xD;
      propranolol or placebo in the morning and at night; all participants will receive propranolol&#xD;
      at some point during the study. Participants will be interviewed weekly for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premenopausal women with or without SAD will keep a record of their menstrual cycles and will&#xD;
      use a urine test kit to identify the time of ovulation during the month before and after&#xD;
      admission to the hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in humans resemble seasonal changes that occur&#xD;
      in animals. Moreover, in both humans and animals, the occurrence of these changes is&#xD;
      regulated by light. In animals the circadian pacemaker regulates seasonal behavior by&#xD;
      transmitting a signal of daylength to other sites in the organism. This signal is expressed,&#xD;
      reciprocally, in the duration of nocturnal melatonin secretion, which is longer in winter and&#xD;
      shorter in summer. Sites distal to the pineal that regulate seasonal behavior read and&#xD;
      respond to this melatonin signal of change of season. In a longitudinal study, we showed that&#xD;
      a homologous melatonin signal of change of season is present in patients with SAD but not in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. In light of the animal models, this finding raises the possibility that&#xD;
      seasonal changes in duration of melatonin secretion govern the course of illness in patients&#xD;
      with SAD. If so, then an intervention that shortens the duration of melatonin secretion in&#xD;
      winter and thereby mimics the effect of summer days should improve symptoms of winter&#xD;
      depression. To test this hypothesis, we propose to administer propranolol, a beta-adrenergic&#xD;
      receptor blocking medication that is frequently prescribed for the treatment of hypertension,&#xD;
      to patients with SAD in the winter. We will administer propranolol at a time of night when it&#xD;
      would suppress and shorten the duration of melatonin secretion and then ascertain whether&#xD;
      this intervention improves depression. A unique feature of this parallel-design, controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial is that propranolol, when administered at a time of day when melatonin is not&#xD;
      secreted, can serve as its own active placebo.&#xD;
