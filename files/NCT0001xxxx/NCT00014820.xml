      To study work-related asthma in a low-income, urban population.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work-related asthma is asthma that is attributable to, or is made worse by, environmental&#xD;
      exposures in the workplace. Published estimates of the proportion of adult asthma&#xD;
      attributable to occupational factors have varied widely, depending on population,&#xD;
      methodology, and definitions, from 2 percent to 33 percent. Occupational asthma is of great&#xD;
      public health importance because it is potentially preventable, can cause substantial&#xD;
      disability, and in some cases is completely curable. Among adults in the United States,&#xD;
      asthma has become a major public health problem, with rates most elevated among low income,&#xD;
      urban, African American and Latino sectors of the population, and with substantial evidence&#xD;
      suggesting potential occupational contributions to the excess rates. These important sectors&#xD;
      of the U.S. population have, however, been inadequately represented in the occupational&#xD;
      asthma research literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a case control study of physician-diagnosed asthma, occupation, industry, and&#xD;
      workplace environmental exposures designed to evaluate the hypothesis that a substantial&#xD;
      component of the asthma burden in a low income, urban, largely minority population was due to&#xD;
      occupational factors. The study design addressed a variety of methodologic challenges&#xD;
      including healthy worker effects, difficulty contacting and recruiting this potentially high&#xD;
      risk population, large numbers of potential etiologic agents, mixed exposures, small&#xD;
      workplaces, and low absolute incidence of occupational asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population was the catchment population of Bellevue Hospital, a general hospital in&#xD;
      lower Manhattan, New York City, with busy ambulatory care services that serve low income&#xD;
      working communities. Cases and controls were recruited from among outpatients and inpatients&#xD;
      at Bellevue Hospital and interviewed face-to-face or by telephone. Occupation, industry, and&#xD;
      occupational exposures were determined by questionnaire supplemented by a Job Exposure&#xD;
      Matrix. Odds ratios (ORs) of association between asthma and specific industrial,&#xD;
      occupational, and exposure categories, controlled for major confounders, were estimated. The&#xD;
      ORs were used to calculate occupation- and industry-specific Attributable Fractions, and an&#xD;
      overall Population Attributable Fraction of asthma attributable to occupational factors. New&#xD;
      onset occupational asthma and work-aggravated asthma were investigated separately.&#xD;
