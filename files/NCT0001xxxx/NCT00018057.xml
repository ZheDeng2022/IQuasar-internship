  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: This protocol uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine&#xD;
      neuro-cognitive correlates of pediatric and adult mood and anxiety disorders. The primary&#xD;
      goal of the project is to document, in pediatric anxiety disorders and major depression,&#xD;
      perturbations in brain systems mediating attention biases, fear conditioning, emotional&#xD;
      memory, and response to various forms of motivational stimuli. As one secondary goal, the&#xD;
      project measures the relationship between these factors and treatment response to either&#xD;
      fluoxetine, a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (CBT), or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Another secondary goal examines similar&#xD;
      associations in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: A total of 2530 children, adolescents, and adults will be recruited. Most&#xD;
      subjects will not be able to complete all procedures. We seek to comprehensively study 150&#xD;
      juveniles with only a current anxiety disorder, 60 juveniles with current major depression,&#xD;
      150 juveniles with no psychiatric disorder, 100 adults with major depression, 60 adults with&#xD;
      an anxiety disorder, and 150 adults with no psychiatric disorder. To achieve this, we are&#xD;
      recruiting 2530 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Subjects will be tested using fMRI paradigms designed to examine brain regions&#xD;
      engaged when processing motivationally salient stimuli, as assessed during attention, memory,&#xD;
      social interaction, reward, and fear-conditioning paradigms. After these initial fMRI tests,&#xD;
      subjects with depression or an anxiety disorder receive treatment. Treatment will comprise&#xD;
      open treatment with either fluoxetine or CBT, augmented with computer-based attention&#xD;
      retraining, delivered in a randomized-controlled design, with random assignment to either&#xD;
      active or placebo attentiontraining regimens. Adolescent subjects then will be re-tested&#xD;
      after eight-weeks using only the attention, memory, and conditioning paradigms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Prior imaging studies note that tasks requiring attention modulation,&#xD;
      emotional memory, social interchange, and fear conditioning engage brain regions previously&#xD;
      implicated in adult mood and anxiety disorders. These regions include most consistently the&#xD;
      amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, imaging studies of reward function&#xD;
      implicate the striatum and prefrontal cortex in adult mood disorders. As a result, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that attention, memory, social interaction, reward, and conditioning paradigms&#xD;
      will engage the amygdala, ventral prefrontal cortex and striatum in both psychiatrically&#xD;
      healthy and impaired subjects. Moreover, we hypothesize that these healthy and&#xD;
      psychiatrically impaired groups will differ in the degree of engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Juvenile subjects also will be treated for eight-weeks, and a subset will be re-tested with&#xD;
      fMRI. We predict that pre-treatment abnormalities in neural circuitry will predict response&#xD;
      to treatment, such that increased amygdala and prefrontal activation will occur in&#xD;
      individuals who show the strongest response to treatment. Moreover, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      effective treatment will normalize abnormalities in attention and emotional memory, as&#xD;
      manifest in fMRI.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention is computer-based. The active and control treatments have two components. In one component of the active intervention, subjects are asked to indicate the identity of a letter that appears behind a neutral face, opposite from an angry face. In another component of the active intervention, subjects are asked to identify numbers that are hidden within a puzzle, in locations distal from angry faces. In both components of the active intervention, subjects implicitly learn to shift their attention away from angry faces. This is because the faces are systematically arranged to be far removed from letters and numbers that need to be identified. The control arm of the intervention involves similar components. However, unlike in the intervention arm, angry faces appear in various locations near letters and numbers. Therefore, attention is not shaped in the control arm. This intervention requires five minutes per session and is administered before weekly psychotherapy sessions.</description>
