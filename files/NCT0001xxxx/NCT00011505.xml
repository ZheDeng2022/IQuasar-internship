      This study will provide information needed to develop more effective treatments for patients&#xD;
      with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). Current treatments include steroids, such as prednisone,&#xD;
      and blood transfusions. These treatments have potential long-term risk and side effects,&#xD;
      including osteoporosis and impaired growth from steroids or iron overload from transfusions.&#xD;
      In addition, as patients reach adulthood, they can develop acute leukemia or bone marrow&#xD;
      failure. The only cure for DBA is bone marrow transplant, a procedure that itself carries&#xD;
      serious risks and is an option for only about 25 percent of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBA is caused by a mutation (error) in a gene that codes for producing red blood cells from&#xD;
      stem cells (blood-forming cells produced by the bone marrow). In 5 to 10 years, gene transfer&#xD;
      therapy may prove to be an effective treatment for DBA. Before this treatment can be&#xD;
      considered, however, more information is needed about DBA patients and how their stem cells&#xD;
      function. This study will examine: 1) whether stem cells of patients with DBA respond to&#xD;
      G-CSF the same way those of healthy people do. (G-CSF is a drug that causes stem cells to&#xD;
      move from the bone marrow to the blood stream, where they can be collected more easily and in&#xD;
      larger numbers by a procedure called leukapheresis, described below. If G-CSF does not work&#xD;
      well in DBA patients, other collection strategies will have to be explored); and 2) whether&#xD;
      the genetic error in DBA can be corrected by gene transfer into patients' stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia 4 years of age and older who weigh at least 27 pounds&#xD;
      and who are dependent on red blood cell transfusions may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will have a medical history taken and a physical examination and will be seen by&#xD;
      the Clinical Center's Department of Medicine Transfusion for leukapheresis evaluation. They&#xD;
      will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of DBA. For these&#xD;
      tests, the hip area is anesthetized and a needle is used to draw bone marrow from the&#xD;
      hipbone. If needed, the procedure will be done under sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given G-CSF by injection under the skin for up to 6 days. Blood and stem&#xD;
      cell counts will be measured from a teaspoon of blood drawn each morning. On the morning of&#xD;
      the fifth dose, the patient will undergo leukapheresis for collection of stem cells. For this&#xD;
      procedure, a large catheter (with a diameter no larger than that of a straw) is placed in an&#xD;
      arm vein to allow blood to flow into a cell separator machine. Most children and some adults&#xD;
      do not have veins large and strong enough for this tubing, so a large intravenous line called&#xD;
      a &quot;central line&quot; is placed into a large vein in the neck or groin. This is done under&#xD;
      sedation and with a local anesthetic. While the patient lies on a bed or recliner, whole&#xD;
      blood is collected through a catheter in one arm or the central line, the stem cells are&#xD;
      separated out by spinning, then the red cells, platelets and plasma are returned through a&#xD;
      second catheter in the other arm or a second opening in the central line. The procedure takes&#xD;
      about 3 to 5 hours, during which the patient can watch television or videos and have family&#xD;
      members at the bedside for company. When the procedure is completed, the patient's&#xD;
      participation in the protocol ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the stem cells collected by leukapheresis will be used for research and some will be&#xD;
      frozen and stored for possible future transplantation into the patient, if required.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital hypoproliferative anemia that generally&#xD;
      presents in infancy. The mainstays of treatment, prednisone and transfusion therapy, have&#xD;
      long-term toxicity in many patients, and bone marrow transplantation with an HLA-matched&#xD;
      donor is an option for only a minority of patients. Most importantly, patients with DBA have&#xD;
      an increased risk of progression of myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia, and aplastic anemia&#xD;
      compared to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characterization of potentially mutated genes in DBA is an area of active research, and&#xD;
      at least one mutation present in about one-fourth of DBA patients may cause disease due to&#xD;
      decreased production of a ribosomal protein. This finding raises the possibility that the&#xD;
      disease, at least in some patients, may be correctable by genetic therapy, by which a normal&#xD;
      copy of the mutated gene can be introduced into the &quot;stem cells&quot; which give rise to red&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore of interest to identify any particular characteristics of DBA patients which&#xD;
      might delay or hinder the application of gene therapy to their disease. This pilot study of&#xD;
      15 patients is designed to evaluate: 1) the CD34+ cell mobilization response to&#xD;
      administration of standard doses of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), 2) the&#xD;
      potential for stem cells from DBA patients to be collected by large volume leukapheresis of&#xD;
      subjects who have been given G-CSF, and 3) the ability of these G-CSF mobilized cells to be&#xD;
      transduced with vectors being developed for gene therapy applications. Outcome parameters to&#xD;
      be monitored are the mobilization response to G-CSF, the safety profile and tolerance of&#xD;
      G-CSF and leukapheresis, and the efficiency of transduction of DBA stem cells with standard&#xD;
      gene therapy vectors. Effectiveness will be gauged by historical comparison of these&#xD;
      parameters to normal healthy age-matched volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to point out that there is no therapeutic intent to the majority of this&#xD;
      protocol or direct benefit for enrolled patients. We do plan, however, to cryopreserve the&#xD;
      remainder of the mobilized cells collected by apheresis for possible autologous&#xD;
      transplantation in the event of the patient's progression to leukemia of bone marrow failure&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;
