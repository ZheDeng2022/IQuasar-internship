      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the drug bevacizumab, in combination with&#xD;
      doxorubicin and docetaxel, in improving survival of patients with inflammatory breast cancer&#xD;
      or locally advanced breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive form of&#xD;
      locally advanced breast cancer that often causes a red, swollen, tender breast and is&#xD;
      associated with a poor prognosis. Bevacizumab blocks the growth of new blood vessels that&#xD;
      supply oxygen and nutrients to tumors, and therefore, may kill cancer cells or stop their&#xD;
      growth. Doxorubicin and docetaxel are approved drugs for treating breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older with stage inflammatory breast cancer who have not been&#xD;
      treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, chest x-ray,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, and MUGA scan or echocardiography (see below). A mammogram of both&#xD;
      breasts, dynamic MRI imaging of the affected breast, computed tomography (CT) of the head,&#xD;
      chest, abdomen and pelvis, and a bone scan are done to determine the extent of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures at various intervals before, during and/or&#xD;
      after completing chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor and skin biopsies to study the effects of bevacizumab on tumor blood vessels, tumor&#xD;
      growth, and the biology of inflammatory breast cancer. A small piece of tumor tissue and a&#xD;
      small piece of skin from the affected breast are removed under local anesthesia for&#xD;
      microscopic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic MRI to examine changes in the blood vessels and breast cancer following bevacizumab&#xD;
      treatment. This test involves injecting a contrast liquid into a vein before scanning. A&#xD;
      standard MRI scan is done before the dynamic MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests are done to 1) study clot formation and breakdown, 2) measure levels of VEGF (a&#xD;
      substance produced by breast cancer cells) and VCAM-1 (a substance produced by cells lining&#xD;
      blood vessel walls), and 3) check blood counts and liver and kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MUGA (a nuclear medicine scan that checks the heart's pumping ability) or echocardiogram&#xD;
      (ultrasound scan of the heart to evaluate heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scans and x-rays to evaluate disease before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a central venous line (plastic tube) placed into a major vein in the chest&#xD;
      before beginning treatment. The line stays in the body during the entire treatment period and&#xD;
      is used to give chemotherapy and other medications, if needed, and to draw blood samples. All&#xD;
      treatment is given on a single day every 3 weeks. This constitutes one treatment cycle. Cycle&#xD;
      1 consists of bevacizumab alone; cycles 2 through 7 consist of bevacizumab with doxorubicin&#xD;
      and docetaxel. During each cycle, patients also receive injections under the skin of G-CSF, a&#xD;
      drug that raises the number of infection-fighting white blood cells, which are often&#xD;
      decreased as a side effect of chemotherapy. After cycle 7, patients may require surgery and&#xD;
      radiation or radiation alone. After radiation treatment, bevacizumab is re-started, given&#xD;
      alone every 3 weeks for an additional eight cycles. Patients whose tumors are positive for&#xD;
      estrogen or progesterone receptors will be advised to take the drug tamoxifen or anastrozole&#xD;
      for 5 years to decrease the chances of disease recurrence. This would begin with cycle 8.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study in patients with previously untreated inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)&#xD;
      or locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) to evaluate angiogenesis parameters after treatment&#xD;
      with rhuMAb VEGF - recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (bevacizumab). The challenge for new molecular-targeted anti-angiogenesis therapy is&#xD;
      to devise appropriate and reliable markers to monitor efficacy. This may be achieved directly&#xD;
      by evaluating changes in angiogenesis parameters in tumor samples. The use of less invasive&#xD;
      surrogate markers to assess the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy is preferable. This may&#xD;
      include functional changes in tumor vasculature assessed using non-invasive methods such as&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or determination of changes in circulating soluble markers&#xD;
      of angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most breast cancers over express VEGF thus making it an ideal disease for treatment with&#xD;
      anti-angiogenesis therapy. This study will evaluate the effects of bevacizumab on&#xD;
      angiogenesis parameters both molecular and functional. The first cycle will consist of&#xD;
      bevacizumab alone followed by six cycles of bevacizumab in combination with doxorubicin and&#xD;
      docetaxel (AT). Loco-regional therapy will follow and bevacizumab will be recommenced for&#xD;
      eight cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in pre-designated angiogenesis parameters will be assessed at baseline, three weeks&#xD;
      after bevacizumab and after three cycles of AT/bevacizumab. The first three molecular&#xD;
      parameters: endothelial cell proliferation, endothelial cell apoptosis and tissue VEGF&#xD;
      require multiple tumor core biopsies obtained using a mammotome. The fourth parameter k(ep),&#xD;
      the redistribution constant is obtained using dynamic MRI. To determine the variability of&#xD;
      the values of the three molecular primary angiogenesis parameters, multiple biopsies will be&#xD;
      sampled at the same time points. An attempt will be made to correlate each of the four&#xD;
      primary angiogenesis parameters with time to progression/recurrence. The effects of&#xD;
      bevacizumab alone and AT/bevacizumab directly on tumor vasculature using dynamic MRI imaging&#xD;
      and on the circulating angiogenesis marker, serum vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)&#xD;
      at the same three time points and prior to surgery and will be undertaken in an exploratory&#xD;
      manner. An attempt will be made to correlate changes in these parameters with clinical&#xD;
      findings and changes in tissue angiogenesis parameters. Additionally, other angiogenesis&#xD;
      biomarkers will also be studied in an exploratory manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombosis factors will be monitored given the increased incidence of venous and arterial&#xD;
      thrombosis seen in previous clinical trials using bevacizumab. An increase in the incidence&#xD;
      of hypertension has also been seen. A subset of patients in this study will undergo frequent&#xD;
      blood pressure monitoring to obtain a profile of the effect of bevacizumab on blood pressure.&#xD;

        tumor cells is not a requirement for diagnosis. We will define locally advanced breast&#xD;
        cancer as stage IIB, IIIA, or IIIC breast cancer according to the 2002 AJCC staging&#xD;
        guidelines. Patients must have tissue accessible for serial biopsies.&#xD;
