  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effect of the drug Rolipram on&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (MS). It will examine whether Rolipram can dampen the part of the immune&#xD;
      response believed to lead to MS and reduce disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with multiple sclerosis who are between the ages of 18 and 65 may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates will be screened with a complete neurological and medical evaluation.&#xD;
      Participants will complete three study phases-baseline, treatment and follow-up, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (3 months) - Approximately four magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans will be&#xD;
      obtained to assess MS activity. Participants with MS activity above a certain level will&#xD;
      continue with the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment (8 months) - Patients will take Rolipram tablets in increasing doses every 2 to 3&#xD;
      days for the first month of this phase until their individual maximum tolerated dose is&#xD;
      established. Dosing will continue at that level for the rest of the treatment phase. Dosing&#xD;
      is in the morning, midday and evening. Patients will be seen monthly in the clinic for&#xD;
      examination and MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up - Participants will have monthly exams and MRIs for 3 months following the&#xD;
      treatment phase, after which their participation in the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' monthly visits during treatment and follow-up include a neurological examination to&#xD;
      assess disease status; MRI to assess brain changes; and blood and urine collection to monitor&#xD;
      liver, kidney and other functions. In addition, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is done during&#xD;
      the last month of the baseline phase and one month after treatment ends to study changes in&#xD;
      the spinal fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord, and leukapheresis is done once during&#xD;
      the last month of the baseline phase and once during the last month of treatment to collect&#xD;
      white blood cells for study. These procedures involve the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays to produce images showing&#xD;
      structural and chemical changes in tissues. The patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder&#xD;
      (the scanner) containing a magnetic field and images are taken. A contrast agent called&#xD;
      gadolinium is injected into a vein during the last set of images to help identify new&#xD;
      lesions. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which is similar to MRI, is also done once during&#xD;
      the baseline phase, at 4 months and at 8 months to measure brain chemicals. For the spinal&#xD;
      tap, a local anesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones&#xD;
      (vertebrae) in the lower back. About 2 tablespoons of fluid is collected through the needle.&#xD;
      For leukapheresis, whole blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm vein. The blood&#xD;
      circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are&#xD;
      removed and the red cells, platelets and plasma are returned to the body through a second&#xD;
      needle placed in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may also have studies to measure levels of Rolipram in the blood. These are done on&#xD;
      study days 1 and 29 and at months 2, 4, and 6. For days 1 and 29, a catheter is placed in an&#xD;
      arm vein and 4 ml. of blood is drawn immediately before the morning dose and at several&#xD;
      intervals from 20 minutes to 6 hours after the dose. For the other tests, a single 4-ml&#xD;
      sample is collected before the noon dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rolipram is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 4 inhibitor that has originally been developed by&#xD;
      Schering AG, Berlin, Germany, as an antidepressant, before others and our laboratory&#xD;
      documented the immunomodulatory properties of the drug. In the current trial, Rolipram will&#xD;
      for the first time be tested as a novel immunomodulatory therapy in multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      patients. The protocol involves a stage I for finding the highest individually well-tolerated&#xD;
      drug dose, before stage II, and 8 months treatment period with this individually&#xD;
      well-tolerated dose, will be conducted. The trial shall document the safety, tolerability an&#xD;
      efficacy with respect to inhibition of central nervous inflammation in multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      patients. Magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examinations will be used to study the&#xD;
      above parameters, and immunological studies that will be conducted in parallel to the trial,&#xD;
      will address the mechanism of action of Rolipram in MS.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Pre-Treatment Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stage I:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Between the ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with clinically definite relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive multiple&#xD;
        sclerosis according to pubished criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EDSS score between 4.0 and 6.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients have either failed standard treatment (interferon beta, glatiramer acetate) by&#xD;
        clinical measures and/or were not eligible for ay of the standard treatments available or&#xD;
        opted not to start or to continue with any of these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stage II:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Same as Stage I with exceptiom that EDSS will be between 1.5 and 6.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility Criteria For Initiating Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stage I:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must have an average of up to 2 Gd-enhancing lesions per month over the 3 month&#xD;
        pre-treatment baseline period (i.e. over 4 MRI scans).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stage II:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must have an average of at least 0.5 Gd-enhancing lesions per month over the 4&#xD;
        month pre-treatment baseline period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stage I &amp; II:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have a relapse during 30 days before initiation of treatment. If a&#xD;
        relapse occurs during the last 30 days of the pre-treatment baseline period and eligibility&#xD;
        MRI criteria are fulfilled, beginning of the treatment (day 1) is delayed for at least so&#xD;
        many days that treatment starts not earlier than 30 days after the relapse and not earlier&#xD;
        than 60 days in case i.v. corticosteroids had been given. Similarly, the baseline needs to&#xD;
        be prolonged if corticosteroid treatments become necessary during these three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from study entry if any of the following exclusion criteria exist&#xD;
        at the time of enrollment. If a washout period of previous treatments becomes necessary,&#xD;
        these criteria have to be assessed again at the beginning of the MRI baseline period. An&#xD;
        additional assessment of the exclusion criteria follows on day 0 of the 6 months treatment&#xD;
        phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
