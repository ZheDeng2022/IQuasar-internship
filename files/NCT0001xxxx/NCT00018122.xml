  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This grant is to study patients that have received a kidney transplant AND an Islet Cell&#xD;
      transplant and to discover how the transplant is functioning. We will seek to have several&#xD;
      patients who have had a kidney transplant but do NOT have either type of diabetes. These&#xD;
      patients will serve as the &quot;control group&quot; since they will also be on immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medications but are not affected by abnormal blood sugars. This will allow investigators to&#xD;
      develop an understanding of how these immunosuppressive medications affect glucose metabolism&#xD;
      (blood sugar levels) and insulin utilization (how the body uses insulin).&#xD;

      If Islet Cell transplants are to become a reasonable treatment alternative for patients with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes, there must be knowledge about how the islet cells function after transplant&#xD;
      {islet cells are responsible for making the insulin the body needs in order to control blood&#xD;
      sugar). This knowledge would allow for improvements in the islet cell transplant procedure&#xD;
      itself, as well as possible alterations of the immunosuppressive medications (drugs that&#xD;
      prevent rejection) that are prescribed. There are two basic kinds of diabetes, type 1&#xD;
      (formally known as Insulin Dependent or Juvenile diabetes) and type 2 (formally known as&#xD;
      Adult-Onset or Non-insulin dependent) diabetes. The patients in this study will be affected&#xD;
      by type 1 diabetes. After the transplant, it is hoped they will no longer need insulin&#xD;
      injections. It is possible patients may need to take pioglitazone and/or metformin, however,&#xD;
      this will be prescribed in Project 1, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medications used for this study include: C-peptide. This is a synthetic product (not from&#xD;
      human or animal sources) that is man-made and identical to the C-peptide made by the body.&#xD;
      C-peptide is made at the same time as insulin, one molecule of insulin equals one molecule&#xD;
      C-peptide. By giving C-peptide that is synthetic, researchers can measure how the C-peptide&#xD;
      breaks down in the body, which could then be related to how insulin breaks down in the body.&#xD;
      Somatostatin will also be used during the same test as the C-peptide. While receiving&#xD;
      Somatostatin, the production of insulin by the patient will be stopped. This medication will&#xD;
      only be given for 4 hours and the blood sugar will be monitored during the entire procedure.&#xD;
      Insulin &amp; Glucose will also be given by IV during certain tests to regulate the blood sugar.&#xD;
      Blood sugars will be maintained within a certain level and this will be achieved through the&#xD;
      administration of insulin and/or glucose. The patient's blood sugar will be monitored at&#xD;
      frequent intervals throughout the various procedures.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Type 1 diabetics that have received a kidney transplant as well as (under Project 1) Islet&#xD;
        Cell Transplant. A control group of 8 kidney transplant recipients who do not have diabetes&#xD;
        will also be sought. Age range for both groups is expected to fall in the 25-50 year/old&#xD;
        range based upon statistical data, although those between the ages of 18 and 65 may also&#xD;
        qualify.&#xD;
