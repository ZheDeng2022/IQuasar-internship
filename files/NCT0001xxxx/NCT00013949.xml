  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is part of a program project directed toward assessing cardiac effects of&#xD;
      particulate and other ambient air pollutants. In this project active elderly adults living in&#xD;
      the communities of Boston and Steubenville have attended 12 weekly sessions including&#xD;
      approximately 40 minutes of Holter monitoring, blood pressure, and oximetry evaluation&#xD;
      before, during, and after outdoor exercise. To investigate the relation of air pollution to&#xD;
      cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation, a second portion of this study involves abstraction of&#xD;
      blood pressure and symptom data and downloading of available repeated measures telemetry data&#xD;
      in two populations. These populations include: 1) 200 outpatients attending 8 to 36 repeated&#xD;
      weekly exercise training sessions in a major hospital cardiac rehabilitation unit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 subjects have participated fully in Boston and Steubenville in the repeated&#xD;
      40 minute measurement of continuous EKG (Holter), blood pressure, and oximetry. In&#xD;
      Steubenville we have also measured exhaled nitrogen oxide, an index of pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammation. The exposure monitoring has included outdoor particle mass of PM2.5, outdoor&#xD;
      gaseous pollutants, and indoor home and personal monitoring to evaluate the indoor&#xD;
      contribution of pollution to health effects.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Participants are 50 to 90 years of age, but almost all are 60 and older. They have been&#xD;
        enrolled as volunteers from communities in Mission Park, Boston, and Steubenville.&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria includes the ability to walk on level ground. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
        includes unstable anginal, and baseline EKG patterns such as left bundle branch block that&#xD;
        would make difficult the detection of repolarization abnormalities. Participants live at or&#xD;
        near the study center which was located in an office or apartment in the apartment building&#xD;
        of the majority of the participants.&#xD;
