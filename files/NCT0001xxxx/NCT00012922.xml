      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of 17 performance measures of hospital quality regularly reported for the Veterans&#xD;
      Administration (VA) health care system, rates of colorectal cancer screening are the lowest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study were to 1) test whether a health care provider-directed&#xD;
      intervention increased colorectal cancer screening rates in an urban VA medical center and 2)&#xD;
      evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a randomized controlled trial, conducted at two clinic firms at a VA Medical&#xD;
      Center in Chicago. Eligible patients were men, age 50 and older, had no personal or family&#xD;
      history of colorectal cancer or polyps, had not received colorectal cancer screening, and had&#xD;
      at least one visit to the clinic during the study period. Health care providers in the&#xD;
      intervention firm attended a workshop on colorectal cancer screening. Every 4-6 months they&#xD;
      attended quality improvement workshops where they received group screening rates,&#xD;
      individualized confidential feedback, and training on improving communication with patients&#xD;
      with limited literacy skills. Medical records were reviewed for colorectal cancer screening&#xD;
      recommendations and completion. Literacy level was assessed in a subset of patients. In the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis, resource and cost estimates were derived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is complete.&#xD;
