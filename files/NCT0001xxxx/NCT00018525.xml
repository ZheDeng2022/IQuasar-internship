  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study are to see if a type of lung surgery, known as lung&#xD;
      reduction surgery, in addition to standard medical treatment improves the quality of life,&#xD;
      lung function, and reduces the high mortality associated with severe emphysema when compared&#xD;
      to standard medical treatment alone. Another goal of this study is to better identify the&#xD;
      patients most likely to benefit from this surgical treatment. The information obtained in&#xD;
      this study is important because lung reduction surgery is being done in several centers&#xD;
      around the country but its long term benefits, if any, over standard medical treatment, are&#xD;
      not known.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the US.&#xD;
      Although medical therapy may delay disability and death, there has been no definitive therapy&#xD;
      to improve pulmonary function in these patients. The resection of emphysematous lung&#xD;
      parenchyma, lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), has been reported in uncontrolled studies&#xD;
      in highly selected emphysema patients to substantially improve parameters of pulmonary&#xD;
      function, dyspnea, and quality of life. Numerous case series have reported significant&#xD;
      short-term benefits. Current LVRS data regarding outcomes is limited by study design lacking&#xD;
      parallel control groups and lack of long term data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this proposal are: 1) To study the effects of LVRS in addition to&#xD;
      maximal medical therapy when compared to maximal medical therapy alone in terms of&#xD;
      improvement of physiology and quality of life. 2) To better define preoperative selection&#xD;
      criteria to determine which patients would benefit from this surgical intervention. To&#xD;
      accomplish these objectives, patients who meet clinical criteria and complete a pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation-program will be randomized into 2 groups: 1) Continuing optimal medical care&#xD;
      or 2) bilateral LVRS via median sternotomy in addition to medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center is currently performing LVRS under a protocol&#xD;
      supported by Merit Review funding (1996-200O, Effects of lung volume reduction surgery in the&#xD;
      treatment of severe emphysema) in selected patients with severe emphysema. This controlled&#xD;
      study is designed to determine patient selection criteria, as well as, both the short and&#xD;
      long term benefits of operated and non-operated patients with severe emphysema receiving&#xD;
      maximal medical therapy. Given the strict selection criteria and unexpectedly high survival&#xD;
      in both treatment groups to date, it is unlikely in a study of this size that survival&#xD;
      differences will be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1997 the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Health Care Financing&#xD;
      Administration organized a national registry and a controlled, multicenter clinical trial to&#xD;
      compare bilateral LVRS to maximal medical treatment (NETT, National Emphysema Treatment&#xD;
      Trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both our on-going LVRS study and the NETT have been hindered by an underestimation of the&#xD;
      difficulty in recruiting patients who qualify for this invasive study. Both studies have&#xD;
      evaluated/recruited to date approximately 50% of the projected number of subjects required to&#xD;
      achieve statistical power to draw significant clinical conclusions. In fact, the NIH is&#xD;
      investing additional funds in the national &quot;marketing&quot; of the NETT and LVRS. We believe that&#xD;
      this national marketing effort, as well as changes and enhancement of local recruiting&#xD;
      strategies will allow us to enroll adequate patients for study completion. This controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial will provide data to address crucial clinical and potential economic&#xD;
      implications of this surgical intervention in patients with severe emphysema.&#xD;
