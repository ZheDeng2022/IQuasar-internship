  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic differences in response to brain injury may reasonably be expected to play a role in&#xD;
      the initial consequences of traumatic brain injury and in the rate of recovery from such&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polymorphisms in the Apolipoprotein E gene encode functional variants which differentially&#xD;
      determine the rate at which neuronal repair can occur, and are associated with differences in&#xD;
      expression of neurodegenerative processes, including traumatic brain injury. It is proposed&#xD;
      that the accuracy of prediction of outcome after head injury will be significantly increased&#xD;
      by inclusion of APOE genotype alone, or in combination with other variables such as severity&#xD;
      of head injury, cognitive, electroencephalographic or neuroradiologic measures, or treatment&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients enrolled in the DVHIP are subject to the following recruitment criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Mild, moderate or severe closed head injury, where the cut off between mild and&#xD;
             moderate is defined by GCS&lt;12. PTA&gt;24 hrs or - foca cerebral contusion on CT/MRI or&#xD;
             Loss of Consciousness (LOC) &gt; 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: the definition of mild, moderate or severe head injury differs widely between&#xD;
             centers and is absolutely not critical for the work proposed as we will use continuous&#xD;
             measures of severity throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Within three months of first assessment. (In practice, patients may be recruited after&#xD;
             3 months. We will deal with this issue by covarying the time from injury to first&#xD;
             assessment in our analyses).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Rancho Los Amigos cognitive level of 5-7 at first assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Volunteer informed consent signed by patient of family.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Military or veterans health care beneficiary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Age 17-55&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unwillingness to participate in rehabilitation program or cooperate with&#xD;
             investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of prior severe traumatic brain injury of other severe neurologic or&#xD;
             psychiatric condition, such as psychosis, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord&#xD;
             injury.&#xD;
