      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to determine if Ro 31-7453 is more effective with or&#xD;
      without food in treating patients who have metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the impact of food on the bioavailability of Ro 31-7453 in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, crossover study. Patients are randomized to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 under fasting conditions on day 1.&#xD;
      After a 1-week washout period, patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 under fed conditions. Arm II:&#xD;
      Patients receive fed treatment as in arm I on day 1. After a 1-week washout period, patients&#xD;
      receive fasted treatment as in arm I. Both arms: At the start of week 3, patients may&#xD;
      continue to receive oral Ro 31-7453 every 12 hours on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 3&#xD;
      weeks for at least 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients (5 per arm) will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
