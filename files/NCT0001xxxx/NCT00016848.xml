  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will try to determine if intake of dietary fats or carbohydrates influences the&#xD;
      tendency to gain weight or accumulate body fat. It will examine how the hormones that&#xD;
      regulate weight may change with a shift from a balanced diet to one that is low in fat or&#xD;
      carbohydrate, irrespective of caloric intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women between the ages of 18 and 40 years with a body mass index of 30 to 49 kg/m2&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a history, physical&#xD;
      examination, blood tests and questionnaires regarding activity, prior diets, and eating&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will follow two separate diet regimens for 5 days each. The first will be a&#xD;
      balanced diet, and the second will be either a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet or a&#xD;
      low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet. The diets are not designed to produce weight loss.&#xD;
      Participants will receive all their meals and snacks for the two diets from the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health and, for the first 3 days of each diet, will be seen as outpatients. For&#xD;
      days 4 and 5 of each diet, they will be admitted to the Clinical Center and will undergo the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests - Blood samples will be collected every 30 minutes over a 24-hour period&#xD;
           through an indwelling catheter in the arm. A total of about 15 tablespoons will be drawn&#xD;
           for each of the two diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour urine collection - One 24 hour urine collection will be done at home the day&#xD;
           before admission to the Clinical Center, and the other will be done during the hospital&#xD;
           stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis and pregnancy test - A small urine sample will be taken and women will&#xD;
           provide an additional sample for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body measurements - Height and weight will be measured using scales. Body fat will be&#xD;
           measured by two methods: skin fold thickness, measured with calipers in 5 separate&#xD;
           places; and body circumference measurements, in which body parts are measured with a&#xD;
           tape measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bod pod measurement - Proportions of fat and non-fat tissue in body weight are measured&#xD;
           while the participant sits in a capsule-like device for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bioelectric impedance analysis - Proportions of body fat are measured based on&#xD;
           conduction of a small electric current.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total body water estimate -The proportion of body weight that is water is determined,&#xD;
           using a method that involves drinking a cup of a special kind of &quot;heavy&quot; water&#xD;
           (deuterium) and then measuring the amount of heavy water in a urine sample taken after 4&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise - Participants will maintain their usual exercise routine, as it was before&#xD;
           beginning the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Caloric restriction triggers a number of homeostatic endocrine responses including&#xD;
      suppression of leptin, gonadotropins, sex steroids, thyroid hormones, insulin and insulin&#xD;
      like growth factors (IGFs) and elevation of growth hormone (GH) and cortisol. Some of these&#xD;
      effects may be disadvantageous in terms of achieving loss of adipose tissue. There is little&#xD;
      information on the role of specific macronutrients in the regulation of these important&#xD;
      endocrine responses to food restriction. The present study aims to determine if dietary&#xD;
      carbohydrate and/or lipid composition has significant effects on these hormonal regulators of&#xD;
      body composition and metabolism, independent of total calorie supply. This will be achieved&#xD;
      by comparing the short-term effects of isocaloric, weight maintenance diets restricted in&#xD;
      either fat or carbohydrate with a standard balanced diet. Protein contribution as well as&#xD;
      calorie content will be held constant in the 3 diets. Study subjects will be obese women and&#xD;
      men (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2) aged 18-40 years. Major study outcome parameters include: leptin,&#xD;
      gonadotropin, GH and cortisol secretory dynamics; sex steroid, IGF, fasting insulin and&#xD;
      glucose levels.&#xD;
