      Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal injuries in the United States and the second leading&#xD;
      cause of all unintentional injury deaths. Each year fractures of the hip account for about&#xD;
      200,000 hospitalizations among the elderly and falls are contributing factors in 40 percent&#xD;
      of admissions to nursing homes. About 30 percent of community-dwelling elderly fall each&#xD;
      year, with about 10 percent seeking emergency medical help for a fall injury. Data from&#xD;
      CDC-funded study to assess falls among the elderly (SAFE) suggest that as many as 41 percent&#xD;
      of elderly patients fall at home in the year following discharge from hospitalization due in&#xD;
      part to deconditioning associated with inactivity.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal injuries in the United States and the second leading&#xD;
      cause of all unintentional injury deaths. Each year fractures of the hip account for about&#xD;
      200,000 hospitalizations among the elderly and falls are contributing factors in 40 percent&#xD;
      of admissions to nursing homes. About 30 percent of community-dwelling elderly fall each&#xD;
      year, with about 10 percent seeking emergency medical help for a fall injury. Data from&#xD;
      CDC-funded study to assess falls among the elderly (SAFE) suggest that as many as 41 percent&#xD;
      of elderly patients fall at home in the year following discharge from hospitalization due in&#xD;
      part to deconditioning associated with inactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The controlled trial of a physical restoration (PR) intervention (Geriatric Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Intensive Program, SAFE-GRIP) is designed to improve physical functional capacity and to&#xD;
      reduce the likelihood of falls in the elderly during the period following discharge from&#xD;
      hospitalization or inactivity/bed rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a four year randomized trial of SAFE-GRIP, designed to improve the physical&#xD;
      functional capacity, to reduce the likelihood of falls and to decrease the chance of injury&#xD;
      from falls. Patients at home or recently discharged to home will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of two groups, PR or control, upon receiving medical clearance (time=0). This project will&#xD;
      provide mechanisms to establish well-designed innovative physical restoration (PR) protocols&#xD;
      for the Miami VAMC and test the effects of these interventions on the rate of&#xD;
      falling/sustaining injuries and their sequelae at home. Our anticipated sample was 105 males&#xD;
      and 105 females aged 60+ years inactive at home or recently discharged to home from the Miami&#xD;
      VAMC and a neighboring community hospital. Study participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two groups, PR or control, upon receiving medical clearance. Baseline measures of&#xD;
      physical function, health care utilization, ADL/IADL performance and health-related quality&#xD;
      of life will be taken following assignment to treatment conditions. These same measures will&#xD;
      be taken again at eight weeks following medical clearance, and again at six months. The&#xD;
      incidence of falls will be tracked throughout the funding period for each subject.&#xD;
      Self-report of the number of falls in the year prior to hospitalization, an assessment of&#xD;
      in-home hazards, and an assessment of participants' post-hospitalization medication regimen&#xD;
      will be obtained at the baseline assessment and used as covariates in the analysis of&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects have completed the study intervention phase. The projected submission date of&#xD;
      the final report is September 30, 2001. Analysis of the prospectively collected study data is&#xD;
      underway. We have acquired the HCFA Denominator Files, and Inpatient Files, and Part B&#xD;
      Provider Service Files for the years 1997, 1998, and 1999. The extraction of 1997, 1998, and&#xD;
      1999 Part B Provider Service Files is almost complete and the analysis of the Inpatient Files&#xD;
      is underway.&#xD;
