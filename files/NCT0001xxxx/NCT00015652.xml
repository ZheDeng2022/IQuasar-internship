  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a new treatment for hepatitis C (HCV) in&#xD;
      patients who also have HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual treatment for HCV in people who are not HIV-infected is interferon-alfa (IFN) with&#xD;
      ribavirin (RBV), an approved treatment by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study&#xD;
      will use a new, longer acting form of IFN called PEG-IFN alfa-2b. PEG-IFN alfa-2b is approved&#xD;
      by the FDA for use in treating HCV but has not yet been approved for use with RBV. This study&#xD;
      also will use IL-2, which is a substance that the body naturally produces. People with HIV&#xD;
      infection usually do not make enough IL-2. IL-2 is being tested in this study to see if it&#xD;
      will &quot;boost&quot; the immune system's response to HCV. The FDA has approved IL-2 for the treatment&#xD;
      of some cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HCV infection is an increasingly important clinical problem in patients infected with HIV. In&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected patients with acute HCV infection, the presence of vigorous T-cell&#xD;
      proliferative responses to HCV proteins is associated with normalization of serum&#xD;
      transaminase levels and viral clearance. Furthermore, early results suggest IL-2 may improve&#xD;
      transaminase levels in HCV/HIV patients. These observations provide the rationale for an&#xD;
      immune-based therapeutic approach to HCV/HIV coinfection. This study explores the use of&#xD;
      initial immunostimulatory therapy with IL-2 followed by the addition of antiviral therapy&#xD;
      with PEG-IFN alfa-2b and RBV, as a possible synergistic approach to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive IL-2 for 12 weeks followed by the addition of PEG-IFN alfa-2b and RBV at the&#xD;
      Week 12 visit. Patients remain on IL-2, PEG-IFN alfa-2b, and RBV for an additional 48 weeks.&#xD;
      At Week 60, all study treatment is permanently discontinued and patients continue to be&#xD;
      evaluated through Week 84. Toxicity or intolerance is evaluated. Data is collected on&#xD;
      biochemical and virologic responses.&#xD;
