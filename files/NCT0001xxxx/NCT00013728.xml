  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are testing the following two hypotheses: 1) Peaks in hourly exposures to airborne&#xD;
      particulate matter (PM) of outdoor origin will be more closely associated with acute&#xD;
      asthmatic responses to particles than 24-hour average exposures in susceptible individuals;&#xD;
      2) Personal exposure to PM, and estimated particle dose to the lungs, will be more closely&#xD;
      associated with daily asthma severity than standard outdoor particle concentrations measured&#xD;
      as 24-hour averages at governmental monitoring sites.&#xD;

      We are testing the following two hypotheses: 1) Peaks in hourly exposures to airborne&#xD;
      particulate matter (PM) of outdoor origin will be more closely associated with acute&#xD;
      asthmatic responses to particles than 24-hour average exposures in susceptible individuals;&#xD;
      2) Personal exposure to PM, and estimated particle dose to the lungs, will be more closely&#xD;
      associated with daily asthma severity than standard outdoor particle concentrations measured&#xD;
      as 24-hour averages at governmental monitoring sites. Toxicological data for asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations from particulate matter (PM) suggests that particle deposition in the lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract can cause inflammatory and lung function changes suggestive of asthma&#xD;
      pathology. There is now a scientific need to explain epidemiological findings of ambient PM&#xD;
      effects on asthmatics at mass concentrations below what is expected (from toxicological data)&#xD;
      to be harmful. One possibility is that study participants are encountering unmeasured&#xD;
      short-term excursions of particle mass levels capable of inducing adverse reactions in the&#xD;
      lung, but this effect is only captured somewhat by the regulatory standard of 24-hour&#xD;
      averages. Our research in southern California is vital to the current controversy regarding&#xD;
      regulatory standards given that a health-based scientific rationale for any specific PM&#xD;
      averaging time is not established.&#xD;
