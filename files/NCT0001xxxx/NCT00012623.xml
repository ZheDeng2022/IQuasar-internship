      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBOCs represent one of VA's main managed care strategies for shifting the focus of care from&#xD;
      the inpatient to the outpatient setting and for improving the health of our nation's&#xD;
      veterans. Hypothesis-driven research is critically needed to test the basic assumptions&#xD;
      motivating the expansion of CBOCs throughout the VA health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose was to determine how increased geographic access to primary care services affects&#xD;
      service use and costs. Two specific aims addressed were: 1) to determine how CBOCs impact the&#xD;
      service use of all existing users and existing users with the following ambulatory care&#xD;
      sensitive conditions (ACSC): alcohol dependence, angina, chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD), depression, diabetes and hypertension; and 2) to describe how CBOCs affect&#xD;
      the workload and costs of the VA health care system from the VISN's perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quasi-experimental pre-post study design with intervention and reference groups was&#xD;
      employed to compare service use and costs in the 18 months following the establishment of a&#xD;
      new CBOC. Fifteen CBOCs from 11 VISNs were included in the analysis. For specific aim 1, the&#xD;
      intervention group was defined as existing users in the catchment area of a new CBOC and the&#xD;
      reference group was defined as matched existing users outside CBOC catchment areas.&#xD;
      Multivariate statistical regression analyses were used to estimate the impact of residing&#xD;
      within the CBOC catchment area on use and cost in the post-period, controlling for patient&#xD;
      casemix and use/cost in the 18 month pre-period. For specific aim 2, the intervention group&#xD;
      was defined as zip codes in the catchment area of a new CBOC and the reference group was&#xD;
      defined as matched zip codes outside CBOC catchment areas. Average use and costs for all&#xD;
      users, existing users and new users from intervention zip codes and reference zip codes were&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
