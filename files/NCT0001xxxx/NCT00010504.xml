  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is the second most common rheumatic disorder, affecting approximately 8-10&#xD;
      million persons in the U.S., and is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and soft&#xD;
      tissue tenderness upon examination. This study focuses on the use of acupuncture as a mode of&#xD;
      therapy for fibromyalgia. The issues under examination are: 1) the optimal duration of&#xD;
      treatment, 2) the independent and synergistic effects of needle placement and needle&#xD;
      stimulation, and 3) appropriate control strategies. The proposal utilizes a randomized,&#xD;
      blinded, sham-controlled design to achieve these aims. Subjects are randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of four groups: 1)active site with stimulation, 2) active site, without stimulation, 3) sham&#xD;
      site with stimulation, and 4) sham site, without stimulation. All subjects will receive&#xD;
      acupuncture at escalating frequency, beginning at once per week and ending at 3 times per&#xD;
      week. This &quot;forced titration&quot; design allows for the detection of inter-subject differences in&#xD;
      responsiveness to acupuncture, as well as the factors which may predict responsiveness (or&#xD;
      lack thereof). Secondary goals of the study are to collect data on the mechanism, safety, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in fibromyalgia, and to determine the optimal outcome&#xD;
      measures, for a full scale research clinical trial.&#xD;
