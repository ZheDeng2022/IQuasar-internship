  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether metformin alone, rosiglitazone alone, or&#xD;
      metformin and rosiglitazone together will lower insulin levels in the blood and decrease fat&#xD;
      in the abdomen or other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that certain anti-HIV medications can cause a number of side effects,&#xD;
      including high blood sugar (resulting from the body's failure to use insulin), high insulin,&#xD;
      and excess fat build-up in the abdominal area. These side effects are known to increase the&#xD;
      risk of heart disease. Metformin and rosiglitazone are 2 drugs that have been shown to lower&#xD;
      insulin resistance and lessen abdominal fat in patients who are not HIV-infected. This study&#xD;
      will investigate the use of these drugs in HIV-infected patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have documented hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance in&#xD;
      a seemingly increasing proportion of patients with HIV infection. Other studies have&#xD;
      described a variety of syndromes of fat accumulation and fat loss, including abdominal&#xD;
      obesity. Although initially attributed specifically to protease inhibitors (PI), these&#xD;
      abnormalities also have been observed in antiretroviral-experienced but PI-naive patients.&#xD;
      Hyperinsulinemia and abdominal obesity are strong independent risk factors for coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. In noninfected patients, metformin and thiazolidinediones have been shown to&#xD;
      reduce insulin resistance by different mechanisms and also to reduce visceral adiposity. This&#xD;
      study investigates the use of metformin and rosiglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione&#xD;
      class, in HIV-infected patients with hyperinsulinemia and central fat accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry, clinical and laboratory assessments are performed. A standard OGTT, with&#xD;
      plasma samples drawn over 120 minutes, will be performed for glucose and insulin&#xD;
      determinations. After completion of entry evaluations, patients are assigned randomly to 1 of&#xD;
      4 double-blinded treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Metformin plus rosiglitazone placebo. Arm B: Metformin placebo plus rosiglitazone. Arm&#xD;
      C: Metformin plus rosiglitazone. Arm D: Metformin placebo plus rosiglitazone placebo.&#xD;
      Patients who are still on study drugs at Week 16 (at either full or reduced dose) are&#xD;
      switched to the open-label phase to receive the combination of metformin and rosiglitazone&#xD;
      through Week 32. Patients have evaluations at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, and 32.&#xD;
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02: Evaluations must be performed under fasting conditions.] Safety&#xD;
      indices, fasting insulin and glucose levels, visceral [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02: and&#xD;
      subcutaneous abdominal] fat are assessed. [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02: Patients who&#xD;
      discontinue study treatment due to pregnancy during the study will have the Week 32&#xD;
      evaluations (except CT and DEXA scans).] [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02: A mid-thigh measurement&#xD;
      was added to the study as a secondary endpoint to look for changes in extremity subcutaneous&#xD;
      fat from therapy with rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone and other peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma activators increase subcutaneous adipogenesis&#xD;
      and may thus increase subcutaneous fat and improve insulin resistance in this way.]&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a viral load (level of HIV in the blood) below 10,000 copies/ml, within 30 days&#xD;
             before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a fasting blood insulin level at 15 micro IU/ml or greater; or a 2-hour insulin&#xD;
             at least 75 micro IU/ml or greater following 75 g glucose load; or a 2-hour glucose&#xD;
             greater than 140 mg/dl following 75 g glucose load AND fasting serum insulin at least&#xD;
             10 micro IU/ml or greater, within 30 days before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet physical restrictions based on the amount and location of body fat and also on&#xD;
             height and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have noticed changes in the location of their body fat during the course of their HIV&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are 18 to 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have taken the same anti-HIV drugs for at least 60 days before study entry and do not&#xD;
             plan to change these drugs for the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If taking hormones, have been on the same treatment for at least 6 months before study&#xD;
             entry and do not plan to change for the entire study. Hormones include birth control&#xD;
             pills, estrogen, or progestin for women and testosterone for men. If hormones were&#xD;
             taken and then stopped, the treatment must have ended at least 6 months before the&#xD;
             patient enters the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a negative pregnancy test within 30 days before taking the study drugs, if female&#xD;
             and able to have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to avoid trying to become pregnant or causing someone to become pregnant. Agree&#xD;
             not to donate sperm or participate in other fertilization procedures. If sexually&#xD;
             active, agree to use [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02: 1] effective method of birth control&#xD;
             while taking the study medications and for at least 30 days after stopping the study&#xD;
             medications. Women who are not able to give birth or whose male partner is sterile are&#xD;
             not required to use birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Several changes have been made to this study. In earlier versions, a fasting blood&#xD;
             insulin above 15 micro IU/ml was the only level accepted. Now there are several other&#xD;
             insulin/glucose levels included. In addition, the timing of pregnancy tests has&#xD;
             changed from 14 days to 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are allergic to metformin or rosiglitazone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abuse drugs or alcohol.&#xD;

             appetite, experimental drugs to increase appetite or weight gain, drugs that affect&#xD;
             the immune system, pentoxifylline, thalidomide, niacin (a multivitamin containing&#xD;
             niacin is okay), hydroxyurea, and cimetidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are taking ritonavir with simvastatin or lovastatin (drugs to lower cholesterol).&#xD;
