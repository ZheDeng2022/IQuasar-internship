      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irofulven in treating patients who have&#xD;
      recurrent or persistent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical activity of irofulven in patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      persistent ovarian epithelial cancer. II. Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of this&#xD;
      drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacodynamic relationship between plasma&#xD;
      concentrations and clinical activity or toxicity of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to the number of prior treatment regimens (1-2 vs&#xD;
      3 or more). Patients receive irofulven IV over 5 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 4&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed&#xD;
      every 4 weeks until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 74 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.&#xD;
