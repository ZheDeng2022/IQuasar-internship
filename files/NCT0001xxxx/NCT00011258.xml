      Atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries is a common cause of stroke. The prevalence and&#xD;
      progression of carotid atherosclerosis are believed to be influenced by genetically inherited&#xD;
      variations in lipoprotein metabolism. This study investigates the specific role of&#xD;
      paraoxonase, an enzyme thought to detoxify atherogenic oxidized low-density lipoprotein. This&#xD;
      study compares veterans who have significant carotid atherosclerosis on ultrasound&#xD;
      examination with controls without carotid atherosclerosis. Both paraoxonase activity and&#xD;
      genotype will be determined and compared between groups. The results may eventually make it&#xD;
      possible to screen for a paraoxonase allele that confers high risk of atherosclerosis, and to&#xD;
      diminish the risk by early treatment.&#xD;

      Study Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the contribution and mechanism of&#xD;
      paraoxonase (PON1) genotypic and phenotypic variation (PON1 status) in risk and progression&#xD;
      of carotid artery disease (CAAD). We propose to study moderately affected individuals&#xD;
      currently being enrolled in a longitudinal, 3-year magnetic resonance imaging (MR) study to&#xD;
      evaluate components of MR image as predictors of CAAD progression. We will study the role of&#xD;
      PON1 in CAAD progression in this cohort. We will also collect age-, sex-, race-, and&#xD;
      hospital- matched controls, to test hypotheses related to the presence or absence of CAAD. We&#xD;
      plan to consider the complex genetic architecture of both vascular disease and PON1 effects&#xD;
      in vascular disease. In addition to evaluating known paraoxonase (PON1) polymorphisms, we&#xD;
      will evaluate PON1 hydrolysis phenotypes. We have shown that these intervening phenotypes can&#xD;
      be superior to known genotypes in CAAD prediction. We will also evaluate PON1 polymorphisms&#xD;
      that we have recently detected and shown to affect PON1 expression, as well as consider&#xD;
      haplotype effects. The specific aims are to: 1) test for PON1 effects in CAAD progression&#xD;
      evaluated by 3 year magnetic resonance image follow-up of percent lumen stenosis; 2) test for&#xD;
      PON1 effects in moderate CAAD vs. control prediction, including independence of PON1 from&#xD;
      traditional cardiovascular risk factors; and 3) evaluate the possible mechanisms of PON1's&#xD;
      association with carotid artery disease, specifically PON1's relationship with the&#xD;
      susceptibility of LDL to oxidation and variation in LDL density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two paraoxonase (PON1) polymorphisms, PON1-Q192R and PON1-L55M have been inconsistently&#xD;
      associated with vascular disease. However, plasma PON1 activity phenotypes vary markedly&#xD;
      within genotypes. Thus, activity was expected to add to the informativeness of genotype for&#xD;
      predicting vascular disease. The case-control study included 212 age and race matched men&#xD;
      with mean age 66.4 yr. (range 49-82 yr.); 95% were Caucasian. The 106 carotid artery disease&#xD;
      (CAAD) cases had &gt;80% carotid stenosis and the 106 controls had &lt;15% stenosis. Two PON1&#xD;
      substrate hydrolysis rates (paraoxon, POase; diazoxon, DZOase) were significantly lower in&#xD;
      cases than in controls and were significant predictors of CAAD using logistic regression&#xD;
      (POase, p=0.005, 25% reduced; DZOase, p=0.019, 16% reduced). POase and DZOase were both&#xD;
      significant when included in the same model. DZOase predicted vascular disease independently&#xD;
      of lipoprotein profile, HDL subfractions, apoAI, and smoking. The marginal effects of&#xD;
      PON1-192 (p=0.75) and PON1-55 (p=0.83) genotypes or haplotype (0.70) did not predict&#xD;
      case-control status. However, when phenotype was included as a predictor both PON1-192 and&#xD;
      PON1-55 genotypes or haplotypes were significant predictors at the 0.05 level. The common&#xD;
      methodology of examining PON1-192 and/or PON1-55 genotypes alone may lead to the erroneous&#xD;
      conclusion that there is no PON1 role in CAAD. This may have broad implications for the&#xD;
      utility of the &quot;genotype only&quot; approach. These results support the benefit of a &quot;level&#xD;
      crossing&quot; approach that includes intervening phenotypes in the study of complexly inherited&#xD;
      disease&#xD;
