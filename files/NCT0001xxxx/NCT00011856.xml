  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate cerebral (brain) aneurysms and their possible inheritance&#xD;
      patterns in families. It will try to determine how often brain aneurysms occur in families in&#xD;
      which more than one member has had an aneurysm and to find the gene or genes that contribute&#xD;
      to their development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People in families in which more than one family member had a cerebral aneurysm are eligible&#xD;
      for this 1-day study. They will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn (no more than 3 to 4 tablespoons) for research to identify genes&#xD;
           that contribute to the development of brain aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A magnetic resonance angiograph (MRA) scan will be done to examine a specific brain area&#xD;
           where aneurysms typically occur. Magnetic resonance imaging uses a strong magnetic field&#xD;
           and radio waves to produce images of the brain and detect abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a more detailed picture of the brain is needed than can be obtained with MRA, a more&#xD;
      specific MRA scan will be done using a contrast dye to enhance the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be invited to participate in related NIH research studies.&#xD;

      This study is designed to explore the genetics of familial cerebral aneurysms. Families in&#xD;
      which more than one person has had a known cerebral aneurysm will be studied. Family&#xD;
      histories will be obtained and participants identified who are willing to come to the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center for an MRAngiograph and venipuncture. DNA will be isolated and linkage&#xD;
      studies undertaken to identify loci involved in the etiology of familial cerebral aneurysms,&#xD;
      using standard linkage approaches.&#xD;
