      RATIONALE: Thalidomide may kill cancer cells by stopping the growth of new blood vessels to&#xD;
      the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients with&#xD;
      HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of thalidomide in terms of regression or&#xD;
      stabilization of disease in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. II. Determine the&#xD;
      toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this&#xD;
      regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide on day 1. Treatment continues daily for 6 months&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete or&#xD;
      partial response or stable disease after 6 months of treatment may continue treatment for an&#xD;
      additional 6 months. Patients are followed at 1, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study within&#xD;
      3.75-6.25 months.&#xD;
