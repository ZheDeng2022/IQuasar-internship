  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will try to learn more about the genetic cause and symptoms of microphthalmia&#xD;
      (small eyes) or anophthalmia (absence of one or both eyes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with microphthalmia or anophthalmia with mental retardation may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Patients' parents and siblings will also be included for genetic studies. Patients may&#xD;
      participate in both the clinical and laboratory parts of the study or just the laboratory&#xD;
      part, as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laboratory study consists of DNA analysis to determine the genetic cause of&#xD;
      microphthalmia/anophthalmia. The DNA sample is obtained using one of the following methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw - for young children, a numbing cream is applied to the skin before the&#xD;
           needlestick to decrease the pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy - a small piece of skin (about 1/8-inch in diameter) is removed surgically&#xD;
           after the area has been numbed with an anesthetic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cotton swab - a specimen is collected from inside the cheek using a cotton swab. This is&#xD;
           done only for patients who cannot provide a blood or skin sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prenatal sample - If, in the case of newborns, specimens are left from prenatal testing,&#xD;
           these can be used instead of a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients may have a permanent cell line grown from the blood or skin sample for use in&#xD;
      future research tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the clinical study, participants undergo some or all of the following procedures at the&#xD;
      NIH Clinical Center:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical photographs, X-rays, blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain - a diagnostic procedure that uses a&#xD;
           magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays to produce images of the brain&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to identify and analyze the underlying mechanistic pathway of X-linked&#xD;
      microphthalmia/anophthalmia. This is a heterogeneous group that includes syndromic&#xD;
      microphthalmia 1 (MCOPS1) OMIM #309800, and syndromic microphthalmia 2 (MCOPS2) OMIM #300166&#xD;
      and other, as yet to be defined, malformations of the globe. We have identified a causative&#xD;
      gene for MCOPS1 (Ng, et al 2004). To further delineate these conditions, we will study&#xD;
      families with these features through a combined clinical and molecular approach. Specimens&#xD;
      will be collected and evaluated in the laboratory by linkage analysis, physical mapping,&#xD;
      candidate gene characterization, mutation screening, genotype-phenotype correlation, and cell&#xD;
      biologic studies of normal and mutant proteins.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria will consist of affected individuals with unilateral or bilateral&#xD;
        microphthalmia/anophthalmia from families with an X-linked mode of transmission. In&#xD;
        addition, we may analyze patients with mental retardation with or without eye defects to&#xD;
        allow genotype phenotype correlation studies. Parents and siblings will be included for&#xD;
        linkage analysis. Unaffected non-transmitting parents may be included to clarify haplotype&#xD;
        status. In addition, families with X-linked microphthalmia/anophthalmia with associated&#xD;
        anomalies such as Lenz dysplasia and other X-linked microphthalmia/anophthalmia syndromes&#xD;
        will be analyzed to determine if these conditions are allelic. Sporadic cases of&#xD;
        microphthalmia with or without mental retardation may be considered for study, along with&#xD;
        parents and unaffected siblings. Unaffected subjects may also be enrolled if needed for&#xD;
        controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specimens from patients collected at outside institutions may be accepted into the study if&#xD;
        they were collected under an IRB-approved protocol at a multiple project assurance (FWA)&#xD;
        institution or if the IRB waives review of the study and allows usage of the NIH consent.&#xD;
        Some of these patient samples may represent overlapping phenotypes (e.g., laterality&#xD;
        defects) and not microphthalmia. Inheritance patterns may not be known for these.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the patient has microphthalmia/anophthalmia with autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant&#xD;
        pattern of inheritance, the family will be excluded. While this criterion should enrich for&#xD;
        X-linked syndromic microphthalmia, the rarity of the disorder necessitates that we will&#xD;
        accept small families and even sporadic cases if they have substantial clinical overlap&#xD;
        with Lenz or OFCD.&#xD;
