    <textblock>
      The current large randomized placebo-controlled trial is testing the ability of acupuncture&#xD;
      to treat major depression. The study is unique in that treatment effects will be from the&#xD;
      perspective of both Western psychiatry and Chinese medicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is an unfortunately common condition for which people often seek alternative&#xD;
      (non-Western) treatments, perhaps because conventional treatments do not consistently provide&#xD;
      lasting relief. A pilot study (Allen, Schnyer and Hitt, 1998) suggests that acupuncture, a&#xD;
      popular but under-researched alternative treatment derived from Chinese medicine, holds&#xD;
      sufficient promise as a treatment for depression to warrant a larger-scale clinical trial.&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a larger-scale test of the efficacy of acupuncture in&#xD;
      this trial. Because relapse and recurrence of Major Depression are quite common, the&#xD;
      investigators also will assess the clinical status of participants for 18 months after&#xD;
      treatment concludes. In the first phase of this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 150&#xD;
      men and women meeting criteria for Major Depression will be randomly assigned to a treatment&#xD;
      approach or to a waitlist control. All participants will ultimately receive acupuncture&#xD;
      designed to address their own particular constellation of depressive symptoms. At the end of&#xD;
      this first phase, blind assessments will be used to compare treatment effects from the&#xD;
      perspectives of both Western psychiatry and Chinese medicine. After this treatment phase,&#xD;
      participants will be assessed several times over the next 18 months. The study is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and clinical significance of acupuncture as a treatment for Major&#xD;
      Depression, and to examine the convergence of Western-based and Chinese-medicine-based&#xD;
      outcome measures. Finally, the study will determine whether changes in energetic pattern&#xD;
      mediate changes in Western defined depression severity, and explore whether patient and&#xD;
      history variables predict responses to acupuncture treatments.&#xD;
