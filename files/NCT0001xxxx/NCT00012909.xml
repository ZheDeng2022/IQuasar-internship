      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision regarding the use of post-menopausal estrogen hormone replacement therapy (HT)&#xD;
      is complex because patients must balance the short and long-term risks and benefits.&#xD;
      Information from new and important clinical trials must also be considered. The purpose of&#xD;
      this research is to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a HT CD-ROM decision-aid in&#xD;
      improving the decision making process for women considering the use of estrogen HT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to: 1) develop a model of the decision-making process for&#xD;
      postmenopausal women considering hormone (HT), based on Multi-Attribute Utility Theory&#xD;
      (MAUT); 2) produce an interactive CD-ROM decision-aid for HT; 3) evaluate the effect of the&#xD;
      interactive CD-ROM decision-aid on patient satisfaction with decision (SWD) and knowledge&#xD;
      about menopause and HT; and 4) test the effect of the interactive CD-ROM decision-aid on&#xD;
      women�s decisions regarding use of HT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (completed) used structured interviews and surveys in the development of a decision&#xD;
      model for HT. In phase II, an interactive CD-ROM decision-aid was developed and a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) of its effect on decision processes was conducted. Postmenopausal&#xD;
      women, aged 45-74 were recruited from the primary care clinics of the four participating&#xD;
      Veterans Affairs hospitals: Milwaukee, Madison, Chicago-Hines, and Chicago-Westside. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis was that women who use the CD-ROM decision-aid would demonstrate increased&#xD;
      satisfaction with their decision regarding hormone replacement therapy use compared to women&#xD;
      receiving the control intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment and follow-up assessments have been completed. The study is in the analysis phase.&#xD;
      The study was presented to the VA HSR&amp;D Combined Monitoring Board on February 5, 2003 and the&#xD;
      committee voted unanimously to recommend continuation of the trial. The study has had one&#xD;
      publication and several scientific abstract presentations.&#xD;
