  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test how the body's immune system responds to the vaccine&#xD;
      ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 and to determine if the vaccine is safe when given alone and with MN&#xD;
      rgp120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infection and AIDS have no cure, in spite of recent advances in anti-HIV drugs. Many&#xD;
      worldwide populations cannot afford the antiviral treatments for infected people. HIV&#xD;
      vaccines offer hope for disease prevention. In this trial, 2 experimental HIV vaccines called&#xD;
      ALVAC vCP1452 and MN rgp120 will be given to volunteers in Haiti, Brazil, Peru, and Trinidad&#xD;
      and Tobago. The study will determine how volunteers' immune systems respond to the vaccines.&#xD;
      (This protocol has been changed by adding new international sites.)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no cure for HIV infection or AIDS in spite of recent advances in antiviral therapy.&#xD;
      Furthermore, drug therapy is too expensive for most affected populations. For this reason,&#xD;
      there is a commitment to the development of safe, effective vaccines to prevent HIV infection&#xD;
      and AIDS worldwide. This study evaluates the immunogenicity and safety of candidate HIV-1&#xD;
      vaccines, based on the canarypox vector termed ALVAC, alone and combined with an MN rgp120&#xD;
      product, at 3 [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/19/01: 5] international sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/19/01: Volunteers in Rio de Janeiro, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago&#xD;
      comprise Part I; volunteers in Sao Paulo and Peru comprise Part II.] Volunteers from Haiti,&#xD;
      Brazil, [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/19/01: Peru] and Trinidad and Tobago are enrolled into 1 of 3&#xD;
      arms and followed for 18 months. Arm 1 volunteers receive ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 at 0, 1, 3, and 6&#xD;
      months. Arm 2 volunteers receive ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 on the same schedule as Arm 1 and receive&#xD;
      HIV-1 MN rgp120 subunit simultaneously with the 3-month and 6-month vaccine doses. Arm 3&#xD;
      volunteers receive a placebo. Blood and urine samples are collected for immunologic assays,&#xD;
      virologic determinations, pregnancy testing, and safety assessments. Risk behavior and social&#xD;
      harms are assessed every 6 months during follow-up [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/19/01: Social harms&#xD;
      are assessed every 3 months during follow-up and risk behavior every 6 months]. At all clinic&#xD;
      visits volunteers receive counseling on avoidance of HIV infection and pregnancy.&#xD;
      Participants are tested for HIV-1 every 3 [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/19/01: the following text has&#xD;
      been deleted: to 6] months. Counseling and follow-up for any needed medical care are&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
