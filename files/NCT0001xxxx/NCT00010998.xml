  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Changes in visual attention are common among elders and people with multiple sclerosis. The&#xD;
      visual attention changes contribute to difficulty with day to day functioning including&#xD;
      falls, driving and even finding one's keys on the kitchen counter as well as contributing to&#xD;
      deficits in other cognitive domains. Yoga emphasizes the ability to focus attention and there&#xD;
      is some evidence that the practice of yoga may improve one's cognitive abilities.&#xD;
      Additionally, yoga practice may improve cognitive function through other non-specific means&#xD;
      such as improved mood, decreased stress or declines in oxidative injury. We propose a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled 6 month phase II trial of yoga in two separate cohorts: healthy elders&#xD;
      and subjects with mild multiple sclerosis. We will determine if yoga intervention produces&#xD;
      improvements on a broad attentional battery that especially emphasizes attentional control.&#xD;
      To further understand the reported beneficial effect of yoga on its practitioners, we will&#xD;
      also determine if there is a positive impact on measures directly related to yoga practice&#xD;
      (flexibility and balance) as well as mood, quality of life and oxidative injury markers. The&#xD;
      yoga intervention consists of a Hatha yoga class meeting twice per week. The class is taught&#xD;
      by experienced yoga teachers who are supervised by a nationally known yoga instructor. There&#xD;
      are two control groups. An exercise group will have a structured walking program prescribed&#xD;
      by a certified Health and Fitness Instructor and Personal Trainer. The program will attempt&#xD;
      to match the Hatha yoga class for metabolic demand. The second control group will be assigned&#xD;
      to a 6 month waiting list. The outcome measures are assessed at baseline and after the 6&#xD;
      month period. The primary outcome measures are alertness (quantitative EEG and self-rated&#xD;
      scale), ability to focus attention (Stroop) and ability to shift attention (extradimensional&#xD;
      set shifting task). Secondary attention outcome measures include the ability to sustain&#xD;
      attention (decrement in reaction time) and ability to divide attention (Useful Field of&#xD;
      View). Other secondary outcome measures include flexibility, balance, mood, quality of life,&#xD;
      fatigue (in MS cohort) and decreased markers of lipid, protein, and DNA oxidative injury.&#xD;
