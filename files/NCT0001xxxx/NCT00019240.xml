      RATIONALE: Herpesvirus is found in Kaposi's sarcoma lesions in most patients; it is therefore&#xD;
      possible that the herpesvirus has a role in causing Kaposi's sarcoma. Cidofovir is an&#xD;
      antiviral drug that acts against many types of herpesvirus, and may be an effective treatment&#xD;
      for Kaposi's sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cidofovir in treating patients with&#xD;
      Kaposi's sarcoma with or without HIV infection.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity of intravenous cidofovir in patients with&#xD;
      Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. II.&#xD;
      Assess the effect of intravenous cidofovir on the load of KS-associated herpesvirus/human&#xD;
      herpesvirus-8 in KS lesions and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by quantitative polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction. III. Assess the toxicity of cidofovir in KS patients with and without HIV&#xD;
      infection. IV. Assess the effect of cidofovir on angiogenic cytokines related to the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: All patients receive intravenous cidofovir weekly for 2 weeks, then every other week&#xD;
      for 6 months. Patients with a complete or partial response may continue treatment until&#xD;
      disease progression intervenes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 25 evaluable patients will be entered over approximately 6 months if&#xD;
      there are at least 2 responses in the first 15 patients.&#xD;
