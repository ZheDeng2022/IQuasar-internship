      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who&#xD;
      have advanced solid tumors that have spread to the brain.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the response rate of patients with cerebral metastases who have failed&#xD;
      or refused standard therapy when treated with temozolomide. II. Assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the quality of life of patients&#xD;
      treated with this drug. IV. Determine the response rate of systemic disease outside the&#xD;
      central nervous system in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide daily for 6 weeks. Treatment repeats every 10&#xD;
      weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed on day 1 of each 10-week course. Patients are followed for 30&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.&#xD;

          -  Platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dl or 100 g/l&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BUN and serum creatinine &lt;1.5 times upper limit of laboratory normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total and direct bilirubin &lt;1.5 times upper limit of laboratory normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SGOT and SGPT &lt; 3 times upper limit of laboratory normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alkaline Phosphatase &lt; 3 times upper limit of laboratory normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A life expectancy from disease outside the CNS of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have histologically confirmed advanced solid malignancy with brain&#xD;
             metastases, with or without systemic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have failed or refused prior standard therapy for cerebral metastases&#xD;
             and have imaging evidence of progressive disease. Prior therapy may include surgery&#xD;
             and/or whole brain radiotherapy and/or stereotactic radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 2 weeks must have elapsed since the completion of radiotherapy at any site&#xD;
             other than brain, prior to start of study medication. At least 4 weeks must have&#xD;
             elapsed since the completion of brain radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since systemic therapy prior to start of study&#xD;
             medication, all clinically significant toxicities (other than hair loss) must have&#xD;
             resolved, and the patient must meet the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic disease may be absent, present and controlled or present and uncontrolled. If&#xD;
             uncontrolled, the systemic disease should be considered less life-threatening than the&#xD;
             cerebral disease. Patients may have received adjuvant chemotherapy and may have&#xD;
             received one or more chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with breast cancer who have progressive brain metastases, but stable systemic&#xD;
             disease whilst on hormonal therapy, may continue the same hormonal therapy, as it can&#xD;
             be assumed that the blood brain barrier is preventing response to this agent in the&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bidimensionally measurable disease must be documented in the brain on gadolinium&#xD;
             magnetic resonance imaging (GdMRI) scan of the brain within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment into the study. In the case of patients who received prior radiotherapy,&#xD;
             the MRI scan findings must be consistent with progressive disease following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had previous surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy must have lesions&#xD;
             clearly measurable and distinct from the surgical and/or radiation changes induced by&#xD;
             prior or local therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may be treated with steroids before initiation of protocol therapy and will&#xD;
             be eligible if they are neurologically stable or improving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No recovery from all active toxicities of prior therapies (other than hair loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery within 1 week (inclusive) prior to study drug administration, otherwise may be&#xD;
             eligible providing acute toxicity is resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are poor medical risks because of non-malignant systemic disease as well&#xD;
             as those with acute infection treated with intravenous antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Frequent vomiting or medical condition that could interfere with oral medication&#xD;
             intake (e.g., partial bowel obstruction).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent primary malignancies at other sites with the exception of surgically cured&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
             Prior malignancies which have not required anti-tumor treatment within the preceding&#xD;
             24 months are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV positivity or AIDS-related illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential who are not using an effective method of&#xD;
             contraception. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test 24 hours prior to administration of study drug and be practicing medically&#xD;
             approved contraceptive precautions.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy (excluding nitrosurea, mitomycin C or vincristine), within four weeks,&#xD;
             inclusive, prior to study drug administration; biologic therapy or immunotherapy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Nitrosurea or mitomycin C administration within six weeks, inclusive, prior to study&#xD;
             drug administration.&#xD;
