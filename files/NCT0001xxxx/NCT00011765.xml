  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether fluoxetine (Prozac), used together with traditional&#xD;
      psychotherapy, can reduce aggression in people who are physically violent towards their&#xD;
      spouses or significant others. Treatment for domestic violence has centered on behavioral&#xD;
      therapies, such as anger management and self-control exercises. Recent studies have shown&#xD;
      that fluoxetine-a drug commonly used to treat depression and panic disorder-can decrease acts&#xD;
      of aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women between the ages of 18 and 65 who have a history of inflicting physical&#xD;
      aggression on a spouses or significant others in the past year (with at least one episode&#xD;
      occurring not under the influence of alcohol) may be eligible for this study. Participants&#xD;
      spouses or significant others will also be asked to participate. All potential participants&#xD;
      will be screened with a medical and psychiatric evaluation and history, breath alcohol&#xD;
      analysis, blood tests, urine drug screen and electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those enrolled will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perpetrator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview and questionnaires - Participants will be interviewed by a social worker about&#xD;
           past and current mental health and use of alcohol and illicit drugs and will complete&#xD;
           questionnaires assessing emotional state and personality, depression, anxiety,&#xD;
           aggression and alcohol consumption. Some of the questionnaires will be repeated at&#xD;
           monthly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical performance testing - Performance and speed will be measured in three separate&#xD;
           training sessions that involve repeatedly pressing a button on a button box console,&#xD;
           earning points worth money.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dyadic interaction paradigm - Participants will interact with their spouse/significant&#xD;
           other in a small room, first discussing a neutral topic, such as the day's events, and&#xD;
           then a subject that has been a source of conflict.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluoxetine administration - Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 10&#xD;
           mg. of fluoxetine or placebo (identical capsules with no active ingredients) once a day&#xD;
           for 3 days, then twice a day, increasing up to four capsules a day if there are no&#xD;
           serious side effects. Blood will be drawn once a month to measure drug levels. At the&#xD;
           end of 3 months, participants taking placebo may remain in the study and receive&#xD;
           fluoxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic visits - Participants are followed in the clinic weekly for the first month, then&#xD;
           twice a month for the next 2 months for adjustment of number of pills, evaluation of&#xD;
           aggressive behavior and alcohol consumption, and therapy for issues of self-esteem,&#xD;
           anger management and communication skills. Couples therapy aimed at conflict resolution&#xD;
           and improving communication skills will be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic tests (optional) - Blood will be drawn to determine if there is a relationship&#xD;
           between genes involved in a chemical process (serotonin reuptake) that is influenced by&#xD;
           fluoxetine and the participant's response to the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spouse/Significant other:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spouses/significant others will complete several questionnaires once a month (total 4 times)&#xD;
      to rate their partners' behavior while in the study. They will also participate in the dyadic&#xD;
      interaction paradigm described above at the beginning and end of the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no controlled studies assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions&#xD;
      to decrease aggression in perpetrators of domestic violence. Since serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors (SSRI) have been shown to decrease aggression in other patient populations, we&#xD;
      will examine the effectiveness of SSRIs in reducing aggression in perpetrators of domestic&#xD;
      violence. In this protocol, perpetrators of domestic violence will be randomized according to&#xD;
      a double-blind design to receive either the SSRI, fluoxetine, or placebo. All participants&#xD;
      will receive psychotherapy. All participants will also be carefully monitored in the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic on a regular basis for three months. Drug efficacy will be established&#xD;
      using validated rating scales and provocative aggression inducing paradigms.&#xD;
