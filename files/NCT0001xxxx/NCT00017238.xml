    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of KRN5500 in treating patients who have solid&#xD;
      tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as KRN5500, work in different ways to stop cancer&#xD;
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the MTD and identify the DLTs of the investigational agent KRN5500 when&#xD;
      administered by a 72-hr continuous i.v. infusion to patients with solid tumors who have&#xD;
      failed standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To establish and assess the safety of an appropriate dose for phase II studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of KRN5500 in patients when administered by a 72 hr&#xD;
      continuous IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize the response to KRN5500 by FLT-PET scanning at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity. II. Establish pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      relationships for the pharmacological effect of the drug upon surrogate markers of activity&#xD;
      and host toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the toxicity profiles for the 1 hr i.v. infusion and 72 hr continuous i.v.&#xD;
      infusion administration schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive KRN5500 IV over 24-72 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 1-3 patients receive KRN5500 at the starting dose over escalating infusion&#xD;
      durations. After the longest duration of infusion time is safely reached, cohorts of 3-6&#xD;
      patients receive escalating doses of KRN5500 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is&#xD;
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are&#xD;
      accrued to receive treatment with KRN5500 at the recommended phase II dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 4 weeks until resolution of all toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
