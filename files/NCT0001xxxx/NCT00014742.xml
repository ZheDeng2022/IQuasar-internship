      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the safety and efficacy of clostridial collagenase vs placebo in terms&#xD;
      of improving the degree of flexion deformity, range of finger motion, and grip strength in&#xD;
      patients with residual stage Dupuytren's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare the overall clinical success rate, time to return to normal finger contracture to&#xD;
      within 0-5 degrees of normal (zero degrees), and frequency of cord rupture in the joint of&#xD;
      patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare the baseline change in degree of finger flexion deformity, range of motion of&#xD;
      the treated finger, and strength of hand grip (in pounds) in patients treated with these&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Compare the frequency distribution of the number of patients with reduction in finger&#xD;
      contracture to within 0-5 degrees of normal (zero degrees) and the number who require&#xD;
      re-treatment with open-label collagenase after treatment with these regimens.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter&#xD;
      study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive a single collagenase injection into the target finger cord on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients receive a single placebo injection as in arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both arms: After the 1 month evaluation, patients who are unresponsive to treatment may&#xD;
      receive monthly injections of collagenase for a maximum of 5 injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning at 1 day after completion of treatment, patients use a joint nighttime extension&#xD;
      splint for 4 months and perform finger flexion/extension exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 1, 7, and 14 days, monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 9&#xD;
      months, and then annually for 4 years.&#xD;
