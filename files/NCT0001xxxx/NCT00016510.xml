  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine differences in how the brain processes English and Korean in native&#xD;
      Korean speakers who are fluent and non-fluent in English as a second language. It is thought&#xD;
      that people who are non-fluent in a second language process the second language differently&#xD;
      from their native language-using different areas of the brain and requiring additional&#xD;
      working memory. The study will increase understanding of language acquisition, brain&#xD;
      plasticity and bilingualism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Native Korean speakers between 18 and 50 years of age with English as a second language may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Three groups of individuals will be enrolled: 1) less fluent&#xD;
      bilinguals - those who have lived in the United States for at least 1, but less than 2 years&#xD;
      and studied English after age 12 and who have a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)&#xD;
      score above 550; 2) fluent bilinguals with early acquisition - those who were exposed to&#xD;
      English before age 7 and lived in the United States after that; and 3) fluent bilinguals with&#xD;
      late acquisition - those who were exposed to English after age 12 and lived in the United&#xD;
      States after age 10. People with a history of head injury or neurological or thought&#xD;
      disorder, left-handed people, and people who cannot read the material used in the study will&#xD;
      be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning while reading words in&#xD;
      English or Korean; while translating from one language to the other; and while answering&#xD;
      questions about the meaning of words in each language. MRI uses a strong magnetic field to&#xD;
      image brain tissue. The patient lies on a table that slides into a narrow metal cylinder,&#xD;
      which is the scanner. The head is restrained gently with foam padding to limit movement. The&#xD;
      patient can see out of the scanner through a mirror and is in contact with the technician via&#xD;
      an intercom at all times during the procedure. The scans measures blood flow to different&#xD;
      parts of the brain, providing information about what brain regions are being used during the&#xD;
      tasks performed. Another scan will be done to obtain a detailed picture of the brain's&#xD;
      structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the usefulness of MRI in identifying brain areas involved in&#xD;
      processing different languages and increase knowledge about how illness affects brain&#xD;
      function. It may help plan treatment for bilingual patients who must undergo brain surgery&#xD;
      for uncontrolled epilepsy or who have a neurological disorder affecting different languages&#xD;
      with varying degrees.&#xD;

      This protocol will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the&#xD;
      localization of verbal working memory and translation systems in normal volunteers who speak&#xD;
      English as a second language. Several important issues in areas such as language acquisition,&#xD;
      cortical plasticity, and bilingualism will be advanced by an increased understanding of how&#xD;
      multiple languages are represented in the brain. There are also an increasing number of&#xD;
      bilingual patients who need to undergo surgical intervention, particularly for uncontrolled&#xD;
      epilepsy, or suffer from a variety of neurological disorders affecting different languages to&#xD;
      varying degrees. It is very important to accurately assess and localize language functions in&#xD;
      these patients. This study will identify cortical areas activated by the immediate&#xD;
      translation of words and sentences between native and second languages, as well as&#xD;
      differences in verbal working memory systems between two languages. It will also evaluate&#xD;
      differences in verbal working memory and translation systems among subjects with different&#xD;
      proficiency and different age at acquisition of their second language. This study will&#xD;
      advance our understanding of the cortical representation that underlies multiple language&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
