  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most persistent and intractable cause of infant and child mortality and morbidity in the&#xD;
      US remains preterm and low birthweight deliveries. Pregnant women in the United States&#xD;
      experience the highest incidence of these complications among developed countries. Even more&#xD;
      disturbing is the observation that immigrant Hispanic women experience worsening birth&#xD;
      outcomes the longer they live here, despite increasing access to prenatal care, improved&#xD;
      socio-economic status and better education. The purpose of this study is to identify the&#xD;
      potential acculturation-related risk factors for preterm and low birthweight (PTLBW) delivery&#xD;
      among Hispanic women of varying lengths of US residency. It is hypothesized that changes in&#xD;
      factors associated with acculturation, such as poor nutritional intake, job stress and&#xD;
      occupational exposures to pesticides or other hazards, and certain types of genital&#xD;
      infections, can best explain the worsening of pregnancy outcomes among Hispanic immigrant&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

      The most persistent and intractable cause of infant and child mortality and morbidity in the&#xD;
      US remains preterm and low birthweight deliveries. Pregnant women in the US experience the&#xD;
      highest incidence of these complications among developed countries. Despite many efforts at&#xD;
      increasing prenatal care, rates of preterm delivery have not substantially changed in the&#xD;
      last decade. Even more disturbing is the observation that immigrant Hispanic women experience&#xD;
      worsening birth outcomes the longer they live in the US, despite increasing access to&#xD;
      prenatal care, improved socio-economic status and better education. (Within five years after&#xD;
      moving to the US, the odds ratio for preterm low birth weight delivery increases by 1.9, from&#xD;
      4% to 7%.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As migrant women become acculturated to the US, they must be exposed to factors that&#xD;
      adversely affect pregnancy outcomes. But the known risk factors, such as poverty, lack of&#xD;
      education, smoking, substance abuse, inadequate pregnancy weight gain, low pre-pregnancy&#xD;
      weight, high altitude, chronic diseases, primipara, and high parity, explain only a small&#xD;
      percentage of this change in incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective study will enroll a cohort of approximately 1500 pregnant Hispanic women&#xD;
      attending prenatal care services through an OB/GYN group at the San Joaquin General Hospital&#xD;
      in Stockton, CA. The majority of Hispanic women (67%) receiving prenatal care through this&#xD;
      group are Mexican immigrants of varying lengths of US residency, and up to 26% of them are&#xD;
      involved in farm labor and/or other types of manual labor. Eighteen percent are US-born&#xD;
      Mexican women. A study of this unique population of Hispanic women of varying lengths of US&#xD;
      residency, and factors related to occupational risks, acculturation and preterm low birth&#xD;
      weight deliveries, will provide an excellent opportunity to examine the factors of&#xD;
      acculturation-based causes of preterm low birthweight (PTLBW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that job stress and occupational exposures related to farm work&#xD;
      can best explain the worsening of pregnancy outcomes among Hispanic women. However, in order&#xD;
      to ensure an understanding of the mechanism of this increased rate of preterm low birthweight&#xD;
      within this population, this study will also examine other risk factors that could possibly&#xD;
      be associated with acculturation and preterm low birthweight. Such factors include changes in&#xD;
      nutrition intake, and certain types of genital infections such as Bacterial Vaginosis,&#xD;
      Gonorrhea and Chlamydia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge that emerges will have direct application for designing improved programs for&#xD;
      the prevention of preterm low birthweight deliveries among Hispanic women. Just as important,&#xD;
      it will provide insight into the underlying causes of the scandalously high rates throughout&#xD;
      all US populations.&#xD;
