      The purpose of this study is to make valganciclovir available, before it is approved for&#xD;
      marketing, to HIV-infected patients who have cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis (eye infection)&#xD;
      and cannot take drugs by injection. This study also will look at the safety of using&#xD;
      valganciclovir as starting and/or ongoing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV can cause serious AIDS-related infections in patients with HIV. Drugs that are effective&#xD;
      against CMV eye infections can be given only by injection; this calls for a thin tube to be&#xD;
      placed into a vein in the chest so that the patient is not put through getting too many&#xD;
      needle sticks. An experimental drug, valganciclovir, is similar to 1 of these approved drugs,&#xD;
      ganciclovir, but is more convenient and easier to use since it can be taken by mouth. Once in&#xD;
      the body, valganciclovir changes to ganciclovir. Studies have shown that valganciclovir&#xD;
      tablets can result in the same level of ganciclovir in the blood as ganciclovir injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CMV causes sight- or life-threatening opportunistic infections in people with AIDS.&#xD;
      Intravenous agents including ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir are presently approved as&#xD;
      treatments for CMV retinitis within this population. Ganciclovir and foscarnet induction and&#xD;
      maintenance therapy require daily infusions and usually require the use of long-term&#xD;
      indwelling central venous catheters. Although the treatment interval of cidofovir is longer,&#xD;
      administration necessitates the use of pre-hydration and probenecid in order to avoid a risk&#xD;
      of renal toxicity. Oral ganciclovir is an alternative to the intravenous formulation for the&#xD;
      maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis. However, because blood levels achieved after oral&#xD;
      ganciclovir are low compared to intravenous, oral ganciclovir cannot be used for induction&#xD;
      therapy. In an attempt to improve the bioavailability of ganciclovir, valganciclovir was&#xD;
      developed. Valganciclovir is a ganciclovir prodrug which, when administered orally, is&#xD;
      rapidly converted to the active compound ganciclovir during a first-pass process, with the&#xD;
      majority of hydrolysis occurring pre-systemically. Studies have shown that valganciclovir&#xD;
      tablets allow systemic exposure of ganciclovir comparable to that achieved with recommended&#xD;
      doses of intravenous ganciclovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo an ophthalmologic exam by an ophthalmologist and safety and other laboratory&#xD;
      tests to establish eligibility. No specific visits are requested by the drug usage plan&#xD;
      following enrollment; however, patients should be seen for safety and/or clinical assessments&#xD;
      and medication dispensation at periodic visits, consistent with standard of care. An&#xD;
      ophthalmologic exam should be performed again at Week 3 (no later than Week 4), at the end of&#xD;
      the induction treatment phase consistent with standard of care in order to ensure adequate&#xD;
      response to therapy. Valganciclovir is provided on a monthly basis and only as long as the&#xD;
      patient is assessed and information provided in a timely manner. This supply will be&#xD;
      terminated 1 month subsequent to when the drug is available by prescription, unless otherwise&#xD;
      decided.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have active CMV retinitis, shown by an eye exam by an eye doctor, that needs&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had problems when drugs were given by injection, such as difficulty in finding a&#xD;
             vein or problems (blood clots, vein inflammation, or infection) caused by injection&#xD;
             devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to use effective methods of birth control (i.e., barrier methods) during the&#xD;
             study and for 90 days after taking the study drug. Females who can have children must&#xD;
             have a negative pregnancy test before entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stop breast-feeding before starting the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have developed CMV retinitis after a transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have kidney disease and need hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are taking part in another drug study, unless approved by the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Take experimental drugs, or have taken them within 30 days before study entry, unless&#xD;
             approved by the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Take drugs not allowed on the study, including foscarnet, cidofovir, and probenecid.&#xD;
