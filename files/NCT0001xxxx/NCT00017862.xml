      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of a single dose of anti-interleukin-5&#xD;
      antibody (SCH 55700) in reducing the number of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in&#xD;
      patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome. Patients with this disease have too many&#xD;
      eosinophils in the blood and in body tissues, which cause damage to the affected organs-most&#xD;
      commonly the heart, nerves and skin. SCH 55700 is an antibody to interleukin 5-a hormone-like&#xD;
      substance produced by white blood cells that plays a significant role in eosinophilia. SCH&#xD;
      55700 has lowered eosinophilia blood counts in patients with asthma and reduced the number of&#xD;
      these cells in tissues of animals with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome 18 years of age and older who have not responded to&#xD;
      standard therapy with steroids, interferon and hydroxyurea or cannot take these drugs may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, eye examination, and blood tests. Depending on the patient's symptoms, other&#xD;
      diagnostic tests may be done, including studies of the eyes, lungs, skin, nerves or heart.&#xD;
      Skin biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage may be included in the diagnostic evaluation. For the&#xD;
      skin biopsy, a small area about 1/3 inch in diameter is numbed and a small core of skin is&#xD;
      surgically removed for study under the microscope. Bronchoalveolar lavage involves inserting&#xD;
      a catheter (flexible tube) into the lungs to instill saline (salt water) and obtain a tissue&#xD;
      sample. This test will be done only if clinically necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those enrolled in the study will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for a single dose of&#xD;
      SCH 55700, injected into an arm vein. They will be monitored in the hospital for at least 72&#xD;
      hours for changes in eosinophil count and side effects of the injection. After discharge,&#xD;
      laboratory tests will be done weekly for the first month, either at the Clinical Center or by&#xD;
      the patient's local physician. Follow-up visits will then be scheduled monthly for 1 year or&#xD;
      until the patient's eosinophil count returns to pre-treatment levels for 2 consecutive&#xD;
      months. Follow-up visits will include a history, physical examination and blood tests,&#xD;
      including studies on how immune cells and other substances in the blood activate or stimulate&#xD;
      eosinophilia. A chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and pulmonary function tests will be done at&#xD;
      1, 3, 6 and 12 months to evaluate organ damage. Other tests may be done if medically&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration will be done before receiving SCH 55700 and one month after&#xD;
      the injection to evaluate the effects of SCH 55700 on eosinophil production in the bone&#xD;
      marrow. For this test, an area of skin and bone is numbed and a very sharp needle is used to&#xD;
      withdraw a sample of the bone marrow. Leukapheresis will also be done before and 1 month&#xD;
      after SCH 55700 treatment to obtain cells for studying the effect of SCH 55700 on eosinophil&#xD;
      activation, function and survival. For this procedure, whole blood is collected through a&#xD;
      needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its&#xD;
      components. The white cells are then removed, and the rest of the blood is returned to the&#xD;
      body, either through the same needle used to draw the blood or through a second needle placed&#xD;
      in the other arm.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of humanized monoclonal anti-IL5&#xD;
      antibody, SCH 55700 in reducing peripheral blood eosinophilia in patients with either&#xD;
      hypereosinophilic syndrome or eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Patients with hypereosinophilic&#xD;
      syndrome refractory to or intolerant of therapy with conventional therapy (steroids,&#xD;
      hydroxyurea and interferon alpha) will be admitted on this protocol. Additionally, subjects&#xD;
      with eosinophilic gastroenteritis refractory or intolerant to conventional therapy (systemic&#xD;
      glucocorticoids) will be admitted on this protocol. A thorough clinical evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed with emphasis on potential sequelae of eosinophil-mediated tissue damage. A&#xD;
      baseline bone marrow will be obtained to exclude neoplasia and to assess the degree and&#xD;
      nature of eosinophilipoiesis. Blood cells and/or serum will also be collected to provide&#xD;
      reagents (such as DNA, RNA, and specific antibodies) for use in the laboratory to address&#xD;
      issues related to the immunologic basis of FHES and GE as well as their pathogenesis and&#xD;
      treatment. Following intravenous administration of a single 1 mg/kg dose of the humanized&#xD;
      monoclonal anti-IL5 antibody, SCH 55700, patients will be followed in an inpatient setting&#xD;
      for a minimum of 72 hours for monitoring of adverse effects secondary to the infusion.&#xD;
      Followup visits will be scheduled monthly for 1 year or until the peripheral eosinophil count&#xD;
      returns to baseline. Patients showing a reduction in eosinophilia and evidence of clinical&#xD;
      improvement will be eligible to receive 5 additional doses of 1 mg/kg of SCH 55700 at monthly&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
