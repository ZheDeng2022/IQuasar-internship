    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is among the most important chronic diseases of&#xD;
      adults. It is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. and affects more than 10% of the&#xD;
      U.S. population over age 55. COPD accounts for more than 25,000 discharges annually from VA&#xD;
      medical centers. Cigarette smoking is the most important known modifiable cause of COPD, yet&#xD;
      only 15-20% of cigarette smokers develop clinically significant COPD. We therefore&#xD;
      hypothesize that genetic mechanisms determine susceptibility to the development of COPD. The&#xD;
      only genetic abnormality known to cause COPD is deficiency of the serine protease inhibitor&#xD;
      1-protease inhibitor, which causes premature development of emphysema, although it is&#xD;
      implicated in fewer than 2% of COPD cases. Several other genetic variants have been proposed&#xD;
      as candidate causes of COPD; however, these have been identified on the basis of association&#xD;
      studies in unrelated subjects, which have considerable risk of ascertainment bias. In the&#xD;
      present study, a sub-pair linkage approach will be utilized in COPD patients and their&#xD;
      smoking siblings to identify genes which determine the risk of developing COPD. The following&#xD;
      are the short-term objectives of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruit a cohort of 400 probands with smoking-related COPD and their smoking siblings,&#xD;
           whether or not affected by COPD. Affected subjects will be extensively characterized as&#xD;
           to specific COPD phenotype, using spirometry, computed tomography, and questionnaire&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the association of known genetic variants in candidate genes to the presence of&#xD;
           COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For proposed candidate genes without known candidate polymorphisms, use sib-pair linkage&#xD;
           analysis to test polymorphic marker loci in close proximity to the candidate gene for&#xD;
           evidence of linkage to COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Test for heterogeneity of linkage among different COPD phenotypes: predominant emphysema&#xD;
           versus predominant airway disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objective of this research is the identification of specific genetic variants&#xD;
      which confer risk for the development of COPD in smokers. This will be achieved by means of&#xD;
      fine mapping of the loci identified in objectives 3-4 above, or in a subsequent genome scan&#xD;
      involving the 400 sibling pairs; identification of novel genetic variants at these loci; and&#xD;
      assessment of the functional significance of these variants and their relation to COPD in an&#xD;
      independent sample of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of subjects for this project began in April, 1999. At this time, a total of 22&#xD;
      subjects (11 COPD patients and 11 first-degree relatives) have been recruited and tested. No&#xD;
      adverse events have occurred. A computerized methodology for quantitation of emphysema from&#xD;
      CT scans has been developed and has demonstrated adequate DNA extraction from our blood&#xD;
      samples. Genotyping has been deferred pending the recruitment of 50 subjects.&#xD;
