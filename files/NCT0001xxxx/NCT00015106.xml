    <textblock>
      The purpose of this CREST (Clinical Rapid Evaluation Screening Trial) study is the treatment&#xD;
      of cocaine dependence using reserpine, gabapentin, or lamotrigine vs. an unmatched placebo&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considerable progress in preclinical research has provided a basis for hypothesis driven&#xD;
      clinical trials in cocaine dependence. A greater mechanistic understanding of both cocaine&#xD;
      and many clinically approved medications has led to the identification of many promising&#xD;
      medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason NIDA has developed a CREST (Clinical Rapid Evaluation Screening Trial)&#xD;
      protocol to provide a needed incremental medication screening step between preclinical&#xD;
      research and full blown expensive Phase III pivotal trials. While patients receive manual&#xD;
      based psychotherapy, three medications are screened compared to unmatched placebo in an&#xD;
      eight-week, 60-subject, four cell design trial. Other important features of the CREST&#xD;
      protocol include collecting baseline measurements over a two week period and analyzing&#xD;
      primary outcome measures (quantitative urine toxicology and clinical global improvement&#xD;
      scales) in terms of a composite score of overall individual patient improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three medications being evaluated in this trial include reserpine, gabapentin and&#xD;
      lamotrigine. Reserpine is being screened because of its well-known preclinical ability to&#xD;
      functionally antagonize cocaine (by depleting neurochemicals elevated by cocaine). Gabapentin&#xD;
      and lamotrigine are hypothesized to interfere with glutamatergic cocaine&#xD;
      sensitization/kindling mechanisms relevant to addiction.&#xD;
