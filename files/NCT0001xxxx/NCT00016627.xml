      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF) is a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease. Although&#xD;
      far from definitive, several lines of evidence suggest that it could involve genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility and that its expression may be modified gene-environment interactions&#xD;
      involving exposure to fibrogenic dusts. If the specific gene loci involved can be identified&#xD;
      and their functions characterized, these studies could lead to a better understanding of the&#xD;
      etiology of the disease and effective intervention strategies among families at increased&#xD;
      risk. It is conceivable that the genetically influenced pathologic mechanisms involved may be&#xD;
      shared with other, more common forms of pulmonary fibrosis such as idiopathic pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis (IPF) or asbestosis. Thus, these studies could lead to the early identification of&#xD;
      individuals susceptible to reversible interstitial lung disease and to the development of&#xD;
      novel therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familial pulmonary fibrosis is indistinguishable pathologically from idiopathic pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis and appears to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance;&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis is associated with pleiotropic genetic disorders, such as Hermansky-Pudlak&#xD;
      syndrome, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, Neimann-Pick disease, Gaucher's disease, and&#xD;
      familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia; pulmonary fibrosis is frequently observed in autoimmune&#xD;
      disease, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis; variable susceptibility is&#xD;
      evident among workers who are reported to be exposed occupationally to similar concentrations&#xD;
      of fibrogenic dusts; and inbred strains of mice differ in their susceptibility to fibrogenic&#xD;
      dust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses standard genetic methodology (linkage analysis) to investigate the&#xD;
      distribution of polymorphisms for anonymous genetic markers in families with familial&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis. The comprehensive genome-wide study, using standard genetic markers, will&#xD;
      allow identification of loci which subsequently may prove to contain novel genes that play a&#xD;
      role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Once genetic loci are defined in familial&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis, candidate genes can be identified on the basis of both positional and&#xD;
      functional criteria. Moreover, this approach will provide basic information on high priority&#xD;
      loci that will be applicable to the rapidly evolving dense human transcript map for pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis in families with two or more cases of pulmonary fibrosis.&#xD;
