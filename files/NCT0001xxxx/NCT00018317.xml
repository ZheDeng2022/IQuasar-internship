  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of long-term adherence to a low protein diet (LPD) of 0.6&#xD;
      g/kg-1/d-1 with and without progressive resistance exercise training in patients with&#xD;
      impaired renal function on body composition, renal function (glomerular filtration rate),&#xD;
      nitrogen balance, muscle strength and size, and functional capacity. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      adherence to a LPD will result in a reduction in skeletal muscle mass and reduced strength&#xD;
      and functional capacity while those patients who adhere to the LPD and exercise will&#xD;
      demonstrate a similar preservation of renal function but will have greater fat free mass,&#xD;
      muscle mass and strength. The intervention trial will last 18 months in which patients with&#xD;
      moderate renal failure will be randomly assigned to one of 4 interventions: standard care,&#xD;
      standard care + exercise, LPD, and LPD with exercise. In this way the independent and&#xD;
      combined effects of diet and exercise on the progression of renal disease and body&#xD;
      composition will be monitored. This study will have important implications for the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with chronic renal failure. New strategies of combining exercise with&#xD;
      recommendations of a low protein diet may slow the progression of renal disease and improve&#xD;
      strength and functional capacity in these at-risk patients.&#xD;

      Management of dietary protein intake of the CRF patient represents a critical balance between&#xD;
      providing adequate protein to meet nutritional requirements, and limiting protein intake in&#xD;
      the hope of slowing or abating the progression of CRF. A number of studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that reduced dietary protein intake can slow the progression of chronic renal failure.&#xD;
      Finding effective ways to increase nitrogen retention and decrease urinary nitrogen excretion&#xD;
      may help CRF patients maintain a more positive nitrogen balance and lessen the nitrogen load&#xD;
      on the kidneys for a given dietary protein intake. Our laboratory has demonstrated that in&#xD;
      older men and women, the consequence of adherence to a low protein diet is an accommodation&#xD;
      that results in decreased muscle mass, strength,and compromised immune function. We have also&#xD;
      demonstrated that when healthy, free living older men and women consume a weight maintenance&#xD;
      diet providing the RDA for protein of 0.8 g/kg-1/day-1 for 15 weeks they lose skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mass. These data clearly indicate that elderly people have an increased need for dietary&#xD;
      protein (compared to young people). Data has also demonstrated that progressive resistance&#xD;
      exercise improves nitrogen balance in older healthy individuals as well as in patients with&#xD;
      mild to moderate chronic renal failure.&#xD;
