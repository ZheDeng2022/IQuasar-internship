  <brief_summary>

      We propose to identify patients and families for inclusion in pilot studies of the three&#xD;
      modalities. Patients and their families will be asked to participate in these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research group has done some preliminary work with the modality of hypnotherapy, but has&#xD;
      no experience to date with the other two modalities. The idea to try relaxation techniques&#xD;
      was generated by the observation that there is great variation in the degree to spasticity at&#xD;
      different times in the same patient with CP. When queried, mothers responded that they were&#xD;
      able to get their child to relax and decrease the tension in their muscles by stroking,&#xD;
      talking softly, and/or by playing certain types of music. The availability of hypnosis and&#xD;
      training in self-hypnosis was presented to several families of our patients. Their&#xD;
      understanding and acceptance of this alternate therapy was gratifying. The results of this&#xD;
      therapy have been promising and have encouraged us to proceed with this modality and to&#xD;
      consider making other nonconventional modalities available to our patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that at least one of the two modalities will be accepted readily by patients&#xD;
      with CP and their families, and with their acceptance compliance with the method chosen will&#xD;
      be at levels of 80 percent or more.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate two different alternative or&#xD;
      complementary medical modalities that have been used in children with cerebral palsy by&#xD;
      practitioners in an attempt to decelerate the complications from the neurologic insult and&#xD;
      resultant muscle imbalance. The specific aims are: 1) The development and incorporation of&#xD;
      two alternative modalities (osteopathic manipulation and acupuncture) into available services&#xD;
      in southern Arizona for individuals with cerebral palsy. 2) The evaluation of the uptake of&#xD;
      and compliance with the two modalities in the clinical services for cerebral palsy. 3)&#xD;
      Conduct pilot studies of each of the two modalities to determine their efficacy in decreasing&#xD;
      the degree of muscle tension in children with spastic cerebral palsy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Children with a diagnosis of spastic CP who are between 48 months and 21 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the hypnotherapy-control arm the children must have a cognitive level sufficient&#xD;
             to allow them to visualize and enter into trance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cognitive level criteria will not apply to the manipulation-acupuncture-control&#xD;
             arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No child will be excluded on the basis of gender, race or culture.&#xD;
