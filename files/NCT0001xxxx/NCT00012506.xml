  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of the drug Enbrel (TNFR:Fc) to&#xD;
      treat uveitis (eye inflammation) in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In other studies, TNFR:Fc significantly reduced joint pain and swelling in adult patients&#xD;
      with rheumatoid arthritis, and the Food and Drug Administration has approved the drug for&#xD;
      that use. Because medicines for arthritis often help patients with eye inflammation, this&#xD;
      study will examine whether TNFR:Fc can help patients with uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with uveitis who are not responding well to standard treatment, such as steroids,&#xD;
      and patients who have side effects from other medicines used to treat their uveitis or have&#xD;
      refused treatment because of possible side effects may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and eye examination. The eye&#xD;
      exam includes a check of vision and eye pressure, examination of the back of the eye&#xD;
      (retina), and front of the eye, including measurements of protein and inflammation.&#xD;
      Candidates will also undergo fluorescein angiography-a procedure in which photographs are&#xD;
      taken of the retina to see if there is any leakage in the eye's blood vessels. A blood test&#xD;
      and joint evaluation will also be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be given an injection of TNFR:Fc twice a week for up to 12 months and&#xD;
      may continue other medicines they may be taking, such as prednisone or methotrexate. They&#xD;
      will have follow-up examinations at week two and months one, two, three and four. Those who&#xD;
      wish to continue treatment after the fourth month can receive the drug for another eight&#xD;
      months and will have follow-up exams at months six, nine and 12, and one month after&#xD;
      treatment ends. Each follow-up visit will include a repeat of the screening exams and an&#xD;
      evaluation of side effects or discomfort from the medicine.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Must meet American College of Rheumatology Criteria for JRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have active anterior uveitis defined as the presence of inflammatory cells (Grade 1+&#xD;
        or higher) in the anterior chamber of at least one eye or the current use of topical&#xD;
        corticosteroids to control exacerbation of disease at a frequency of TID or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age between 2 and 18 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;

        Ability to comply with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be up to date on all recommended childhood immunizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Using current arthritis regimen for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No media opacity that precludes assessment of anterior chamber inflammation.&#xD;

        experimental therapy within one month of baseline evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Not currently receiving disease modifying antirheumatic therapy (DMARD), with the exception&#xD;
        of prednisone at a dose no greater than 1.0 mg/kg/day, or methotrexate at a dose no greater&#xD;
        than 15 mg/m(2)/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No active eye or joint inflammation requiring immediate addition or increase in systemic&#xD;
        anti-inflammatory medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No females who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No refusal to use contraception during the study and 6 months after termination of active&#xD;
        study therapy, if child-bearing or fathering potential exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No use of Latanoprost within two weeks prior to enrollment, or have a current or likely&#xD;
        need for Latanoprost during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No hypersensitivity to fluorescein dye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No active serious infections or history of recurring serious infections.&#xD;
