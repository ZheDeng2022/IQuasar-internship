  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining UCN-01 with cisplatin in treating&#xD;
      patients who have advanced solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to&#xD;
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. UCN-01 may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth and may help cisplatin&#xD;
      kill more cancer cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cisplatin in combination with UCN-01 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the toxicity and observe the potential antitumor activity of UCN-01 plus&#xD;
      cisplatin in advanced malignancies at each dose level studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the pharmacokinetics of UCN-01 and cisplatin on this treatment schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To perform laboratory correlative studies to investigate intermediate molecular markers&#xD;
      of the activity of UCN-01 and cisplatin at the cellular level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and UCN-01 IV continuously over 36-72&#xD;
      hours on day 2. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 2-3 months for at least 1 year.&#xD;
