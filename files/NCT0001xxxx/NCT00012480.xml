  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our data indicate that environmental exposure to the heavy metal lead are more widespread&#xD;
      than currently appreciated and that such exposures are associated with the production of&#xD;
      human male subfertility. Lead's effects are observed in male partners of infertile couples&#xD;
      attending an IVF clinical, in men acting as semen donors in an artificial insemination&#xD;
      program and in men representative of the general public. Our goal is to identify the&#xD;
      mechanism(s) underlying lead's anti-fertility action.&#xD;

      Our goal is to understand how environmental and occupational exposures to heavy and&#xD;
      transition metal ions injure the human male reproductive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Urological Association and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine report&#xD;
      that ~15% of couples (i.e., more than 6.1 million people in the U.S.) experience infertility&#xD;
      at some time. The male is responsible for infertility of 20% of these couples and contributes&#xD;
      to the infertility of another 30-40%. However, the cause(s) of male infertility in many cases&#xD;
      is unknown. Our data suggest that lead exposures (in the air, in food and in drinking water)&#xD;
      underlie a significant fraction of &quot;unexplained&quot; male infertility. We found that blood and&#xD;
      seminal plasma lead levels were elevated in 22% of normospermic males from couples seeking&#xD;
      infertility treatment, in 29% of semen donors participating in an artificial insemination&#xD;
      program and in 23% of unselected semen donors answering an advertisement for research&#xD;
      participation. These elevated lead levels were associated with decreased sperm fertility&#xD;
      potential in IVF, in artificial insemination and in pregnancy by coitus. The negative effects&#xD;
      of lead on sperm function was correlated with expression of specific forms of sperm ion&#xD;
      channels (metal binding proteins that allow lead to enter cells), suggesting that such&#xD;
      proteins serve as markers for susceptibility or resistance to the reproductive toxic effects&#xD;
      of lead. Further, in cases in which human male lead levels changed markedly over time, there&#xD;
      were corresponding changes in sperm ion channel, sperm function and sperm fertility&#xD;
      potential. These changes were linked to changes in calcium modulated processes in human&#xD;
      testis biopsies obtained from infertility patients and could be mimicked in testes of rats&#xD;
      experimentally fed lead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, we plan to identify changes in gene expression important to the&#xD;
      production of the infertile state by comparing the genes expressed in the testis of control&#xD;
      and lead exposed rats which are resistant or susceptible to lead. These findings will help to&#xD;
      explain how lead exposure kill cells within the testis. We will then determine whether the&#xD;
      same changes occur in human testis biopsies and ejaculated sperm from infertile males with&#xD;
      high body burdens of lead. The expected outcome of this study is the identification of a&#xD;
      possible mechanism explaining male infertility associated with low sperm counts or idiopathic&#xD;
      male infertility, tools for diagnosis of male infertility and the hope for rationale&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
