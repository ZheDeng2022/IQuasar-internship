  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is examining the reproductive effects of exposure to certain compounds that are&#xD;
      suspected to act on the endocrine system, e.g. they may act like or interfere with hormones&#xD;
      such as estrogen. The study is being conducted among Laotian women, as it is suspected that&#xD;
      they may have higher exposures to the compounds of interest (pesticides and PCBs) from their&#xD;
      homeland and from consumption of fish caught in the San Francisco Bay. Fifty Laotian&#xD;
      immigrants were recruited by community workers to collect urine daily during 3 menstrual&#xD;
      cycles for measurement of steroid hormones (estrogen and progesterone). Additionally, they&#xD;
      provided a blood sample to measure exposure levels, and completed 2 interviews in their&#xD;
      native language. These measured levels, as well as the self-reported data on a number of&#xD;
      factors including fish consumption, will be examined for possible effects on hormone levels&#xD;
      and menstrual function.&#xD;

      We are conducting a study to examine whether women who have been exposed to chlorinated&#xD;
      pesticides or PCBs have alterations in their ovarian function as measured by the frequency of&#xD;
      menstrual cycle disturbances. Such disturbances may impact the frequency of infertility and&#xD;
      sub-fertility, as well as that of other hormone-dependent illnesses such as breast cancer and&#xD;
      osteoporosis. The target population is a group of Laotian immigrants who are frequent&#xD;
      consumers of fish caught locally in the San Francisco Bay. Contaminant levels above health&#xD;
      protective advisories have been documented in Bay fish and shellfish for a number of these&#xD;
      substances. Immigration from Asia, as well as consumption of contaminated fish, have been&#xD;
      shown to be associated with higher organochlorine pesticide body burdens. Exposure is&#xD;
      determined by measuring serum levels of a panel of pesticide metabolites, including those of&#xD;
      DDT, chlordane, hepatochlor and others, as well as PCB congeners. In addition, mercury levels&#xD;
      are measured in the blood. Menstrual function is assessed by measuring urinary metabolites of&#xD;
      steroid hormones daily during three menstrual cycles of 50 Laotian women of reproductive age.&#xD;
      The participants were also asked to complete two detailed in-person interviews about various&#xD;
      factors, including fish consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously conducted a study of menstrual function in a group of 400 women during which we&#xD;
      developed algorithms to determine ovulatory status, day of ovulation and menstrual cycle&#xD;
      disturbances such as short luteal phase that can also be applied to the new sample. This&#xD;
      previously collected sample (or the Asians therein) will serve as a baseline comparison group&#xD;
      for the current sample. In addition, it will provide a source of data on the effects of&#xD;
      lifestyle (such as smoking and alcohol consumption) and demographic (such as age and&#xD;
      ethnicity) factors on menstrual function, allowing for more efficient examination of a small&#xD;
      group of exposed women in the current study. In addition to serum organochlorine levels,&#xD;
      questionnaire measures of exposure (e.g. species-specific fish consumption, occupational&#xD;
      exposure and previous residence) will be examined in relation to ovarian function defined as&#xD;
      continuous measures (e.g. cycle length, steroid conjugate levels) and dichotomous&#xD;
      abnormalities (e.g. short luteal phase or anovulation). At this time all data collection is&#xD;
      complete, hormones measured and analyses begun.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In working with this refugee, lower socioeconomic status community we adopted a model of&#xD;
      participatory research. Steps were taken to develop partnerships with various community&#xD;
      organizations. Staff who spoke one of the three prominent dialects (Mien, Lao, or Khmu ) were&#xD;
      hired from the local community and provided with training to present information about&#xD;
      reproductive and environmental health to the community. Participants were compensated for&#xD;
      their time, as well as being provided with educational materials about reproductive health,&#xD;
      safe consumption of seafood and their own results.&#xD;

        Eligibility requirements based on need to measure reproductive hormones and menstrual&#xD;
        function in relation to hypothesized exposure. So women had to be born in SE Asia, consume&#xD;
        fish regularly, have a menstrual period in last 6 weeks, and not be taking any hormone&#xD;
        medications.&#xD;
