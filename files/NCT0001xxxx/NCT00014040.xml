      This study will test whether inhaling nitric oxide gas can improve blood flow to the heart,&#xD;
      ventricular function, exercise tolerance in patients with coronary artery disease and chest&#xD;
      pain that has not improved with medical or surgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with coronary artery disease who have chest pain despite treatment with medicines&#xD;
      and angioplasty or surgery may be eligible for this study. Those enrolled will receive&#xD;
      monetary compensation for their participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study is 5 days, with 2 testing periods lasting 2 days each. During one&#xD;
      of the periods, the study participants will breathe nitric oxide mixed with room air through&#xD;
      a face mask during the tests. During the other period, the participants will breathe room air&#xD;
      alone through a face mask during the tests. At least 1 day will separate the treatment&#xD;
      periods. During each of the 2 treatment periods (nitric oxide and room air), participants&#xD;
      will undergo 4 tests to determine whether the treatment improves the heart's response to&#xD;
      stress with increased heart rate and contraction. Approximately one hour before each of the&#xD;
      tests, participants will breathe either nitric oxide mixed with room air or room air alone&#xD;
      through the face mask, and continue the inhalation treatment while each test is being&#xD;
      performed. The face mask will be removed at the end of each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of the first day of each treatment period, participants will have a special&#xD;
      echocardiogram with imaging of the heart. The echocardiogram will be performed during an&#xD;
      infusion of dobutamine, a medicine that increases heart rate and contraction, and serves to&#xD;
      stress the heart. This manner of stress testing is commonly used in hospitals around the&#xD;
      country to determine if walls of the heart are receiving sufficient blood supply. That&#xD;
      afternoon, participants will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the heart.&#xD;
      The MRI will determine the heart's blood flow and contraction while receiving the same dosage&#xD;
      of dobutamine as was used earlier in the day. On the morning of the second day of each&#xD;
      treatment period, participants will exercise on a treadmill until moderately uncomfortable&#xD;
      chest pain is reported. Later that morning, participants will undergo cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization. For the cardiac catheterization, a long tube (catheter) will be placed into&#xD;
      a vein of the neck once the skin is numbed with xylocaine. This tube will be positioned&#xD;
      within the right atrium of the heart and into a tube-like structure called the coronary&#xD;
      sinus, where venous blood exits the heart muscle. A small catheter will also be placed in an&#xD;
      artery of the upper forearm after the skin has been numbed with xylocaine. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be taken to allow us to measure the amount of nitric oxide transported in the blood. The&#xD;
      blood samples will be drawn (through the tube in the heart and through the small tube in the&#xD;
      artery) at the beginning of the study and during infusion of dobutamine to stress the heart.&#xD;
      The dose of the dobutamine infusion will be the same dose used in the previous day's stress&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the first treatment period, we will stop testing for at least one&#xD;
      day. Participants will begin the second treatment period with the inhalation treatment not&#xD;
      received during the first treatment period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although medical therapy and revascularization procedures are effective for relief of chest&#xD;
      pain symptoms in many patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), others either do not&#xD;
      respond to or tolerate medical therapies, or have failed attempts at revascularization. For&#xD;
      this growing number of patients, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches. The&#xD;
      purpose of this protocol is to test the effectiveness of nitric oxide (NO) inhalation therapy&#xD;
      for the relief of inducible myocardial ischemia in patients with CAD who have failed&#xD;
      conventional attempts at medical and revascularization management. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      enriched NO transport in blood from the lungs and delivery to the coronary vasculature with&#xD;
      NO inhalation will improve blood flow to the myocardium during stress by dilating coronary&#xD;
      arteries and arterioles. The primary end-point of this study is improvement in treadmill&#xD;
      exercise duration during NO inhalation compared with exercise duration during room air&#xD;
      breathing, with secondary end-points selected to provide mechanistic insight as to relief of&#xD;
      inducible ischemia by NO, including effects on: 1) arterial delivery and myocardial&#xD;
      extraction of NO transport molecules, 2) myocardial perfusion, and 3) global and regional&#xD;
      myocardial contractility. This clinical trial is randomized, double-blind, and placebo (room&#xD;
      air)-controlled in design, with CAD patients treated with NO (or room air) breathing for&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour before each stress test, followed by crossover to the alternate therapy&#xD;
      after two days of testing. Demonstration of benefit from NO inhalation could result in an&#xD;
      important therapeutic option for CAD patients with few alternatives for the relief of&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia.&#xD;
