      This study compares two approaches to the management of acute low back pain: usual care&#xD;
      (standard benefit) vs. the choice of: usual care, chiropractic, acupuncture or massage&#xD;
      therapy (expanded benefit). 480 subjects with uncomplicated, acute low back pain will be&#xD;
      recruited from a health maintenance organization, and randomized to either usual care (n=160)&#xD;
      or choice of expanded benefits (n=320). Patients' preferences for individual therapies and&#xD;
      expectations of improvement will be measured at baseline and throughout the study. Subjects&#xD;
      randomized to the expanded benefits arm who choose chiropractic, acupuncture or massage will&#xD;
      receive up to 10 treatments over a five-week period. Additional treatments will be available&#xD;
      after the fifth week but will require a copayment. Treatments will be provided by licensed&#xD;
      providers who have met strict credentialing criteria. Chiropractic, acupuncture or massage&#xD;
      treatments will begin within 48 hours. Chiropractic, acupuncture and massage therapy scope of&#xD;
      practice guidelines for the treatment of acute low back pain have been developed as have&#xD;
      detailed data tracking procedures to be used at each patient visit. Symptom relief,&#xD;
      functional status, restricted activity days, use of health care, and patient and provider&#xD;
      satisfaction will be assessed at 2, 5,12, 26 and 52 weeks after initiation of treatment.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will include: 1) change in symptoms; 2) change in functional status; 3)&#xD;
      patient satisfaction; and 4) total utilization of services associated with care for low back&#xD;
      pain. Medical records and the HMO's cost management information system will identify use of&#xD;
      services. It is hypothesized that patients offered their choice of expanded benefits will&#xD;
      experience a more rapid improvement in symptoms, a faster return to baseline functional&#xD;
      status, a decrease in utilization of conventional medical services, and will be more&#xD;
      satisfied with their care. The study is a direct examination of the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      insurance eligibility intervention, not a test of the efficacy of specific, non-allopathic&#xD;
      treatment regimens. The results of this study will provide valuable information to&#xD;
      clinicians, patients and third party payers on the relative benefits and costs of an&#xD;
      &quot;expanded benefits&quot; treatment option which incorporates chiropractic, acupuncture and massage&#xD;
      services for low back pain.&#xD;
