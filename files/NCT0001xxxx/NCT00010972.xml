      This study is testing the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture in controlling pain related&#xD;
      to the removal of partially impacted mandibular third molars. Acupuncture is the Chinese art&#xD;
      of healing by inserting needles into the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants ages 18 - 40 are given an initial x-ray to determine if one lower molar is&#xD;
      partially bony impacted. Eligible participants will then undergo standard oral surgery to&#xD;
      remove the impacted molar. A local anesthetic will be used prior to surgery. Directly after&#xD;
      surgery the participant will be assigned to one of three groups. Participants will not be&#xD;
      able to select which group they are assigned. Participants will receive either real or sham&#xD;
      (fake) acupuncture as a treatment for post-extraction pain. After the initial acupuncture&#xD;
      treatment, participants are required to remain for six hours at the dental site to be&#xD;
      monitored. If a participants discomfort is measured as moderate or higher then a second&#xD;
      acupuncture treatment will be administered. All participants will be administered&#xD;
      questionnaires during the day of surgery. Participants will also be required to complete two&#xD;
      diaries during the seven days following surgery. On the seventh day, participants return to&#xD;
      have stitches removed and hand in completed diaries.&#xD;
