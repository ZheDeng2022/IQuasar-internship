      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing&#xD;
      so they stop growing or die. Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune&#xD;
      system and stop cancer cells from growing. Combining chemotherapy with biological therapy may&#xD;
      kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of fluorouracil combined with biological&#xD;
      therapy in treating patients who have metastatic kidney or colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of fluorouracil and interleukin-12-primed activated T&#xD;
      cells (12ATC) with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interferon alfa in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      renal cell cancer or colorectal cancer. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 12ATC in&#xD;
      this patient population. III. Determine the clinical response of patients treated with this&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of interleukin-12-primed activated T cells (12ATC).&#xD;
      Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5 and undergo&#xD;
      leukopheresis on day 6 to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients treated&#xD;
      at dose level 3 also undergo leukopheresis on day 7. The PBMC are treated with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody anti-CD3, interleukin-12 and interleukin-2 to form 12ATC. Patients receive&#xD;
      chemo/immunotherapy comprising fluorouracil IV continuously over 24 hours on day 13 and&#xD;
      GM-CSF and interferon alfa SC on days 17, 19, 21, 24, 26, and 28. Patients receive 12ATC IV&#xD;
      over 15-30 minutes on days 31, 34, 38, 41, 45, and 48 and interferon alfa SC on days 35, 42,&#xD;
      and 49. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 12ATC until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 weeks, every 3 months&#xD;
      for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-18 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
