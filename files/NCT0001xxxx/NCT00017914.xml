    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate subjects with adult- and childhood-onset myositis to learn more&#xD;
      about their cause and the immune system changes and medical problems associated with them.&#xD;
      Myositis is an inflammatory muscle disease that can damage muscles and other organs,&#xD;
      resulting in significant disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children or adults with polymyositis or dermatomyositis or a related condition may be&#xD;
      evaluated under this study. Healthy children or adults will also be enrolled as &quot;controls,&quot;&#xD;
      for comparison of test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a complete history (including completing some questionnaires) and&#xD;
      physical examination, review of medical records, and blood and urine tests. Patients may then&#xD;
      choose to participate in an additional 1- to 5-day evaluation, which will include some or all&#xD;
      of the following diagnostic, treatment or research procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standardized muscle strength testing, range of motion of joints and walking (gait)&#xD;
           analysis by a physiotherapist; completion of a questionnaire regarding ability to&#xD;
           perform daily tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Skin assessment, possibly including photographs of lesions and a skin biopsy (removal of&#xD;
           a small skin sample under local anesthetic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Magnetic resonance imaging (scans that use magnetic fields to visualize tissues) of leg&#xD;
           muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Swallowing studies, including a physical examination and questionnaire on swallowing&#xD;
           ability, studies of tongue strength, and ultrasound imaging during swallowing, and&#xD;
           possibly, a modified barium swallow&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Voice and speech assessment, possibly including computerized voice analysis and&#xD;
           laryngoscopy-analysis of the larynx (voice box) using a small rigid scope with a camera&#xD;
           placed in the mouth to view and record vocal cord function&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pulmonary function tests (measurement of air moved into and out of the lungs, using a&#xD;
           breathing machine) to evaluate lung function and, possibly, chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Electrocardiogram (measurement of the electrical activity of the heart) and, possibly,&#xD;
           echocardiogram (ultrasound imaging of the heart)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Endocrine evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Eye examination, in patients with vision loss or other eye symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Nutrition assessment to evaluate muscle mass and muscle wasting, including tape&#xD;
           measurements or bioelectric impedance testing, a painless procedure in which wires are&#xD;
           attached to the extremities with a sticky paste.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Muscle ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Electromyography (record of the electrical activity of muscles)&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Muscle or skin biopsy (removal of a small piece of muscle tissue for microscopic&#xD;
           examination)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients may have only a one-time evaluation or may return for one follow-up evaluations&#xD;
      (either the 1-day or 3- to 5-day evaluation) over a 1-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy children will undergo a medical history and brief physical examination; blood and&#xD;
      urine tests; speech and swallowing studies including questionnaires and physical examination,&#xD;
      tongue strength, and ultrasound study; and bioelectric impedance testing. Children 8 to 18&#xD;
      years old may also have exercise testing.&#xD;
