    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of benzoylphenylurea in&#xD;
      treating patients with advanced cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop&#xD;
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose of benzoylphenylurea&#xD;
      in patients with advanced malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral benzoylphenylurea weekly for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive&#xD;
      escalating doses of benzoylphenylurea until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.&#xD;
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
