      Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing&#xD;
      substances to them without harming normal cells. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia,&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or biological effective dose of monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody Hu1D10 (apolizumab) in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia&#xD;
      or small lymphocytic lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the safety of this drug, in terms of frequency and severity of&#xD;
      treatment-related adverse events, in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether this drug has anti-leukemia/lymphoma activity in patients expressing the&#xD;
      Hu1D10 antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient population. III. Determine&#xD;
      whether the infusion-related toxicity of this drug is secondary to cytokine release in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine whether the intensity of 1D10 target antigen on tumor cells is related to&#xD;
      clinical response and treatment toxicity in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the pharmacodynamics of this drug in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      diagnosis (chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma vs acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukemia [ALL] or acute myeloid leukemia [AML]). Patients with ALL or AML are enrolled after&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive apolizumab IV over at least 2 hours on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17,&#xD;
      19, 22, 24, and 26. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients with a complete or partial response who relapse after 2 months may receive&#xD;
      an additional course of therapy provided they still express the 1D10 antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MOAB Hu1D10 until the MTD is determined.&#xD;
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). If no DLT is observed, the biological effective dose (BED) is&#xD;
      determined in the above cohorts. The BED is defined as the dose at which at least 4 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience an acceptable minimum trough level and clinical response. An additional&#xD;
      24 patients (12 per stratum) are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 1 week, 1 and 2 months, and then every 3 months for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients (12 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
