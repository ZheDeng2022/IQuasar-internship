      Primary Hypothesis: Risk factors such as smoking, alcohol, and caffeine are associated with&#xD;
      osteoporosis in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes: Percent reduction in cross-sectional bone mineral density over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Abstract: The goals of this project are to establish a new cohort of male veterans and&#xD;
      describe associations between potential risk factors and baseline bone mineral density (BMD)&#xD;
      as well as rates of BMD loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a two-year observational prospective study of 1000 male veterans aged 50 and&#xD;
      older. The subjects are drawn from two existing VA cohorts, the Normative Aging Study (NAS)&#xD;
      and the Veterans Health Study (VHS). Examinations to be performed on each subject (baseline&#xD;
      and two follow-up exams) include BMD measurement at the hip, forearm and total body,&#xD;
      anthropometry, hand grip strength, and questionnaires on current diet, physical activity,&#xD;
      tobacco, alcohol use, sunlight exposure, health related quality of life (Medical Outcomes&#xD;
      Study Short Form), depression (Brief Depression Scale), fracture history, medications and&#xD;
      psychological factors (PrimeMD, MiniMental). Additional data on historical exposure to risk&#xD;
      factors, previously obtained in the NAS or VHS studies, will also be correlated with BMD and&#xD;
      BMD loss. Multivariate linear and logistic models with control for potential confounders will&#xD;
      be used in the main analyses. Examinations take place at the Boston VA Outpatient Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations on each subject include BMD measurement at the hip, forearm and total body,&#xD;
      height and weight, hand grip strength, leg extensor strength, and mobility. Questionnaires on&#xD;
      current diet, physical activity, tobacco, alcohol use, sunlight exposure, health related&#xD;
      quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form), depression (Brief Depression Scale),&#xD;
      fracture history, medications and psychological factors (PrimeMD, MiniMental) are&#xD;
      administered. Each subject also contributes a nonfasting blood sample and a 24-hour urine&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning in April, 1999, two additional measures are being obtained as a result of a 4-year&#xD;
      supplemental VA Epidemiology grant awarded to Dr. Miller. These are the heel ultrasound&#xD;
      measure and a 4-day physical activity level determined by ambulatory monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary cross-sectional analysis of mean BMD for femoral neck, total body and forearm BMD&#xD;
      suggest the percent reduction in cross-sectional BMD between ages 60-69 and 80-89 is&#xD;
      approximately 9% per decade at the femoral neck, 5%/decade at the total body, and 8%/decade&#xD;
      at the forearm. These age-related patterns agree well with other studies of BMD in older men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The x-ray densitometer was installed at the Boston VA Outpatient Clinic in April, 1998 and&#xD;
      the study technician was certified for bone density measurements during the three-day&#xD;
      training session that followed. A precision study was conducted in the following month. In&#xD;
      vivo reproducibility was determined by performing 5 repeat scans of each of the three sites&#xD;
      on 5 volunteers ranging in age from 21 to 50 years. Subjects were repositioned between each&#xD;
      scan. The coefficient of variation (CV) of femoral neck BMD in our laboratory is 0.92%; for&#xD;
      whole body BMD, 0.72%; and for distal radius BMD, 1.04%. An aluminum spine phantom with known&#xD;
      density (1.254 gm/cm2) is scanned every two weeks on the DPX-IQ. The mean ? standard&#xD;
      deviation of 15 measurements is 1.250 ? 0.0058, coefficient of variation = 0.46%. There has&#xD;
      been no detectable drift in phantom values during the study start-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When completed, this study will be one of the largest in the US to study risk factors for&#xD;
      osteoporosis in men, historically an understudied group in relation to osteoporosis. Several&#xD;
      of the hypothesized risk factors (smoking, alcohol, caffeine, for example) are amenable to&#xD;
      change and represent potential areas of intervention. Thus, not only can the VA make a&#xD;
      valuable contribution to furthering our understanding of osteoporosis in men in general, but&#xD;
      strategies may be identified to reduce morbidity as well as reduce health care costs&#xD;
      associated with fracture in the elderly.&#xD;
