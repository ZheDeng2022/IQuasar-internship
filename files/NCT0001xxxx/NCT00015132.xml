      The purpose of this CREST (Clinical Rapid Evaluation Screening Trial) study is the use of&#xD;
      tiagabine, sertraline, or donepezil for the treatment of cocaine dependence using a modified&#xD;
      placebo-controlled experimental design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considerable progress in preclinical research has provided a basis for hypothesis driven&#xD;
      clinical trials in cocaine dependence. A greater mechanistic understanding of both cocaine&#xD;
      and many clinically approved medications has led to the identification of many promising&#xD;
      medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason NIDA has developed a CREST (Clinical Rapid Evaluation Screening Trial)&#xD;
      protocol to provide a needed incremental medication screening step between preclinical&#xD;
      research and full blown expensive Phase III pivotal trials. While patients receive manual&#xD;
      based psychotherapy, three medications are screened compared to unmatched placebo in an&#xD;
      eight-week, 80-subject, four cell design trial. Other important features of the CREST&#xD;
      protocol include collecting baseline measurements over a two week period and analyzing&#xD;
      primary outcome measures (quantitative urine toxicology and clinical global improvement&#xD;
      scales) in terms of a composite score of overall individual patient improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three medications being evaluated in this trial include tiagabine, sertraline, and&#xD;
      donepzil. Tiagabine is hypothesized to interfere with glutamatergic cocaine mechanisms&#xD;
      relevant to addiction. Sertraline is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal 5-HT&#xD;
      reuptake, which may modulate the reinforcing and cueing effects of cocaine. Donepezil is&#xD;
      hypothesized to interfere with cholinergic cocaine mechanisms relevant to addiction.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females, 18 to 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. DSM-IV diagnosis of cocaine dependence as determined by a semi-structured psychiatric&#xD;
             evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of at least $100 worth of cocaine within the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Substantiated current cocaine use demonstrated by six urine toxicology specimens, two&#xD;
             of which are positive for BE, in a consecutive two week period during the 30 days&#xD;
             prior to study entry. No more than 4 specimens within seven days will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Additional baseline measures must be completed in conjunction with urine specimens&#xD;
             described in #4, which include: once weekly craving measure (BSCS), Self and Observer&#xD;
             Global ratings, semiquantitative urine specimen for toxicology of six substances&#xD;
             (amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, opiates); and three&#xD;
             times weekly alcohol breathalyzer and Self Report of Drug Use (SUR).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability to provide written informed consent and to comply with all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of child-bearing capacity must be using one of the following acceptable methods&#xD;
             of birth-control: a. oral contraceptives, b. barrier (diaphragm or condom) with&#xD;
             spermicide, c. intrauterine progesterone contraceptive system, d. levonorgestrel&#xD;
             implant, e. medroxyprogesterone acetate contraceptive injection, f.complete abstinence&#xD;
