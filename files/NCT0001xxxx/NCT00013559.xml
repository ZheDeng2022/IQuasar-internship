  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how a rare disease called Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) affects people&#xD;
      and how they change over time. SMS is caused by a small chromosome 17p11.2 deletion (missing&#xD;
      piece). The syndrome is associated with distinct physical, developmental and behavioral&#xD;
      characteristics, but it is not fully understood. To learn more about this disease, a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary research team will study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The range and type of medical, behavioral, and learning problems of people with SMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The deletion of chromosome 17p11.2 to find the gene or genes that cause SMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether certain specific genetic changes cause certain specific medical problems&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What signs and symptoms must be present to make a diagnosis of SMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact that a child with SMS has on his or her family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of all ages with SMS may be eligible for this study. They will be evaluated by a&#xD;
      team of medical specialists at the NIH Clinical Center over the course of several days.&#xD;
      Parents of patients will be asked to provide copies of past medical records and tests results&#xD;
      for review. They will provide a family medical history and information on the child s&#xD;
      prenatal, developmental, behavioral and medical histories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may involve the following evaluations: physical, neurological and psychological&#xD;
      exams; ear, nose and throat evaluation; speech, language and swallowing evaluation; hearing&#xD;
      test; eye examination; imaging studies (e.g., X-rays, ultrasound, MRI); developmental and&#xD;
      behavioral assessment; rehabilitation evaluation with gait (walking) analysis; urinalysis,&#xD;
      blood, and/or skin cell studies; sleep study; other consultations as required. A tissue&#xD;
      sample (blood or cheek swab or skin biopsy) may be taken for genetic studies. To obtain a&#xD;
      cheek swab, a small brush is rubbed against the inside of the cheek to wipe off some cells.&#xD;
      For a skin biopsy, a small area of skin is numbed with a local anesthetic and a small circle&#xD;
      of skin, usually about 1/8 inch, is removed with a biopsy tool. Parents may be asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires about their child s growth and development, therapies, medications,&#xD;
      sleep, development and behavioral concerns. They also may be asked to bring their child to&#xD;
      NIH for follow-up visits every 6 months to 3 years, depending on the child s age. The purpose&#xD;
      of these visits is to see how the child changes over time and to conduct additional tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents may also be asked to enroll their child in a SMS Research Registry and provide tissue&#xD;
      samples for a SMS Research Core Tissue Bank. The research registry is a confidential database&#xD;
      of individuals diagnosed with SMS. Its purpose is to facilitate SMS research initiatives and&#xD;
      promote the development of improved treatments for SMS. Enrollment requires completing a&#xD;
      30-minute questionnaire. The tissue bank stores tissue cultures and cell lines created for&#xD;
      future SMS research. About 2 teaspoons of blood are drawn from adult patients and 1 to 3&#xD;
      teaspoons from children, depending on their size. Tissue samples can be obtained by skin&#xD;
      biopsy or during a scheduled surgical procedure.&#xD;

      This project investigates the clinical manifestations and molecular genetic defects of&#xD;
      Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS), a rare (1/15,000 1/25,000) clinically recognizable yet often&#xD;
      under diagnosed multiple congenital anomaly/intellectual disability (MCA/ID) syndrome (OMIM&#xD;
      #182290). The syndrome is characterized by a distinct pattern of minor craniofacial and&#xD;
      skeletal anomalies, expressive speech/language delays, psychomotor and growth retardation,&#xD;
      and a striking neurobehavioral phenotype that includes a circadian sleep disorder. The&#xD;
      majority of cases (~90%) are due to de novo interstitial deletion of chromosome 17p11.2 that&#xD;
      includes the RAI1 (retinoic acid induced 1) gene; however, heterozygous RAI1 mutations&#xD;
      account for about 10% of cases. While clinical variability exists, haploinsufficiency of RAI1&#xD;
      (by deletion or mutation) is believed to be responsible for most of the common features that&#xD;
      characterize the syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with confirmed or clinically suspected SMS, their parents, and/or unaffected&#xD;
      siblings will be enrolled in this comprehensive longitudinal natural history study. An NIH&#xD;
      interdisciplinary SMS Research Team (SMS-RT) of clinical and basic science researchers, in&#xD;
      collaboration with extramural investigators, will conduct comprehensive clinical and&#xD;
      molecular analyses to delineate the physiological, developmental (cognitive), behavioral,&#xD;
      biochemical, and cellular processes that characterize the syndrome. The protocol aims to:&#xD;
      characterize the phenotypic variability, natural history and underlying pathophysiology of&#xD;
      SMS; delineate the neurobehavioral phenotype with respect to sleep disturbance, cognition,&#xD;
      mood and maladaptive behaviors and sensory processing dysfunction; investigate the&#xD;
      physiologic and functional aspects specifically underlying delays in speech/language and&#xD;
      motor development; explore genotype/phenotype correlations to identify gene(s) or modifiers&#xD;
      that contribute to phenotypic variability; determine potential intervention and therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies likely to improve outcome; and evaluate the psychosocial impact of SMS on the&#xD;
      family system. Offsite enrollment of two pediatric comparison groups to participate in the&#xD;
      Home Assessment of Sleep (HAS) are also enrolled: 1) unaffected siblings/control group; and&#xD;
      2) a DD/ID-comparison group of children with developmental/intellectual disabilities&#xD;
      associated with sleep disturbances.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR LONGITUDINAL SMS NATURAL HISTORY STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Persons with known or suspected SMS (male/female, all ages, all ethnicities), their parents&#xD;
        and/or unaffected siblings are eligible for enrollment. In some cases, a screening&#xD;
        evaluation to confirm the diagnosis may occur at NIH and/or via blood samples sent for&#xD;
        deletion screening, prior to enrollment. Subjects may be excluded from further&#xD;
        participation if the diagnosis of SMS is ruled out after the initial SMS screening&#xD;
        evaluation and/or inability to obtain voluntary informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HOME ASSESSMENT OF SLEEP (HAS) DD/MR-SYNDROME COMPARISON GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children (male &amp; female, all ethnicities) less than18 years with a confirmed diagnosis&#xD;
        (based on current accepted diagnostic criteria) of a specified developmental disability&#xD;
        (DD)/MR-syndrome reported to include sleep disturbance. These include: Prader-Willi&#xD;
        syndrome (PWS), Down syndrome (DS), Cornelia deLange syndrome (CDLS), and/or behavioral&#xD;
        diagnosis of autism, ADHD or fragile X syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HOME ASSESSMENT OF SLEEP (HAS) DD/MR-SYNDROME COMPARISON GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Failure to meet established/accepted diagnostic criteria and/or inability to obtain&#xD;
        voluntary informed consent (i.e. parental consent for child with developmental delay/MR) is&#xD;
        reason for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SMS RESEARCH REGISTRY AND CORE TISSUE BANK:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals (male &amp; female, all ages and all ethnicities) with a confirmed diagnosis of SMS&#xD;
        &amp; their parents who voluntarily give informed consent are eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SMS RESEARCH REGISTRY AND CORE TISSUE BANK:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who do not have a confirmed diagnosis of SMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There is no exclusion based on age, gender, ethnicity or any other factor. Decisionally&#xD;
        impaired subjects may be enrolled if the parent, legal guardian, or durable power of&#xD;
        attorney (DPA) consents; assent will be obtained when deemed appropriate.&#xD;
