      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of pioglitazone, a new diabetes medicine, on&#xD;
      decreasing insulin resistance and improving liver disease in patients with nonalcoholic&#xD;
      steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is a chronic liver disease with unknown cause that involves fat&#xD;
      accumulation and inflammation in the liver, leading to liver cirrhosis in 10 to 15 percent of&#xD;
      patients and significant liver scarring in another 30 percent. Although similar to a&#xD;
      condition that affects people who drink excessive amounts of alcohol, NASH occurs in people&#xD;
      who drink only minimal or no alcohol. It is most often seen in patients with insulin&#xD;
      resistance. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance and improves blood lipid (fat) levels,&#xD;
      so that it may improve liver disease in NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NASH 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will&#xD;
      be screened with a medical history and physical examination and routine blood tests. They&#xD;
      will see a dietitian for counseling on diet and weight reduction, if needed. They will stop&#xD;
      taking any medications for liver disease and take a daily multivitamin pill. After 2 months,&#xD;
      those eligible for participation will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the Clinical Center for 2 to 3 days for a complete medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, blood tests, urinalysis, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      abdominal ultrasound and a liver biopsy. After the diagnosis of NASH is confirmed, the&#xD;
      following procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiography - imaging test using sound waves shows the heart structure and function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting metabolic rate - measures amount of oxygen (and calories) used to maintain body&#xD;
           functions at rest. While lying down, the patient wears a clear plastic hood over the&#xD;
           head for 20 minutes while the amount of oxygen used is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans - shows the size of the liver and other organs.&#xD;
           The patient lies on a table in a metal cylinder that contains a magnetic field (the&#xD;
           scanner) for no more than 30 minutes while the organs are imaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan measures whole body composition, including&#xD;
           amount of fat. The patient lies under an X-ray scanning machine for about 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) - measures blood sugar and insulin levels. The&#xD;
           patient drinks a very sweet drink containing glucose (sugar), after which blood samples&#xD;
           are collected at various intervals during the 3-hour test. The blood is drawn through a&#xD;
           catheter (thin plastic tube) placed in the arm before the test begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) - determines how the tissues respond to&#xD;
           insulin and glucose. Glucose is injected into a vein, followed by a short infusion of&#xD;
           insulin. Blood samples are collected through a catheter at various intervals during the&#xD;
           3-hour test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the above procedures are completed, patients start taking pioglitazone by mouth once a&#xD;
      day for 48 weeks, keeping track of the medication and any side effects. They will be seen at&#xD;
      the clinic every 2 weeks for the first month and then every 4 weeks for the rest of the&#xD;
      treatment period. The visits will include an interview and examination by a physician and&#xD;
      blood draw for laboratory tests. Female patients will have a pregnancy test at each clinic&#xD;
      visit. At the end of the treatment period patients will be admitted to the Clinical Center&#xD;
      for a repeat medical evaluation that will include the procedures described above.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a clinicopathological entity that is being recognized&#xD;
      more frequently in recent years. It is characterized by histologic changes that are similar&#xD;
      to alcoholic hepatitis, but in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. It is typically&#xD;
      associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. It&#xD;
      may progress and cause severe hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in significant numbers of&#xD;
      patients. Currently, there is no effective therapy for this condition. In this pilot, open&#xD;
      label study, we propose to treat 30 patients with nonalcoholic hepatitis with pioglitazone&#xD;
      for 48 weeks. Pioglitazone has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, the possible&#xD;
      underlying mechanism of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Pioglitazone is an antidiabetic drug&#xD;
      that belongs to thiazolidinedione group. The mechanism of action is thought to be mediated by&#xD;
      activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-gamma (PPAR-gamma). After an&#xD;
      initial evaluation of insulin sensitivity, fat distribution and liver biopsy, patients will&#xD;
      receive 30 mg of pioglitazone, orally for 48 weeks. Patients will be monitored at regular&#xD;
      intervals for symptoms of liver disease, side effects of pioglitazone, serum biochemical and&#xD;
      metabolic indices. At 48 weeks, patients will have a repeat medical evaluation and liver&#xD;
      biopsy. Pre and post treatment liver histology, fat distribution and insulin sensitivity will&#xD;
      be compared. The primary end point of successful therapy will be improvement in hepatic&#xD;
      histology as determined by reduction of at least three points in NASH activity score.&#xD;
      Secondary end points will be improvement in insulin sensitivity, reduction in visceral fat,&#xD;
      liver volume and liver biochemistry.&#xD;
