      The object of this study is to determine if Reiki will improve glycemic control and cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic function diabetic patients with painful neuropathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of coronary heart disease(CHD) in type II diabetes is currently at least 20% in&#xD;
      subjects 65 years and older. Numerous data suggest that hyperglycemia may be an independent&#xD;
      risk factor for macrovascular complications. Diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN) affects 5-50%&#xD;
      of patients with diabetes and is exacerbated by poor glycemic control. DPN is characterized&#xD;
      by acute functional abnormalities in nerve fibers followed by chronic nerve fiber loss and&#xD;
      blunted nerve fiber regeneration. Symptoms include tingling and burning sensations in the&#xD;
      calves, ankles and feet. Pharmacological treatment of diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) and&#xD;
      DPN include tricyclic antidepressants, which are cardiotoxic and have a low efficacy rate.&#xD;
      The ADA recommends the utilization of diet and exercise as the primary means of glycemic&#xD;
      control, and therefore of DPN. Because of the increased levels of extremity pain, patients&#xD;
      with DPN are less likely to include exercise as a part of their health regimen. Diabetic&#xD;
      autonomic neuropathy (DAN) commonly complicates diabetes and has been invoked as a cause of&#xD;
      sudden death in diabetic patients. The excess cardiac mortality in diabetics appears to be&#xD;
      augmented by the presence of DAN in patients with advanced deficits in sympathetic&#xD;
      cardiovascular enervation which may augment cardiac arrhythmogenesis. An bio-energy modality&#xD;
      known as Reiki is an energy manipulation technique similar to Therapeutic Touch, a hands-on&#xD;
      modality familiar in nursing for the relief of chronic pain, as well as accelerate healing in&#xD;
      full thickness dermal wounds. The study approach is to apply Reiki to patients with DPN +/-&#xD;
      DAN in a semi-double blind, randomized, crossover study to ascertain if glycemic control and&#xD;
      cardiac autonomic function are improved in these patients. Outcome measures will include&#xD;
      HBA1c values, the McGill-Melzack Pain Questionnaire, and a quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
      Participants will also be tested as to their ability to tolerate exercise by a 6 minute walk&#xD;
      test. This study will help elucidate whether an bio-energy technique can reduce pain levels,&#xD;
      improve glycemic control by increasing exercise tolerance and improve cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      function, both major contributors to CHD mortality.&#xD;
