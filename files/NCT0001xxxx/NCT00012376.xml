  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop&#xD;
      growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of&#xD;
      immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system&#xD;
      recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of&#xD;
      bryostatin 1 combined with sargramostim in treating patients who have refractory myeloid&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of continuous intravenous infusion bryostatin-1&#xD;
      when given in combination with GM-CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe and quantify the frequency of toxicity of the combination of continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion bryostatin-1 and subcutaneously administered GM-CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the impact of the combination of bryostatin-1 and GM-CSF on the&#xD;
      differentiation and cell cycle distribution of myeloid cells in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the impact of the combination of bryostatin-1 and GM-CSF on T lymphocyte&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the pharmacokinetics of continuous infusion bryostatin-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bryostatin 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously once&#xD;
      daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease stabilization or improvement may&#xD;
      continue treatment for up to 12 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 2 patients receive escalating doses of bryostatin 1 until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 30% of patients experience&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis of MDS must be confirmed by a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy&#xD;
             revealing refractory anemia, or primary refractory leukopenia or thrombocytopenia with&#xD;
             morphologic features of MDS; patients with 5q- syndrome are ineligible; patients with&#xD;
             RA and RARS are eligible provided they are transfusion dependent. Patients with&#xD;
             chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) are eligible; allogeneic BMT will be the&#xD;
             treatment priority for patients with HLA-matched siblings; MDS patients for whom&#xD;
             intensive chemotherapy has failed to achieve remission will be candidates for this&#xD;
             trial if the chemotherapy was administered &gt; 1 month prior to enrollment, and&#xD;
             performance status is adequate; patients are also eligible having previously&#xD;
             progressed on other institutional trials, including phenylbutyrate and ATRA or&#xD;
             5'-azacytadine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy confirmed diagnosis of relapsed&#xD;
             AML within 4 weeks of registering for this trial; patients will be eligible only if&#xD;
             their WBC is &lt; 30 x 103/:l and stable for at least 7 days, and if they are unlikely to&#xD;
             require cytotoxic therapy during the duration of the trial; patients may not have APL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly diagnosed patients may be considered for this trial provided they do not qualify&#xD;
             for potentially curative intensive chemotherapeutic regimens; patients with APL are&#xD;
             not eligible for this trial; patients who have refused chemotherapy for untreated AML,&#xD;
             or who are deemed to be poor candidates medically for AML induction chemotherapy, but&#xD;
             otherwise meet the criteria list below may enroll on this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with accelerated or myeloid blast phase CML are eligible if their blast count&#xD;
             is &lt; 30 x 103/:L and stable for at least 7 days; patients previously treated for&#xD;
             chronic phase CML will be eligible for this protocol; patients may also have undergone&#xD;
             treatment for acceleration or blastic phase provided this is not within 2 weeks of&#xD;
             enrollment and they meet all the eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with PNH will be eligible provided they are experiencing symptoms&#xD;
             associated with their disease; in particular, patients experiencing life-threatening&#xD;
             complications of their illness, including abdominal, central vein or cerebral&#xD;
             thromboses, active infections, as well as recurrent, symptomatic hemolytic crises and&#xD;
             do not have other treatment options are encouraged to consider participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  JHOC confirmed and documented diagnosis of either AML, MDS, CML in accelerated or&#xD;
             blast phase or PNH&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have relatively stable bone marrow function for more than ten days prior&#xD;
             to enrollment on the study; WBC count doubling within this time period would indicate&#xD;
             unstable bone marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have central intravenous access; acceptable access include: PICC lines,&#xD;
             hickman and hohn catheters, and port-a-caths&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or caregiver must be willing to perform subcutaneous injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total serum bilirubin =&lt; 1.6 mg/dL, unless secondary to hemolysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SGOT/SGPT each &lt; 2 times the upper limit of normal unless disease related (i.e., PNH,&#xD;
             extramedullary disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin should be at least 8 gm/dL at the time of protocol entry; patients may&#xD;
             receive transfusions to achieve this level&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received treatment for their myeloid disorder within 2 weeks of&#xD;
             beginning the trial; treatments include the use of chemotherapy, hematopoietic growth&#xD;
             factors, and biologic therapy such as monoclonal antibodies; the exception is the use&#xD;
             of hydroxyurea for patients with WBC &gt; 10 x 103/:L; this duration of time appears&#xD;
             adequate for wash out due to the relatively short-acting nature of most anti-leukemia&#xD;
             agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from all toxicities (to grade 0 or 1) associated with&#xD;
             previous treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have any clinical symptoms of active CNS disease; if CNS disease is&#xD;
             suspected, patient must have LP with negative cytology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have evidence of pulmonary leukostasis (i.e., the clinical syndrome&#xD;
             associated with symptomatic shortness of breath or hypoxia which is directly&#xD;
             attributed to an elevated white blood cell count and the resulting capillary ischemia)&#xD;
             or disseminated intravascular coagulation (i.e., the clinical syndrome associated with&#xD;
             systemic intravascular clotting which is directly attributed to excessive&#xD;
             procoagulants that overwhelm the inhibitory arm of the coagulation cascade)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All women of potential child bearing must have negative serum B-HCG and use an&#xD;
             effective means of birth control throughout the trial period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to provide informed consent and to return to clinic for adequate&#xD;
             follow up as required by the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of RA with 5q- syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukemia with blast count &gt; 30 x 103/:L, uncontrolled with hydroxyurea&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  APL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CML in lymphoid blast phase&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &gt;= 3&#xD;
&#xD;

             infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active CNS disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a previous history of intolerance to GM-CSF&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women are not eligible for this protocol; all patients with&#xD;
             child-bearing potential must use effective contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received bryostatin-1 in the past are not eligible for this protocol&#xD;
