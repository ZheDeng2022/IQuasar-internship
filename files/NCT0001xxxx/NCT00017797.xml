  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if HIV-infected pregnant women who take protease&#xD;
      inhibitors (PIs) are more likely to have blood sugar problems than those who do not take PIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected people generally are treated with a combination of different types of anti-HIV&#xD;
      drugs, 1 of which is usually a PI. The same holds true for pregnant women, but not much is&#xD;
      known about the use of these drugs in pregnancy. Blood sugar and liver problems caused by&#xD;
      anti-HIV drugs in nonpregnant patients are well known but their effects in pregnancy are not.&#xD;
      Also, certain physical changes brought about by pregnancy may affect the way drugs are&#xD;
      handled in the body. There remains a need for further study into the use of anti-HIV drugs&#xD;
      during pregnancy and their effect on the safety of the mother and baby.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The dramatic impact of potent combination antiretroviral therapies on the course of HIV&#xD;
      disease has made the use of PIs routine in the care of HIV-1-infected individuals.&#xD;
      Combination therapy likewise has become the standard of care in pregnant individuals, even&#xD;
      though information on use of these drugs during human pregnancy is limited. There are no&#xD;
      published prospective evaluations of toxicities experienced by pregnant women on&#xD;
      PI-containing antiretroviral regimens, despite findings of metabolic disturbances of glucose,&#xD;
      fatty acids, and cholesterol, as well as lactic acidosis/hepatic steatosis in nonpregnant&#xD;
      individuals treated with antiretrovirals. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects also are well&#xD;
      documented in nonpregnant individuals treated with PIs, but have not been systematically&#xD;
      evaluated in pregnancy. In addition, the physiologic changes brought about by pregnancy may&#xD;
      influence the pharmacokinetics, safety, and side effects of antiretroviral drugs. There&#xD;
      remains a need for further evaluation of the use of antiretrovirals during pregnancy and&#xD;
      their impact on maternal, fetal, and infant safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are stratified according to whether or not they are on a PI-containing&#xD;
      antiretroviral regimen and the number of weeks of gestation (26 weeks or less versus greater&#xD;
      than 26 weeks). Patients are followed at 8-week intervals from the time of entry until&#xD;
      delivery or pregnancy termination, with an additional visit at 12 weeks after delivery or&#xD;
      pregnancy termination. All infants born to study participants are evaluated at the time of&#xD;
      delivery (anthropometrics and HIV DNA PCR) and are seen again at the mothers' 12-week&#xD;
      post-delivery visit. Glucose tolerance testing and other metabolic studies are performed&#xD;
      serially during pregnancy and again postpartum. This is an observational study and drugs are&#xD;
      not supplied. Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy must obtain their own medications.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are female and 13 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are between 20 and 34 weeks pregnant at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had an ultrasound performed at 16 or more weeks of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have consent of a parent or guardian if under 18 years of age. The father of the baby,&#xD;
             if available, also must give consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have taken the same anti-HIV drugs, including a PI, during the 8 weeks just before&#xD;
             study entry. If not taking a PI or any anti-HIV drug, must not have taken a PI during&#xD;
             the 8 weeks just before study entry. Patients must carry on this way for the entire&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have diabetes. Patients who have had diabetes caused by pancreas problems or steroid&#xD;
             use in the past, but now have normal blood sugar without having to take drugs or&#xD;
             special diets, are allowed. Patients who have had blood sugar problems in a past&#xD;
             pregnancy also are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had a serious infection or medical condition within 30 days before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are enrolled in another study which requires a lot of blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Take, or have taken in the 6 weeks before study entry, any of the following drugs:&#xD;
             hormones (growth hormone, testosterone, or steroids), thalidomide, interleukins or&#xD;
             interferons, efavirenz, hydroxyurea, drugs to control blood sugar, and anti-cancer&#xD;
             drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Take, or have taken in the year before study entry, steroids, e.g., prednisone, for&#xD;
             more than 14 days in any 3-month period. Inhaled steroids and steroid creams/ointments&#xD;
             are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Take, or have taken in the 30 days before study entry, PIs with lovastatin or&#xD;
             simvastatin (2 drugs that lower the amount of fat in the blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an ultrasound showing a major abnormality in the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have problems with their pregnancy and/or are expecting more than 1 baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abuse drugs or alcohol.&#xD;
