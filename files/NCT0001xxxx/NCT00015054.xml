  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of methylphenidate (MPD) as&#xD;
      effective and safe in the outpatient treatment of cocaine-dependent patients with a comorbid&#xD;
      DSM-IV diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), to demonstrate the&#xD;
      ability of each site to participate in a subsequent anticipated controlled trial of MPD&#xD;
      (recruitment and execution), and to gather preliminary data on the ability of sweat patches&#xD;
      to detect episodes of cocaine use.&#xD;

      Forty-one participants were enrolled into this multi-site, outpatient, open-label, ten-week&#xD;
      trial. Participants were scheduled to attend three visits per week to allow safety and&#xD;
      efficacy measures to be taken. In addition, participants were given two hours of individual&#xD;
      substance abuse therapy during the first four weeks, and one hour per week during the last&#xD;
      six weeks, of the trial. All participants were started on a total daily dose of 20 mg MPD.&#xD;
      The total daily dose was then increased to a maximum daily dose of 60 mg (20 mg TID) or to&#xD;
      the maximum dose tolerated by the participant.&#xD;
