  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see if Z-100 (an investigational drug) treatment is safe in&#xD;
      HIV patients who have never received treatment for their HIV, who have not been taking highly&#xD;
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 8 weeks, or who have been stable on their&#xD;
      current first or second HAART regimen for at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
