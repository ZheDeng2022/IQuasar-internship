  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of the drug riluzole on Parkinson's disease symptoms and&#xD;
      on dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that develop as a result of long-term treatment with&#xD;
      levodopa. Riluzole blocks the action of the chemical messenger glutamate, thought to be&#xD;
      involved in producing Parkinson's symptoms. The drug is currently approved to treat&#xD;
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, another neurologic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with relatively advanced Parkinson's disease between 20 and 80 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this 4-week study. Participants will have a complete medical history and&#xD;
      physical examination, and a detailed neurological evaluation. The evaluations will include&#xD;
      blood tests and an electrocardiogram, and possibly brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT&#xD;
      scan, and chest X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will, if possible, stop taking all antiparkinsonian medications except levodopa&#xD;
      (Sinemet) for one month before the study begins and throughout its duration. For the first 1&#xD;
      to 3 days, patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center to undergo a levodopa&#xD;
      &quot;dose-finding&quot; procedure. For this study, patients will stop taking their oral Sinemet and&#xD;
      instead will have levodopa infused through a vein for up to 8 hours/day. During the&#xD;
      infusions, the levodopa dose will be increased slowly until either 1) parkinsonian symptoms&#xD;
      improve, 2) unacceptable side effects occur, or 3) the maximum study dose is reached.&#xD;
      Symptoms will be monitored frequently to find two infusion rates: 1) one that is less than&#xD;
      what is needed to relieve symptoms (suboptimal rate), and 2) one that relieves symptoms but&#xD;
      may produce dyskinesias (optimal rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the dose-finding phase is completed, treatment will begin. Patients will take riluzole&#xD;
      or placebo (a look-a-like pill with no active ingredient) twice a day, along with their&#xD;
      regular Sinemet, for 3 weeks. (All participants will receive placebo at some time during the&#xD;
      study, and some patients will receive only placebo throughout the entire 4 weeks.) At the end&#xD;
      of each week, patients will be readmitted to the hospital and receive the previous week's&#xD;
      dose of riluzole or placebo in combination with a levodopa infusion at the rate determined in&#xD;
      the dose-finding phase of the study. The procedure for the infusion will be the same as that&#xD;
      for the dose-finding phase. The dose of riluzole will be increased until the optimum dose has&#xD;
      been achieved or until side effects occur (at which time the dose will be lowered or the drug&#xD;
      stopped).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, parkinsonian symptoms and dyskinesias will be evaluated using&#xD;
      standardized rating scales and blood samples will be drawn periodically to measure drug&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of a nonselective inhibitor of&#xD;
      glutamate mediated synaptic transmission on the severity of parkinsonian signs and&#xD;
      levodopa-associated motor response complications in patients with moderately advanced&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. In a controlled proof-of-principle clinical trial, the efficacy of the&#xD;
      glutamate release inhibitor riluzole will be assessed through the use of validated motor&#xD;
      function scales. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent clinical evaluations and&#xD;
      laboratory tests.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Males and females between the ages of 20-80 are eligible for study. Women must be either at&#xD;
        least one year post-menopausal, or using an adequate contraceptive method for at least one&#xD;
        month prior to and during participation in this study. All will carry the diagnosis of&#xD;
        idiopathic Parkinson's disease based on the presence of a characteristic clinical history&#xD;
        and neurological findings. All will have relatively advanced disease with&#xD;
        levodopa-associated motor response complications, including peak-dose dyskinesias and&#xD;
        wearing-off fluctuations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence or history of any medical condition that can reasonably be expected to subject&#xD;
        the patient to unwarranted risk. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities&#xD;
        including liver enzyme elevations more than two times the upper limit of normal, or&#xD;
        neutropenia (wbc less than 3000).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Parkinson's disease patients exhibiting diphasic or end-of dose dyskinesias or disabling&#xD;
        dystonia will be excluded. Patients who are unable to be treated with levodopa/carbidopa&#xD;
        alone or with a single, relatively short-acting dopamine agonist will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a form of parkinsonism other than idiopathic PD or with a diagnosis of&#xD;
        dementia (MMSE less than 24) or major psychiatric disorder (UPDRS [Part I Item 3] greater&#xD;
        than or equal to 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with unacceptable prior/concomitant medications will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since the influence of any investigational compound on the unborn child and reproductive&#xD;
        organs is unknown, pregnant women and those not practicing effective means of birth control&#xD;
        will be excluded as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with prior bilateral surgical intervention for the treatment of parkinsonian&#xD;
        symptoms, i.e. deep brain stimulation, pallidotomy, fetal tissue transplantation as well as&#xD;
        patients must at risk for hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, and/or myocardial ischemia&#xD;
        secondary to intravenous levodopa challenge will be excluded.&#xD;
