      The purpose of this protocol is to develop a valid, reliable, better standardized, and more&#xD;
      efficient test of visual acuity (ability to see fine details) for use in clinical trials.&#xD;
      Recent improvements in computer video hardware permit calibration, characterization, and&#xD;
      accurate rendering of eye-chart-quality letters. The computer can then be used to measure&#xD;
      acuity. The modified binary search (MOBS) testing strategy is one method of computer-based&#xD;
      testing. This study will compare the accuracy, precision, stability and utility of the MOBS&#xD;
      technique with the eye chart method used in the National Eye Institute's Early Treatment for&#xD;
      Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). The ETDRS method is currently the gold standard for&#xD;
      acuity testing in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will include NEI clinic patients between 7 and 90 years of age with or without&#xD;
      eye disease. Eye diseases include poor visual acuity, age-related macular degeneration,&#xD;
      cataract, optic nerve abnormality, corneal abnormality, uveitis, glaucoma, other retinal or&#xD;
      choroid abnormality, amblyopia or other eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their vision tested in each eye using both the ETDRS eye chart method&#xD;
      and the MOBS method. The ETDRS method will require subjects to read all the letters on the&#xD;
      chart until they can no longer see the details. For the MOBS method, they will read a single&#xD;
      letter at a time that will appear on the computer screen. After reading each letter, a new&#xD;
      letter will be presented that is either bigger or smaller in size. After completing the last&#xD;
      acuity test, participants will fill out a questionnaire regarding their preference for one&#xD;
      test type over the other.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the project is to develop a valid, reliable, better standardized and&#xD;
      more efficient test of visual acuity for use in clinical trials. Accuracy, precision,&#xD;
      stability, and utility of the test will be assessed for non-inferiority with Early Treatment&#xD;
      for Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol, the gold standard for acuity testing in&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental protocol (EVA-MOBS {Electronic Visual Acuity - Modified Binary Search})&#xD;
      utilizes a testing strategy that would appear to increase the efficiency and standardization&#xD;
      of acuity threshold determination. A more efficient test is justified on the basis of&#xD;
      reducing subject burden. Increased measurement efficiency may also reduce both subject- and&#xD;
      tester-based bias, while allowing a better means to assess measurement stability through the&#xD;
      collection of repeated measures data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the standard eye examination, replicated visual acuity assessments will be made&#xD;
      during regularly-scheduled Clinic visits. Up to 500 opportunistically-sampled subjects from&#xD;
      the National Eye Institute will be tested both with the ETDRS and EVA-MOBS protocols over a&#xD;
      12 month study period. Similar testing will take place at two other institutions (Devers Eye&#xD;
      Institute, Portland, OR; The Retina Foundation of the Southwest, Dallas, TX) and the data&#xD;
      from all three institutions will be combined and analyzed at the JAEB Center (Tampa, FL).&#xD;
      Subjects will range in age from 7 years to 90 years and will be classified by clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis (normal, high refractive error, age-related macular degeneration, cataract, optic&#xD;
      nerve abnormality, corneal abnormality, uveitis, glaucoma, retinal/choroid abnormality,&#xD;
      amblyopia and other criteria). First, those with poor acuity will be oversampled by&#xD;
      increasing the chance that they will be selected for this testing. Second, patients will only&#xD;
      be selected for this extra testing if it will not seriously delay clinic operations on any&#xD;
      given day. Order of acuity test type will be randomized. It is estimated that up to 10&#xD;
      patients per day can have this testing performed without compromising clinic operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental protocol runs on a Palm handheld that is used to provide instructions to the&#xD;
      tester, record the subject's responses, and communicate with a PC/monitor at a test distance&#xD;
      of 3 meters. Stimuli are high contrast black-and-white ETDRS letters presented on an ultra&#xD;
      high resolution FD Trinitron monitor, that subtend 2.5 to 200 min of arc; each letter appears&#xD;
      in isolation under equiluminant conditions, and is flanked with black bars to simulate visual&#xD;
      crowding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acuity scores will be compared, with the ETDRS score serving as the reference standard.&#xD;
      Stability of the acuity estimates from the EVA-MOBS protocol will be assessed with data from&#xD;
      repeated measures. A short questionnaire will be administered, following the last acuity&#xD;
      test, to determine whether a test type preference exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If results indicate that the protocol is well tolerated by clinical populations and that&#xD;
      thresholds are accurate, precise, and stable, the method will be standardized for use in&#xD;
      future trials. Use of stimuli to test visual resolution acuity, such as the Landolt-C, may&#xD;
      subsequently be evaluated.&#xD;
