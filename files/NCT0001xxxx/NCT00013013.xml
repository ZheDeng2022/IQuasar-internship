      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among veterans, smoking is the single most important risk factor for preventable mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity, and studies suggest a higher prevalence of smoking among veterans than the&#xD;
      general population. The VHA has encouraged adoption of the AHCPR Guideline for Smoking&#xD;
      Cessation, yet most hospitals have poorly developed smoking cessation programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to investigate the effectiveness of an organizational strategy&#xD;
      to increase compliance with the AHCPR guideline. Short term goals of the study include&#xD;
      increasing the rate of identification of smokers and increasing the delivery of brief smoking&#xD;
      cessation interventions. Long term goals include reducing tobacco consumption among veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty VAMCï¿½s with active primary care clinics have been randomly assigned to either control&#xD;
      (usual practice; UP) or intervention (organizational support; OS) groups. The intervention&#xD;
      hospitals receive staff training and site consultation; all hospitals will receive the AHCPR&#xD;
      guideline. Rate of identification of smokers in the medical record, smoking cessation rates,&#xD;
      provision of smoking cessation services (e.g., NRT, counseling), and costs of NRT will be&#xD;
      determined via telephone interviews with patients, chart review, and electronic records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data collection is nearly complete, and the intervention period will be complete in&#xD;
      September, 2000. We have completed telephone surveys with approximately 4500 veterans.&#xD;
      Analysis of study data is ongoing, and manuscript preparation will begin within the next few&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
