  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One hundred fifty two participants were randomized. Study duration is approximately 86 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential for pegloticase with methotrexate (MTX)&#xD;
      to increase the response rate seen with pegloticase alone, and to characterize the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the concomitant use of pegloticase with MTX, by&#xD;
      comparing pegloticase co-administered with MTX to pegloticase co-administered with placebo&#xD;
      for MTX in adults with uncontrolled gout.&#xD;

      This study is a Phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group, efficacy and safety study of pegloticase with MTX vs. pegloticase with&#xD;
      placebo for MTX in adult participants with uncontrolled gout.&#xD;
