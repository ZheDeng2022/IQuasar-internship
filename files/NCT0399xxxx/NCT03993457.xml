      PRECISE-D is a single site, randomized, open label 8-week clinical trial that will enroll 70&#xD;
      participants to evaluate if the level of inflammation in our body can predict how we will&#xD;
      respond to antidepressants. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a substance in the body that is&#xD;
      associated with inflammation. Previous research has suggested that people with high CRP&#xD;
      (i.e., high inflammation levels) tend to have greater improvement of depressive symptoms with&#xD;
      an antidepressant called bupropion, while individuals with low CRP (i.e., low inflammation&#xD;
      levels) appear to have more benefit from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
      antidepressants (SSRI), such as escitalopram. However, it is not completely clear if CRP can&#xD;
      predict your response to these two antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a screening visit that includes a physical exam, overall health&#xD;
      evaluation, assessment of mental health history, and a toxicology and pregnancy test. Once&#xD;
      screening is complete, participants will be randomized to one of two groups that will&#xD;
      determine whether their CRP levels will be used to select which antidepressant they will&#xD;
      receive. Participants will then complete 4 follow up visits at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. A&#xD;
      follow-up phone call from the study team will occur at week 12.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRECISE-D is a single site, randomized, open label 8-week clinical trial that will enroll 70&#xD;
      participants. Participants will be asked to attend approximately 5 visits with the&#xD;
      researchers or study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening process will take approximately 2 hours, and will include a physical&#xD;
      examination, toxicology and pregnancy test, as well as the completion of assessments. We will&#xD;
      ask participants a series of questions regarding their general health, mental health history,&#xD;
      and any medications they are currently taking. Additionally, some self-report questionnaires&#xD;
      will be used as part of this process. The results of the screening exams, tests, and/or&#xD;
      procedures will be reviewed to determine whether a participant will be allowed to continue in&#xD;
      the study. In the event that there are questions about a participant's eligibility or&#xD;
      screening procedures are remaining, the screening visit may be conducted over 2 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility is determined, the baseline visit (Week 0) will be completed. This visit&#xD;
      will last approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes and will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bloodwork: We will obtain levels of CRP and other inflammatory substances. We will also&#xD;
           examine electrolytes, kidney function, thyroid function, lipid panel, blood cell count,&#xD;
           and other tests of general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-Report Questionnaires: Participants will complete 8 questionnaires. These include&#xD;
           questions about mental health and mood. The questionnaires range from 5 to 20+ items.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive tests: We will examine the participant's attention, memory, and cognition&#xD;
           using a series of computerized assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to a study group based on their CRP level: CRP less than 1 (low&#xD;
      CRP), or CRP greater than or equal to 1 (high CRP). Within this group assignment,&#xD;
      participants will then be randomized, or assigned by chance (like flipping a coin), to one of&#xD;
      2 study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • CRP consistent antidepressant selection (medication will be prescribed based on&#xD;
      participant's CRP level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CRP less than 1, participant will be prescribed escitalopram. If CRP greater than or equal&#xD;
      to 1, participant will be prescribed bupropion XL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • CRP inconsistent antidepressant selection (medication will be prescribed in contradiction&#xD;
      to participant's CRP level) If CRP less than 1, participant will be prescribed bupropion XL.&#xD;
      If CRP greater than or equal to 1, participant will be prescribed escitalopram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group participants will receive either escitalopram or bupropion XL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 tablet of 150 mg of bupropion-XL per day (initial dose). The dose will be increased to&#xD;
           300mg per day after the first week, and may be increased up to 450 mg/per day if deemed&#xD;
           necessary by the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 tablet of 5 mg of escitalopram per day (initial dose). The dose will be increased to&#xD;
           10 mg per day after the first week, followed by an additional increase to 20 mg/day if&#xD;
           deemed necessary by clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and study doctors will know which medication is being used, but not which group&#xD;
      the participant is in; that is, participants and study doctors will not know the&#xD;
      participant's CRP levels nor whether the medication assignment is consistent with CRP levels.&#xD;
      The dose of the medication may be adjusted up or down during the study to improve effects of&#xD;
      the medication or reduce possible side effects. Dose changes will be made based on how the&#xD;
      participant is feeling and any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then complete a clinical visit at Week 2, 4, and 6. These visits will last&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes, and will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Evaluation: a psychiatrist will check the participant's vital signs and assess&#xD;
           their overall wellbeing. Symptom changes, side effects, and adherence to treatment will&#xD;
           be evaluated. Medication dosage adjustments will be made as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-Report Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final clinical visit will occur at week 8. This visit will be the last in person visit&#xD;
      and will last approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes. The following will be completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-Report Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bloodwork&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test (if you are a female able to become pregnant)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study completion, participants who wish to remain on treatment will be given a four&#xD;
      week supply of study drug while they transition care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a remote follow up assessment will be done at Week 12. Participants will be&#xD;
      contacted via phone to complete a series of questionnaires. Additionally, they will receive a&#xD;
      series of self reports via email. Paper forms will be also available at the Center for&#xD;
      Depression Research and Clinical Care if the participant prefers to answer them on paper or&#xD;
      don't have access to an email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-report questionnaires, study evaluations, and assessment of CRP levels and&#xD;
      additional inflammatory substances in this study are designed for research, not for medical&#xD;
      purposes. Even though the researchers are not specifically looking at blood to find a medical&#xD;
      problem, participants will be notified if any abnormal results are identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also have the option to participate in a Finger Prick Blood CRP substudy&#xD;
      that will compare CRP results based on the blood source: venous blood obtained via&#xD;
      venipuncture and capillary blood obtained via finger prick. A few drops of capillary blood&#xD;
      will be collected via finger prick once during the study at week 0 (screening/baseline). We&#xD;
      will compare the finger prick results to the results obtained from venipuncture at the same&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
