      The therapeutic approach taken by trial SAKK 66/17 is different from those already used in&#xD;
      clinical practice and possibly offers patients a therapeutic benefit after failure of&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy and immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with laser ablation-accessible solid tumors are treated by thermal ablation followed&#xD;
      immediately by an intratumoral injection of IP-001 (1 % N-dihydro-galacto-chitosan,&#xD;
      Immunophotonics Inc.) for injection). IP-001 is intended to trigger a tumor-specific systemic&#xD;
      immune response when exposed to tumor antigens liberated by thermal ablation. There is strong&#xD;
      preclinical and early clinical evidence that combining thermal ablation with IP-001 might be&#xD;
      able to turn 'cold' tumors into 'hot' tumors, inducing a systemic immune response. This may&#xD;
      result in shrinkage of the treated tumor, as well as, long-term response mediated by the&#xD;
      patient's immunological defense system against any remaining tumor cells (residual primary&#xD;
      and metastatic tumor cells) including tumor cells outside or distant from the treated area&#xD;
      (also known as abscopal effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will provide information on the safety and tolerability of thermal ablation&#xD;
      followed immediately by an intratumoral IP-001 injection (Ablation + IP-001) in patients with&#xD;
      laser ablation-accessible solid tumors ('all comers', Part 1 - safety run in). Further&#xD;
      information on safety and tolerability, as well as preliminary antitumor activity, will be&#xD;
      evaluated in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (Part 2, Cohort1), whereas in melanoma&#xD;
      patients, anti-tumor activity will be defined as a primary objective (Part 2, Cohort 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial treatment consists of an Ablation + IP-001 in 4-week intervals for up to 6&#xD;
      scheduled treatments. Thermal ablation will be performed according to the instruction of the&#xD;
      medical device, and IP-001 will be administered in different dose levels according to the&#xD;
      trial design. All patients will be followed until progression of disease or until the start&#xD;
      of a subsequent treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite constant progress in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors failing&#xD;
      standard systemic treatment, there is still a high unmet medical need to develop new active&#xD;
      anticancer drugs or therapies. Although patients with advanced melanoma have benefitted&#xD;
      substantially from the new checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, etc., those patients&#xD;
      progressing after such treatment are still in high need of additional treatment options. In&#xD;
      the field of advanced sarcoma, little to no progress has been made in the last years, and&#xD;
      chemotherapy is still standard treatment for these patients. The therapeutic approach taken&#xD;
      by trial SAKK 66/17 is different from those already used in clinical practice and possibly&#xD;
      offers patients a therapeutic benefit after failure of standard chemotherapy and&#xD;
      immunotherapy. There is strong preclinical and early clinical evidence that combining thermal&#xD;
      ablation with IP-001 (1 % N-dihydro-galacto-chitosan, Immunophotonics Inc.) for injection)&#xD;
      might be able to turn 'cold' tumors into 'hot' tumors, inducing a systemic immune response.&#xD;
      This may result in shrinkage of the treated tumor, as well as long-term response mediated by&#xD;
      the patient's immunological defense system against any remaining tumor cells (residual&#xD;
      primary and metastatic tumor cells), including tumor cells outside or distant from the&#xD;
      treated area (also known as abscopal effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Part 1 is to determine the safety and tolerability of thermal&#xD;
      ablation followed immediately by an intratumoral IP-001 injection (Ablation + IP-001) in&#xD;
      patients with laser ablation-accessible solid tumors ('all comers').&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Part 2 - Cohort 1 (soft tissue sarcoma, STS) is to further determine&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of thermal ablation followed immediately by an intratumoral&#xD;
      IP-001 injection (Ablation + IP-001) in the dose established in Part 1 of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Part 2 - Cohort 2 (melanoma) of the trial is to define anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of thermal ablation followed immediately by an intratumoral IP-001 injection&#xD;
      (Ablation + IP-001) utilizing the dose established in Part 1 of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the trial is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to further determine the safety and tolerability of IP-001 (Part 2, Cohort 1 and 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity in STS patients (Part 2, Cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to observe further signs of clinical preliminary anti-tumor activity in patients with&#xD;
           melanoma (Part 2, Cohort 2).&#xD;
