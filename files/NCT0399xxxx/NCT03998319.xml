  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart attacks are caused by a blood clot blocking the blood vessels of the heart, preventing&#xD;
      blood getting to the heart muscle. Opening up the artery with a balloon (angioplasty) and a&#xD;
      small mesh tube (stent) although life saving can cause this clot to break up and get washed&#xD;
      downstream, which can make the heart attack worse. The investigators can measure the amount&#xD;
      of damage caused to the microcirculation by calculating the IMR (Index of Microcirculatory&#xD;
      resistance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This can be measured by a wire in the coronary artery with a pressure sensor at the tip. If&#xD;
      the IMR is elevated, it is suggestive of extensive microcirculatory damage. A clot dissolving&#xD;
      medicine can be administered in the artery to try and reduce the IMR which can reduce damage&#xD;
      to the heart muscle and improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired microcirculatory perfusion in patients as a result of ST-elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (STEMI) is associated with poor clinical outcomes. This project seeks to identify&#xD;
      patients with impaired microcirculatory perfusion after STEMI and to assess whether acute&#xD;
      improvement in microcirculatory perfusion in these patients by the use of intracoronary&#xD;
      thrombolytic therapy results in improved clinical outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to the participating hospitals with a heart attack will be approached to&#xD;
      participate in the study. After angioplasty has been performed, the IMR will be measured in&#xD;
      the infarct related artery. If the IMR is &gt;32 patients will be randomised to receive&#xD;
      intracoronary clot dissolving therapy in the form of low, or very low dose tenecteplase (TNK)&#xD;
      or water as a placebo. Patients who have an IMR â‰¤32 will be followed up in a registry.&#xD;
      Cardiac enzymes will be measured at baseline and discharge. Randomised participants will&#xD;
      receive a cardiac MRI at discharge (3-7 days post primary PCI) and at 6 months post PCI. All&#xD;
      participants will be followed up at 30 days, and 6, 12 and 24 months following discharge.&#xD;
