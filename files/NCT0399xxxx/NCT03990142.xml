  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intradialytic hypotension is a common complication of hemodialysis sessions in patients with&#xD;
      chronic renal failure, with an estimated prevalence of 10 to 30%. This hypotensopn is&#xD;
      classically defined by a decrease in systolic blood pressure greater than 30 mmHg associated&#xD;
      with clinical signs (cramps, abdominal pain, unconsciousness, convulsions). Its repetition is&#xD;
      correlated with cardiovascular events, neurological events and excess mortality. Several&#xD;
      clinical factors have been proposed to predict the risk of intradialytic hypotension such as&#xD;
      age, certain comorbidities (diabetes, ischemic heart disease...), dialysis modalities&#xD;
      (hemodialysis), ultrafiltration, conductivity but also alterations of the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system (especially the sympathetic system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the study of vegetative functions has been facilitated by the use of&#xD;
      SUDOSCAN® (Impeto, Paris, France) which is a simple, non-invasive tool that allows the study&#xD;
      of Chlorine conductance directly reflecting the activity of small non-myelinated C fibers&#xD;
      that innervate the sweat glands. SUDOSCAN® has shown good sensitivity and specificity in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of vegetative damage in diabetic patients and also a good correlation with cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic neuropathy. More recently, SUDOSCAN® has shown good sensitivity in the detection of&#xD;
      neuropathies small fibers especially in diabetic patients. This sensitivity is comparable to&#xD;
      QST-type quantitative tests and the correlation with cardiovascular dysautonomia tests is&#xD;
      good. This test, simple and fast realization, does not require the active participation of&#xD;
      the patient. There is a good correlation between the results of SUDOSCAN® and the reduction&#xD;
      of intra-dermal fiber density at cutaneous biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodialysis patients are at risk of peripheral neurological involvement not only because of&#xD;
      an increasing incidence of diabetes (30-40%) but also because of the abnormal production and&#xD;
      elimination of certain uremic toxins. Few studies exist on the anomalies of the vegetative&#xD;
      system in hemodialysis. A recent publication has suggested a difference in nerve excitability&#xD;
      depending on the type of hemodialysis suggesting nerve changes secondary to ionic changes.&#xD;
      The identification of patients at risk of intradialytic hypotension during dialysis sessions&#xD;
      could be useful for adapting hemodialysis protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be classified into 2 groups according to the occurrence of intradialytic&#xD;
      hypotension. Group 1 corresponds to patients with intradialytic hypotension and group 2&#xD;
      corresponds to patients without intradialytic hypotension.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be classified into 2 groups according to the occurrence of intradialytic hypotension which is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure greater than 30 mmHg associated with clinical signs (cramps, abdominal pain, unconsciousness, convulsions). Group 1 corresponds to patients with intradialytic hypotension and group 2 corresponds to patients without intradialytic hypotension. This study aims to measure the cutaneous conductance to chlorine by SUDOSCAN® in all dialysis patients and to seek a link between the results of this examination and the occurrence of discomfort during hemodialysis sessions.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The additional examination, related to this research protocol, corresponds to a record of cutaneous conductance with chlorine. This recording of 2 min 30 is done thanks to SUDOSCAN® within 30 minutes before the dialysis session (before the &quot;connection&quot; to the dialysis machine) and within 30 minutes after the end of the dialysis with a measurement of the tension blood pressure and heart rate immediately before SUDOSCAN®.</description>
