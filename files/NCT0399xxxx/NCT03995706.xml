      Single center, non-randomized, Phase 0 study. Sacituzumab Govitecan given preoperatively,&#xD;
      followed by craniotomy with surgery or biopsy of brain tumors (GBM and metastatic brain&#xD;
      tumors from Breast) and intraoperative tissue collection will follow with contemporaneous CSF&#xD;
      (depending on tumor location) and whole blood (serum) sampling.&#xD;

    <description>Sacituzumab Govitecan treatment will be initiated with a 10mg/kg standard dose without any dose escalation on day-1, prior to surgery. Sacituzumab govitecan and will continue to be administered by IV infusion over 3 hours on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle post-operatively until progression.</description>

    <description>All 20 subjects will receive study drug Sacituzumab Govitecan preoperatively. Intraoperative tissue collection will follow with contemporaneous CSF (depending on tumor location) and whole blood (serum) sampling. Samples will be tested for total SN-38and free SN-38, as well as SN-38G. Following recovery from surgery, patients will resume treatment</description>
