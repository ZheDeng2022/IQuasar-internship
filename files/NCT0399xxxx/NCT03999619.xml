  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Move 2 Learn (M2L) is a 10-week movement and pre-literacy program for preschool aged children&#xD;
      and their parents designed to improve both movement and reading skills as well as support&#xD;
      their overall cognitive, physical, and psychological development. This study will be using a&#xD;
      randomized wait-list controlled trial design to evaluate the program on several outcomes:&#xD;
      motor skills, pre-literacy skills, cognitive function, perceived physical competence, and&#xD;
      physical activity. Children ages 3 to 4 years with typical development will be randomized to&#xD;
      either start the program immediately or enter the wait-list control group to begin the&#xD;
      program after a 10-week control period. The outcomes will be assessed for all children three&#xD;
      times, at week 0, week 11, and week 21 to evaluate change over time in both groups.&#xD;

      Design: The study will use a randomized wait-list controlled design. Children will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the intervention arm or the wait-list control arm with a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Children randomized to the intervention arm will enter the Move 2 Learn (M2L) intervention&#xD;
      during the first 10-12 weeks of the study period; children randomized to the wait-list&#xD;
      control arm will not receive any intervention during the first 10-12 weeks of the study (the&#xD;
      wait-list control period), then will enter into a modified M2L intervention during the second&#xD;
      10 to 12 weeks of the study. All children will be assessed 3 times at 10-12-week intervals.&#xD;
      The intervention arm will be assessed before and immediately after they receive the&#xD;
      intervention, and at a 10-12-week follow-up. The wait-list control group will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, immediately before receiving the intervention (10-12 weeks following) and after&#xD;
      they receive the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be randomized 1:1 to either the intervention or wait-list control group. Simple&#xD;
      randomization will be completed using a computer algorithm. After confirming eligibility and&#xD;
      obtaining verbal consent, a research assistant will send the complete list of study IDs to an&#xD;
      independent biostatistician who will use a computer algorithm to randomly assign the child to&#xD;
      the intervention or to the wait-list control group. Sealed, opaque, and numbered envelops&#xD;
      will be prepared with their allocation details (e.g. if randomized to the intervention arm,&#xD;
      information regarding the location and time of the intervention will be provided).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The Move 2 Learn (M2L) program (both the original and the modified program)&#xD;
      will be run out of the gym space provided in-kind by the Faculty of Kinesiology and Physical&#xD;
      Education at the University of Toronto. This behavioral program will run for 60 minutes once&#xD;
      per week for 10 consecutive weeks and will consist of three components: direct movement skill&#xD;
      instruction, unstructured exploratory free-play, and in interactive storybook reading&#xD;
      activity. There is active involvement of at least one parent/caregiver in the direct&#xD;
      instruction and reading components and parents/caregivers are provided with handouts&#xD;
      outlining specific strategies to implement for at-home practice of the activities. Each week,&#xD;
      parents will be verbally encouraged to practice these skills at home with their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants randomized to the wait-list control group will not receive any intervention&#xD;
      during the control period (between time 1 and time 2 assessments. After their time 2&#xD;
      assessment is complete, participants will receive a modified version of the M2L program. All&#xD;
      in-sessions components of the M2L program will be implemented with the exception of the&#xD;
      parent handouts and the verbal encouragement to practice at-home between sessions&#xD;
      Assessments: At the time 1 appointment, children will be administered the gross motor&#xD;
      subscales of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 (PDMS-2; Folio &amp; Fewell, 2000), the&#xD;
      perceived physical competence subscale of the Pictorial Scale (PPC) of Perceived Competence&#xD;
      and Social Acceptance for Young Children-Preschool-Kindergarten version (PSCS-PK; Harter &amp;&#xD;
      Pike, 1984), the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening: Preschool (PALS-PK; Invernizzi,&#xD;
      Sullivan, Meier, &amp; Swank, 2004), the Preschool Word and Print Awareness Test (PWPA; Justice &amp;&#xD;
      Ezell, 2002), and the Picture Deletion Task for Preschoolers (PDTP; Byrne, DeWolfe, &amp; Bawden,&#xD;
      1998; Corkum, Byrne, &amp; Ellsworth, 1995). Parents will complete a demographic questionnaire&#xD;
      (see Demographic Survey for Parents), and a parental engagement questionnaire that asks about&#xD;
      the use of specific activities to promote motor skill and early literacy skill development&#xD;
      (see Parental Engagement Survey) and the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive&#xD;
      Function®-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P; Gioia, Espy, &amp; Isquith, 2001). On completion of&#xD;
      testing, children will be fitted with an accelerometer; parents will be instructed on its&#xD;
      proper use and provided with a diary to track wear time (e.g., time of day put on, time of&#xD;
      day removed). After 7 days, parents will mail back the the accelerometer(s) and diary (see&#xD;
      Accelerometer Log). At each subsequent appointment (time 2 and time 3), all outcomes&#xD;
      described above will be measured again (see Figure 2) except for the parent demographic&#xD;
      survey and the BRIEF-P. Each study appointment will take approximately 1.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcomes will be assessed at the INfant and Child Health (INCH) Lab at the University of&#xD;
      Toronto by trained graduate students, blind to the intervention status of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: The primary outcomes include fundamental movement skills and pre-literacy skills.&#xD;
      Movement skills will be assessed using the gross motor sub-scales of the Peabody&#xD;
      Developmental Motor Scales - 2 (PDMS-2). The Preschool Word and Print Awareness Test (PWPA)&#xD;
      and the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening: Preschool (PALS-PK) to measure&#xD;
      print-concept knowledge and alphabet knowledge, respectively. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      physical activity, cognitive function, and self-perceived physical competence. All outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed at the INfant and Child Health (INCH) Lab at the University of Toronto by&#xD;
      trained graduate students, blind to the intervention status of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor Skill Proficiency: The gross motor subscales of the PDMS-2 (stationary performances,&#xD;
      locomotion, and object manipulation) will be used to assess change in motor skill over the&#xD;
      course of the study and will be administered by a trained graduate student blind to the&#xD;
      intervention status of the participant. This tool is commercially available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-literacy Skills: Emergent literacy skills that will be measured include print concepts&#xD;
      and alphabet knowledge. The PALS-PK Upper-case Alphabet Recognition task will be used to&#xD;
      measure children's alphabet knowledge. This tool is commercially available. Print awareness&#xD;
      will be assessed using the PWPA. The assessment uses an interactive story book reading&#xD;
      activity to test children on their knowledge of 14 print concepts, such as print&#xD;
      directionality and print function (Justice &amp; Ezell, 2002). This tool is freely available as&#xD;
      it was published as an appendix in the Justice, Bowles, &amp; Skibbe, 2006 article.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity: Accelerometry is an objective method of assessing free-moving physical&#xD;
      activity, and is the method best-suited to measuring activity in young children. This study&#xD;
      will use the Actigraph GT3X activity monitor, a light (27g) and small (3.8cm × 3.7cm × 1.8cm)&#xD;
      device, secured to the child by a belt worn around the waist. A 3 s epoch will be used&#xD;
      (Obeid, Nguyen, Gabel, &amp; Timmons, 2011) and will record physical activity for 7 consecutive&#xD;
      days (Trost, Pate, Freedson, Sallis, &amp; Taylor, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Executive Function: The BRIEF-P, a parent-report tool, will be used to assess children's&#xD;
      trait executive function at week 0 (Sherman &amp; Brooks, 2010). State executive function will be&#xD;
      assessed using the Attention Sustained subtest 6 of the Leiter-3 test battery. The task&#xD;
      requires children to view a target image (an animal) and identify the images that match among&#xD;
      a set of distractor images as quickly as possible; there are 4 trials, each of which have a&#xD;
      practice set. This tool is commercially available. To assess inhibition, the Head Toes Knees&#xD;
      and Shoulders instrument will also be administered. This task requires Children are to play a&#xD;
      game in which they must do the opposite of what the experimenter says. The experimenter&#xD;
      instructs children to touch their head (or their toes), but instead of following the command,&#xD;
      the children are supposed to do the opposite and touch their toes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived Physical Competence: The PSCS-PK will be used to assess each child's level of&#xD;
      perceived competence. There are physical competence subscale (6-items) will be administered.&#xD;
      The scale is an extension of Harter's Perceived Competence Scale for Children (1982). This&#xD;
      tool is freely available online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic Factors: The baseline questionnaire will include questions about the parent and&#xD;
      the child on age, gender, race/ethnicity, parental education and occupation, and household&#xD;
      income. The questionnaire will be parent-completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental Engagement: Parents will be asked about the use and the frequency of use, of&#xD;
      specific activities that will be employed in our program. A parent-reported questionnaire&#xD;
      specific to these activities has been created to determine if parents have been using these&#xD;
      strategies before our program, and if they have incorporated them into their activities with&#xD;
      their child after having completed the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental Acceptability: Consenting parents will engage in a focus group, led by a&#xD;
      facilitator. Staying consistent with the unstructured nature of a focus group, open-ended&#xD;
      questions designed to initiate discussions surrounding their attitudes and opinions, likes&#xD;
      and dislikes of the program will be asked. The discussion will be audio recorded and&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim. Focus group transcriptions will be used to revise the program and its&#xD;
      components to better serve the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Basic descriptive statistics of participating children and parents will be&#xD;
      completed. Mixed effects models will be used to assess a group-by-time effect on all&#xD;
      outcomes. All analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat basis.&#xD;
