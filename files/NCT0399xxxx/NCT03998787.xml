  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. Several&#xD;
      scientific pieces of evidence, based on the use of kinematic techniques, have allowed&#xD;
      quantifying objectively the alterations of the voluntary movement in the different stages of&#xD;
      the disease. In recent years, several studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&#xD;
      techniques, have also shown abnormalities in neurophysiological parameters of the primary&#xD;
      motor cortex (M1) in patients with MP, in particular, a reduction in cortical excitability&#xD;
      and synaptic plasticity of M1. In addition to the central role played by a dopaminergic&#xD;
      deficit in MP, recent evidence suggests a possible involvement of the neurotransmitter&#xD;
      glutamatergic system. In the present monocentric observational study, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to assess possible correlations between polymorphisms of metabotropic glutamate type&#xD;
      3 receptors (mGlu3), clinical evaluation scales, alterations of kinematic motion parameters&#xD;
      and neurophysiological parameters of M1.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In recent years, numerous neurophysiological studies have characterized the alterations of&#xD;
      voluntary movement and the pathophysiological mechanisms of MP. Kinematic studies have shown&#xD;
      that in addition to bradykinesia, which literally means slowing of movement, voluntary&#xD;
      movements in PD are characterized by reduced amplitude (hypokinesia), altered rhythmicity&#xD;
      (dysrhythmia) and progressive decrease in amplitude and speed during the execution of&#xD;
      repetitive movements (sequence effect). Recent evidence also suggests that the&#xD;
      characteristics of voluntary movement can vary in the various stages of PD, it has been&#xD;
      observed, for example, that in early stages of disease, i.e. in newly diagnosed patients not&#xD;
      previously treated with dopaminergic drugs repetitive finger-tapping movements are&#xD;
      characterized by reduced amplitude and speed and the effect sequence, without significant&#xD;
      changes in the rhythm of movement. In the advanced stages of PD, movement is characterized by&#xD;
      a marked decrease in amplitude and velocity and by an altered rhythm of movement but not by&#xD;
      the sequence effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS is a neurophysiological technique that allows the non-invasive study of different&#xD;
      physiological mechanisms of M1 in humans. Stimulation, delivered in single stimuli, allows&#xD;
      for example to evaluate neurophysiological parameters such as motor thresholds, the amplitude&#xD;
      of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and the so-called input-output recruitment curve of MEPs,&#xD;
      i.e. parameters that reflect the overall excitability of the corticospinal system. TMS&#xD;
      delivered in pairs of magnetic stimuli allows additional parameters to be evaluated, such as&#xD;
      intracortical inhibition at short intervals (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF), i.e.&#xD;
      parameters that reflect the excitability of inhibitory and facilitator cortical interneurons.&#xD;
      In recent years, further protocols have been developed using the repetitive stimulation of M1&#xD;
      to induce lasting changes in the amplitude of MEPs that are thought to reflect the mechanisms&#xD;
      of synaptic plasticity, similar to similar phenomena observed in the experimental animal. In&#xD;
      particular, the technique of associative stimulation (PAS), is based on percutaneous&#xD;
      electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerve and concomitant stimulation of M1 by TMS at&#xD;
      certain inter-stimulation intervals (25ms or 10ms) to induce lasting changes, in a&#xD;
      facilitatory or inhibitory sense, in the amplitude of MEPs. Numerous TMS studies have been&#xD;
      performed in PD patients in recent years. Among the main results observed are altered&#xD;
      excitability of M1, especially a reduced SICI and reduced synaptic plasticity, tested with&#xD;
      the PAS technique or other methods. Recently, we have also observed that some alterations of&#xD;
      excitability and plasticity of M1 correlate with specific kinematic alterations of movement&#xD;
      in PD patients, suggesting therefore that neurophysiological changes of M1 contribute to the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of bradykinesia. In addition to the central role played by a dopaminergic&#xD;
      deficit in MP, recent evidence suggests a possible involvement of the neurotransmitter&#xD;
      glutamatergic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have observed relationships between the reduced cortical inhibition and&#xD;
      reduced synaptic plasticity of M1 and the overall severity of PD evaluated with standardized&#xD;
      clinical scales and kinematic motion analysis techniques. In the present study, we will&#xD;
      relate metabotropic type 3 glutamate receptor polymorphisms (mGlu3) to the severity of motor&#xD;
      and non-motor symptoms, cortical plasticity and other neurophysiological parameters in&#xD;
      patients with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous observations obtained in our laboratory have shown that the kinematic study in PD is&#xD;
      a valid technique for objectively documenting various alterations of voluntary movement,&#xD;
      including bradykinesia, hypokinesia, altered rhythmicity, and sequence effect. These&#xD;
      characteristics may change at various stages of PD. For example, it has been observed that in&#xD;
      the early stages of illness, repetitive finger movements are characterized by reduced&#xD;
      amplitude and speed and by the sequence effect, without significant alterations in the rhythm&#xD;
      of the movement. In the advanced stages of PD, movement is characterized by a marked decrease&#xD;
      in amplitude and velocity and an altered rhythm of movement but not by the sequence effect.&#xD;
      Kinematic studies in patients with PD have also made it possible to objectively quantify the&#xD;
      effects of dopaminergic replacement therapy on the various alterations that characterize the&#xD;
      PD. The objective effects of dopaminergic therapy on the various alterations of voluntary&#xD;
      movement, quantified by kinematic studies, are variable. In particular, it has been&#xD;
      repeatedly observed that the sequencing effect in patients with PD does not improve&#xD;
      significantly following the administration of dopaminergic drugs. Previous observations&#xD;
      obtained in TMS studies have also demonstrated altered M1 excitability in patients with PD,&#xD;
      including for example reduced SICI and reduced synaptic plasticity, tested with the PAS&#xD;
      technique or other methods. In some cases, it has been observed that the administration of&#xD;
      dopaminergic drugs is able to normalize the alterations of neurophysiological parameters of&#xD;
      M1 in PD, the results are however variable. Recently, we have observed that some alterations&#xD;
      of excitability and plasticity of M1 correlate with specific kinematic alterations of&#xD;
      movement in PD patients, suggesting therefore that neurophysiological changes of M1&#xD;
      contribute to the pathophysiology of bradykinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present monocentric observational study, the investigators propose to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) To carry out an accurate characterization of the alterations of the voluntary movement in&#xD;
      patients with PD through the use of standardized clinical scales and a computerized system&#xD;
      for the objective analysis of the voluntary movement and a detailed study of possible&#xD;
      neurophysiological alterations of M1 in patients with PD, through the use of TMS techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Evaluate metabotropic type 3 glutamate receptor polymorphisms (mGlu3) in PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Investigate possible correlations between type 3 metabotropic glutamate receptor&#xD;
      polymorphisms (mGlu3), clinical evaluation scales, alterations of kinematic motion parameters&#xD;
      and neurophysiological parameters of M1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN The study involves the recruitment of 20 PD patients,&#xD;
      diagnosed according to current clinical criteria and 20 healthy control subjects. Patients&#xD;
      with motor fluctuations and dyskinesia will be excluded. Recruitment of patients and control&#xD;
      subjects will be carried out at the IRCCS NEUROMED Institute, Pozzilli (IS). All PD patients&#xD;
      will undergo blood sampling to assess metabotropic glutamate type 3 (mGlu3) receptor&#xD;
      polymorphisms All study participants will give informed consent to the experimental&#xD;
      procedures, which will be approved by the local ethics committee and conducted in accordance&#xD;
      with the Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized clinical scales and a computerized system for objective analysis of voluntary&#xD;
      movement will be used to characterize alterations of voluntary movement in PD patients. With&#xD;
      this system, the movements of the upper limb will be examined, following the instructions&#xD;
      dictated by the scale most widely used today in the clinical environment, namely the new&#xD;
      version of the UPDRS, promoted by the Movement Disorder Society. The repetitive movements of&#xD;
      the fingers will be examined by inviting the patient to tap his index finger on his thumb.&#xD;
      For each test, the movements shall be made for 15 seconds in succession. Three recordings&#xD;
      will be made for each movement. Participants will be encouraged to make the movements as fast&#xD;
      and as wide as possible. The movements will be analyzed at the most affected side. The&#xD;
      computerized analysis system will allow to objectively extrapolate the parameters related to&#xD;
      speed, amplitude, the rhythm of the movement and effect-sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of neurophysiological alterations of M1 will be carried out by means of the TMS&#xD;
      technique. Ejecting single magnetic stimuli, a measurement of parameters reflecting the&#xD;
      excitability of the corticospinal pathway will be carried out, i.e. the measurement of motor&#xD;
      thresholds and of the input-output recruitment curve. By delivering magnetic stimuli in&#xD;
      pairs, according to a condition-test paradigm, at inter-stimulus intervals fixed at 2-4-10&#xD;
      and 15ms parameters reflecting the excitability of intracortical circuits of inhibitory&#xD;
      (SICI) and facilitatory (ICF) type will be measured. Finally, the PAS technique will be used&#xD;
      to study the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity of M1. PAS uses joint peripheral nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (percutaneous electrical stimulation) and M1 (TMS) at an inter-stimulation&#xD;
      interval fixed at 25ms. During the PAS technique, 225 stimuli are delivered globally, at a&#xD;
      frequency of 0.4 Hz and for a total duration of 15 minutes of stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PD will be studied in a single experimental session, at least twelve hours&#xD;
      after the suspension of dopaminergic drugs (OFF session). Healthy control subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated in a single experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEANING AND INNOVATION The main innovative aspect of the study is the integrated approach&#xD;
      that involves the use of both techniques of kinematic analysis of movement, and techniques of&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation. The present work could, therefore, allow to deepen the&#xD;
      current knowledge and to obtain advancement in terms of understanding the pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying the altered motor control in patients with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EQUIPMENT AND RESOURCES The study will be carried out at the IRCCS NEUROMED Institute,&#xD;
      Pozzilli (IS). The institute has the material to conduct the study and in particular: the&#xD;
      optoelectronic system of infrared cameras (sampling rate, 120Hz), (SMART motion system, BTS&#xD;
      Engineering, Milan, Italy) for kinematic evaluation; the dedicated software for kinematic&#xD;
      data analysis (SMART Analyzer, BTS Engineering, Milan, ltaly); two Magstim magnetic&#xD;
      stimulators (Magstim Company, Withland, UK) for single and double stimulation magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation and one DS7 Digitimer electric simulator (Digitimer, UK) for PAS stimulation; one&#xD;
      D 360 Digitimer amplifier (Digitimer, UK) and one AD 1401 plus analogue-to-digital converter&#xD;
      (Cambridge Electronic Design, UK) for recording the electromyographic signal; one dedicated&#xD;
      software (Signal® version 4.00, Cambridge Electronic Design, UK) for off-line analysis of the&#xD;
      electromyographic signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE OF THE STUDY The results of the study could be useful for a better&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms, and in particular of the involvement of&#xD;
      M1, at the basis of the alterations of voluntary movement in MP. The results of the study&#xD;
      could also be useful in developing possible treatments, based on the use of subtype-selective&#xD;
      agonists and positive allosteric modulators of metabotropic glutamate type 3 receptors&#xD;
      (mGlu3).&#xD;
