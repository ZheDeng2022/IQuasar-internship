    <textblock>
      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. In order to&#xD;
      report the efficacy and safety of glycyrrhetinic acid combining with high-dose dexamethasone&#xD;
      for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).&#xD;

      The investigators anticipate to undertaking a parallel group, single-centre, randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial of 30 ITP adult patients. One part of the participants are randomly selected&#xD;
      to receive glycyrrhetinic acid (given compound glycyrrhizin tablets orally at a dose of 225mg&#xD;
      per day for 1 month), combining with dexamethasone (given orally at a dose of 40 mg per day&#xD;
      for 4 days, two-cycles with an interval of 10 days); the others are selected to receive&#xD;
      high-dose of dexamethasone treatment plus placebo. Platelet count, bleeding and other&#xD;
      symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded&#xD;
      throughout the study. In order to report the efficacy and safety of glycyrrhetinic acid&#xD;
      combining with high-dose dexamethasone therapy for the treatment of adults with ITP.&#xD;
