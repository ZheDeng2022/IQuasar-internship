    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe antibody persistence for each of the 4 dengue&#xD;
      serotypes for up to 45 months after the first vaccination in the primary vaccination series&#xD;
      for participants from parent trial DEN-315 (NCT03341637) (Mexico) and for up to 36 months&#xD;
      after the first vaccination in the primary vaccination series for participants from parent&#xD;
      trial DEN-304 (NCT03423173) (United States [US]) and to describe the impact of a tetravalent&#xD;
      dengue vaccine (TDV) booster dose vs placebo on antibody response for each of the 4 dengue&#xD;
      serotypes at 1 month and 6 months post administration of the TDV booster or placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine tested in this study is Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV). This&#xD;
      study will look at the long-term antibody persistence and safety of Takeda's TDV in healthy&#xD;
      adolescents and adults and will assess the impact of a booster dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has enrolled 365 healthy participants. Participants who previously received TDV in&#xD;
      two parent trials (DEN-304 [NCT03423173] and DEN-315 [NCT03341637]), will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in this follow-up trial. Participants will be assessed for antibody persistence&#xD;
      and safety from Baseline (Month 0) through Month 15 (for participants from parent trial&#xD;
      DEN-304 [US]) or Month 24 (for participants from parent trial DEN-315 [Mexico]). At Month 15&#xD;
      (for participants from parent trial DEN-304 [US]) or at Month 24 (for participants from&#xD;
      parent trial DEN-315 [Mexico]), eligible participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to one&#xD;
      of two trial groups to receive TDV or placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1- TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous (SC) injection at Month 15 for participants from parent&#xD;
           trial DEN-304 (US) or at Month 24 for participants from parent trial DEN-315 (Mexico]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2- Takeda's tetravalent dengue placebo (dummy SC injection - this is a liquid that&#xD;
           looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient), 0.5 mL, subcutaneous injection&#xD;
           at Month 15 for participants from parent trial DEN-304 (US) or at Month 24 for&#xD;
           participants from parent trial DEN-315 (Mexico).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in US and Mexico. The overall time to participate&#xD;
      in this study is up to 21 months for parent trial DEN-304 (US) and up to 30 months for parent&#xD;
      trial DEN-315 (Mexico). Participants from parent trial DEN-304 (US) and participants from&#xD;
      parent trial DEN-315 (Mexico) will make 5 visits and 6 visits, respectively, to the clinic&#xD;
      including a final visit 6 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
