      This proposal will investigate the wound condition between different drainage methods of the&#xD;
      stoma closure wound. Anastomotic leakage is a major complication after colorectal surgery.&#xD;
      The protective stoma will decrease the anastomosis leakage rate and severity1. Stoma closure&#xD;
      is often performed after the condition of the previous protecting site improved. Wound&#xD;
      infection is not a rare complication after stoma closure, with a reported infectious rate&#xD;
      from 3% to 43%. Wound infection will result in wound dehiscence, incisional herniation, ileus&#xD;
      and the length of hospital stay. Lots of the stoma wound closure technique have been&#xD;
      developed, including subcutaneous antibiotic material implantation, wound irrigation with&#xD;
      iodine, closure wound with a drain tube, secondary closure, delayed primary closure and&#xD;
      pursestring closure. But there still is in a debate about the best skin closure test. In&#xD;
      Division of Colorectal Surgery Shuang Ho Hospital, two current stoma wound closure methods&#xD;
      were subcutaneous Jackson-Pratt drainage and cutaneous Penrose drainage insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the project, clinical outcomes of these two drainage methods will be compared. The&#xD;
      subcutaneous. Jackson-Pratt drainage is used to create negative pressure in subcutaneous&#xD;
      closure wound. The negative pressure will extract actively the tissue debris and fluid,&#xD;
      avoiding the seroma and pus accumulation. The cutaneous Penrose drainage is used to create&#xD;
      delayed skin healing, and the tissue debris and fluid will drainage passive by capillary&#xD;
      phenomenon. Two groups will be distributed randomly. The demographic characters like age,&#xD;
      gender, BMI, nutritional status, under chemotherapy, diabetes and past medication history&#xD;
      will be reviewed. Perioperative clinical data like the method of the anastomosis, operation&#xD;
      time, postoperative hospital day, surgical site infection, prolonged ileus, anastomosis&#xD;
      leakage, and incisional hernia will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this study, these two stoma wound closure methods will be evaluated and analyze the risk&#xD;
      factors of complication for the stoma wound closure.&#xD;
