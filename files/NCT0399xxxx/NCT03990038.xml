  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The improvement of postoperative analgesia is an important issue in orthopedic surgery,&#xD;
      especially after total knee arthroplasty The use of a peripheral nerve block such as the&#xD;
      adductor canal block is favored since it offers a postoperative analgesia superior to&#xD;
      opioids, and also preserves the strength of the quadriceps, as opposed to the femoral block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adductor canal block can be given as a single injection (single shot) or a continuous&#xD;
      perineural infusion to extend the block's analgesic duration. It is unclear if the continuous&#xD;
      infusion is superior to the single shot. Indeed, a high catheter dislodgement rate is&#xD;
      observed for this location and local anesthetics could migrate into the femoral canal,&#xD;
      resulting in quadriceps weakness. Alternatively, adequate postoperative analgesia has been&#xD;
      shown effective with a single shot adductor canal block combined with extended release&#xD;
      opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective in this study is to compare two analgesic protocols on the pain score&#xD;
      at walk 24 hours after total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here are the two protocols compared :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adductor canal block followed by continuous perineural perfusion for 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adductor canal block (single shot) followed by hydromorphone extended release&#xD;
           formulation for 48 hours In addition to analgesic adjuvants administered in both groups&#xD;
           : acetaminophen, celecoxib, pregabalin, dexamethasone and periarticular infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that both protocols ensure a similar analgesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The improvement of postoperative analgesia is an important issue in orthopedic surgery,&#xD;
      especially after total knee arthroplasty. The early postoperative mobilization of these&#xD;
      patients is crucial to ensure a favorable functional evolution, and this goal can't be&#xD;
      accomplished without effective analgesia. Opioids offer an efficient pain relief, but their&#xD;
      consumption can result in side effects that can increase the length of hospital stay. The use&#xD;
      of a peripheral nerve block, such as the adductor canal block (BCA) is a widely favored&#xD;
      alternative since it allows postoperative analgesia superior to opioids while preserving the&#xD;
      strength of the quadriceps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a long period of time, the femoral block has been the most popular peripheral nerve block&#xD;
      for patients after a knee arthroplasty. However, this perineural block is associated with an&#xD;
      important rate of quadriceps' weakness, which could impair the post-operative mobilization&#xD;
      and expose the patient to a risk of falling. It has now been widely replaced by the adductor&#xD;
      canal block. The latter has the advantage of providing analgesia at rest and during movement&#xD;
      equivalent to the femoral block, while preserving the quadriceps strength and offering a&#xD;
      better mobility in the first 24 hours after surgery. In opposition to the femoral block, the&#xD;
      adductor canal block does not increase the risk of falling since it is mainly a sensitive&#xD;
      block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adductor canal block is an advantageous analgesic modality for patients after TKA, but it&#xD;
      is limited since it offers only analgesia to the anteromedial aspect of the knee, sparing the&#xD;
      lateral and posterior faces. It is common to combine this block with a periarticular knee&#xD;
      infiltration with local anesthetics, performed by the surgical team at the end of the&#xD;
      surgery. The two modalities combined make it possible to achieve very low pains scores at&#xD;
      rest and during walking, compared to both techniques used separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adductor canal block can be administered in one unique injection or with a perineural&#xD;
      continuous infusion, to extend the block's analgesic duration. However, it is uncertain&#xD;
      whether there is an advantage to use a continuous infusion. There is a significant rate of&#xD;
      catheter migrating out of the adductor canal and losing effect. There is also the possibility&#xD;
      that the continuous infusion results in a proximal extent of local anesthetic in the femoral&#xD;
      canal, generating quadriceps weakness that invalidates the benefits for ACB in the context of&#xD;
      postoperative mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, the location of the catheter near the surgical site predisposes it to be dislodged&#xD;
      out of the adductor canal during surgical manipulations in a significant proportion of&#xD;
      patients. A rate as high as 30% of catheter dislodgement on postoperative day 1 was observed.&#xD;
      It is possible to perform the block after surgery, before the dressing is applied, but this&#xD;
      practice tends to create delays, which are not desirable in the actual context of&#xD;
      optimization of the OR time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, perineural catheters require a strict surveillance by a specialized team and&#xD;
      could interfere with patient mobilization because of the restriction associated with the&#xD;
      equipment involved. It is reasonable to think that the absence of a catheter and an infusion&#xD;
      pump offers an easier mobilization, although this has not been validated in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, continuous infusions increase the cumulative dose of local anesthetics that the&#xD;
      patients is exposed to. In order to reduce the toxicity risk, it is necessary to reduce the&#xD;
      periarticular infiltration doses, which could impair the quality of analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, it has been demonstrated that adequate post-operative analgesia could be&#xD;
      obtained with an adductor canal block, combined with extended release opioids. Several&#xD;
      clinical trials involving patients after total knee arthroplasty have shown that there is a&#xD;
      benefit to using extended release opioids added to a multimodal analgesia protocol. Their&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile ensures a more constant analgesia, while offering a safety profile&#xD;
      similar to immediate release opioids, a lesser risk of respiratory depression and overdose.&#xD;
      The usage of extended release opioids after TKA is justified since patients accuse moderate&#xD;
      to severe pain during the first days after surgery, despite the use of a multimodal analgesia&#xD;
      protocol and sustained consumption of immediate release opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two protocols have not been compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, there is a consensus that postoperative analgesia in patients after TKA should&#xD;
      be addressed with a multimodal analgesia protocol that includes a perineural block and&#xD;
      analgesic adjuvants. However, the optimal composition of this protocol is not well defined.&#xD;
      In our hospital center, the postoperative analgesia protocol for TKA includes a continuous&#xD;
      adductor canal block for 48 hours, intravenous dexamethasone, periarticular infiltration of&#xD;
      the posterior capsule by the surgeon and analgesic adjuvants such as acetaminophen, celecoxib&#xD;
      and pregabalin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcome and hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective in this study is to compare two analgesic protocols on the pain score&#xD;
      while walking 24 hours after total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here are the two protocols compared :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adductor canal block followed by continuous perineural perfusion for 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adductor canal block (single shot) followed by hydromorphone extended release&#xD;
           formulation for 48 hours In addition to analgesic adjuvants administered in both groups&#xD;
           : acetaminophen, celecoxib, pregabalin, dexamethasone and periarticular infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that both protocols ensure a similar analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary issues are the proportion of patient that achieve a pain score at walk &lt; 4, the&#xD;
      time for the 10 m walk test, the incidence of drowsiness, nausea and vomiting and the&#xD;
      postoperative opioid use at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is relevant since it aims to answer a frequently asked question in&#xD;
      clinical practice, and its outcome will have a direct impact on the anesthetic practice. In&#xD;
      addition, it aims to improve early postoperative mobilization with acceptable pain, which is&#xD;
      important after orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
