      Abstract Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) refers to different degrees of glucose&#xD;
      intolerance or impaired glucose tolerance,which are commonly found on non-diabetic persons&#xD;
      during pregnancy.GDM is an important public health issue that has a huge impact on children's&#xD;
      health.According to statistics,the global occurrence of GDM in 2017 was as high as 16.2%.As&#xD;
      well as lifestyle changes that are leading to an increased number of women with&#xD;
      overweightness and obesity,the increasing number of&quot;older mothers&quot;responding to the&#xD;
      second-child policy are raising up the percentile of GDM by the year.infancy and pre-school&#xD;
      age are the important stages of physical growth and psychomotor development.At present,there&#xD;
      are few domestic and International studies on the impact of GDM on the health of children,and&#xD;
      the conclusions are not the same.There is a lack of long-term follow-up and Chinese samples.&#xD;
      This study focuses on the current new hotspot in the research of the children's health&#xD;
      problems, based on the 1000-day life concept and theory of DOHaD. Prospective cohort study&#xD;
      methods and real-world studies were used. To study and clarify the effect of GDM on the&#xD;
      neuropsychological development and physical growth indicators of children in China, and&#xD;
      further explore the possible mechanism of action and the related indicators of predictive&#xD;
      value, looking for possible early intervention targets. The results are expected to expand&#xD;
      the data sources of this type of research in China, improve the data quality and clarify the&#xD;
      characteristics of this type of population in China, and provide data support for the&#xD;
      revision of maternal and child health related policies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to statistics, the occurrence of GDM in 2017 of China was roughly 14.8%. A&#xD;
           preliminary test performed by the obstetrics outpatient department of the First People's&#xD;
           Hospital of Chongqing Liangjiang New Area, China (Project partner) revels that the GDM&#xD;
           percentile was 17.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is currently believed that GDM can affect the perinatal health of next generation&#xD;
           including &quot;giant children&quot;. Recently, the impact of GDM on the health of children in&#xD;
           childhood has become a research hot spot. GDM is an important public health issue that&#xD;
           has a huge impact on children's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
           &quot;1000 days in the early life&quot; refers to the period from the combination of sperm and egg&#xD;
           to the second year of life, which has a profound impact on children's growth and&#xD;
           development and adulthood health and even the health of their children. Children at this&#xD;
           age are in the window period of interaction between genetics and environmental factors,&#xD;
           and yet, are also in the &quot;opportunity window&quot; of epigenetic regulation. The disease and&#xD;
           nutrition of pregnant mothers will greatly affect the growth and development of children&#xD;
           in the first 1000 days of their lives, as well as the long-term health of the children&#xD;
           and that of the children's children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           International studies have shown that the children of GDM mothers may have abnormalities&#xD;
           in nervous system development, including cognitive memory impairment and bradykinesia.&#xD;
           Recent studies have found that GDM diagnosed before 26 weeks of gestation can increase&#xD;
           the risk of autism spectrum disorders in the 18-24-month-old children, and GDM treatment&#xD;
           cannot reduce the risk. A study in Spain found that GDM significantly reduced test&#xD;
           scores for language and gross motor development in 18 months old children(P&lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The mechanism of GDM on the development of children psychomotor development is more&#xD;
           complicated. Studies have shown that the middle and late pregnancy is an important stage&#xD;
           of nervous system development. chronic hypoxia in GDM fetuses prompts the body to&#xD;
           mobilize iron from other tissues, including the brain, to produce sufficient hemoglobin&#xD;
           for oxygen. Iron is involved in the differentiation of neurons in the brain, the&#xD;
           synthesis and decomposition of neurotransmitters and the myelin sheath of the brain,&#xD;
           etc. Iron deficiency in the brain can lead to changes in the structure and function of&#xD;
           the hippocampus and striatum, thus affecting the development of sensation, movement,&#xD;
           emotion, learning, memory and behavior. Currently considered, Some indicators of blood&#xD;
           routine can comprehensively reflect the iron storage in the body. Iron deficiency in&#xD;
           developing children causes irreparable damage to cognitive and memory functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Researchers believe that GDM during pregnancy affects children's iron metabolism,&#xD;
           thereby increasing the risk of impaired neuropsychological development such as cognitive&#xD;
           memory and exercise after birth, and that the iron nutrition status after returning to&#xD;
           normal cannot reverse this damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The new concept of the origin of human disease ,&quot;The developmental origins of health and&#xD;
           disease (DOHaD).&quot;theory, that is, environmental factors (such as maternal nutrition,&#xD;
           diseases, etc.) in early life (such as fetal period) will affect some adult&#xD;
           non-communicable diseases (such as obesity and metabolic diseases),and even affects the&#xD;
           health of multiple generations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Foreign related studies had found that the birth weight of the children in the GDM group&#xD;
           was higher than that of the non-GDM mothers (P&lt;0.01), and the height of the children in&#xD;
           the GDM group was lower than that of non-GDM group when the children were 1.5 years old&#xD;
           (P&lt;0.01). At the age of 7.7 years, the children weight of GDM group was significantly&#xD;
           higher than that of the non-GDM group (P&lt;0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Researchers believe that GDM during pregnancy affects fetal fat synthesis and weight,&#xD;
           further affects the weight and body symmetry of the children after delivery, and&#xD;
           increase the risk of physique growth deviation of the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Purpose and Significance of Research 2.1 Purpose 2.1.1 To clarify whether GDM during&#xD;
           pregnancy affects children's iron metabolism, thereby increasing the risk of postnatal&#xD;
           cognitive memory, motion and other neuropsychological development level damage, and&#xD;
           whether the postnatal iron nutrition status returns to normal cannot reverse this&#xD;
           damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.2 To clarify whether GDM during pregnancy affects fetal fat synthesis and weight&#xD;
           gain,further affects the weight and body symmetry of the children after delivery, and&#xD;
           increasing the risk of physique growth deviation of the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Significance The results of this study may provide a basis for the scientific&#xD;
           judgment of the prognosis of the children of GDM mothers and the formulation of early&#xD;
           intervention plans, as well as data support for further health policy formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Target 3.1 To clarify the influence of GDM on children's neuropsychological development&#xD;
           level and progression; 3.2 To clarify the influence of GDM on children's physique&#xD;
           growth; 3.3 To clarify the effect of GDM on Hb, MCV, MCHC, RDW%, and PLT in neonatal&#xD;
           blood routines; 3.4 To understand whether GDM at different stages of pregnancy has&#xD;
           different effects on the physique growth and neuropsychological development of the&#xD;
           children, and whether it may have a predictive effect; 3.5 To understand whether the&#xD;
           impaired neuropsychological development level of infants and preschool children in the&#xD;
           GDM group with normal Hb, MCV, MCHC,RDW% and PLT has been repaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research Steps In the obstetrics department of the First People's Hospital of Chongqing&#xD;
           Liangjiang New Area,China, the pregnant women diagnosed as GDM by IADPSG2010 standard&#xD;
           and delivery children were enrolled into the GDM group, and the healthy pregnant women&#xD;
           and delivery children in the same period were enrolled into the non-GDM group according&#xD;
           to 1:1 ratio. To Collect data of pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes of the&#xD;
           two groups, and fill in the &quot;Questionnaire&quot;, including the age of pregnant women,&#xD;
           permanent residence, pre-pregnancy weight, pre-pregnancy weight, height, educational&#xD;
           status, Number of pregnancies, number of births, pregnancy-related conditions, etc.&#xD;
           Husband's age, educational status, weight, height, average monthly household income,&#xD;
           etc. The physique growth index and blood routine were monitored at the age of 1 month,3&#xD;
           months,6 months,12 months,24 months,36 months,48 months,60 months and 72 months,&#xD;
           respectively. Physique growth indicators and blood routine were monitored. PDMS-2 was&#xD;
           used to evaluate the motor development of infants at the age of 1 months,3 months and 6&#xD;
           months, and the Gesell developmental scale was used to comprehensively evaluate the&#xD;
           neuropsychological development of infants at the age of 6 months,12 months,24 months,36&#xD;
           months,48 months,60 months and 72 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The calculation formula of sample size is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nkeley =(（Z_(α/2)+Z_β ）^2 P(1-P)(γ+1))/〖γ(P_(0-) P_1)〗^2 p = (p_0+γp_1)/(γ+1) N＝The&#xD;
           sample size of each group，α＝standard deviation，α=0.05，Zα/2=1.96，β=0.2，Zβ=0.842，r=1.It is&#xD;
           ca6.lculated that each group needs 255 samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Recruitment Process Since July 1, 2019, the subject recruitment was implemented in the&#xD;
           obstetrics department of the First People's Hospital of Chongqing Liangjiang New Area,&#xD;
           China. 255 pregnant women diagnosed with GDM by IADPSG2010 standard and their children&#xD;
           will be enrolled into the GDM group, whereas, the same number of healthy pregnant women&#xD;
           and their children will be enrolled into the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Statistical Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           Excel software was used for data entry and SPSS 19.0 statistical software was used for&#xD;
           data analysis. GDM was used as the exposure factor to analyze the differences between&#xD;
           exposed group (study group) and unexposed group (control group).Specific analysis&#xD;
           includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.1 Chi-square test was used to analyze the general demographic characteristics and&#xD;
           other baseline characteristics between the two groups; 7.2 Chi-square test was used to&#xD;
           analyze the feeding conditions, complementary food addition conditions, nursing&#xD;
           conditions and main diseases between the two groups; 7.3 The height and weight values of&#xD;
           the two groups were calculated according to the standard: LAZ, WAZ, WLZ and BMIZ, and&#xD;
           the results were analyzed by student's t test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.4 GMQ, FMQ and TMQ values in PDMS-2 motor development scale assessment results between&#xD;
           the two groups were analyzed by nonparametric tests, while the development quotient (DQ)&#xD;
           of the five area assessed by the Gesell developmental scale was analyzed using&#xD;
           nonparametric tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.5 Student's t test was used to analyze the blood routine values between the two&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.6 Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the factors affecting&#xD;
           physical, motor and intellectual development between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.7 Incomplete Data Disposal Method 7.7.1 Deletion of cases containing missing data:&#xD;
           there are mainly simple deletion method and weight method. If the number of missing data&#xD;
           is small, cases with missing data can be deleted or bias reduced by weighting the&#xD;
           complete data. After marking cases with incomplete data, complete data cases are&#xD;
           assigned with different weights, which can be obtained by logistic or probit regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.7.2 Fill in the missing data with the possible data&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mean value interpolation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the null value is numeric, the missing attribute value is filled in based on the&#xD;
           average value of the value of the attribute on all other objects; If the null value is&#xD;
           non-numeric, the value that the attribute takes the most times in all other objects&#xD;
           (that is, the value with the highest occurrence frequency) is used to make up the&#xD;
           missing attribute value according to the mode principle in statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.7.3 Lost to follow-up to the processing method last observation carried forward(LOCF)&#xD;
           and baseline observation carried forward(BOCF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Quality Control Plan Site quality control will be carried out regularly, at least once a&#xD;
           month, to ensure that the plan is strictly followed, and the data collected are&#xD;
           accurately recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1 Ethics This study has been approved by the Ethics Review Board of Children's&#xD;
           Hospital of Chongqing Medical University.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2 Selection of Research Subjects The person in charge of screening and enrollment must&#xD;
           screen the subjects in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria and&#xD;
           maintain consistency of the inclusion and exclusion criteria Upon signing of the&#xD;
           contract, screener will collect data of pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and pregnancy outcome&#xD;
           of the two groups of mothers and have them fill out a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.3 Follow-Up Visits One researcher will keep track of follow-up visit, keep telephone&#xD;
           numbers, provide health consultation, pay home visits, keep touch with the parents in&#xD;
           any other possible forms and remind the parents of their appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.4 Measures and Physical Evaluation One researcher will be responsible for physical&#xD;
           measurements. This researcher will be trained on the standard physical measurement prior&#xD;
           to the beginning of research, and the average value of three measurements will be taken.&#xD;
           In terms of accuracy, two appraisers must go through the professional training of&#xD;
           regular medical institutions and obtain the qualification certificate, and then begin&#xD;
           the evaluation after the accuracy and consistency of the evaluation results.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.5 Data Collection Special personnel are assigned to collect and save paper data every&#xD;
           day, and timely input the paper data into the computer for real and correct storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
