  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the changes in blood lipids and feelings of satiety&#xD;
      after consumption of acid stable or acid unstable oil-in-water emulsions in which the&#xD;
      droplets are in either the liquid or partially solid (i.e. crystalline) states.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double blinded randomized cross-over acute meal study will be carried out in which 15&#xD;
      healthy male participants will attend four study visits, separated by at least one week. On&#xD;
      each study visit, fasted participants will consume either the emulsion with solid or liquid&#xD;
      droplets and that is either acid stable or acid unstable, in a randomized order. All&#xD;
      emulsions will have similar compositions, mainly differing in terms of droplet physical&#xD;
      state, achieved by using lipids with different melting temperature. The emulsions will also&#xD;
      contrast in terms of colloidal stability to acids, achieved by using different emulsifiers.&#xD;
      This will isolate the impacts of physical state and acid stability, and their interactions.&#xD;
      Postprandial lipemia, gastric emptying and satiety will be measured for 6 hours after&#xD;
      consumption of each test beverage. The study meals will include crushed acetaminophen, the&#xD;
      appearance of which will be measured in plasma as a measure of liquid content gastric&#xD;
      emptying. It will also include periodic measurements of the gastric antrum area by ultrasound&#xD;
      to assess the rate of gastric emptying. Participants will be asked to maintain their usual&#xD;
      lifestyle habits throughout the study, with some changes in the 48 hour period leading up to&#xD;
      each of the four visits.&#xD;
