  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Systems pass through different development and study stages. At an early&#xD;
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and&#xD;
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then&#xD;
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and&#xD;
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, as a&#xD;
      result, they get optimized. Afterwards, and prior to product launch, the Phonak Hearing&#xD;
      Systems undergo a final quality control in terms of clinical trials. This is a pre-validation&#xD;
      study, investigating optimized algorithms, features, functions and wearing comfort. This will&#xD;
      be a clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG Headquarters based&#xD;
      in Stäfa (Switzerland).&#xD;

      In this study one CE-labeled Phonak Behind-the-ear (BTE) devices is investigated including&#xD;
      CE-labeled compatible accessories. The experimental device will be investigated regarding its&#xD;
      performance of speech understanding in noise with and without an accessory existing of an&#xD;
      external microphone to pick sound at a certain target. A secondary objective of this study is&#xD;
      the investigation of the Overall system stability in daily life situations. The experimental&#xD;
      device contains direct connectivity functionality. Another objective of this study is the&#xD;
      investigation of the subjective occlusion effect of different acoustic couplings. This will&#xD;
      be a clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG Headquarters based&#xD;
      in Stäfa (Switzerland).&#xD;

    <measure>Speech intelligibility in noise</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study is to investigate the speech intelligibility in noise of the investigational device alone versus the active comparator. Speech understanding in noise will be evaluated with an objective and validated test procedure, the Outcome measure will be the value of speech intelligibility in percentage at a certain signal to noise ratio.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Sound quality perception</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the overall sound quality perception of the investigational device for daily real life situations. The sound quality perception will be measured with a subjective satisfaction rating scale ranging from 0% to 100%.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Another objective of this study is to investigate the subjectively perceived occlusion effect of the own voice by the use of the investigational device. The subjective occlusion effect will be investigated with subjective ratings scales for the dimensions 'dullness of own voice' and 'naturalness of own voice'</description>
