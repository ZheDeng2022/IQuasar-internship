  <brief_summary>

      Due to the widespread use of NGS, TTN is emerging as a major causative gene in neuromuscular&#xD;
      disorders, with high clinical heterogeneity. The mechanisms underlying the phenotypic&#xD;
      variability and mode of inheritance (recessive or dominant) of titinopathies are poorly&#xD;
      understood. They involve the primordial structural functions of titin on the formation and&#xD;
      stability of the sarcomere, as well as its interactions with other proteins. We identified by&#xD;
      NGS, in patients with skeletal myopathy (with or without cardiomyopathy), several potentially&#xD;
      disease causing TTN variants. The specific aims of the present project are to implement&#xD;
      functional studies (transcripts, protein analyses, in vitro protein-protein interaction&#xD;
      studies) to evaluate the effect of TTN variants on the transcripts and protein in order to&#xD;
      perform phenotype-genotype correlation studies. We participate to the national &quot;titin&#xD;
      network&quot; and to international efforts for the understanding of the molecular bases of&#xD;
      titinopathies. Genomic characterisation opens the way to develop cellular models of&#xD;
      titinopathy, derived from patient biopsies. This is also a mandatory first step for the&#xD;
      design of novel therapeutic approaches.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Titinopathies are hereditary skeletal and cardiac myopathies due to alteration of titin, a&#xD;
      giant elastic protein of the sarcomere. Due to the widespread use of next generation&#xD;
      sequencing (NGS), the titin gene (TTN) is emerging as a major causative gene in neuromuscular&#xD;
      disorders (NMDs), with high clinical and allelic heterogeneity. The mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      phenotypic variability and mode of inheritance recessive or dominant of titinopathies are&#xD;
      poorly understood. They involve the primordial structural functions of the titin on the&#xD;
      formation and stability of the sarcomere, as well as its interactions with other proteins.&#xD;
      Effects of variants in TTN are variable, silent, recessive or dominant, and bioinformatics&#xD;
      tools are not really efficient for interpretation of their functional impact, making them&#xD;
      extremely difficult to interpret. Moreover, TTN variants are very frequent in the general&#xD;
      population. Due to the huge size (3700kD) and complexity of titin, analyses of consequences&#xD;
      of TTN variants on transcripts and protein are not performed commonly. There are few teams in&#xD;
      the international community, but no team in France, that propose Western-blot (WB) analyses&#xD;
      on titin as a diagnostic test. Moreover, this test allows to confirm the diagnosis only for&#xD;
      recessive titinopathies due to truncating mutations, that are rare situations (&lt;10% of&#xD;
      suspected titinopathies). Concerning non-truncating variants, that are the most frequent ones&#xD;
      (in particular missense variants), there are no functional diagnostic tests to assess their&#xD;
      pathogenicity. Thus, expect the cases of recessive titinopathies due to compound heterozygous&#xD;
      truncating mutations, it is not possible to confirm whether the phenotype of a patient is due&#xD;
      to a titinopathy, leaving patients without diagnosis. It is thus important to implement&#xD;
      functional tests to evaluate the pathogenic effects of TTN variants on titin abundance and&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project comes from our NGS diagnostic results and will be the continuation of an ongoing&#xD;
      AFM funded project (application 19958). We have identified by NGS, in patients with skeletal&#xD;
      myopathy (with or without cardiomyopathy), several potentially disease causing TTN variants.&#xD;
      Thanks to the AFM-funded project, we have analysed consequences of some TTN variants on&#xD;
      splicing, and we are currently implementing experimental conditions to perform titin WB. In&#xD;
      addition, we have observed that most non-truncating variants in TTN suspected to be&#xD;
      pathogenic are located in titin domains interacting with myosin heavy-chain (MHC). In the&#xD;
      hypothesis that they could have deleterious effects in the stability of interactions between&#xD;
      titin and MHC in the sarcomere, we plan to implement functional tests to evaluate their&#xD;
      consequences in titin-myosin interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the present project will be to implement functional studies to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of TTN variants on the transcripts and protein in order to improve the diagnostic&#xD;
      approach and to perform correlation studies with the modes of inheritance and the phenotypes.&#xD;
      Innovative aspect of the project is the combination of several molecular and biochemical&#xD;
      approaches on RNA (evaluation of the effects on transcription and/or splicing on titin&#xD;
      transcripts in skeletal muscle of patients), protein (evaluation of the effects of all TTN&#xD;
      variants on titin amount and size, by WB analyses on muscle biopsies) and protein-protein&#xD;
      interactions (assessment of pathogenic impact of TTN variants located in titin-MHC&#xD;
      interacting domains on interactions with MHC), that we will implement on the basis of&#xD;
      technologies reported in academic research projects. The strength of our project is also&#xD;
      based on our robust network with neurologists, neuro paediatricians, pathologists and other&#xD;
      biological experts, within the organization in an interregional reference center of NMDs and&#xD;
      in a national network of titinopathies, and the implication in the project of a neurologist&#xD;
      (Dr Morales) through his PhD thesis, to carry out phenotype-genotype correlations studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional studies of the variants identified in the TTN gene should have strong impact for&#xD;
      diagnosis of patients, that is important for its management and familial genetic counselling.&#xD;
      The implemented tests will be available to the French network of titinopathies. This should&#xD;
      solve the diagnosis of a large number of patients without clear diagnosis, and specify the&#xD;
      frequency of involvement of titinopathies in myopathies. Improvement of diagnosis of&#xD;
      titinopathies will have high socio-economic impacts because it will reduce the cost due to&#xD;
      iterative diagnostic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenotype-genotype correlation studies will allow expanding the mutation and clinical&#xD;
      spectrum of titinopathies and participating to the international effort to understand the&#xD;
      molecular bases of titinopathies, that is a mandatory first step to devise therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches. In addition, genetic confirmation open the way to develop cellular models of&#xD;
      titinopathy, derived from the tissues of patients. These models will be basis for proteomic&#xD;
      and other functional studies to decipher the mechanisms of titinopaphies and to point to&#xD;
      metabolic pathways that could be the target of pharmacological therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, the present application will constitute a major, original and innovative&#xD;
      development to contribute to diagnosis and to the knowledge of molecular bases of&#xD;
      titinopathies.&#xD;
