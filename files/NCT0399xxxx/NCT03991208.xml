    <textblock>
      A 2x2 randomized crossover of single dose malarone at rest and during moderate intensity&#xD;
      exercise under controlled conditions of heat and humidity in healthy adult participants.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of AUC and Cmax will be performed to determine pharmacokinetic changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A clinical trial under controlled heat exposure and moderate intensity exercise, determined&#xD;
      by VO2max testing and calibration, to determine if physiologic changes during heat exposure&#xD;
      and exercise change the pharmacokinetics of malarone to a degree that falls outside the range&#xD;
      of that which is considered bioequivalent or 80-125% concentration using AUC and Cmax for&#xD;
      rate and extent of exposure. Participants will be randomized to order of rest and exercise&#xD;
      components. Single dose malarone will be used during both arms. Single dose malarone&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics will give insight into risk of toxicity or risk of under treatment during&#xD;
      prophylaxis administration.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy adult female and male ages 18-44 weighing greater than 40kg with BMI less than 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        17 years old or younger, 45 years old or older, unable to speak and read English, unable to&#xD;
        perform exercise tests safely, and/or unable to consent to participate. Unwilling to&#xD;
        undergo blood draws. Have known allergy to sunflower butter or are unwilling or unable to&#xD;
        consume 2 tbsp or have an allergy to any component of malarone. Also non abstinent females&#xD;
        at risk of becoming pregnant or in a heterosexual sexual relationships must be willing to&#xD;
        use there chosen and available form of contraception defined as barrier protection,&#xD;
        implantable device or hormones, or oral contraceptive pills during time of study up to 2&#xD;
        months after or abstinence unless previously sterile with tubal ligation 1 year or greater&#xD;
        prior to screening or hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Those with any of the following conditions will also be excluded from the study: history of&#xD;
        any of the following: rhabdomyolysis or heat stroke, heart disease, pulmonary disease,&#xD;
        chronic kidney disease, single kidney, chronic hepatitis, diabetes, seizure disorders,&#xD;
        multiple sclerosis, COPD, asthma, sickle cell trait or disease, thalassemia, thyroid&#xD;
        disease, cancer, chronic infections such as history of HIV, HEP B or HEP C, or&#xD;
        rheumatologic disorder; current pregnancy or lactation, systolic blood pressure over 140 mm&#xD;
        Hg or diastolic pressure over 90 mm Hg; anemia (hematocrit lower than 36% for women and 38%&#xD;
        for men and hemoglobin below 11g/dL for women and 12g/dL for men); diabetes (blood glucose&#xD;
        above 110 mg/dL); use of any medications for chronic medical conditions (such as&#xD;
        glucose-lowering drugs, prednisone, or beta blockers); or any condition that leads to&#xD;
        inability to run safely on a treadmill. Non systemic drugs for skin condition or seasonal&#xD;
        allergies will not be a disqualifier. Any volunteers identified during the cardiac risk&#xD;
        assessment as above low risk will also be excluded from the study. The ACSM guidelines for&#xD;
        exclusion criteria identify low-risk individuals as younger than 45, without history of&#xD;
        CVD, and with no more than one risk factor according to the ACSM Risk Stratification&#xD;
        Questionnaire for stratification. Risk factors include family history of heart disease,&#xD;
        smoking status, hypertension with a blood pressure above 140/90, hypercholesterolemia with&#xD;
        cholesterol over 200 mg/dL, fasting glucose over 110 mg/dL, obesity with a percent body fat&#xD;
        &gt;25% for men or &gt; 30% for women, and (be consistent throughout including ICD) sedentary&#xD;
        lifestyle. The monitoring physician can also exclude a volunteer based on his or her&#xD;
        medical opinion given the results of a physical exam and/or EKG results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Initial screening for history will be performed by phone interview with requested waived&#xD;
        consent. Those not able to achieve 80% pass on ICD test in 2 tries or less.&#xD;
