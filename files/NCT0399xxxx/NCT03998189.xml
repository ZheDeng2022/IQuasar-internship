  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will establish non-invasive sample collections, including breath, saliva,&#xD;
      blood and urine pre-surgery and at the participant's one-month post-surgery follow-up visit.&#xD;
      Participants with suspected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage I-III will be recruited.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility of adding non-invasive sample collections in the&#xD;
           pre-surgical setting and at the post-surgery follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify and assess metabolic and microbial signatures collected at pre- and&#xD;
           post-surgery and determine which are indicative of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify signatures which are associated with lung cancer stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify signatures which are impacted by patient's pulmonary function status.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objectives is to assess the feasibility of adding these non-invasive sample collections to pre- and post-surgery visits the following outcomes (counts) will be gathered - (number eligible for trial, number that consent to participate, number that provide pre-surgery samples, number that provide post-surgery samples) using a 95% exact Clopper-Pearson confidence interval for each feasibility estimate.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identification of Lung Cancer Stage Specific Signatures</measure>
    <time_frame>One month post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>For lung cancer examine whether pre-surgery, post-surgery or change from pre- to post- surgery metabolic or microbial measures are different depending on lung cancer stage. Consideration of the metabolic or microbial measures as outcomes and use a general linear models framework to see if lung cancer stage (included as a class variable, but then examined as an ordinal variable using a contrast statement in general linear model) is associated with any marker.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identification of Signatures Associated With Pulmonary Function</measure>
    <time_frame>One month post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>For pulmonary function, the same approach as for lung cancer stage, except that pulmonary function will be considered as a continuous variable in the model. Pulmonary function can be examined at both time-points (pre- and post- surgery) thus we can examine the relationships between pulmonary function measures and biomarker measures at each time points (and the change in measures over time).</description>
