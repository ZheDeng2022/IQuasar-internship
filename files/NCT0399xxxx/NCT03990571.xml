  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well axitinib and avelumab work in treating patients with&#xD;
      adenoid cystic carcinoma that has come back or spread to other places in the body. Axitinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system&#xD;
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Giving axitinib and avelumab together may help to control adenoid cystic carcinoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the objective response rate (ORR) to axitinib and avelumab combination according to&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) who have evidence of disease progression within 6&#xD;
      months prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess ORR to axitinib and avelumab combination according to immune-related (ir)RECIST&#xD;
      criteria patients with recurrent or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate median progression free survival (PFS), PFS rate at 6 months after start of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate median overall survival (OS), OS rate at 6 months after start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate duration of response (DoR). V. Evaluate safety and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess molecular markers associated with response and resistance to the study combination&#xD;
      using tissue and/or plasma obtained from study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive axitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and avelumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days and then&#xD;
      every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

             bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or&#xD;
             postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical&#xD;
             cause)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12&#xD;
             months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements&#xD;
             must also apply: Women &lt; 50 years old: they would be considered post-menopausal if&#xD;
             they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or more following cessation of&#xD;
             exogenous hormonal treatments. The levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and&#xD;
             follicle-stimulating Hormone (FSH) must also be in the post menopausal range (as per&#xD;
             the institution). Women &gt;= 50 years old: they would be considered post-menopausal if&#xD;
             they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or more following cessation of all&#xD;
             exogenous hormonal treatments, or have had radiation-induced oophorectomy with the&#xD;
             last menses &gt; 1 year ago, or have had chemotherapy-induced menopause with &gt; 1 year&#xD;

          -  Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must use adequate contraception for the duration of the study and 30 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of study medication. Adequate contraception methods include: birth&#xD;
             control pills (e.g. combined oral contraceptive pill), barrier protection (e.g. condom&#xD;
             plus spermicide, cervical/vault cap or intrauterine device), and abstinence. Patients&#xD;
             should not father a child for 6 months after completion of the study medication.&#xD;
             Patients should refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months&#xD;
             after discontinuing the study medication. If male patients wish to father children&#xD;
             they should be advised to arrange for freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of&#xD;
             the study medication&#xD;

             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with an uncontrolled seizure disorder, active neurologic disease, or active&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS) involvement except for individuals who have&#xD;
             previously-treated CNS metastases, are asymptomatic, and have no requirement for doses&#xD;
             of corticosteroids (indicated to reduce brain edema) higher than the equivalent of 10&#xD;
             mg of oral prednisone a day or anti-seizure medication for at least 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of ongoing malignancies or malignancies in remission &lt; 2 years. Adequately&#xD;
             curative intent treated initial stage non-melanoma skin cancers; in situ carcinoma of&#xD;
             the cervix; breast carcinoma in situ; low-grade local bladder cancer; and low-risk&#xD;
             prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance will be allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study. Based on its mechanism of action.&#xD;
             Avelumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal models,&#xD;
             the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is important in the maintenance of pregnancy through&#xD;
             induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue. Human IgG1 immunoglobulins are&#xD;
             known to cross the placenta. Therefore, avelumab has the potential to be transmitted&#xD;
             from the mother to the developing fetus. Blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown in&#xD;
             murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an&#xD;
             increase in fetal loss. Therefore, potential risks of administering avelumab during&#xD;
             pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. Advise females of&#xD;
             reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with avelumab&#xD;
             and for at least one month after the last dose of avelumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lactating females: There is no information regarding the presence of avelumab in human&#xD;
             milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Since&#xD;
             many drugs including antibodies are excreted in human milk, advise a lactating woman&#xD;
             not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose of&#xD;
             avelumab due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor (e.g. anti-PD-1/PD-L1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with VEGF or VEGFR inhibitors (e.g. lenvatinib, bevacizumab)&#xD;
