             if the major histological component appears to be non-squamous.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As the stage IV non-squamous NSCLC treatment, no prior cytotoxic treatment is allowed&#xD;
             and the patients treated with below tyrosine kinase inhibitor prior to the enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a sensitizing mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#xD;
             gene must have experienced disease progression (during or after treatment) or&#xD;
             intolerance to treatment with one or more EGFR TKIs, such as erlotinib, gefitinib,&#xD;
             osimertinib or another EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) appropriate for the&#xD;
             treatment of EGFR mutant NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the patients have identified T790M mutation after 1st or 2nd generation EGFR TKI&#xD;
        failure, the patient must be treated with the second line 3rd generation EGFR TKI&#xD;

        having an ALK fusion oncogene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with unknown EGFR and/or ALK status require test results at screening. ALK and/or&#xD;
        EGFR may be assessed locally or at a main investigator laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inoperable stage III non-squamous NSCLC treatment, no prior cytotoxic treatment is allowed&#xD;

             chemoradiotherapy with curative intent for non-metastatic disease must have&#xD;
             experienced a treatment free interval of at least 6 months from randomization since&#xD;
             the last chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of treated asymptomatic Central Nervous System(CNS) metastases&#xD;
             are eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;

             screening scan may be eligible without the need for an additional radiation therapy&#xD;
             and/or surgery for Central Nervous System(CNS) metastases by investigator's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are available to provide tissue from previously obtained archival tumor&#xD;
             tissue or tissue obtained from a biopsy at screening for the PD-L1 test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ( in case, if patient cannot provides any slides, the enrollment can still be considered&#xD;
        with individual discussion with the principal investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Biopsy and blood sample requirement are as follows for the Whole exome and transcriptome&#xD;
        sequencing: A representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimen in&#xD;
        paraffin block (preferred) or 10 or more unstained, freshly cut, serial sections on slides&#xD;
        from an FFPE tumor specimen is required for participation in this study. If fewer than 10&#xD;
        slides are available, patient can be still considered for the enrollment based on the&#xD;
        discussion and the decision with the principal investigator. This specimen must be&#xD;
        accompanied by the associated pathology report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Fine-needle aspiration (defined as samples that do not preserve tissue architecture and&#xD;
        yield cell suspension and/or cell smears), brushing, cell pellet specimens (e.g., from&#xD;
        pleural effusion, and lavage samples) are not acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Tumor tissue from bone metastases that is subject to decalcification is not acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Endobronchial ultrasonographic biopsy samples are not preferred but acceptable. For core&#xD;
        needle biopsy specimens, preferably at least three cores embedded in a single paraffin&#xD;
        block, should be submitted for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        30ml of peripheral blood sample acquired during the screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST v1.1 Previously irradiated lesions can only be&#xD;
        considered as measurable disease if disease progression has been unequivocally documented&#xD;
        at that site since radiation and the previously irradiated lesion is not the only site of&#xD;
        disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adequate hematologic and end organ function, defined by the following laboratory results&#xD;
        obtained within 14 days prior to randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        ANC ≥ 1500 cells/µL without granulocyte colony stimulating factor support Lymphocyte count&#xD;
        ≥500/µL Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µL without transfusion Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Patients may&#xD;
        be transfused to meet this criterion. INR or aPTT ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) This&#xD;
        applies only to patients who are not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation; patients&#xD;
        receiving therapeutic anticoagulation should be on a stable dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN, with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with documented liver metastases: AST and/or ALT ≤ 5 x ULN Patients with&#xD;
        documented liver or bone metastases: alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.25 x ULN Patients with known Gilbert disease who have serum bilirubin&#xD;
        level ≤ 3 x ULN may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female patients of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner)&#xD;
             to use a highly effective form(s) of contraception that results in a low failure rate&#xD;
             (&lt; 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, and to continue its use for 5&#xD;
             months after the last dose of atezolizumab and/or 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             bevacizumab or paclitaxel, whichever is later). Such methods include: combined&#xD;
             (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception, progestogen-only&#xD;
             hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation together with another&#xD;
             additional barrier method always containing a spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD):&#xD;
             intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized&#xD;
             partner (on the understanding that this is the only one partner during the whole study&#xD;
             duration), and sexual abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For male patients with female partners of childbearing potential, agreement (by&#xD;
             patient and/or partner) to use a highly effective form(s) of contraception that&#xD;
             results in a low failure rate [&lt; 1% per year] when used consistently and correctly,&#xD;
             and to continue its use for 6 months after the last dose of bevacizumab, carboplatin,&#xD;
             or paclitaxel. Male patients should not donate sperm during this study and for at&#xD;
             least 6 months after the last dose of bevacizumab, carboplatin, or paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oral contraception should always be combined with an additional contraceptive method&#xD;
             because of a potential interaction with the study drug. The same rules are valid for&#xD;
             male patients involved in this clinical study if they have a partner of childbirth&#xD;
             potential. Male patients must always use a condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are not postmenopausal ( 12 months of non therapy-induced amenorrhea) or&#xD;
             surgically sterile must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days&#xD;
             prior to initiation of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who meet any of the criteria below will be excluded from study entry.&#xD;
        Cancer-Specific Exclusions Active or untreated symptomatic Central Nervous System(CNS)&#xD;
        metastases as determined by CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation during&#xD;
        screening and prior radiographic assessments Spinal cord compression not definitively&#xD;
        treated with surgery and/or radiation or previously diagnosed and treated spinal cord&#xD;
        compression without evidence that disease has been clinically stable for &gt; 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
        randomization Leptomeningeal disease Uncontrolled tumor-related pain Patients requiring&#xD;
        pain medication must be on a stable regimen at study entry. Symptomatic lesions amenable to&#xD;
        palliative radiotherapy (e.g., bone metastases or metastases causing nerve impingement)&#xD;
        should be treated prior to randomization. Patients should be recovered from the effects of&#xD;
        radiation. There is no required minimum recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth would likely cause functional deficits&#xD;
        or intractable pain (e.g., epidural metastasis that is not currently associated with spinal&#xD;
        cord compression) should be considered for locoregional therapy, if appropriate, prior to&#xD;
        randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent&#xD;
        drainage procedures (once monthly or more frequently) Patients with indwelling catheters&#xD;
        (e.g., PleurX®) are allowed. Uncontrolled or symptomatic hypercalcemia (&gt; 1.5 mmol/L&#xD;
        ionized calcium or Ca &gt; 12 mg/dL) Patients who are receiving denosumab prior to&#xD;
        randomization must be willing and eligible to receive a bisphosphonate instead while in the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Malignancies other than NSCLC within 5 years prior to randomization, with the exception of&#xD;
        those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., expected 5 year OS &gt; 90%)&#xD;
        treated with expected curative outcome (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the&#xD;
        cervix, basal or squamous-cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer treated surgically&#xD;
        with curative intent, ductal carcinoma in situ treated surgically with curative intent)&#xD;
