  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional recovery after total knee replacement (TKR) is characterized by an incomplete&#xD;
      muscle strength due to arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) and tendency to estimate the&#xD;
      functional level. These deficits could be related to alteration of sensory feedback, and&#xD;
      could influence the ability to modulate patients' motor performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are not studies investigatin the ability to modulate the motor performance in&#xD;
      patients with TKR compared to healthy age-matched subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study 20 patients with TKR and 20 healthy will be included . Inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
      age between 40 and 80 , TKR for primary knee osteoarthritis, knee flexion ≥ 90° and complete&#xD;
      knee extension, ability to perform a sit to stand on a 46 cm high chair and to walk for at&#xD;
      least 50 meters without aids. Exclusion criteria: patients undergoing TKR after traumas,&#xD;
      previous tibial or femoral osteotomy, partial or complete revision surgery. subjects with&#xD;
      psychiatric and/or cognitive impairments, or with neurological, musculoskeletal or other&#xD;
      disorders that could influence motor or functional recovery will be also exluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the ability in motor performance modulation in&#xD;
      patients after TKR compared to healthy age-mtched subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is to investigate this ability during a leg extension performed in open&#xD;
      kinetic chain. This ability will be also evaluated during a Sit To Stand and during walking&#xD;
      (with 10 Meters Walking Test). Secondary endpoint is to investigate pain, rate of perceived&#xD;
      exertion and perceived load symmetry during the three tests. In both healthy and TKR groups&#xD;
      these outcomes will be detected two times. In particular, in TKR group, patients will be&#xD;
      tested the day before surgery and 5 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed at conducting a survey in healthy subjects and in a population of&#xD;
      subjects undergoing TKR . Participants will undergo an acquisition similar to others already&#xD;
      described in the literature and without adverse events. Tests will last about 60 minutes and&#xD;
      during them, will be used the equipment of Motion Analysis Lab of &quot;Humanitas Research&#xD;
      Hospital&quot;.&#xD;
