  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress echocardiography is a screening test for coronary heart disease that already has good&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity (both around 70%). This examination is mainly offered to stable&#xD;
      patients, consulting externally, in order to detect ischemic heart disease in the same way as&#xD;
      would a myocardial scintigraphy or MRI stress. This examination is an echocardiographic&#xD;
      modality consisting in visualizing and analyzing the modifications of the contraction of the&#xD;
      cardiac muscle during a stress constituted by an effort or by injection of certain drugs.&#xD;
      Stress echocardiography is performed by injection of drugs to reproduce the conditions of the&#xD;
      effort. The products used to perform this examination are initially an intravenous infusion&#xD;
      of dobutamine, atropine whose effect is to increase the heart rate, and in a second time, an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of beta-blockers or a bradycardic calcium channel blocker at the end of&#xD;
      the procedure whose effect is to slow down the heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of echographic contrast medium, allowing a better visibility, is recommended for the&#xD;
      realization of a stress ultrasound, since the echogenicity is judged insufficient on two&#xD;
      segments (segmentation of the left ventricle in 17 segments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of dobutamine stress echocardiography currently relies solely on the analysis of&#xD;
      segmental kinetics, namely the quality of the thickening of the endocardium. When segmental&#xD;
      kinetics are abnormal, patients benefit from a coronary CT scan or coronary angiography to&#xD;
      visualize all the coronary arteries and to check whether there is a narrowing of the&#xD;
      arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, stress echocardiography performed using a contrast medium makes it possible to&#xD;
      analyze two other indices in addition to segmental kinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the second parameter that can be analyzed corresponds to the Coronary Flow Reserve&#xD;
      measurement, thanks to the easy identification of the Doppler flow in the anterior&#xD;
      interventricular at rest and peak of dobutamine. The coronal reserve is well validated with&#xD;
      adenosine, but much less well known under dobutamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third parameter that can be analyzed is myocardial perfusion. By using appropriate&#xD;
      settings, it is possible to see the microbubbles in the thickness of the myocardium. These&#xD;
      bubbles are then destroyed by an ultrasonic flash of high mechanical index. This results in&#xD;
      the destruction of all intra-myocardial bubbles. The analysis of the myocardial perfusion is&#xD;
      based on the rate of reappearance of these bubbles (through the coronary arteries) at rest&#xD;
      and peak stress. In case of significant stenosis or coronary occlusion, there is a delay or&#xD;
      complete absence of perfusion in the territory concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joint analysis of segmental kinetics, coronary reserve and myocardial perfusion has already&#xD;
      been described with adenosine, but not with dobutamine. Studies in the literature suggest&#xD;
      that the analysis of coronary reserve on the one hand, and myocardial perfusion on the other&#xD;
      hand would increase the sensitivity and specificity of the examination. In addition, other&#xD;
      studies suggest that among the tests considered normal for segmental kinetics analysis, there&#xD;
      are patients with myocardial perfusion abnormality and / or coronary reserve abnormality that&#xD;
      strike (s) on prognosis (alteration of the coronary microcirculation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is why it seems interesting to compare the results of these 3 indices obtained during&#xD;
      stress echocardiography under dobutamine.&#xD;

During this stress ultrasound, the 3 indices (segmental kinetics, coronary reserve and myocardial perfusion) will be analyzed.

The evaluation of the myocardial perfusion is carried out thanks to the use of the &quot;flash&quot;, modality not being part of the usual care.&#xD;
Indeed, during the examination, the power of the probe will be increased to evaluate the myocardial perfusion. The bubbles of the contrast medium are destroyed by applying a &quot;flash&quot;, that is to say a transient increase in the power of the ultrasonic beam. Systole after systole, on a recorded loop, the filling rate of the myocardium, which depends on the myocardial blood flow, is analyzed.
