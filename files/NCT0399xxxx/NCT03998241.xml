      Introduction Anterior knee pain (AKP) commonly affects physically active as well as sedentary&#xD;
      individuals and the aetiology remains unknown. Altered joint position sense (JPS) impacts&#xD;
      accurate motor action and knee joint stability. It is unclear whether people with AKP have&#xD;
      altered JPS. The aim of this study was to investigate the JPS of individuals with AKP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A descriptive cross-sectional design was used to measure JPS in twenty-five&#xD;
      participants with unilateral or bilateral AKP. The Vicon 3D motion analysis system was used&#xD;
      to assess JPS by means of active joint position sense testing during single leg squat and&#xD;
      active knee extension in sitting. Target angles were self-determined based on each&#xD;
      participant's capabilities. The absolute error (AE) was used as the main outcome measure.&#xD;
      Impaired JPS was classified as an AE equal to or greater than five degrees.&#xD;

      Research Design CAF Human motion analysis Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences,&#xD;
      Stellenbosch University. Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of Stellenbosch University under reference number S16/10/197. This study was&#xD;
      conducted as part of a master's thesis project (Rhode 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling and Recruitment Sample recruitment was aimed to attract individuals with AKP from&#xD;
      different socio-economic backgrounds, sporting codes and areas. Letters of invitation were&#xD;
      sent to various universities, sports clinics, physiotherapy practices and sporting clubs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure Measurement Tools Vicon 3D motion analysis system The eight-camera Vicon&#xD;
      T-20-series motion analysis system (Vicon Motion Systems Ltd., Oxford, UK) with Nexus 1.7&#xD;
      software was used to assess joint position sense (JPS). The Vicon has demonstrated high&#xD;
      accuracy and reliability and has been shown to have less than a 1.5-degree error (Ehara et al&#xD;
      1997). Retro-reflective markers with a diameter of 9.5mm were used. Dynamic calibration was&#xD;
      performed according to standard laboratory protocol, and the Vicon T-wand was placed on a 3D&#xD;
      Bertec force plate (Bertec Corporation Ltd.), which is synchronized with the Vicon motion&#xD;
      analysis system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H-Frame An H-frame was constructed based on a study by Clark et al (2016). The function of&#xD;
      the H-frame was that of a range of motion (ROM) guide when establishing the target angle (TA)&#xD;
      for participants during the test trial. The H-frame was positioned so that the rubber band&#xD;
      (crossbar) makes contact with the distal part of the patella during single leg squat (SLS)&#xD;
      and that the crossbar touches the skin overlying the anterior ankle joint line during active&#xD;
      knee extension (AKE). The H-frame was removed during the test procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kujala/anterior knee pain scale (AKPS) questionnaire The AKPS is a 13-item knee functional&#xD;
      questionnaire. This scale is scored out of 100, with a higher score indicating less&#xD;
      disability. The AKPS demonstrated high reliability and responsiveness in a population of&#xD;
      patients with AKP (Watson et al 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual analogue pain scale (VAS) This VAS scale is a well-known outcome measure to evaluate&#xD;
      levels/intensity of pain (Crossley et al 2016). The VAS is scored from 0 (no pain) to 10&#xD;
      (maximum pain). The VAS demonstrates good reliability and responsiveness among a population&#xD;
      of patients with AKP (Green et al 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower extremity functional scale (LEFS) questionnaire The LEFS consists of 20 items that&#xD;
      measure the ability to perform various functional activities and activities of daily life.&#xD;
      The LEFS is scored out of a maximum score of 80. The LEFS demonstrates high reliability and&#xD;
      responsiveness in the population of patients with AKP (Watson et al 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for positive and negative knee joint position sense The main outcome measurements&#xD;
      for knee JPS testing was absolute error (AE). AE refers to the difference between the test or&#xD;
      target angle and the reproduced angle. Absolute error represents accuracy without directional&#xD;
      bias. For the purpose of this study, abnormal JPS was defined as an AE equal or greater than&#xD;
      five degrees. This criterion was based on published research by Relph and Callaghan (2016)&#xD;
      and Clark et al (2016) using healthy pain free participants. The mean AE from five trails for&#xD;
      each test was used for statistical analysis (Selfe et al 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Procedures Initial screening To verify that participants met the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      they completed a screening questionnaire via email. Prior to JPS testing, participants&#xD;
      completed the AKP scale questionnaire (AKPS) and the LEFS questionnaire. A data collection&#xD;
      form was used to collect participant personal details and variables including age, gender,&#xD;
      body length, episodes and duration of AKP, area of symptoms, type of treatment received for&#xD;
      AKP and sport participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination and diagnosis The diagnostic checklist was completed, and the physical&#xD;
      examination was performed to confirm a diagnosis of AKP and to exclude other knee pathologies&#xD;
      prior to testing. The physical examination (P/E) was conducted by the primary researcher&#xD;
      (CR), who is an experienced physiotherapist. Additionally, anthropometrics (weight, BMI, leg&#xD;
      length) were measured for each participant. Data were captured as part of participant&#xD;
      demographics to describe this population group/participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation for Vicon testing Participants were dressed in short pants, were barefoot, with&#xD;
      clean shaven legs with no lotion on legs to ensure effective marker placement. Thirty&#xD;
      retro-reflective markers were placed on bony landmarks according to lower limb Plug-in Gait&#xD;
      model (Clark et al 2016). Additional pelvic markers, a sacral wand, two extra shin markers&#xD;
      and extra anterior and posterior thigh markers where added, to ensure joint position sense&#xD;
      accuracy. The primary researcher (CR) performed the marker placement assisted by a research&#xD;
      assistant. Reflective markers were placed in the standing position in preparation for SLS and&#xD;
      re-applied with the participant in the seated position to ensure accurate positioning of&#xD;
      markers placements for active knee extension. A static and dynamic calibration were performed&#xD;
      in both test positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain measurement During the test trials the participants were asked to verbally indicate the&#xD;
      severity of their anterior knee pain using the VAS pain scale. Pain severity was measured at&#xD;
      the start and end of proprioceptive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proprioceptive Testing All participants were familiarized with the proprioceptive test&#xD;
      procedure by means of explanation, demonstration and a practice opportunity. The participants&#xD;
      were asked to resume the test position i.e. (i) standing or (ii) sitting. The target angle&#xD;
      was determined by each participant according to his/her capabilities and comfort level, i.e.&#xD;
      the target angle was unique to each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single leg squat (SLS) Starting position For the SLS the participant supported one hands on a&#xD;
      chair for balance. The participant was standing on the tested leg, while the other leg was&#xD;
      slightly flexed at the hip and knee in a position that was comfortable for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instructions to participant The participant was asked to do a SLS and stop in the mid-range.&#xD;
      The participant was asked to briefly hold this mid-range angle to position the H-frame&#xD;
      indicating this angle as the target angle (TA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test trial The participant was cued to squat down till they felt the cross bar of the&#xD;
      H-frame. The participant was instructed to hold the SLS for five seconds to establish and&#xD;
      familiarize themselves with the target angle (TA). The test trial was repeated five times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test procedure The participant was blindfolded, and the H-frame was removed. The participant&#xD;
      was instructed to perform a SLS, and to indicate when they had reached the TA by shouting&#xD;
      STOP. This position indicated the relative error (RE) and was maintained for five seconds to&#xD;
      record the data. Testing was repeated five times. This number of repetitions has been&#xD;
      recommended for JPS testing in previous research (Selfe et al 2006). SLS was repeated on the&#xD;
      knees without AKP for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitting: active knee extension (AKE) Starting position The participant was seated on an 800mm&#xD;
      high bar stool, with both feet supported. Each participant was positioned with the popliteal&#xD;
      fossa approximately 5cm from the edge of the chair. The participant's arms were crossed over&#xD;
      their chests comfortably to avoid obstruction of the pelvic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instructions to participants The participant actively extended the knee through the range of&#xD;
      90 degrees knee flexion to 0 degrees knee extension; thereafter they had to stop in the&#xD;
      mid-range position. The participant was asked to briefly hold this mid-range angle to&#xD;
      position the H-frame indicating this position as the TA. The participant was verbally cued to&#xD;
      resume the starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test trial The participant actively extended the knee from the starting position of 90&#xD;
      degrees knee flexion to the TA. The participants were verbally cued to hold this position for&#xD;
      five seconds to establish the TA. Thereafter the participant was asked to return to the&#xD;
      starting position of the knee in 90 degrees flexion. The test trail was repeated five times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing The H-frame was removed at the commencement of AKE testing. The participant was asked&#xD;
      to repeat AKE, indicating when the TA had been reached, by shouting STOP. This position&#xD;
      indicated the relative error (RE) and the participants maintained this position for five&#xD;
      seconds. Testing was repeated five times. The AKE was repeated on the knees without AKP for&#xD;
      comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses All descriptive data (demographic information, functional and pain&#xD;
      scales) were analyzed using descriptive statistics to indicate central tendencies in data&#xD;
      (means and standard deviations). A non-pragmatic test approach was adopted by illustrating&#xD;
      the ranges. Data was captured through the Vicon Nexus 3D motion analyses system. Chi-square&#xD;
      calculations was performed to determine a significant difference in JPS between the knees&#xD;
      with AKP and the knees without AKP during single leg stance and active knee extension.&#xD;
