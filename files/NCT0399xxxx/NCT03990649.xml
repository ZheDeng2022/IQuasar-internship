    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of soticlestat (TAK-935) on calculated&#xD;
      24-hour average pain intensity by the numeric pain scale (NPS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called soticlestat (TAK-935). Soticlestat is being&#xD;
      tested to treat people with chronic complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). This study will&#xD;
      look at the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of soticlestat as an adjunctive therapy in&#xD;
      participants with CRPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 24 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by&#xD;
      chance, like flipping a coin) in 2:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups-which will&#xD;
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an&#xD;
      urgent medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soticlestat 100 mg tablets, 100, 200 or 300 mg twice daily (BID) Placebo (dummy inactive&#xD;
      pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 100 mg soticlestat tablets or soticlestat matching placebo tablets,&#xD;
      BID for Week 1, 2x100 mg soticlestat tablets or soticlestat matching placebo tablets, BID for&#xD;
      Week 2 and followed by 3x100 mg soticlestat tablets or soticlestat matching placebo tablets,&#xD;
      BID for Week 3. Dose will be uptitrated based on safety and tolerability in titration period.&#xD;
      Participants will continue to receive the same dose in maintenance period. Dose adjustments&#xD;
      during maintenance period may take place due to safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then enter Part B (optional) or taper period. In Part B all participants&#xD;
      will receive soticlestat 2x100 mg tablets, BID for 1 Week, followed by soticlestat 3x100 mg&#xD;
      tablets, BID for 1 Week. Dose will be uptitrated/downtitrated based on safety and&#xD;
      tolerability in titration period (Part B), participants will continue to receive the same&#xD;
      dose in maintenance period (Part B) and followed by a taper period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United Kingdom. The overall time to participate&#xD;
      in this study is approximately 36 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic&#xD;
      and will be contacted by telephone 15 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

    <description>The 24-hour average pain intensity was calculated from current pain intensity scores collected three times a day as measured by the electronic pain diary daily using NPS. NPS is an 11-point scale, where scores range from 0-10, 0= no pain to 10 = most pain imaginable. Negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

    <description>Response was defined as ≥ 30% improvement on the 24-hour pain intensity as assessed by the NPS score. The 24-hour average pain intensity was calculated from current pain intensity scores collected three times a day as measured by the electronic pain diary daily using NPS during Part A.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Domain Score of PROMIS-29 Version 2.1 at the End of Part A</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS-29 (v2.1) is a health-related quality of life survey assessing 7 domains with 4 questions on a 5-point Likert scale. Total raw domain scores are converted into T-scores from a reference population: Depression: 1=never to 5=always, T-scores:41.0-79.4; Physical function: 1=unable to do to 5=without any difficulty, T-scores: 22.5-57.0; Anxiety: 1=never to 5=always, T-scores: 40.3-81.6; Pain interference: 1=not at all to 5=very much, T-scores: 41.6-75.6; Fatigue: 1=not at all to 5=very much, T-scores: 33.7-75.8; Sleep disturbance: 1=very much to 5=not at all, T-scores: 32.0-73.3; Ability to participate in social roles or activities: 1=always to 5=never, T-scores: 27.5-64.2. High scores signify more of domain being measured. Thus, on symptom-oriented domains, higher scores=worse symptomatology and a negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. On function-oriented domains, higher score=better functioning and a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

             (CRPS) at the screening visit and is at least 6 months since onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant's pain medications and nondrug treatments must be stable (regimented per&#xD;
             prescription) for 1 month prior to screening and remain stable throughout Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant agrees to use a single previously prescribed rescue medication within the&#xD;

             that participants who have been vaccinated against hepatitis B [hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antibody {Ab}-positive] who are negative for other markers of prior hepatitis B&#xD;
             infection [eg, negative for hepatitis B core Ab] are eligible. Also, note that&#xD;
             participants who are positive for hepatitis C Ab are eligible if they have a negative&#xD;

        <title>Change From Baseline in Domain Score of PROMIS-29 Version 2.1 at the End of Part A</title>
        <description>PROMIS-29 (v2.1) is a health-related quality of life survey assessing 7 domains with 4 questions on a 5-point Likert scale. Total raw domain scores are converted into T-scores from a reference population: Depression: 1=never to 5=always, T-scores:41.0-79.4; Physical function: 1=unable to do to 5=without any difficulty, T-scores: 22.5-57.0; Anxiety: 1=never to 5=always, T-scores: 40.3-81.6; Pain interference: 1=not at all to 5=very much, T-scores: 41.6-75.6; Fatigue: 1=not at all to 5=very much, T-scores: 33.7-75.8; Sleep disturbance: 1=very much to 5=not at all, T-scores: 32.0-73.3; Ability to participate in social roles or activities: 1=always to 5=never, T-scores: 27.5-64.2. High scores signify more of domain being measured. Thus, on symptom-oriented domains, higher scores=worse symptomatology and a negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. On function-oriented domains, higher score=better functioning and a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Domain Score of PROMIS-29 Version 2.1 at the End of Part A</title>
          <description>PROMIS-29 (v2.1) is a health-related quality of life survey assessing 7 domains with 4 questions on a 5-point Likert scale. Total raw domain scores are converted into T-scores from a reference population: Depression: 1=never to 5=always, T-scores:41.0-79.4; Physical function: 1=unable to do to 5=without any difficulty, T-scores: 22.5-57.0; Anxiety: 1=never to 5=always, T-scores: 40.3-81.6; Pain interference: 1=not at all to 5=very much, T-scores: 41.6-75.6; Fatigue: 1=not at all to 5=very much, T-scores: 33.7-75.8; Sleep disturbance: 1=very much to 5=not at all, T-scores: 32.0-73.3; Ability to participate in social roles or activities: 1=always to 5=never, T-scores: 27.5-64.2. High scores signify more of domain being measured. Thus, on symptom-oriented domains, higher scores=worse symptomatology and a negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. On function-oriented domains, higher score=better functioning and a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
