      The study evaluates the the utility of a non-invasive skin measurement as a biomarker of&#xD;
      infant food intake during complementary feeding.&#xD;

      RATIONALE: During infancy, children go from consuming primarily breast milk or formula, to&#xD;
      consuming a variety of baby foods and table foods. Doctors, researchers, and community health&#xD;
      workers are interested in knowing what foods infants eat, but since many infants have&#xD;
      multiple adult caregivers, it can be hard for one caregiver to accurately recall the dietary&#xD;
      pattern of the infant. A rapid, non-invasive biomarker of food intake in infants could serve&#xD;
      as a useful monitoring tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: In order to develop a non-invasive measure of infant food intake, the association&#xD;
      between infant dietary patterns, skin carotenoids, and blood carotenoids will be evaluated at&#xD;
      4, 6, and 8 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Infants will visit the research center at 4, 6, and 8 months of age for length,&#xD;
      weight, skinfold thickness, and skin colorant measures. An infant blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected at each visit and lactating mothers will be asked to provide a breast milk sample.&#xD;
      The caregiver will complete a food survey at each visit, will keep an infant food diary for a&#xD;
      week at 4, 6, and 8 months of age, and will enter the food diaries into an online survey 3&#xD;
      times during each of the diary weeks.&#xD;

        Subjects will be recruited using the CNRC and BCM clinical study recruitment websites and&#xD;
        listservs, the CNRC volunteer database, word of mouth, and approved flyers posted on the&#xD;
        BCM campus, the Texas Children's Health Plan Center for Women and Children clinics, the&#xD;
        Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of Medicine (TCH/BCM) pediatric clinics, and the&#xD;
        TCH/BCM obstetrics and gynecology clinics. We will also distribute flyers in-person&#xD;
        (pending the permission of the clinic) in the waiting rooms of the TCH/BCM pediatrics and&#xD;
        Texas Children's Health Plan Clinic and at sites throughout the community.&#xD;
