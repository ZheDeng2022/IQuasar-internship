  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past few decades, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have rapidly&#xD;
      developed as effective, and probably the most cost-effective, tools to connect most, if not&#xD;
      all, aspects of family lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To promote family harmony, The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust has initiated the Jockey&#xD;
      Club SMART Family-Link Project in collaboration with The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and&#xD;
      NGOs. This project, making effective use of information and communications technology (ICT)&#xD;
      and data analytics, is aimed at helping 26 NGO-operated Integrated Family Service Centres and&#xD;
      Integrated Service Centres (Centres) enhance the quality and efficiency of their family&#xD;
      service. The project is also aimed at building the capabilities of front-line workers so as&#xD;
      to achieve the goal of enhancing family well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aim to gain a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the current level of&#xD;
      ICT use by the providers of family services in Hong Kong, and their anticipated future&#xD;
      direction regarding ICT use. In-depth and focus group interviews are conducted for the&#xD;
      stakeholders (such as heads of service, programme directors, counsellors and service users)&#xD;
      from the non-government organisations (NGOs) and the Social Welfare Department. The&#xD;
      interviews help identify the concerns of social service and related workers and the needs of&#xD;
      the participating NGOs in the development of the ICT system and the application in their&#xD;
      services. The needs and concerns of the stakeholders in using ICTs in family services will be&#xD;
      identified. It can facilitate the planning and designing of the system, the community&#xD;
      programmes, and the training and sharing platform. The system will better fit the needs of&#xD;
      the social service sector. In addition, the impact of JC SMART Family-Link Project on the&#xD;
      stakeholder in family services will be evaluated through questionnaire survey and focus group&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;

      Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) as a global trend refers to a cluster of&#xD;
      technologies that are used to share, distribute, gather, and communicate information. ICTs&#xD;
      encompass hardware that is often Internet capable such as computers, smart phones, and&#xD;
      tablets, as well as the software and applications, such as email, social media sites, and&#xD;
      video conferencing that are used on these devices. In Hong Kong, as of March 2016, the number&#xD;
      of mobile service subscribers was 16.72 million, representing one of highest penetration&#xD;
      rates in the world at about 228.3 per cent; amongst these subscribers, 14.69 million were 3G/&#xD;
      4G service customers. As of March 2016, a surge to 20,557 Terabytes (or an average of 1,358&#xD;
      Megabytes per 2.5G/3G/4G mobile user) was recorded for local mobile data usage, representing&#xD;
      a growth of 1.18 times and 1.58 times over the same period in 2015 and 2014 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the review on family services in Hong Kong in 2000, pilot projects on the&#xD;
      Integrated Family Service Centre (IFSC) service mode, were conducted in 2002. The Review&#xD;
      report &quot;Building Effective Family Services: Review on the Implementation of the IFSC Service&#xD;
      Mode&quot; stated that the IFSC service mode is an appropriate service mode for public-funded&#xD;
      family services in Hong Kong. However, the Review also identified factors hindering the&#xD;
      delivery of IFSC services. These hindering factors are the namely poor accessibility of some&#xD;
      IFSCs, heavy workload, and stigmatisation. With the use of ICT, these hindering factors can&#xD;
      be overcome, thus improving the IFSC service mode. The Review also recommended that &quot;IFSCs&#xD;
      should explore service enhancement through appropriate use and sharing of information&#xD;
      technology.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the current level of ICT use by providers of&#xD;
      family services in Hong Kong, and their anticipated future direction regarding ICT use, focus&#xD;
      group interviews are conducted with various stakeholders, including heads of service and&#xD;
      programme directors at Hong Kong NGOs running IFSCs, and social service workers and service&#xD;
      users of various IFSCs. Focus group interviews and survey questionnaires for service&#xD;
      providers and service users are used to collect the information on the view and use of ICT in&#xD;
      their daily practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust has initiated the Jockey Club SMART Family-Link&#xD;
      Project in collaboration with The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and NGOs to promote the&#xD;
      effective use of information and communications technology (ICT) and data analytics in family&#xD;
      services. This project is aimed at helping 26 NGO-operated Integrated Family Service Centres&#xD;
      and Integrated Service Centres (Centres) devise an innovative and evidence-based family&#xD;
      service delivery model that leverages the effective use of ICT and data analytics and enhance&#xD;
      the quality and efficiency of their family service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to (i) understand the current practice of ICT use in family services and&#xD;
      identify the needs and concerns of the stakeholders (heads of service, programme directors,&#xD;
      counsellors, social service and related workers, and service users) on using ICTs in family&#xD;
      services; and (ii) assess the impact of the Jockey Club SMART Family-Link Project.&#xD;
