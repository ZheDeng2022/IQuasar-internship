  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/Ib study whose purpose is to find out if combining an experimental drug&#xD;
      called binimetinib with pembrolizumab is beneficial in people who have advanced non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. This study may also see if the combination is safe and may also find the&#xD;
      best dose of binimetinib that should be added to pembrolizumab.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will have two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - During this part, also called the dose de-escalation part, an initial group of 6&#xD;
      participants will receive a certain planned dose of binimetinib in addition to a standard&#xD;
      dose of pembrolizumab. If this combination is found to be safe during the first 28 days of&#xD;
      receiving the study drugs, this will be considered the most appropriate dose of the study&#xD;
      drug combination (the highest dose of binimetinib that can be given with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      without causing serious side effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib - Once the appropriate dose of binimetinib is confirmed in Phase I (as described&#xD;
      above), additional participants will be enrolled in the Phase Ib to further test how safe,&#xD;
      tolerable, and effective the study drugs at that dose level. Phase Ib will also evaluate the&#xD;
      anti-tumour activity of binimetinib and pembrolizumab in participants with advanced non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Binimetinib is a drug that, inside the cell, blocks an important series of chemical reactions called a molecular pathway. Binimetinib blocks the MEK1/2 pathway from working. In some types of cancers, this pathway becomes too active, which can cause tumor cell growth. Blocking the MEK1/2 pathway from working is thought to slow or stop tumor cell growth.</description>

    <intervention_name>Pembrolizumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy drug that is approved by Health Canada for the treatment of patients with PD-L1 positive non-small cell lung cancer as a first treatment. PD-1 is a type of protein that binds to another type of protein known as PD-L1. When these proteins bind together, it helps prevent cells from killing each other, including cancer cells. Some drugs, like pembrolizumab, are used to block PD-1 from binding to PD-L1. When the protein is blocked, the body's immune system can kill more cells.</description>
