      The study team will test a multilevel package of interventions to connect adolescent girls&#xD;
      and young women (AGYW) with a source of regular care to provide a sustainable platform for&#xD;
      successful implementation of regular human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing and support&#xD;
      for linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiviral treatment. Interventions&#xD;
      will include integrated wellness care (IWC) clinics and the SHIELD intervention (Support for&#xD;
      HIV Integrated Education, Linkages to care, and Destigmatization) to educate and empower AGYW&#xD;
      and their families, and to create community-based youth clubs to foster peer support. A&#xD;
      cluster randomized controlled trial will be implemented with 6 geographic regions randomized&#xD;
      into 3 groups: zones with IWC clinics and SHIELD intervention, zones with only SHIELD&#xD;
      intervention, and control zones with no intervention. HIV testing will be assessed among the&#xD;
      SHIELD only HIV negative or unknown (HIV-/u) cohort and retention in care along with viral&#xD;
      load suppression will be primarily assessed in the IWC clinics and SHIELD HIV positive (HIV+)&#xD;
      cohort. In-depth interviews and surveys will be used to gather staff and stakeholder feedback&#xD;
      following the trial. Cost-effectiveness of the interventions and budgetary impacts will be&#xD;
      assessed through using a cost assessment tool.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to develop and test a multilevel package of interventions&#xD;
      to connect adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) of ages 10-24 in Zambia with a source of&#xD;
      regular care to provide a sustainable platform for successful implementation of regular HIV&#xD;
      testing and support for linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiviral&#xD;
      treatment. To meet the overall goal, the study team will adapt prior tools to create&#xD;
      integrated wellness care (IWC) clinics and the SHIELD intervention (Support for HIV&#xD;
      Integrated Education, Linkages to care, and Destigmatization) to educate and empower AGYW and&#xD;
      their families, and to create community-based youth clubs to foster peer support. The&#xD;
      researchers will test the hypothesis that the combination of IWC clinics, age-appropriate&#xD;
      SHIELD interventions for AGYW and their families, and peer support will increase HIV testing,&#xD;
      retention in care, and viral load suppression compared to the current standard-of-care&#xD;
      clinical services with or without the SHIELD intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SHIELD intervention is based on social cognitive theory, which posits that positive&#xD;
      behavior change requires knowledge and skills to increase behavioral capability, development&#xD;
      of self-efficacy to increase the belief that one can achieve the desired outcomes, and social&#xD;
      support to provide positive reinforcement and develop positive outcomes expectations. The&#xD;
      researchers will develop a three-session, six-module program for AGYW that increases&#xD;
      knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy to engage along the HIV prevention and care continuum,&#xD;
      and a two-session, four-module program for family members to increase social support.&#xD;
      Intervention content for both AGYW and families will be tailored for five distinct groups to&#xD;
      reflect development stage and AGYW's HIV status. Modules will be adapted from existing&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions, such as Stepping Stones and Families Matter! based on community&#xD;
      advisory board (CAB) and youth advisory board (YAB) input and formative research with AGYW,&#xD;
      caregivers, and community leaders. Modules will address HIV prevention and treatment, general&#xD;
      wellness and sexual and reproductive health (SRH), approaches to combat stigma and&#xD;
      discrimination, and skills for better communication, and include new content on health&#xD;
      service availability and access to increase self-efficacy in seeking health care services. In&#xD;
      addition to the education modules, we will establish youth clubs for the five distinct groups&#xD;
      by adapting those created for a prior initiative. Youth clubs will be facilitated by peer&#xD;
      navigators, who will be AGYW aged 16 to 24 years, and trained in participant confidentiality,&#xD;
      AGYW rights, basic counseling skills, overview of SRH and HIV continuum of care, processes of&#xD;
      referral and linkages for health services, recruitment strategies, and study aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formative Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      To inform the adaptation of existing materials and new content for the SHIELD intervention,&#xD;
      the study team will conduct formative research with AGYW, their parents, and community&#xD;
      leaders to explore their perceptions of HIV, stigma, and social support. The study team will&#xD;
      conduct in-depth interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGD) with AGYWs to explore&#xD;
      their knowledge about HIV and the perceived importance of prevention, testing, and&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence (as applicable). The study team will examine barriers&#xD;
      and facilitators to HIV care or prevention, with a focus on the types of stigma experienced&#xD;
      and social support. The study team will also explore AGYW's knowledge of availability of&#xD;
      health services and their preferences for service delivery, which will also inform the&#xD;
      discrete choice experiment (DCE) attributes and levels. The researchers will conduct focus&#xD;
      group discussions (FGDs) with parents and other caregivers of HIV-uninfected AGYW, and FGDs&#xD;
      with caregivers of HIV-infected AGYW, to discuss participant's views about their daughters'&#xD;
      access to SRH services and HIV care, the stigma that AGYW and their families experience when&#xD;
      AGYW use these services, and barriers to and facilitators of family support for AGYW's access&#xD;
      to care. Finally, the research team will conduct IDIs with community stakeholders such as&#xD;
      health care providers, church leaders, and teachers to explore their views on how best to&#xD;
      reduce stigma within their communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from the formative research will help to identify content that should be adapted or&#xD;
      added to the SHIELD intervention to address locally relevant barriers to HIV prevention,&#xD;
      testing, treatment, and care. The researchers will review the findings and develop draft&#xD;
      training modules and the youth club protocols. The modules will be tested with participants&#xD;
      from each AGYW cohort, families of HIV-uninfected AGYW, and families of HIV-infected AGYW to&#xD;
      fine-tune content and delivery. The data from this pre-testing phase will be used to make&#xD;
      final revisions to the intervention content, manual, and training materials in preparation&#xD;
      for the trial implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IWC Clinic Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      IWC clinics will be created within health facilities where AGYWs can receive sexual and&#xD;
      reproductive health services, including HIV testing and treatment, family planning, sexually&#xD;
      transmitted disease screening and treatment, and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination. IWC&#xD;
      clinics will be established in existing government health facilities and will follow the&#xD;
      model of the cervical cancer screening clinics. SOPs will be developed to include HIV, HPV&#xD;
      vaccination, and SRH clinical guidelines specific to the AGYW, care pathways mapped out for&#xD;
      common problems or conditions, procedures to maintain patient privacy, quality assurance&#xD;
      checklists, and details on documentation and data capture (pre-programed computer tablets&#xD;
      will be used to enter study data). The researchers will also map out the physical structure&#xD;
      and layout of the room for the IWC to ensure ergonomics in patient care processes and offer&#xD;
      privacy for physical exams. The study team will explore the best options for placement of the&#xD;
      IWC clinic within the health facilities with the use of at least two rooms: one devoted to&#xD;
      the intake process and another for medical examinations. To accommodate AGYW who are&#xD;
      generally not available to attend clinics during work or school hours, the IWC operational&#xD;
      hours will include early morning, late evening, and weekend hours. Given this proposed&#xD;
      schedule, it may be possible to share space with the cervical cancer screening clinic, which&#xD;
      generally has at least two dedicated rooms and operates on a more conventional workday&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IWC clinic and health center staff will be trained to ensure that staff offer holistic HIV&#xD;
      and SRH services, including family planning, sexually transmitted infection diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment, and condom promotion, in a nonjudgmental and friendly manner. This training will&#xD;
      include learning the standard operating procedures (SOPs), gaining hands-on experience by&#xD;
      shadowing nurses based at the same facility to understand clinic procedures, and stigma&#xD;
      training that can give staff the skills to create a stigma-free health facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DCE along with a supplemental survey will be administered to systematically evaluate&#xD;
      preferences for HIV clinical care services. AGYW will be asked to choose among constructed&#xD;
      scenarios with varying combinations of key attributes relevant to HIV and other clinical care&#xD;
      services (for example, service availability, wait time, operating hours, provider type, and&#xD;
      protection of privacy); choosing not to attend the clinic will also be an option. To permit&#xD;
      use in a low-literacy environment and to ensure an AGYW-tailored approach, the attributes and&#xD;
      levels will be converted into graphics. The DCE selection will generate 200 possible&#xD;
      scenarios based on attributes and levels. To select a fractional set of scenarios (target of&#xD;
      128 profiles), the study team will employ a randomized design process that ensures that&#xD;
      respondents see well-balanced and near-orthogonal fractions of the full-choice design (eight&#xD;
      choice decisions per respondent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team plans to perform sub-analyses by age group and HIV status to assess&#xD;
      differences by developmental stage and have ensured that the sample size of 1,000 HIV-/u&#xD;
      (approximately 330 in three groups) and 800 HIV+ (400 in 2 groups) will be adequate to&#xD;
      perform the planned analysis. In addition to the choice tasks, the study team will administer&#xD;
      a supplemental survey to obtain demographics, socioeconomic status, reproductive history,&#xD;
      access to care, attitudes towards using formal medical care, and stigma associated with HIV&#xD;
      diagnosis. The findings from the DCE will be supplemented with information gained from other&#xD;
      qualitative (interviews and focus groups) and quantitative (patient supplemental survey) data&#xD;
      collection to ensure a comprehensive and context-based interpretation of the results. These&#xD;
      findings will be used to tailor the services, hours of operation, and overall structure of&#xD;
      the IWC clinic-based intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will conduct pilot testing to assess the SOPs in practice, and review the&#xD;
      patient flow and interaction with the IWC staff. The study team will recruit a sample of AGYW&#xD;
      from the clinic catchment area to receive services at one of the IWC clinics. Each AGYW will&#xD;
      be offered HPV vaccination, counseling for HIV testing, and SRH services; the AGYW will also&#xD;
      be encouraged to discuss additional health care needs. Those who choose to receive HPV&#xD;
      vaccination will be given a follow-up appointment so the study team can also monitor the&#xD;
      process of providing the second vaccine dose (second dose will be provided at 6 weeks or 6&#xD;
      months, depending on the 2- or 3-dose schedule; AGYW will be followed to ensure they complete&#xD;
      the required doses, but only the 6-week dosage will be included in the pilot study). The&#xD;
      study team will use time and motion methodology to monitor the AGYW interaction and&#xD;
      activities at the clinic from initial check-in to the end of the visit; the data will be used&#xD;
      to assess patient wait times and disruptions in the patient flow. This information, along&#xD;
      with the feedback from the AGYW (who will undergo a short interview at the end of the first&#xD;
      visit) and the IWC nurse and peer navigator team (interviewed at the completion of all pilot&#xD;
      test visits), will help identify any changes that need to be incorporated to improve the care&#xD;
      processes. The SOPs will be revised by incorporating lessons from the pilot testing, and the&#xD;
      nurses will receive additional training when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort recruitment and sampling frame&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identify AGYW to establish a sampling frame. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health&#xD;
      (MOH), we will identify six health centers or clinics that provide HIV services and cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening in Lusaka district. The study team will identify AGYW for inclusion in the&#xD;
      catchment areas of these clinics, zones immediately surrounding the clinics. To avoid&#xD;
      potential cross-contamination, the study team will select clinic zones that are not&#xD;
      contiguous. The AGYW recruited using this approach will serve as the cohort for conducting&#xD;
      the DCE and the sampling frame for random selection to participate in the cluster randomized&#xD;
      trial. The sample sizes required for these follow-on assessments were taken into account in&#xD;
      determining the size of the initial HIV-/u and HIV+ cohorts, and the feasibility of&#xD;
      recruiting the targeted number of AGYW is based on prior and ongoing studies conducted by the&#xD;
      grant team. The systematic approach to establishing the sampling frame will provide discrete,&#xD;
      non-duplicated individuals (the participant list will be updated daily); reduce selection&#xD;
      bias by ensuring a more representative sampling for the cluster randomized trial; and also,&#xD;
      if necessary, allow for adjustments in the random selection process so AGYW cohorts are&#xD;
      similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the HIV-/u cohort, the study team will map out each neighborhood and households&#xD;
      within the clinic catchment area with the assistance of the local Neighborhood Health&#xD;
      Committees, the community liaisons attached to the clinics, and the outreach staff from the&#xD;
      cervical cancer program. Peer Navigators (PNs) will visit each household, beginning with&#xD;
      residential areas closest to the clinics, to identify eligible AGYW and recruit them to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Participants will be notified of their rights, that questions&#xD;
      regarding HIV status will be discussed, and that their refusal to participate will not affect&#xD;
      their access to health care or other services. All AGYW 18 years of age and older will&#xD;
      provide written informed consent in their preferred language, and parental consent will be&#xD;
      obtained for participants under 18 years of age followed by assent from these minors. The&#xD;
      study team will include one AGYW per household and enroll AGYW on a continual basis until&#xD;
      desired enrollment targets are reached. Participants in the HIV-/u cohort must (a) be female;&#xD;
      (b) be 10 to 20 years of age; and (c) self-report their HIV status as negative or unknown (no&#xD;
      HIV testing within the past 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team has selected the 10 to 20 age group because this is the highest-priority&#xD;
      cohort and because prevention interventions are best targeted to this age group, as high-risk&#xD;
      young women older than 20 years are likely to be HIV positive already. Additional inclusion&#xD;
      criteria include (d) is not pregnant, does not suspect she is pregnant, and does not express&#xD;
      desire to become pregnant over the next 18 months; (e) is willing to sign a release for&#xD;
      medical records (to obtain clinic data on service use); (f) plans to reside in the current&#xD;
      location for the next 18 months; and (g) has not been part of the other planned formative&#xD;
      research activities. The study team is excluding pregnant AGYW because their motivations and&#xD;
      health-seeking behaviors are likely to change during pregnancy, they require specialized&#xD;
      antenatal care, and they are not eligible for the HPV vaccine that will be offered to the IWC&#xD;
      clinic participants. All pregnant AGYW identified during the study will be offered assistance&#xD;
      to obtain care at appropriate antenatal clinics. The study team will recruit 160 to 170&#xD;
      adolescent girls from each clinic catchment area, with equal numbers in 10 to 12, 13 to 15,&#xD;
      and 16 to 20 age ranges, for a total of 1,000 girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the HIV+ cohort, to maintain confidentially, the study team will request that health&#xD;
      providers and community outreach staff at target clinics, along with staff from&#xD;
      community-based testing centers, approach eligible HIV+ AGYW who reside in the clinic&#xD;
      catchment area (identified through patient record review). The use of community outreach&#xD;
      staff will allow targeting AGYW who are HIV+ but not receiving treatment. Those who&#xD;
      voluntarily indicate that they are HIV positive during recruitment of the HIV-/u cohort will&#xD;
      also be given the opportunity to enroll in the HIV+ cohort when eligible. Participants who&#xD;
      are female, 16 to 24 years of age, and diagnosed with HIV within the past 3 years (to target&#xD;
      relatively recently diagnosed AGYW at the time of recruitment) will be eligible for inclusion&#xD;
      in the study. The study team will continue enrollment until the enrollment target is reached.&#xD;
      Those who receive a new HIV+ diagnosis during the 3-month recruitment time frame will also be&#xD;
      included. In Zambia, sexual acts with adolescents younger than 16 years, even if consensual,&#xD;
      are considered criminal. Given the possible negative repercussions that AGYW may experience&#xD;
      should they be reported and our desire to maintain a trusting relationship with the&#xD;
      communities that are served, the study team will not recruit adolescent girls aged 15 years&#xD;
      and younger for the HIV+ cohort. The study team will enroll a total of 800 HIV+ AGYW,&#xD;
      targeting a similar number (130 to 140) from each clinic zone with equal representation among&#xD;
      those 16 to 20 and 21 to 24 years of age. The additional inclusion criteria will also be&#xD;
      applied to the HIV+ cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will collect data from AGYW, their caregiver (identified by AGYW), clinical&#xD;
      staff, and PNs electronically using computer tablets with pre-loaded software and&#xD;
      instruments. Instruments will be available in English, Bemba, Nyanja, and Tonga as needed. To&#xD;
      facilitate use by younger girls who may not be fully literate, the study team will include a&#xD;
      voice-enabled component, which will allow AGYW to listen and respond to questions. In&#xD;
      addition, AGYW can use the tablet, along with headphones, to self-administer the instrument&#xD;
      to answer sensitive questions related to sexual risk and HIV status. All instruments for data&#xD;
      collection will be created (with adjustments as needed for each AGYW age group) and&#xD;
      pretested, using the same set of AGYW and caregivers selected for pretesting the SHIELD&#xD;
      intervention. The study team will also identify five clinical staff and five PNs who will not&#xD;
      be participating in the study to pretest provider specific data collection instruments. To&#xD;
      ensure the highest level of fidelity and adherence to the protocol, all data collectors will&#xD;
      receive in-depth training and monitoring. Additionally, the study team will be abstracting&#xD;
      required data elements through clinic audit from the six clinic sites included in the study;&#xD;
      the study team have the Zambian Ministry of Health's (MOH's) support to interact with clinic&#xD;
      personnel and conduct record abstraction. The study team will perform pilot data abstraction&#xD;
      to review quality of data at each site and conduct a series of trainings for clinic staff to&#xD;
      address problems identified and implement procedures to ensure high-quality data are&#xD;
      available for the study.&#xD;
