  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) for Veteran participants with alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder co-occurring with mild traumatic brain injury and/or post-traumatic stress disorder.&#xD;
      The treatment intervention is repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and the&#xD;
      goal is to reduce alcohol craving with this treatment. The study will enroll 20 Veteran&#xD;
      participants. Half of these participants will receive real rTMS and half of the participants&#xD;
      will receive placebo rTMS. rTMS treatment will be provided over 10 sessions that will occur&#xD;
      once every weekday for 2 weeks. Veteran participants will then complete follow-up phone calls&#xD;
      to further evaluate alcohol craving and other symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder (AUD) are high priority disorders for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in&#xD;
      part, because these disorders rarely occur in isolation. The co-occurrence compounds brain&#xD;
      impairment and negatively impacts symptom presentation and rehabilitation effectiveness.&#xD;
      Veterans with co-occurring AUD, mTBI and/or PTSD have few effective treatment options. Thus,&#xD;
      treatment development for these Veterans is of great need. The aim of this protocol is to&#xD;
      examine safety, feasibility, and the behavioral and neural effects of an repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) intervention for Veterans with AUD and co-occurring&#xD;
      mTBI and/or PTSD. Behavioral and neural effects of rTMS will be examined after the first rTMS&#xD;
      session and after the last rTMS session. The investigators hypothesize that the rTMS&#xD;
      intervention will be 1) safe, 2) feasible and 3) efficacious. Specifically, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that there will be no adverse events related to the rTMS intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that all participants enrolled will successfully complete all rTMS&#xD;
      sessions. The investigators hypothesize that participants treated with active rTMS, relative&#xD;
      to placebo rTMS, will have reduced alcohol craving severity levels. Finally, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that participants treated with active rTMS relative to placebo rTMS&#xD;
      will have reduced brain activation in response to alcohol cues and improved functional&#xD;
      connectivity after the last rTMS session. This is a prospective, pilot, double-blind&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of the intervention rTMS. There will be 2 groups of Veterans with&#xD;
      AUD and co-occurring mTBI and/or PTSD those given 1) active rTMS and those given 2) placebo&#xD;
      rTMS. Targeted enrollment for this study is 20 Veterans: n=10 active rTMS and n=10 placebo&#xD;
      rTMS. Participants will be screened for safety and evaluated on mental health-related&#xD;
      behavioral measures. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive active or placebo&#xD;
      rTMS. Participants will then complete motor thresholding (MT) to determine rTMS intensity.&#xD;
      Participants will then complete 10 sessions of rTMS. These sessions will be completed once&#xD;
      daily on week days over two weeks. TMS pulses will be applied to the left DLPFC at 10Hz rate,&#xD;
      4.9 seconds per train, with inter-train interval of 30 seconds, and a total of 20 trains per&#xD;
      session. After the 10th rTMS session, participants will complete an MRI which will last&#xD;
      approximately 1hour. A sub-sample of participants will complete an MRI immediately after the&#xD;
      first rTMS session. Participants will also repeat the mental health behavioral measures after&#xD;
      the last rTMS session. Participants will complete follow-up phone interviews to assess for&#xD;
      alcohol craving, mTBI symptoms and PTSD symptoms at one day, one week and one month&#xD;
      post-rTMS. Completion of this study is an essential first step towards treatment development&#xD;
      for Veterans with co-occurring AUD, mTBI and/or PTSD.&#xD;

    <masking_description>A unblinded member(s) of the research team will be provided with randomization codes from the study biostatistician. A unblended research team member will then provide the PI and rTMS treatment providers with a specific code for the rTMS device. rTMS providers enter the specific rTMS code into the rTMS device and the device is designed to deliver active or placebo rTMS based on this code. The rTMS device is designed to deliver placebo rTMS that looks, sounds and feels like active rTMS.</masking_description>
