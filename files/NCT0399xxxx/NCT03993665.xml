      The investigators aim to validate specific MRI parameters that could improve diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of metastatic cervical lymph nodes in patients with a squamous cell carcinoma in the&#xD;
      head and neck region. Moreover, we aim to explore specific MRI parameters that could improve&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of bone invasion and tumour relapse, as well as predict treatment&#xD;
      response and survival in this target population.&#xD;

      Background: The locoregional control rates in patients with advanced head and neck cancer&#xD;
      remain suboptimal. Accurate diagnosis of metastatic cervical lymph nodes, bone invasion, or&#xD;
      tumour relapse in a previously irradiated or operated field remains challenging.&#xD;
      Technological advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enable to quantify diffusion and&#xD;
      perfusion of the tumour and its surrounding tissues, which could improve diagnostic&#xD;
      performance. Moreover, they could provide additional information about radiation and/or&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic efficiency in an individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The investigators aim to validate specific MRI parameters that could improve&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of metastatic cervical lymph nodes in patients with a squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma in the head and neck region. Moreover, we aim to explore specific MRI parameters&#xD;
      that could improve diagnostic accuracy of bone invasion and tumour relapse, as well as&#xD;
      predict treatment response and survival in this target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this trial, a validation cohort will be recruited in a prospective manner, to&#xD;
      validate the MRI parameters that showed clinically acceptable discriminant value based on the&#xD;
      retrospective study. The values of the selected MRI parameters will be calculated in&#xD;
      metastatic lymph nodes of the affected group, for comparison with their values measured in&#xD;
      the lymph nodes of a prospectively recruited control group, comprising patients who require&#xD;
      the same standardized MRI protocol for evaluation of a Whartin tumour or pleomorphic adenoma&#xD;
      of the parotid gland without malignant transformation, and in whom both the parotid gland&#xD;
      lesion and the cervical lymph node are surgically removed for histological confirmation. All&#xD;
      included patients of the 'affected group' will also undergo a preoperative positron emission&#xD;
      tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), according to international guidelines, and will&#xD;
      preferably receive a multiparametric MRI at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post treatment&#xD;
      as part of routine follow-up.&#xD;
