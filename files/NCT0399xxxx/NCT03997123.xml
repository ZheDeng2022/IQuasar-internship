    <description>The self-administered instrument includes 23-items and yields 5 multi-item scores (body image, sexual functioning, arm symptoms, breast symptoms, and systemic therapy side effects). Items are scored on a 4-point verbal rating scale: &quot;Not at All,&quot; &quot;A Little,&quot; &quot;Quite a Bit,&quot; and &quot;Very Much&quot;. Scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, where higher scores indicate better unctioning, better HRQoL, or greater level of symptom.</description>

The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be scored according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual (Fayers et al. 2001). Higher scores on the global measure of health status and functional scales indicate better health status/function, but higher scores on symptom scales/scores represent greater symptom severity.</description>
