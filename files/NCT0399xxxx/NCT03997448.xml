    <textblock>
      This study will test the combination of abemaciclib with pembrolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal adenocarcinoma that is metastatic or cannot&#xD;
      be surgically removed, and who have progressed on, or were unable to tolerate, at least 2&#xD;
      earlier courses of treatment for their advanced disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II non-randomized, single arm, open label study of abemaciclib in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal&#xD;
      junction, or esophageal adenocarcinoma who have received at least two lines of prior therapy.&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered in 21-day cycles. Pembrolizumab will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) at a dose of 200 mg on day 1 of each cycle. Abemaciclib will be taken&#xD;
      orally twice a day on each day of the cycle, 150 mg per dose. Treatment will continue until&#xD;
      disease progression or development of unacceptable toxicities.&#xD;

             chemoradiation and had recurrence during or within 6 months of completion of all&#xD;
             treatments may count adjuvant therapy as one chemotherapy line.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 as determined by local site&#xD;
             investigator/radiology assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG PS 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have discontinued all previous treatments for cancer (including&#xD;
             cytotoxic chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapy, radiotherapy, and&#xD;
             investigational therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received chemotherapy must have recovered (CTCAE Grade ≤1) from the acute&#xD;
             effects of chemotherapy except for residual alopecia or Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
             A washout period of at least 21 days is required between last systemic therapy dose&#xD;
             and treatment initiation per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A washout period of at least 14 days is required between end of radiotherapy and&#xD;
             treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;

             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least&#xD;
             12 consecutive months.&#xD;

             methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method plus a hormonal&#xD;
             method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are not surgically sterile (vasectomy) must agree to use an acceptable method&#xD;
             of contraception. Male subjects with female sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly&#xD;
             pregnant, or who could become pregnant during the study must agree to use condoms from&#xD;
             the first dose of study drug through at least 60 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             drug. Total abstinence for the same time period is an acceptable alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject&#xD;
             to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study.&#xD;

             Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: The killed virus vaccines used for seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are&#xD;
        allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated&#xD;
        vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children&#xD;
             within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through&#xD;
             60 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab or abemaciclib. (NOTE: breast milk cannot&#xD;
             be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study.)&#xD;
