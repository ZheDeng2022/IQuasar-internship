      The aim of the study is to investigate the use of Hemopatch to prevent biliary fistula in&#xD;
      patients submitted to surgery for malignancy.&#xD;

      Background: Biliary fistula (BF) is one of the most common sources of post hepatectomy&#xD;
      morbidity. International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS) define BF as increased&#xD;
      bilirubin concentration in the drain at least 3 times greater than the serum bilirubin&#xD;
      concentration on or after postoperative day (POD) 3. BF is graded into grade A, B and C,&#xD;
      based on the clinical impact on the postoperative course. Considering ISGLS definition, the&#xD;
      incidence of BF ranges from 4,4% to 27,2%. The definition developed in Humanitas Research&#xD;
      Hospital (HRH), defines BF as bilirubin concentration in the drain fluid greater than 10&#xD;
      mg/dL on or after POD 3. In this case, the incidence is around 8%. Various topical&#xD;
      haemostatic agents have been developed for liver resection area management their usefulness&#xD;
      in preventing BF by using a sealing product on the resection surface still remains unclear&#xD;
      and needs to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: this study aimed to assess the clinical validation of Hemopatch to prevent&#xD;
      post-operative biliary fistula. Secondarily, it is aimed to evaluate the clinical validity of&#xD;
      the two proposed definition of biliary fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: According to the incidence of BF in our previous series (considering ISGLS&#xD;
      definition), we designed a randomized controlled study on 220 patients, who underwent hepatic&#xD;
      resection from 2018 to 2020. Patients were randomized to treatment group A (Hemopatch) and&#xD;
      standard group B (Tisseal and Tabotamp). Both ISGLS and HRH definitions of BF were&#xD;
      considered. All patients were systematically drained. Drains were maintained at least 5 days,&#xD;
      and bilirubin was measured on PODs 3, 5, and 7. Drains were removed if the bilirubin&#xD;
      concentration in the drain fluid was less than 10 mg/dL on POD 7. A statistical analysis to&#xD;
      compare perioperative variables between two groups was performed. Then, a multivariate&#xD;
      analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors for BF.&#xD;
