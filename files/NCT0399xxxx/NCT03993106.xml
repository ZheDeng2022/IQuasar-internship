    <textblock>
      sEphB-HSA may prevent tumor cells from multiplying and blocks several compounds that promote&#xD;
      the growth of blood vessels that bring nutrients to the tumor. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to learn if sEphB4-HSA will decrease the number or size of Kaposi sarcoma lesions in people.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      sEphB4-HSA will be given through an intravenous infusion (into a vein). Each cycle of&#xD;
      sEphB4-HSA will be 28 days (4 weeks). Each cycle of the study drug includes administration of&#xD;
      2 doses of sEphB4-HSA given on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may continue on study protocol as long as their KS is continuing to respond or&#xD;
      is clinically stable on study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may come off treatment for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for more than 2 dose reductions for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose delay more than 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient withdraws consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study termination by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who are noncompliant with respect to taking drugs, keeping appointments, or&#xD;
           having tests required for the evaluation of drug safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant's condition renders them unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment&#xD;
           of the investigator.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Every 4 weeks until study completion (average 6 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The observed proportions of participants experiencing clinical response and unacceptable toxicity will be calculated with 95% confidence intervals. For clinical response, the Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the distribution for time to death assessed for up to 1 month after treatment completion; for time to progression assessed from chemotherapy initiation to first documented progression up to 1 month after treatment completion; and for time to response assessed from the first dose until first documented response up to 1 month after completion of treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method will then be used to estimate the distribution of time to response, time to relapse, and time to death. Adverse events will be tabulated according to type and severity.</description>

             documentation may include a record demonstrating that another physician has documented&#xD;
             the participant's HIV status based on either: 1) approved diagnostic tests, or 2) the&#xD;

             management of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the participant is HIV negative, documentation of a negative result for any&#xD;
                  federally approved, licensed HIV rapid test within 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
                  enrollment will suffice. If the initial rapid test is positive, further approved&#xD;

             investigational therapy) within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)&#xD;
             prior to entering the study OR those who have not recovered from adverse events due to&#xD;
             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to sEphB4-HSA or other agents used in study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants for whom front-line cytotoxic therapy is indicated (i.e. symptomatic&#xD;
             visceral or pulmonary Kaposi Sarcoma or symptomatic Kaposi Sarcoma impairing&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Previous local therapy of any KS-indicator lesion unless the lesion has clearly&#xD;
             progressed since that local treatment. Any prior local treatment to indicator lesions&#xD;

             clear-cut progression of said lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants who are pregnant, lactating, or breast-feeding.&#xD;

             pregnant women and it could have potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with sEphB4-HSA, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
