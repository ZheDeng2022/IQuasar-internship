    <textblock>
      This trial is a phase III multicentre blinded randomised controlled clinical non-inferiority&#xD;
      trial of cryopreserved platelets vs. conventional liquid-stored platelets for the management&#xD;
      of surgical bleeding. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of cryopreserved platelets, compared to conventional liquid-stored platelets,&#xD;
      for the management of surgical bleeding. This trial will recruit cardiac surgical patients&#xD;
      deemed to be at high risk of surgical bleeding and who may potentially require transfusion of&#xD;
      platelets. It is estimated to require 808 high-risk cardiac surgical patients to be&#xD;
      recruited, to obtain 202 patients who receive transfused study platelets for surgical&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For logistic reasons and in order to use this scarce resource optimally, liquid-stored&#xD;
      platelets are not stored in smaller hospitals, or in deployed military hospitals. Patients in&#xD;
      these hospitals therefore currently have limited or no access to platelet transfusion.&#xD;
      Cryopreservation of platelets is a promising technology that would allow smaller hospitals to&#xD;
      provide platelet transfusions, reduce overall platelet wastage, and possibly produce better&#xD;
      patient outcomes through more effective haemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase III multicentre blinded randomised controlled clinical non-inferiority trial&#xD;
      of cryopreserved platelets vs. conventional liquid-stored platelets for the management of&#xD;
      surgical bleeding. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of cryopreserved platelets, compared to conventional liquid-stored platelets,&#xD;
      for the management of surgical bleeding. This trial will recruit cardiac surgical patients&#xD;
      deemed to be at high risk of surgical bleeding and who may potentially require transfusion of&#xD;
      platelets. It is estimated to require 808 high-risk cardiac surgical patients to be&#xD;
      recruited, to obtain 202 patients who receive transfused study platelets for surgical&#xD;
      bleeding. The study will recruit patients in Australian tertiary hospitals.The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that cryopreserved platelets will be at least as effective as conventional&#xD;
      liquid-stored platelets in the treatment of active bleeding due to surgery.&#xD;
