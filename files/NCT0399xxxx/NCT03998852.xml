  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apathy is a neurocognitive syndrome characterized by reduced goal-directed behaviors,&#xD;
      contributing to decreased patient and caregiver quality of life. Apathy pathophysiology&#xD;
      involves disruption of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops, modulated by several&#xD;
      neurotransmitter systems including dopamine and acetylcholine, thus complexifying&#xD;
      pharmacological management. Post-stroke apathy (PSA) can provide a proper in vivo model to&#xD;
      study the underlying neurochemical substrates of apathy as a syndrome. The present project&#xD;
      aims to provide a better characterization of the cholinergic and dopaminergic functioning in&#xD;
      apathy as a syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to precise the respective alterations of these two systems, investigators will use a&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging of dopaminergic (with [18F]-FDOPA, a&#xD;
      marker of the decarboxylating enzyme of dopamine) and - for the first time in apathetic&#xD;
      patients - cholinergic (with [18F]-FEOBV, a marker of the vesicular acetylcholine&#xD;
      transporter) transmissions in 15 apathetic and 15 unapathetic patients 3 months after stroke,&#xD;
      without overlapping depression. This dual imaging study may provide help in guiding&#xD;
      therapeutic management of PSA. The functional network analysis allowed by functional MRI is&#xD;
      crucial to complement regional neurotransmitter deficits observed with PET. Altogether, a&#xD;
      multimodal approach in apathy, combining PET and MRI, can allow identifying which circuits of&#xD;
      the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops are disrupted and how these circuits are modulated&#xD;
      by other neurotransmitters.&#xD;
