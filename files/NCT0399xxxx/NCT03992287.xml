    <textblock>
      This study was a 12 weeks, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial. 46&#xD;
      subjects were randomly divided into Hydrolysed Red Ginseng extract 10ml or placebo group. The&#xD;
      investigators measured Ocular Surface Disease Index, tear break-up time, Visual analog scale,&#xD;
      Schirmer's test, meibomian gland test and Fluorescein staining.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes of Ocular Surface Disease Index</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire which is Ocular Surface Disease Index consisted of 12 questions each of which included visual symptoms, visual work status, and environmental factors.&#xD;
The Ocular Surface Disease Index scores are ranged from 0 to 100, and the high score is the more severe the symptoms. The Ocular Surface Disease Index score is calculated as follows.&#xD;
: (Sum of all items answered × 25) / total number of questions answered</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of tear break-up time</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The tear break-up time test measures the time in seconds. The time is from the last blinking to the point of tear layer defect or streak-like defect after blinking the eye with 1% of fluorescein.&#xD;
10 seconds or more as normal, between 5 and 10 seconds as mild dry eye syndrome, and 5 seconds or less as severe dry eye syndrome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Visual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale(VAS) score is 0 point for no symptom, 10 points for the most severe symptom, and the patient is asked to mark the degree of subjective pain symptoms as an integer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Schirmer's test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Schirmer's test determines whether the eye produces enough tears to keep it moist. This test is used when a person experiences very dry eyes or excessive watering of the eyes. It poses no risk to the subject. A negative (more than 10 mm of moisture on the filter paper in 5 minutes) test result is normal. Both eyes normally secrete the same amount of tears.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of meibomian gland test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Meibomian gland test evaluate 8 Meibum of the upper middle eyelid or lower middle eyelid. The Meibum quality score and the Meibum expressibility score are evaluated as follows.&#xD;
Meibum quality score 0 = clear fluid&#xD;
= cloudy fluid&#xD;
= cloudy particulate fluid(with debris)&#xD;
= inspissated (opaque),like toothpaste&#xD;
Meibum expressibility score 0 = all glands expressible&#xD;
= three to four glands expressible&#xD;
= one to two glands expressible&#xD;
= no glands expressible</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Fluorescein staining</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fluorescein staining was evaluated by staining with 1% fluorescein (1% sodium fluorescein 1 μL volume), and then assessed for damage after corneal and conjunctival staining. The degree of staining of the cornea is divided into 5 sections according to the NEI scale, and each section is judged as 0 ~ 3 scores. It is judgement the degree of severity from 0 to 15 scores per eye. The degree of conjunctival staining is divided into six sections per eye, and each section is scored 0 to 3 scores total 0 ~ 18 scores.</description>
