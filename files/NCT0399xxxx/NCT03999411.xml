    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100%. The ART medication visual analogue scale is an instrument for patients to rate their dose taken percentages. 100% of doses taken will be regarded as good adherence. Participants who scores 95 and higher will provide blood samples for confirmation. Participant's plasma HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid Viral Load (RNA VL) must be &lt; 40 copies/ml to confirm ART adherence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Usability of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The usability of the Crave-to Quit and Emocha apps will be assessed via a questionnaire with scores ranging from 0-10 with the higher score indicating increased comfortability with using the app.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The acceptability is be assessed by 3 items &quot;How satisfied were you with the intervention?&quot;, &quot;How likely are you to recommend this intervention to a friend?&quot; and &quot;How useful was the intervention?&quot; Each question is scored from 0-10 with the higher score indicating increased acceptability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement with the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant engagement is evaluated via self-reported use of the Crave-to-Quit and Emocha apps. Participants will complete a questionnaire indicating how often they used the apps. The scores will range from 0 to 5 with 0 indicating no use at all and 5 indicating daily use.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of delivery will be assessed via evaluating the percentage of: recruitment rate, effort required, screenings conducted, eligible participants, participants who agree to enroll, rescheduled visits, cancellation of visits, missed visits, attrition, lost to follow up, response and adherence/compliance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
