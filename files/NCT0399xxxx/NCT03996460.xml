  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of treatment with K0706 in Dementia with&#xD;
      Lewy Bodies (DLB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that K0706 will be safe and tolerable and that this drug will alter CSF and&#xD;
      plasma biomarkers in DLB. Clinical assessments of cognitive, behavioral and motor functioning&#xD;
      will also be evaluated. A total of 45 participants will be randomized 1:1:1 into 3 groups&#xD;
      (n=15/per group) to be treated with sachet of 192 mg powder of K0706 ( equivalent to 96 mg&#xD;
      capsule of K0706) or sachet of 384 mg powder of K0706 (equivalent to 192 capsule of K0706) or&#xD;
      sachet of matching placebo ( equivalent to a capsule of placebo) for 12 weeks, followed by&#xD;
      4-week wash-out period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is an alpha-synucleinopathy and the second most common form&#xD;
      of dementia in the elderly. DLB shares striking neuropathological and clinical similarities&#xD;
      with both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). DLB and PD are characterized&#xD;
      by death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the nigro-striatal system and formation of&#xD;
      intra-neuronal alpha-synuclein inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LBs). Misfolded&#xD;
      alpha-synuclein aggregates within LBs and apha-synuclein (SYN) is the highest genetic risk&#xD;
      factor for PD and DLB followed by the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) . At autopsy&#xD;
      alpha-synuclein, hyper-phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid plaques are all detected in the&#xD;
      brains of individuals with DLB. Therefore, the neuropathology of DLB overlaps with both PD&#xD;
      and AD, and includes alpha-synuclein accumulation in LBs, p-tau and beta-amyloid deposition .&#xD;
      Potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, including alpha-synuclein, dopamine&#xD;
      metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) , total tau&#xD;
      and p-tau and amyloid beta peptides (Abeta 40/42) may be commonly shared in AD, PD and DLB.&#xD;
      The core clinical features of DLB, include dementia and Parkinsonism in addition to&#xD;
      hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorders&#xD;
      (RBD) . L-Dopa replacement therapies and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may partially&#xD;
      control motor and cognitive symptoms, respectively in DLB. Selective Serotonin Re-uptake&#xD;
      Inhibitors (SSRIs) and antipsychotics manage the behavioral but worsen motor symptoms in DLB.&#xD;
      There is a major unmet medical need for further research into DLB to identify potential&#xD;
      therapies for this disease and provide significant insights into the treatment of other&#xD;
      Parkinsonian and memory disorders. A major challenge facing DLB is to develop a therapy that&#xD;
      can halt neuronal death and alleviate cognitive, motor and behavioral symptoms. No&#xD;
      therapeutic approach exists to alter the levels of neurotoxic proteins such as&#xD;
      alpha-synuclein and halt DA and other neuronal death in DLB. One mechanism to degrade&#xD;
      neurotoxic proteins is autophagy , which is a process by which the cell can degrade its own&#xD;
      contents. There is evidence that autophagy is impaired in neurodegeneration , leading to&#xD;
      failure of degradation of protein aggregates, including misfolded alpha-synuclein.&#xD;
      Importantly, autophagy is exploited therapeutically in several diseases, including adult&#xD;
      chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) induce autophagy, leading&#xD;
      to destruction of rapidly dividing tumor cells in CML and degradation of neurotoxic proteins,&#xD;
      including alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid and p-tau in PD and AD models. Sun Pharma Advanced&#xD;
      Research Company Limited (SPARC Ltd.) is developing K0706, for the treatment of adult&#xD;
      patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)&#xD;
      that is resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy or Philadelphia positive acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) that is resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy; and&#xD;
      its ability to slow down progression of PD. Using allometric scaling and an average human&#xD;
      body weight of 70kg an oral dose of 15-30mg/kg once daily in mice corresponds to an oral&#xD;
      human equivalent dose (HED) of 85-160 mg which is within the tolerated dose in both CML and&#xD;
      PD. Therefore, the effects of a sachet of 192 mg powder of K0706 (equivalent to 96 mg capsule&#xD;
      of K0706 ) and a sachet of 384 mg powder of K0706( equivalet to 192 mg capsule of K0706) and&#xD;
      a sachet of matching placebo taken daily by mouth for 12 weeks, followed by a 4 week wash-out&#xD;
      period will be evaluated in individuals diagnosed with DLB. The data obtained from this study&#xD;
      will serve as a proof of concept for future placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with DLB, AD, or PD.&#xD;
