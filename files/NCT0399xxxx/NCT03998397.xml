  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients presenting in Emergency Department (ED) present alcohol acute intoxication.&#xD;
      Some previous studies in general population found that young people under- or over-estimated&#xD;
      of blood alcohol concentration (BAC). The hypothesis of the study is that self-estimation of&#xD;
      BAC by the patient is under-estimated. Moreover, comparing self-estimation of BAC and&#xD;
      objective measure of BAC, which is routinely performed in ED, could increase in patients the&#xD;
      awareness of the disorders, increase motivation to change of the patient, and increase the&#xD;
      rates of seeking-treatment six months after the first evaluation, in particular in patients&#xD;
      with alcohol use disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators knowledge, there is no study investigating self-estimation, compared to&#xD;
      objective measurement of blood alcohol concentration in patients with alcohol intoxication&#xD;
      presenting to an Emergency Department (ED). The study will assess blood alcohol concentration&#xD;
      and self-estimates of BAC, using the Subjective Effects of Alcohol Scale for Measuring&#xD;
      Subjective Response to Alcohol in 100 patients with or without alcohol use disorders&#xD;
      according to DSM-5 classification (using MINI scale and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification&#xD;
      Test (AUDIT)&#xD;
