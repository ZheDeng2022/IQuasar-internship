      Patients with high severity of post-surgical pain scores will be randomized to transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) vs sham TMS groups. Both group of patients will have 10 TMS&#xD;
      sessions during 5 days. Our hypothesis is that, the reduction in the severity of pain scores&#xD;
      will be greater among those patients who are randomized to active TMS group compared to sham&#xD;
      TMS group. The investigators will explore how improvements in pain correlate with changes in&#xD;
      brain network connectivity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 25 million adults suffer from chronic pain in the United States making it the&#xD;
      single most common symptom for which patients seek medical care. Although chronic pain can&#xD;
      develop from a variety conditions, surgery is one of the most common and the incidence of&#xD;
      chronic pain after thoracic surgery is particularly high. Opioids have been a mainstay&#xD;
      therapy for post-surgical pain, but there is increasing awareness that post-surgical opioid&#xD;
      use is a risk factor for addiction. Consequently, there are major nationwide efforts underway&#xD;
      to limit opioid use in the post-surgical setting and identify safer options. One promising&#xD;
      modality that has emerged in recent years is the use of non-invasive brain stimulation using&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS provides a method for noninvasively modulating cortical excitability, and a number of&#xD;
      studies have shown that non-invasive neuromodulation can reduce pain in patients suffering&#xD;
      from chronic pain. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to investigate changes in brain networks after TMS and additionally&#xD;
      investigate individual differences in brain network connectivity patterns that predict the&#xD;
      effectiveness of TMS. The investigators expect that active TMS, compared to sham TMS, will&#xD;
      normalize brain network connectivity and lead to lower pain and opioid use after surgery. In&#xD;
      addition, by assessing pre-surgical brain networks, the investigators hope to identify brain&#xD;
      connectivity patterns that predict efficacy of TMS as a post-surgical treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 36 subjects who've undergone thoracic surgery. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit primarily in-patients but may also recruit patients who have gone&#xD;
      home after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During weeks 2-3 Post-Surgery, 5 study visits will be completed, each ranging in duration&#xD;
      from 1 1/2 - 3 hours. All 5 visits include 2 short TMS sessions (10 total), pain and mood&#xD;
      assessments. At V1 and V5, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans will be&#xD;
      completed, as well as additional pain and health related assessments (many only done at V1).&#xD;
      Also, short, follow-up phone calls will be completed at 3 and 6 months post-surgery to assess&#xD;
      pain and other outcomes.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Patients will be randomized to active TMS vs sham TMS groups with approximately a 2:1 ratio. At the end of the study, the investigators expect 24 patients to have active TMS and 12 patients to have sham TMS sessions.&#xD;
Patients in the sham TMS group will have appointments at the same time as the active TMS patients. The TMS device used for the sham TMS group patients will be identical to the active TMS group. Only the stimulation will be different.</masking_description>

    <measure>The change in the severity of pain score after 5 days of active vs sham TMS.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The change in pain score will be calculated based on the following 2 pain scores:&#xD;
Day 1 NRS is the severity of pain collected at the beginning of the first study visit before the TMS and MRI sessions.&#xD;
Day 5 NRS is the severity of pain collected at the end of the 5th study visit, after the second TMS and the MRI session.&#xD;
The change in pain score is the difference between the day 5 NRS and the day 1 NRS.</description>
