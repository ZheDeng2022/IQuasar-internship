      Single center, single arm phase Ib trial to test the feasibility and safety of Tumor-&#xD;
      Infiltrating Lymphocyte-Adoptive Cell Therapy (TIL-ACT) combined with low-dose irradiation in&#xD;
      patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The trial is based on lymphodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by low dose irradiation (LDI), and then ACT utilizing ex vivo expanded&#xD;
      TILs in combination with high dose IL-2 (optional, depending on patient's tolerance). LDI&#xD;
      will be administered once to metastatic lesions using tomotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to define the feasibility and safety of TIL-ACT in combination&#xD;
      with low-dose irradiation (LDI) in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will begin with intravenous (IV) non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy composed by fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Both treatments will be started on&#xD;
      the same day. Fludarabine will be administered for five days, and cyclophosphamide for two&#xD;
      days. Low-dose irradiation (LDI) will be then administered once, to up to 20 measurable tumor&#xD;
      lesions using tomotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIL infusion will be performed intravenously followed by high dose IL-2 administration every&#xD;
      eight hours, for a maximum of eight doses. Supportive care will be given as needed during the&#xD;
      whole treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients achieving a stable disease, partial response or complete response after TIL-ACT&#xD;
      treatment will then enter a follow-up period for 5 years.&#xD;
