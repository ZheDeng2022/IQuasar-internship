    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is a debilitating disorder that severely impairs the quality of life of the&#xD;
      patients and requires life-long attention. It can be classified as primary or secondary,&#xD;
      based on the etiology. Primary lymphedema is a rare, congenital disorder caused by inherited&#xD;
      genetic mutation on a number of genes that are essential for lymphatic vessel development and&#xD;
      function. Acquired (or secondary) lymphedema is a consequence of lymphatic trauma,&#xD;
      predominantly due to surgery or radiotherapy for various types of cancers, with axillary&#xD;
      and/or inguinal lymph node dissection being the most common cause. At the cellular level,&#xD;
      perturbed or dysfunctional lymphatic drainage triggers accumulation of interstitial fluid,&#xD;
      negatively affects cellular behavior, and induces infiltration of fibroblasts, adipocytes and&#xD;
      keratinocytes, eventually leading to possible fibrosis and ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper extremity lymphedema most commonly affects breast cancer patients, while lower&#xD;
      extremity lymphedema is typically associated with gynecological cancers, prostate cancer,&#xD;
      lymphoma and melanoma. Besides the functional impairments, lymphedema severely reduces the&#xD;
      quality of life, causing psychosocial problems such as depression, sexual dysfunctions,&#xD;
      social avoidance and a decrease in self-confidence. While the prevalence of lymphedema is&#xD;
      relatively high (1.33-1.44 pro mille), its true prevalence is likely underestimated and 1 in&#xD;
      6 patients undergoing treatment for a solid tumor ultimately develops lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, treatment for lymphatic dysfunction remains largely symptomatic, without real&#xD;
      cure. According to the International Society of Lymphology, lymphedema has to be treated with&#xD;
      Decongestive Lymphatic Therapy, a two-stage treatment program. During the first or intensive&#xD;
      phase, lymphedema has to be maximally reduced: this phase consists of skin care, manual lymph&#xD;
      drainage (MLD), multi-layer bandaging and exercise therapy. The second or maintenance phase&#xD;
      aims to conserve and optimize the result obtained in the first phase, and consists of skin&#xD;
      care, compression by a low-stretch elastic sleeve, exercises and MLD. Skin care, multi-layer&#xD;
      bandaging, elastic sleeve and exercises are treatment modalities that can be performed by the&#xD;
      patients themselves, after careful instruction from the physician. On the contrary, MLD has&#xD;
      to be applied by a physical therapist and hence entails a big financial cost for the patient&#xD;
      and the Health Care. In addition, reductive techniques, such as direct excision and&#xD;
      liposuction, can be applied in patients with more advanced stages of lymphedema with a&#xD;
      predominant fibrofatty component10. Encouraging initial results, i.e. symptomatic improvement&#xD;
      and reduction in excess volume, have been obtained with lymphovenous bypass, the&#xD;
      microsurgical anastomosis of collecting lymphatic vessels to adjacent venules, and&#xD;
      vascularized lymph node transplantation, where lymph nodes are harvested from an unaffected&#xD;
      region and transferred to the lymphedematous area. However, all the treatments available so&#xD;
      far can offer only stabilisation of lymphedema and prevent further evolution, but they do not&#xD;
      offer a definitive cure. There is thus a large unmet need to develop new effective therapies&#xD;
      for lymphedema and, more general, lymph vessel dysfunction. In contrast to various strategies&#xD;
      inhibiting lymphatic vessel growth, stimulating lymphatic vessel growth has been more&#xD;
      challenging; there is currently no approved clinical strategy for ameliorating lymphatic&#xD;
      dysfunctions. In this trial we will evaluate an entirely novel pro-lymphangiogenic strategy,&#xD;
      not based on the delivery of lymphangiogenic growth factors, but rather based on modulating&#xD;
      lymphatic endothelial cell metabolism. The lab of Angiogenesis and Vascular Metabolism (PCA&#xD;
      lab), Catholic University Leuven, led by Prof. Peter Carmeliet recently reported that&#xD;
      metabolism (glycolysis, fatty acid β-oxidation, glutamine metabolism) of endothelial cells,&#xD;
      the cells lining blood vessels, controls vessel sprouting. Initial experiments from this PCA&#xD;
      lab indicate that the Ketogenic Diet (KD) , which is effective in increasing the levels of&#xD;
      ßOHB both in the plasma and lymph, ameliorates the disease outcome in the mouse (tail) model&#xD;
      of lymphedema, by reducing edema formation over time. Strikingly, lymphangiography with Evans&#xD;
      blue dye revealed that KD improves lymph vessel function, increasing dye uptake after&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection in the lymphedematous tissue and its drainage into lymph, plasma and&#xD;
      lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these proof-of-concept data, the investigators plan to test this innovative concept&#xD;
      to ameliorate lymph vessel dysfunction in lymphedema patients. Randomisation will be&#xD;
      performed between a ketogenic diet and a isocaloric diet. After randomization and baseline&#xD;
      measurements (determination of energy requirements and intake), the intervention will consist&#xD;
      of 3 phases: a one week run-in period, 24 weeks strict KD and 24 weeks Modified Atkins Diet.&#xD;
      In the first phase, the one week run-in period, is establishment of the individual ketosis&#xD;
      level (on average after five days ketosis is introduced). During this run-in period, the&#xD;
      exact ratio of lipids over proteins and carbohydrates will be determined per patient based on&#xD;
      an isocaloric diet; this ratio will vary per patient and over time. Every day, 40 g of&#xD;
      KetoCal, a nutritionally complete ready-to-drink liquid, is foreseen to ensure adequate&#xD;
      amounts of vitamins and minerals and to ensure ketosis during the night (some patients drink&#xD;
      some sips of the shake during the night). During this run-in period, patients will become&#xD;
      familiar with their diet and, in particular, they will learn which foods are allowed and&#xD;
      which are not. To assist the patients, the ketobel program (a computer program developed by&#xD;
      the metabolic dieticians of the Clinical Nutrition Unit, University Hospital Leuven) will&#xD;
      allow the calculation of the exact amount of foods/lipids each patient can/needs to consume.&#xD;
      The instructions given by the program will allow patients to create a menu according to their&#xD;
      personal preferences, with the final aim of increasing the adherence to the KD. A dietician&#xD;
      will assist every participant intensively in this run-in period (10 h/week). To ensure&#xD;
      ketotic state, ketosis will be measured twice a day (morning and evening) using urinary&#xD;
      sticks. If there is a change in the ketotic state, the lipid/non-lipid fraction ratio will be&#xD;
      adjusted in collaboration with the dietician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase, 24 weeks of strict KD , the patients will receive 40 g of KetoCal daily&#xD;
      and the dietician will assist the patient during this phase 2 hours/week. This support is&#xD;
      necessary as the lipid/non-lipid ratio to obtain ketosis varies over time as well. In the&#xD;
      second phase, the dietician will assess on a weekly basis general health status, body&#xD;
      parameters (weight, waist circumference), physical activity, weight loss and compliance to&#xD;
      diet. The plasma metabolite profile (different types of cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting&#xD;
      glucose, hsCRP, ketone bodies) will be performed every 3 weeks. To stimulate adherence to the&#xD;
      diet, chat sessions will be organized between patients and a dietician, as moderator; these&#xD;
      sessions will take place once a week and allow patients to exchange ideas/recipes about the&#xD;
      diet and to motivate each other. These chat sessions have been organized previously by the&#xD;
      members of the Clinical and Experimental Endocrinology group in other projects and were&#xD;
      considered by the patients as an added value and a stimulation to continue with the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third phase, the patients' diet will be less strict and adapted to a Modified Atkins&#xD;
      Diet. This shift is necessary to enhance adherence on the one hand and to allow follow-up for&#xD;
      a longer period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the run-in period, the energy requirements and intake of the control group will be&#xD;
      assessed as well. During this run-in period, the dietician will discuss the diet and&#xD;
      maintenance of an isocaloric diet with the patients. As such, the diet of the control group&#xD;
      will not change from their normal dietary pattern, unless a patient is following an&#xD;
      Atkins-like diet. In the latter case, the patient will be asked to change the diet to a&#xD;
      normal Belgian diet. During the first 24 weeks of intervention period, the patients will be&#xD;
      contacted every 3 weeks to stimulate the participants and to follow up on some basic&#xD;
      anthropometric markers, such as weight and waist circumference. The dietician will also&#xD;
      adapt, if needed, the isocaloric diet of the control group during the intervention period to&#xD;
      match possible unwanted weight loss of patients in the KD group. In the third phase of the&#xD;
      study, patients will not be contacted outside the standard of care and the data will only be&#xD;
      collected after 48 weeks.&#xD;
