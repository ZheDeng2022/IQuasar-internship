    <textblock>
      The main purposes of this study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the safety and tolerability of a single subcutaneous injection of different&#xD;
           doses of TG103 in healthy Chinese adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of a single subcutaneous&#xD;
           injection of different doses of TG103 in healthy Chinese adult subjects were assessed.&#xD;
