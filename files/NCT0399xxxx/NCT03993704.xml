    <textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study to&#xD;
      assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple doses of orally&#xD;
      administered LHF-535 in 24 to 32 healthy adult participants. Three successive escalating&#xD;
      cohorts, each containing 8 participants, are planned. Within each cohort, 6 participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive an oral dose of LHF-535 once daily for 14 days, and 2 will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive an oral dose of placebo once daily for 14 days. After a screening&#xD;
      period of up to 28 days, all participants will be confined to the study center from 1 day&#xD;
      prior to dosing until at least 24 hours after the 14th day of dosing. Participants will&#xD;
      return for follow-up evaluations on Day 17 and Day 21 (72 and 168 hours after last dose,&#xD;
      respectively) and on Day 42. After each cohort, safety data through Day 17 and PK data&#xD;
      through Day 7 will be reviewed by a blinded Safety Committee prior to dosing of the next&#xD;
      cohort. The Safety Committee is charged with making one of the following three&#xD;
      recommendations: (1) proceed with dose escalation as planned, (2) continue the study with&#xD;
      modification (e.g., proceed with the next cohort at a lower dose level than planned), or (3)&#xD;
      suspend the study. An additional cohort of 8 participants may be added to evaluate dosing for&#xD;
      future studies, at the discretion of the Sponsor, in consultation with the Safety Committee.&#xD;
