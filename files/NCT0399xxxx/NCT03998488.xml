      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial examining the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) and high fiber supplementation in patients&#xD;
      with active mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis (UC). All enrolled subjects will provide&#xD;
      serological, stool and mucosal specimen at each clinic visit to help further define the&#xD;
      alterations in microbial profiles and immune cell function in response to psyllium fiber&#xD;
      after FMT treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with the following&#xD;
      treatment assignments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigational FMT (one-time)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Subject will blindly receive investigational FMT once at day 0 colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects in this group will blindly receive placebo FMP250 at week 8 by flexible&#xD;
                sigmoidoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigational FMT (one-time) + Psyllium (2x/day for 8 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Subject will blindly receive investigational FMT once at day 0 colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects in this group will blindly receive placebo FMP250 at week 8 by flexible&#xD;
                sigmoidoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Placebo FMT (one-time) +/- Psyllium (2x/day for 8 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Subject will blindly receive placebo FMT once at day 0 colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects in this group will blindly receive investigational FMP250 at week 8 by&#xD;
                flexible sigmoidoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will blindly receive the investigational or placebo FMP250 treatment if they meet&#xD;
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria during the day 0 screening colonoscopy. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive follow-up phone calls at day 1, week 2, week 6, and week 10 post-FMT and will return&#xD;
      for clinic visits at week 4, week 8 and week 12 post-FMT. Stool and blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected for research purposes from subjects at every clinic visit (Day 0 colonoscopy, Week&#xD;
      4, Week 8, and Week 12). Mucosal biopsies will also be taken during the initial colonoscopy,&#xD;
      at day 0 and during the follow-up flexible sigmoidoscopy at week 8. At week 8 post-FMT, all&#xD;
      subjects will be evaluated by flexible sigmoidoscopy. Subjects originally randomized into the&#xD;
      placebo cohort at week 0 will receive investigational FMP250 by flexible sigmoidoscopy at&#xD;
      week 8, and subjects originally randomized into the investigational cohort at week 0 will&#xD;
      receive placebo FMP250 by flexible sigmoidoscopy at week 8. Lastly, all subjects will be&#xD;
      contacted for follow-up phone calls every subsequent 6 months for the next year.&#xD;

    <description>The proposed intervention will deliver 250 milliliters of FMT by colonoscopy to the investigational FMT treatment groups at week 0. The placebo treatment group will instead receive the placebo FMT by colonoscopy at week 0 and then the investigational FMT by flexible sigmoidoscopy at week 8.&#xD;
Investigational FMT is biologically active human fecal material that is pre-screened, tested, quarantined, stored, packaged, and labeled by OpenBiome. Placebo FMP250 is a control unit made of glycerol, saline, and food dye that is stored, packaged, and labeled identically to the investigational FMT, to ensure blinding during delivery.</description>
