  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kids FIRST was a 12-week, four arm, home- and school-based pilot randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      to reduce screen-time and unhealthy snacking with assessments at pre- (baseline) and&#xD;
      post-intervention. Four UK schools were randomised to control or one of three interventions -&#xD;
      Group 1: targeting reductions in screen-time and unhealthy snacking (ST+Sn), Group 2:&#xD;
      targeting reductions in screen-time only (ST), Group 3: targeting reductions in unhealthy&#xD;
      snacking only (Sn). Intervention group parents received four online 'sessions' and four&#xD;
      packages of resources which were tailored to each intervention group and focused on specific&#xD;
      mediators of screen-time and/or unhealthy snacking. Children received four 30-minute lessons&#xD;
      during school time, followed by homework activities/challenges. Children and parents reported&#xD;
      their own screen-time behaviours, children reported their own snacking behaviours, and&#xD;
      completed questionnaires on individual, behavioural, social and physical home environmental&#xD;
      variables. Descriptive analyses were undertaken using principles of intention to treat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Kids FIRST intervention was performed and reported in accordance with the Consolidated&#xD;
      Standards of Reporting Trials extension to randomised pilot and feasibility trials&#xD;
      guidelines. The study was approved by the Ethical Advisory Committee of Loughborough&#xD;
      University (R15-PO36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and recruitment Kids FIRST was family based with a school component. The study&#xD;
      targeted families with at least one 9-11 year old child. Families were recruited through&#xD;
      schools in the East Midlands region of the United Kingdom between September and December&#xD;
      2015. Twenty-five primary schools were selected from a database of schools and school&#xD;
      contacts. Headteachers were sent study information via email, which was followed-up with a&#xD;
      telephone call, inviting them to be part of the project. In participating schools,&#xD;
      parents/caregivers of children aged 9-11 years (year 5 and 6 of Primary School) were sent&#xD;
      information sheets via the school outlining the study details and inviting them and their&#xD;
      child to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study was a pilot four-arm cluster randomised controlled trial with&#xD;
      assessments at pre- (baseline) and post-intervention (13 weeks after baseline). The study&#xD;
      arms were three intervention groups and a control group. The intervention groups were: Group&#xD;
      1: targeting reductions in screen-time and unhealthy snacking (ST+Sn), Group 2: targeting&#xD;
      reductions in screen-time (ST), and Group 3: targeting reductions in unhealthy snacking (Sn).&#xD;
      Following consent by headteachers, schools were randomised to either one of the three&#xD;
      intervention groups or the control group by NP using computer generated random sequences.&#xD;
      Only NP had access to the randomisation sequences (which were on a password protected file).&#xD;
      This method of randomisation eliminated the possibility of contamination between pupils and&#xD;
      parents from the same school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical underpinning of the Kids FIRST intervention The Kids FIRST intervention was&#xD;
      framed in a social ecological perspective, and was theoretically informed, drawing on&#xD;
      constructs designed to address potential individual, behavioural, social and physical home&#xD;
      environmental mediators derived from Habit Theory, Behavioural Choice, and Social Cognitive&#xD;
      theories of individual behaviour change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The taxonomy of behaviour change techniques was applied to characterise the association&#xD;
      between the potential mediators targeted in the Kids FIRST study, the intervention components&#xD;
      / strategies developed, and the theoretical underpinning. Supplementary Table 1 describes the&#xD;
      specific behaviours that were targeted by the intervention and the practical application of&#xD;
      the behaviour change techniques applied in relation to the Kids FIRST intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kids FIRST intervention overview The intervention was implemented over a 12-week period from&#xD;
      October 2015 to May 2016 (rolling recruitment of schools) following the baseline assessments.&#xD;
      Families in each of the three intervention arms received the same structure of intervention,&#xD;
      but the content was tailored to the targeted behaviour(s). Parents and children attended an&#xD;
      introductory group session at school which provided an overview of the programme. Families in&#xD;
      the control group did not receive any resources or engage with any sessions. No changes to&#xD;
      the trial methods were implemented after the commencement of the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family setting The intervention consisted of four blocks of three weeks. Each block targeted&#xD;
      and focused on specific evidence-based mediators. All intervention families were given access&#xD;
      to the Kids FIRST website (which was live for the duration of the study only), which included&#xD;
      a login page where families were directed to the content/pages that were specific to their&#xD;
      intervention group (i.e. families in group 1 could only access the webpages for group 1) by a&#xD;
      group sensitive password. During each block, parents in each intervention group received one&#xD;
      online session, and a package of resources (e.g. newsletters, information sheets, charts&#xD;
      etc.) delivered via their child from school. The online sessions introduced the topic of the&#xD;
      block to the parents and were followed by the newsletters and resources which prompted 'try&#xD;
      at home' activities and challenges with a focus on the specific mediators. Online sessions&#xD;
      were delivered via PowerPoint or an audio file and were focused on providing parents with&#xD;
      support in the form of informational and cognitive, behavioural, environmental, and social&#xD;
      support intervention components as a means of empowering families to make behavioural changes&#xD;
      that were specific to them. The newsletters and resources (e.g. monitoring charts, top tips,&#xD;
      recipes, and alternative activity or snack ideas) aimed to support the key learning messages&#xD;
      delivered in the online sessions and to the children in the classroom lessons (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key messages of the programme, which were reinforced at each block of the intervention,&#xD;
      were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase knowledge about ST/Sn outcomes (health and other);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase awareness and implementation of strategies to participate in healthy ST and/or&#xD;
           consumption of healthy snacks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Guide parents on how to implement behaviour modification, such as planning and&#xD;
           monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      School setting Children randomised to an intervention received four 30-minute lessons during&#xD;
      school time over the intervention period (one per 'block'). Key learning messages&#xD;
      incorporating key principles of behaviour change were delivered to whole year group classes&#xD;
      by trained research personnel. The class lessons were followed by homework&#xD;
      activities/challenges and were aimed at the children and were designed to (i) target habits&#xD;
      and self-efficacy, (ii) target screen-time and/or nutritional knowledge; (iii) introduce&#xD;
      alternative activities/snacks, and (iv) encourage role modelling. Lessons were designed with&#xD;
      class teachers prior to the commencement of the programme and incorporated literacy and&#xD;
      numeracy aspects that were aligned to the national curriculum specific for each age group.&#xD;
