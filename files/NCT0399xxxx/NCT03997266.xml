  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the NANO trial is to study the longstanding clinical practice of empirically&#xD;
      administering intravenous antibiotics to extremely low birthweight (ELBW) infants in the&#xD;
      first days of life. In this 802-subject multicenter placebo-controlled randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial, the hypothesis to be tested is that the incidence of adverse outcomes is higher in&#xD;
      babies receiving empiric antibiotics (EA) in the first week of life compared to babies&#xD;
      receiving placebo. The study targets a population of ELBW infants in whom the clinical&#xD;
      decision to use or not use EA is currently most challenging -- infants that are clinically&#xD;
      stable that did not have a known exposure to intraamniotic infection and were not born&#xD;
      preterm for maternal indications. The primary outcome is the composite outcome of late-onset&#xD;
      sepsis (LOS), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), or death during the index hospitalization.&#xD;
      Secondary safety outcomes will include total antibiotic days, days to full enteral feedings,&#xD;
      and common morbidities in preterm infants that have previously been linked to EA, e.g.&#xD;
      retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Weight and length z-score, and&#xD;
      head circumference, are standard measures to be collected weekly by clinical team per a&#xD;
      standardized protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Randomization and blinding. Physicians will screen infants based on inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The site coordinator will confirm eligibility with the treating physician and input&#xD;
      patient data into the web based system. Once data is inputted, the coordinator will randomize&#xD;
      eligible families 1:1 using web-based block randomization stratified by study site to receive&#xD;
      EA or placebo. Multiples (i.e. siblings) will be randomized to the same treatment arm.&#xD;
      Randomization will be sent to the investigational pharmacy via email, where study drug will&#xD;
      be drawn. Participants, treating clinicians, and study staff will all be blinded to&#xD;
      allocation. Outcome assessors and statistical summaries for trial monitoring will be unaware&#xD;
      of group allocation. Unblinded data evaluation during the trial will be restricted to a&#xD;
      designated study statistician and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Investigators&#xD;
      will be unblinded and analyses initiated only after all data collection forms are completed,&#xD;
      data queries resolved, and data are locked for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. Following randomization, the coordinator will contact the attending physician,&#xD;
      nurse practitioner and/or other providers as appropriate, and nurse to inform them that&#xD;
      randomization has been completed. The intervention consists of administering either&#xD;
      conventional EA or placebo while completing an evaluation for early onset sepsis. Timing of&#xD;
      drug administration will be closely monitored. Enrolled subjects will receive EITHER&#xD;
      ampicillin and gentamicin at site approved dosing guidelines OR volume matched equivalent of&#xD;
      normal saline. These dosing regimens are derived from updated published guidelines for&#xD;
      neonates. No masking is required as each of these solutions is clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug will be ordered and in many cases discontinued just as EA would normally be&#xD;
      ordered and discontinued; specifically, this means that the drugs will be ordered and&#xD;
      administered within 4 hours of life and then discontinued at the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      neonatologist. Typically this occurs when blood culture results are deemed negative (expected&#xD;
      in &gt; 95% of study subjects). The study protocol will allow the first dose of study drug to be&#xD;
      administered as late as 4 hours after delivery. Research coordinators will follow daily&#xD;
      orders on all study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal sample collection. Samples will be obtained exclusively for research purposes, and&#xD;
      there will be no testing of patients beyond obtaining microbiome samples, and recording&#xD;
      demographic data and clinical history. Spontaneously expelled fecal samples for microbiome&#xD;
      analyses will be obtained weekly from study subjects through the first 8 weeks of life, and&#xD;
      monthly thereafter until death or discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant blood draw. An additional research blood sample for genetic analysis will be drawn one&#xD;
      time and should be done at the time of clinical blood draws. However, if this blood draw is&#xD;
      missed, it can be done in the neonate's first week of life. A volume of 0.3 to 0.4mL will be&#xD;
      drawn in EDTA tubes and shaken well. After the sample is collected, it will be frozen for&#xD;
      shipment. The blood draw will be performed by NICU personnel who routinely draw blood on&#xD;
      preterm babies. It will be either the bedside nurse or the respiratory therapist depending on&#xD;
      whether the blood is drawn from an umbilical catheter or by heelstick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal vaginal swab and rectal swabs at delivery will be collected. If a rectal swab was&#xD;
      not collected at the time of delivery, a maternal fecal sample during the first week&#xD;
      postpartum will be collected in its place. Samples will be cryopreserved at -80C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic database will be used to track sample collection and storage history.&#xD;
