  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this split-mouth study was to compare the efficacy of using Bio-active cement&#xD;
      versus Packable glass ionomer for cementation of posterior zirconia pediatric crowns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restoration of pulp treated or badly broken down deciduous teeth with full coverage&#xD;
      restoration have shown superior success rate to all other restorative materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restoration of deciduous teeth with esthetic full coverage restoration has been a challenging&#xD;
      aim especially for the more functionally loaded posterior teeth. Due to the continuous&#xD;
      increase in socio-economic standards; restoring posterior teeth with esthetic restoration is&#xD;
      on high demand nowadays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently introduced zirconia pediatric crowns have been very promising in terms of&#xD;
      strength and toughness. Clinical trials on maxillary incisors have shown very high success&#xD;
      rates in terms of retention and gingival health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem of restoring posterior deciduous teeth with pre-fabricated zirconia crowns is&#xD;
      that its retention is only and totally dependent on luting cement, in addition to the problem&#xD;
      of the deteriorated gingival condition around crowns in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being recently introduced to the market; there have not been any clinical trials studying&#xD;
      retention of zirconia posterior pediatric crowns published yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently introduced bio-active cement [NuSmile® BioCem™] is claimed by the manufacturer to be&#xD;
      the solution of this problem due to the shock absorbing effect, bioactive components, and&#xD;
      antimicrobial effect making it tougher than traditional cements and more gingival friendly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, experienced clinicians have found that packable glass ionomer gives very acceptable&#xD;
      results for retention of zirconia pediatric crowns. This may be due to the fact that,&#xD;
      pre-fabricated pediatric crown is not well adapted to the prepared tooth creating a greater&#xD;
      gap between the prepared tooth and the crown, resulting in a greater film thickness of luting&#xD;
      cement, which may benefit from the stronger, tougher and less soluble packable glass ionomer&#xD;
      rather than the conventional glass ionomer cement for cementation of zirconia crowns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no clear evidence whether it's better to cement zirconia based crowns with&#xD;
      conventional or adhesive cement; and to the investigator's knowledge, there is no data&#xD;
      available for the best clinical practice in cementation of zirconia pediatric crowns; and so,&#xD;
      this study was carried out to compare the effectiveness of bio-active cement with packable&#xD;
      glass ionomer when used for cementation of zirconia pediatric crowns.&#xD;
