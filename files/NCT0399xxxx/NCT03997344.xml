    <textblock>
      This pilot study evaluates the feasibility of conducting a study to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      nature exposure/hiking in groups on symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in Veterans.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) nature hikes and 2) urban hikes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives and hypothesis: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a tragically common&#xD;
      problem among US Military Veterans. Current treatment options for PTSD are not uniformly&#xD;
      effective and dropout rates are high. Treatment approaches that are evidence-based,&#xD;
      effective, and acceptable to Veterans are needed. Nature therapy is a promising, low-cost&#xD;
      intervention, yet there are few rigorous studies that have evaluated it as a therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention in Veterans with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to lay the ground work for a full-scale study by&#xD;
      assessing the feasibility and acceptability of: i) recruitment, screening, and data&#xD;
      collection methods; and ii) the nature hiking and urban hiking control group interventions.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the interventions will be feasible and the recruitment,&#xD;
      screening, and data collection methods will be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key eligibility criteria for this two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial include being a&#xD;
      Veterans with PTSD, physical fitness/ability sufficient to walk for at least 2 hours, and&#xD;
      willingness to complete assessments. Eligible individuals will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      groups: 1) nature hiking group, 2) urban hiking group. The investigators will enroll up to 60&#xD;
      individuals, to randomize up to 15 participants per group. Note that the number enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized are not expected to be the same since he investigators anticipate some individuals&#xD;
      who enroll will be determined not to be eligible based on responses to the baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire. Individuals randomized to groups 1 or 2 will be invited to participate in six&#xD;
      hikes of 2-4 hours in duration, over approximately 12 weeks. Individuals will be asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires at baseline and weekly for 12 weeks, and then again at 24 weeks. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes for this study relate to feasibility and acceptability. The investigators&#xD;
      will collect information on time to recruit the sample, retention and survey completion at&#xD;
      each time point, and attendance at hikes. A secondary aim is to ascertain changes in PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms (which will serve as the primary outcome of the full-scale trial), secondary&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g., quality of life) and mediators of the intervention, including factors such as&#xD;
      depression, perceived stress, affect, loneliness, anxiety, social connectedness, rumination,&#xD;
      and nature connection.&#xD;
