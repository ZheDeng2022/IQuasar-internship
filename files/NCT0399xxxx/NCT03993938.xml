  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter mitral valve repair in the form of MitraClip® is a safe and effective&#xD;
      alternative to surgical mitral valve repair/replacement in patients with high operative&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality risk. Successful MitraClip application depends on intraprocedural&#xD;
      quantification of mitral regurgitation and left atrial pressure (LAP) monitoring. The pleth&#xD;
      variability index (PVI) is a noninvasive, dynamic index based on analysis of the respiratory&#xD;
      variations in the plethysmographic waveform recorded transcutaneously by the pulse oximeter.&#xD;
      Studies demonstrate that PVI is accurate in predicting fluid responsiveness in mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated adult patients. In this study, we wish to measure PVI during TMVR and correlate&#xD;
      with invasive indices such as left atrial pressure (LAP) and stroke volume variation. Our&#xD;
      study hopes to provide a real-time non-invasive alternative to invasive indices to better&#xD;
      guide fluid management and improve hemodynamics.&#xD;

    <description>Delta pleth variability index (PVI) and delta left atrial pressure (LAP) are calculated by subtracting the values of LAP (as obtained intraprocedurally) and corresponding PVI value (as recorded by the Masimo Radical-7 probe) from the LAP and PVI value respectively after MitraClip placement. The delta PVI and delta LAP for the sample patient population are correlated to obtain the Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value</description>
