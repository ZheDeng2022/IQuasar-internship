  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to use a specific type of non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation known as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to determine its&#xD;
      effects on brain activity (measured with electroencephalogram, or EEG, a type of non-invasive&#xD;
      brain recording) and mood in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The device used for non-invasive brain stimulation is investigational and has not been&#xD;
      approved by the FDA, though it has been designated as a nonsignificant risk (NSR) device&#xD;
      study by the FDA. Half of the participants will receive tACS and half will receive sham&#xD;
      stimulation, an inactive control procedure for comparison use only. Participation in this&#xD;
      study includes up to nine appointments, each one lasting from 30 minutes to six hours over&#xD;
      the course of 3 weeks. The first two appointments will be remote interviews to determine&#xD;
      eligibility. If you qualify, the next five appointments will be scheduled as consecutive&#xD;
      stimulation sessions in the Carolina Center for Neurostimulation at the Vilcom office. An&#xD;
      optional MRI at UNC may be scheduled afterwards. The follow-up appointment will be in our&#xD;
      center two weeks after you complete the final stimulation session. We estimate the total time&#xD;
      needed to complete study participation to be about 28 hours. This study is not designed to&#xD;
      benefit participants and there is little chance that you will benefit from being in this&#xD;
      research study. There is a small chance that you may experience a reduction in the severity&#xD;
      of symptoms associated with MDD. Transcranial current stimulation (the application of a very&#xD;
      weak electric current across your brain) has been used without reports of any serious&#xD;
      side-effects.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Fourier transform is applied to 2 second epochs of resting-state eyes-open EEG data and averaged across epochs. The amplitude of alpha oscillations is calculated and averaged across left frontal electrodes. The difference between the baseline recording on the first day of stimulation is compared to the recording on the fifth day of the intervention prior to stimulation.</description>

    <description>Fourier transform is applied to 2 second epochs of resting-state eyes-open EEG data and averaged across epochs.

    <measure>Correlation between changes in the amplitude of left frontal alpha oscillations from baseline to day 5 of intervention and changes in symptoms of depression from baseline to two-week follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation Coefficient (r) will be used to determine if there is a relationship between the change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores from baseline to two-week follow up and change in the amplitude of left frontal alpha oscillations before stimulation at baseline and Day 5 of stimulation. The HDRS is a clinician-rated measure of depression severity where higher scores indicate greater depression severity. To calculate the amplitude of left frontal alpha oscillations, Fourier transform is applied to 2 second epochs of resting-state eyes-open EEG data and averaged across epochs. The amplitude of alpha oscillations is calculated and averaged across left frontal electrodes.</description>
