  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nursing process consists of establishing interventions applying the scientific method for&#xD;
      the resolution of real or potential health problems of the person, based on five stages:&#xD;
      assessment, diagnosis, planning, execution and evaluation, which allows detecting the&#xD;
      circumstances and elements that affect the adult's independence and the influence he has on&#xD;
      his environment, his quality of life, his family, social and psychological role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical trial, randomized, controlled with standard management; to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the nursing process on the quality of life in elderly patients who&#xD;
      come or are referred to the Cardiology Hospital, National Medical Century XXI, with&#xD;
      alterations in the ventricular atrial conduction and require the installation of a permanent&#xD;
      pacemaker. The first evaluation (Time 0) will be carried out through an interview with the&#xD;
      SF36 instrument, translated into several languages and applied to multiple studies in Mexico&#xD;
      for validation. Two groups will be formed for comparison: Group I will be assigned to&#xD;
      standard management; Group II: group of patients who are also treated through the nursing&#xD;
      process with the model of Marjory Gordon with the intervention Handling the definitive&#xD;
      pacemaker with education and information activities. It will be verified for quality control&#xD;
      of the maneuver; through a checklist. As a final point, the quality of life will be evaluated&#xD;
      through the use of the SF36 instrument that consists of 36 items that explore 8 dimensions of&#xD;
      the state of physical health, physical function, physical role, body pain, general health,&#xD;
      vitality, social function, emotional role and mental health: considering depression, anxiety,&#xD;
      self-control, and general well-being; applying the assessment system of the functional&#xD;
      patterns of the Marjory Gordon model, through surveys. Statistical analysis: Chi square or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test will be used according to expected values, for qualitative variables. For&#xD;
      quantitative variables, the Mann Whitney U or Student's T according to their distribution.&#xD;
      There will be a calculation of the number needed to be treated, and a multivariate analysis&#xD;
      will be carried out using a binary logistic regression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the Cardiology Hospital, National Medical Center Century XXI, will be&#xD;
      included and a permanent pacemaker will be installed due to alterations in atrio-ventricular&#xD;
      conduction that meet the selection criteria. They will be explained what the research&#xD;
      consists of and they will be given an informed consent form to participate in the study, with&#xD;
      all the ethical considerations that we will discuss later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      they require to control their comorbidities according to the assessment of their treating&#xD;
      physician. Having accepted their participation in the present research project, the first&#xD;
      evaluation (Time 0) will be conducted through an interview with the instrument SF36 Spanish&#xD;
      version containing a total of 36 questions, translated into several languages and applied to&#xD;
      multiple studies in Mexico for its validation. The interview will be conducted in two parts&#xD;
      and will last approximately 15 to 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the first evaluation has been carried out, they will randomly assign, through the use of&#xD;
      random number tables, to receive specific care from the nursing staff in the following&#xD;
      manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Group of conventional nursing intervention (Group I) that refers to the form performed up&#xD;
      to now, hemodynamic assessment, local pacemaker verification, electrocardiographic tracing,&#xD;
      surveillance and care of the incision, assessment of symptoms after the insertion of the&#xD;
      pacemaker, risks and interferences, mobilization and posture, complications, care information&#xD;
      and identification of other needs of the elderly in terms of mobility, degree of dependency,&#xD;
      pain assessment, elimination, nutritional, rest and relationship difficulties family, work,&#xD;
      emotional conflicts, values and religiosity in some cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Nursing intervention group through the nursing process with the Marjory Gordon system&#xD;
      (Group II).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Starting with the assessment stage by functional patterns: health perception-management,&#xD;
           nutrition, elimination, activity and rest, sleep and rest, perceptual cognitive,&#xD;
           self-concept-self-perception, role-relationships, sexuality-reproduction,&#xD;
           coping-tolerance of stress, values and beliefs and the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Following the diagnostic stage of nursing, the problem is identified through labels that&#xD;
           define it as: Decrease in cardiac output, risk of bleeding, ineffective protection,&#xD;
           acute pain, risk of imbalance of body temperature, deterioration of ambulation,&#xD;
           deterioration of physical mobility, deterioration of gas exchange, disposition to&#xD;
           improve one's health, sleep deprivation, deterioration of urinary elimination,&#xD;
           constipation, self-care deficit, sensory perception disorder, deterioration of social&#xD;
           interaction or conflict of decisions , hopelessness, low self-esteem, body image&#xD;
           disorder, ineffective coping, anxiety, fear and hopelessness complementing the structure&#xD;
           of the diagnosis with risk factors (for example: poor knowledge) and etiological (for&#xD;
           example: altered frequency and heart rate) , as well as, with defining characteristics&#xD;
           (signs and symptoms) that pre Say the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The planning stage will be carried out through expected results from the problems&#xD;
           identified as nursing diagnoses and using the classification of expected nursing&#xD;
           outcomes (NOC) each of them with a target score of maintaining results; will increase;&#xD;
           and scales from severe to none, or from seriously compromised to uncommitted will depend&#xD;
           on the proposed result. Decreased cardiac output The expected result will be&#xD;
           effectiveness of the heart pump which will be measured with indicators such as: systolic&#xD;
           blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate , peripheral pulses. From the&#xD;
           expected result, nursing interventions will be derived:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention &quot;Cardiac care&quot; with activities&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Observing vital signs frequently&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Monitor cardiovascular status&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Check and check the operation of the pacemaker,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Instruct the patient on the importance of the immediate report of any chest&#xD;
                discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Take note of the significant signs and symptoms of decreased cardiac output. â€¢&#xD;
                Intervention &quot;Management of the definitive pacemaker&quot; with activities of&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Education on the potential risks of metabolic alterations (eg potential to increase&#xD;
                the thresholds of rhythm or capture);&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The importance of attending their periodic checks;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Sources of higher electromagnetic interference (eg arc welding equipment, radio&#xD;
                transmitters, electronic muscle stimulators, concert loudspeakers, electric drills,&#xD;
                hand-held metal detectors, magnetic resonance, radiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Keep about 15 cm away from cell phones;&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Signs and symptoms of a dysfunctional pacemaker (eg bradycardia, dizziness,&#xD;
                weakness, fatigue, chest discomfort, angina, dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, paroxysmal&#xD;
                nocturnal dyspnea, exertional dyspnea, hypotension, syncope, cardiac arrest)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. The importance of carrying the identification card of the manufacturer at all&#xD;
                times.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Information to the patient and the family related to the implantation of the&#xD;
                pacemaker (eg, indications, functions, universal programming codes, potential&#xD;
                complications); related to the effects of pacemaker treatment to reduce patient&#xD;
                uncertainty, fear and anxiety about symptoms (eg dizziness, palpitations, chest&#xD;
                pain, shortness of breath) related to treatment (arm edema or augmentation) of&#xD;
                heat);&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Teach the patient to check the manufacturer's warnings when in doubt about&#xD;
                electrical appliances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fourth stage of the nursing process execution of nursing interventions (NIC) obtained&#xD;
           through the expected results (NOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the response of patients to nursing interventions in their quality of life, the&#xD;
      following will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Before discharge from hospital, verification of quality control of the maneuver will be&#xD;
      carried out, using a checklist, on the indications given by the nursing staff to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. One month after the patient's hospital discharge, during which patients are regularly&#xD;
      scheduled for follow-up consultation, after their routine medical assessment, an interview&#xD;
      will be conducted where we will make a total of 36 questions with 3 to 5 answer options each,&#xD;
      with the SF36 instrument. The 36 items explore 8 dimensions of the state of physical health,&#xD;
      physical function, physical role, body pain, general health, vitality, social function,&#xD;
      emotional role and mental health: considering depression, anxiety, self-control, and general&#xD;
      well-being; applying the assessment system of the functional patterns of the Marjory Gordon&#xD;
      model, through surveys. The interview will be conducted in two parts and will last&#xD;
      approximately 15 to 20 minutes. (Outcome) The system by Functional Employers focuses its&#xD;
      attention on 11 items with importance for the health of the individual, family or community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ability of the person to identify their health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ability of the person to identify their nutritional needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify the excretory function (intestinal, urinary and skin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Realization of the activities and exercise carried out by the person.&#xD;
&#xD;

           presence of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Form in which the patient feels, feelings, knowledge of himself.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Way to live with others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. It is experienced or expressed in the form of thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs,&#xD;
           attitudes, values, activities, practices, roles and relationships.&#xD;
