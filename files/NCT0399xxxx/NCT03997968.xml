  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is an interventional, active-treatment, open-label, multi-center, Phase&#xD;
      1/2 study. The study objectives are to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) of the oral RAD51 inhibitor CYT-0851 in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell&#xD;
      malignancies and advanced solid tumors and to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose as a&#xD;
      monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy for evaluation in these patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overexpression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) or other cytidine deaminases&#xD;
      causes high rates of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage (mutations, double strand DNA breaks,&#xD;
      and chromosome rearrangements) in a high number of patients with B-cell malignancies, such as&#xD;
      NHL, MM, and CLL, and in a subset of patients with solid tumors, such as non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC), sarcoma, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      head and neck. Cancer cells that overexpress AID and other cytidine deaminases rely on RAD51,&#xD;
      a protein involved in homologous recombination, to repair the DNA damage caused by cytidine&#xD;
      deaminases. Inhibition of RAD51 with CYT-0851 in preclinical models induces cell death, tumor&#xD;
      growth delay or tumor regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 1 part of the study will follow an accelerated titration design, which includes&#xD;
      enrollment of single patient cohorts until certain criteria are met, followed by a standard&#xD;
      3+3 design. This design will allow for identification of a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      level while dosing the least number of patients as possible at potentially sub-therapeutic&#xD;
      doses. Upon identification of the RP2D in the monotherapy, the study will open to three&#xD;
      combination treatment arms to identify the RP2D in combination with rituximab and&#xD;
      bendamustine in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and capecitabine or gemcitabine for solid tumors. In the&#xD;
      Phase 2 part of the study, preliminary efficacy will be evaluated in 8 expansion cohorts&#xD;
      (total n = 92-220), using a Simon two-stage design. The RP2D will be selected based on the&#xD;
      MTD, the safety profile, PK, and available pharmacodynamics data generated from all subjects&#xD;
      in Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both Phase 1 and Phase 2, patients will be treated in continuous 21-day or 28-day cycles&#xD;
      and all patients will be assessed for response every 2 cycles. Treatment will be terminated&#xD;
      if the patient progresses, cannot tolerate treatment, or withdraws consent from active&#xD;
      therapy. Patients will undergo a safety evaluation approximately 1 month (28-35 days) after&#xD;
      the last dose. Patients will be followed for response until progression is documented.&#xD;
