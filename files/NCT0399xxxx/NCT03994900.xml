  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are the first mortality cause in Occidental countries. Surgery and&#xD;
      anesthesia can provoke hemodynamic instability and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system as well as bleeding or thrombosis. These factors as top of some post-operative factors&#xD;
      such as tissular hypoxemia, can result in cardiovascular complications. Developing a tool to&#xD;
      predict post-operative cardiovascular complication could influence peri-operative measures by&#xD;
      stratifying the population at risk. UCLouvain has developed a patented technique using a&#xD;
      paramagnetic electronic resonance spectrometry (EPR) able to quantify a paramagnetic&#xD;
      component, nitrosylated hemoglobin (HbNO) of the erythrocytes drawn from venous blood. This&#xD;
      HbNO has been correlated to the traditional cardiac risk factors. In this study, we will&#xD;
      assess the HbNO of patients prior to surgery and will correlate it with cardiovascualr and&#xD;
      non cardiovascular complications in order to evaluate the predictive aspect of our biomarker.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are the first mortality cause in Occidental countries. They would be&#xD;
      the cause of 31% of the overall mortality in those countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some risk factors are strongly related to the apparition of a cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      including smoking, high cholesterol levels, hypertension, diabetes, age, high BMI or familial&#xD;
      early cardiovascular disease and/or hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have already shown that major non-cardiac surgery can lead to cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications in 3% of the patients regardless of their cardiovascular risk profile and major&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events are a significant source of post-operative morbidity in&#xD;
      approximately 11% among those patient3,4,6,7. Complications can also lead to a prolongated&#xD;
      hospitalization for patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery8,9.The peri- and&#xD;
      post-operative cardiovascular complications depend on patient-related risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery and anesthesia can provoke hemodynamic instability and stimulation of the sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system. Surgery and the ensuing inflammation can also induce bleeding and or&#xD;
      thrombosis. These factors as top of some post-operative factors such as tissular hypoxemia,&#xD;
      can result in cardiovascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An assessment of the medical cardiac history of the patients is performed before any&#xD;
      surgery3. Developing a tool to predict post-operative cardiovascular complication could&#xD;
      influence peri-operative measures by stratifying the population at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that cardiovascular diseases are preceded by a dysfunction of the vascular&#xD;
      endothelium leading to a loss of the antithrombogenic, anti-proliferative and vasorelaxant&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key mediator of vascular homeostasis and endothelial integrity is the nitric oxide (NO)&#xD;
      produced by the endothelial NO synthetase (eNOS). UCLouvain has developed a patented&#xD;
      technique using a paramagnetic electronic resonance spectrometry (EPR) able to quantify a&#xD;
      paramagnetic component, nitrosylated hemoglobin (HbNO) of the erythrocytes drawn from venous&#xD;
      blood. This HbNO has been correlated to the traditional cardiac risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantifying the HbNO could predict, prior to any major non-cardiac surgery, an eventual&#xD;
      peri-operative cardiovascular complication. Preoperative HbNO would as such be a useful&#xD;
      marker of cardiovascular complications. Necessary perioperative measures can therefore be&#xD;
      taken in order to decrease this risk. This assessment would be associated to the preoperative&#xD;
      anesthesia visit (EPI : évaluation péri-interventionnelle) form reporting previous&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and risk factors.&#xD;
