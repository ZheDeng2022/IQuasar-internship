  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is undertaken to evaluate the workflow and concomitant products to create&#xD;
      full dentures by using Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology, i.e. Digital Light Processingâ„¢&#xD;
      Technology (Carbon 3D) to restore fully edentulous jaws. The assessment includes quality of&#xD;
      materials provided by Dentsply Sirona Lab by using printers for Additive Manufacturing (M2&#xD;
      series, Carbon 3D 1089 Mills Way, Redwood City, CA 94063). This assessment will be done by&#xD;
      clinical review of the AM dentures on fit and quality. In addition, the trial includes a&#xD;
      patient survey to assess current dentures and the new AM dentures with a subjective&#xD;
      comparison of both.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This descriptive, prospective, clinical investigation will be conducted on approximately&#xD;
           forty (40) enrolled subjects at four (4) sites in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of subjects encompasses all steps to fabricate new dentures for maxilla and&#xD;
           mandible (no greater than five (5) visits; 30-60 min. chair time per appointment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects will be followed 7-10 days after final delivery of the denture for function&#xD;
           check.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term follow-up will be performed after 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months&#xD;
           to assess fit, function, and esthetics under function performed by the dental&#xD;
           professional and by capturing according feedback by the patient.&#xD;

        The investigational device is part of a treatment concept for edentulous patients of all&#xD;
        ages, gender and races. The incidence for tooth loss has not declined over years, and the&#xD;
        prevalence for edentulism is significantly higher for adults 50 years and older15, 16. For&#xD;
        this descriptive two-part survey, no minimum number of patients is defined, but to achieve&#xD;
        a reasonable subject number, a minimum of forty (40) patients will be enrolled, i.e. 80&#xD;
        dentures will be fabricated within this study.&#xD;
