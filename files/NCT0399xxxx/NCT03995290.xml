  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will pilot the use of 3D printed models of the hip, for use in pre-operative&#xD;
      planning and patient communication to improve clinical outcomes and patient engagement. This&#xD;
      method will be implemented in the setting of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), with the&#xD;
      goal of identifying and measuring specific anatomical pathologies and impingement (range of&#xD;
      motion) risks, to communicate a pre-operative plan to both the surgical team, and the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a standard of care pre-operative CT scan, a 3D rendering of the CT scan will be&#xD;
      completed. The de-identified CT Scan data will be transferred to the Clemson University&#xD;
      Bioengineering Department, and a 3D modeling software will convert it to a computer model&#xD;
      that will then be 3D printed. During the doctor-patient pre-operative consultation, the 3D&#xD;
      Printed model will be used to assist the doctor in describing the patient's pathology and&#xD;
      upcoming surgical procedure. In this pilot study, the surgeon will make measurements and&#xD;
      estimates of resection for the femoroplasty and acetabuloplasty off of 2D CT scan, MRI, and&#xD;
      x-rays. This will then be compared quantitatively to the results of the 3D model/3D printing&#xD;
      measurements. Surgeon debriefings will occur postoperatively to determine the benefit of the&#xD;
      model and how well it matched up to what the surgeon experienced during the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FAI involves complex anatomic morphology which can be unique to each patient. A thorough&#xD;
      understanding of the type and specifically location of impingement is paramount to successful&#xD;
      results if surgery is required. 2D imaging has limitations when analyzing a 3D anatomic&#xD;
      lesion. 3D printed hip models have the potential to provide superior preoperative planning&#xD;
      and subsequent surgical results. In addition, 3D models can potentially improve patient&#xD;
      understanding, expectations, and outcomes.&#xD;

The surgeon will also make estimates based on the 3D model/3D printing measurements.
