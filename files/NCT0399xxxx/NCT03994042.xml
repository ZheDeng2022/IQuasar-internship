    <textblock>
      This research project will investigate neurofeedback training in stroke rehabilitation during&#xD;
      which patients receive feedback in real time from their brain activity measured with&#xD;
      ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG). The investigators hypothesize that the feedback training allows&#xD;
      to internally stimulate brain motor networks in order to promote functional recovery of the&#xD;
      hand.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be carried out as a pilot study in order to optimize and set parameters for a&#xD;
      subsequent study that will involve more stroke patients. Stroke patients will be trained to&#xD;
      mentally imagine the opening and closing of the hand (hereafter named MI, Motor Imagery).&#xD;
      During the training, the patients will receive visual feedback in real time that reflects the&#xD;
      neural activity related to motor processes. The NeuroFeedback (NF) will be projected with&#xD;
      minimal time delay to maximize the neural learning. This type of brain training with feedback&#xD;
      is thought to have significant importance to stimulate the ability of the brain to reorganize&#xD;
      and compensate for a damaged region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will go through the following data collection procedure (total of 27-28&#xD;
      measurement sessions per RP):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical baseline evaluations, 1 time/week during 3 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 MRI measurement during one week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-3 calibration EEG recordings during one week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MI-neurofeedback training [3 times/week] + Clinical intervention evaluation [1&#xD;
           time/week] during 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 MRI measurement + 1 calibration EEG recording during one week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical intervention evaluations, 1 time/week during 3 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements. The MRI exam will be carried out on a Siemens&#xD;
      MAGNETOM Prisma 3T scanner (head-coil with 20 channels) at baseline and at final assessment&#xD;
      session at Stockholm University Brain Imaging Centre. The MRI protocol comprises i)&#xD;
      anatomical whole brain spin-echo T1 and T2 weighted sequences for description of lesion size&#xD;
      and location ii) acquisition of T2*-weighted gradient echo EPI-BOLD images of the whole brain&#xD;
      for assessment of resting state functional connectivity of sensorimotor networks&#xD;
      (resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)), and iii) the same sequence as the previous with rest&#xD;
      interleaved by a motor imagery paradigm further described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor Imagery (MI) paradigm. The paradigm consists of instructing RP, by the use of a&#xD;
      mirrored computer screen, to either i) rest his/her mind with eyes open, ii) mentally imagine&#xD;
      a hand movement (MI), or ii) execute a hand movement. The hand movements that are instructed&#xD;
      are either to close the hand or to open the hand and extend the fingers. RP will perform&#xD;
      several repetitions of each hand movement (MI and execution) in order to collect a&#xD;
      statistical basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calibration EEG recording. Calibration of EEG recordings will be performed at 2-3 times&#xD;
      during 1 week prior to the intervention and one time after the intervention while the&#xD;
      participant performs the mental imagery paradigm described above. RP will be seated in front&#xD;
      a computer screen and ratings will be registered by the use of a button-press. During these&#xD;
      session, EEG, EOG, EMG, and accelerometer-data will be collected and are further described&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG), ElectroOculoGram (EOG), ElectroMyoGram (EMG) and accelerometer&#xD;
      equipment. The EEG equipment consists of a 64-electrode scalp EEG acquisition system (Brain&#xD;
      Products ActiCHamp). The 64 electrodes (active Ag/AgCl) will be distributed according to the&#xD;
      extended 10-20 reference placement system. In addition to the EEG recording, 3 electrodes&#xD;
      (passive Ag/AgCl, Brain Products) will be placed on each side of both eyes and on the earlob&#xD;
      to measure eye-movements during the experiment (EOG). EMG electrodes (passive Ag/AgCl, Brain&#xD;
      Products) will be placed over four muscles controlling the wrist and fingers according to a&#xD;
      standardized protocol. Two accelerometer-sensors (Brain Products) will be placed on the hand&#xD;
      and the index finger in order to record movement-related activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG, EOG, EMG and accelerometer data analysis. The recorded data will be further analyzed&#xD;
      offline in order to evaluate the characteristic features in the data that best describe MI of&#xD;
      hand movements. This will be performed in Matlab and Labview combining custom-made scripts&#xD;
      with already developed toolboxes (such as EEGLab, Chronux). Features to be evaluated will&#xD;
      include the evoked activity, the time-frequency spectra, phase, correlation coefficients,&#xD;
      coherency among other. When the feature that best describes MI has been identified different&#xD;
      classifier and pattern recognition methods will be evaluated in extracting the information.&#xD;
      Intelligent algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), regularized linear regression, naïve&#xD;
      Bayes classifiers among others will be evaluated and compared. These are commonly used&#xD;
      methods in the field of neurotechnology and a prior comparison-study using neural data from&#xD;
      invasive recordings shows the importance of choosing a well-adapted classifier for extracting&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MI-NeuroFeedback Training (NFT). EEG, EOG, EMG and accelerometer-data will be collected as&#xD;
      described in the section &quot;EEG, EMG and accelerometer equipment&quot;. RP will perform the MI&#xD;
      paradigm without the execution of hand movements. Real-time feedback from recorded&#xD;
      EEG-activity will be provided to RP during MI. The feedback consists of a virtual hand on a&#xD;
      computer screen whose movements reflect the brain activity of RP related to MI. The recorded&#xD;
      data will be further analyzed offline with the analytic tools that are described in previous&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
