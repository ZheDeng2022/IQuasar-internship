  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to demonstrate that investigational drug, Quiklean®, is not inferior to&#xD;
      standard comparator, Klean-Prep with Dulcolax®, with respect to the overall quality of bowel&#xD;
      preparation in subjects undergoing colonoscopy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, evaluator blind, active-controlled, parallel study to compare the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of investigational drug (Quiklean®) with standard comparator (Klean-Prep&#xD;
      with Dulcolax®) in subjects undergoing bowel preparation for colonoscopy. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group A: Quiklean® (32 tablets)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group B: 2 sachets of Klean-Prep with 1 tablet of Dulcolax® The study will be consist of&#xD;
           4 clinical visits. Subjects will come to the clinics at Visit 1 (the start of the&#xD;
           screening), Visit 2 (randomization), and Visit 3 (colonoscopy visit), and Visit 4&#xD;
           (follow-up visit) according to the pre-defined schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the inform consent is obtained from the subject, the designated assessment will be&#xD;
      performed. If the eligibility criteria has been met, the subjects will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      with a 1:1 (Group A:B) and scheduled to a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy visit should be&#xD;
      arranged within 10 days after screening visit and randomization. Subjects are instructed how&#xD;
      to take study medication, and standard dietary instructions for each group are identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After bowel preparation, the colonoscopy will be performed in the morning by the experienced&#xD;
      colonoscopist, and the entire process of colonoscopy will be simultaneously recorded by&#xD;
      video. The quality of bowel cleansing in video will be rated by an independent blinded&#xD;
      colonoscopist after the completion of colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified Aronchick scale for the primary efficacy endpoint and the Ottawa scale, and&#xD;
      subject's responses to the acceptability and tolerability for the secondary efficacy endpoint&#xD;
      will be rated and collected. The safety laboratory examinations from the blood sample,&#xD;
      solicited events from the start of administration of study medications before colonoscopy,&#xD;
      and treatment-emergent adverse events will be also recorded.&#xD;
