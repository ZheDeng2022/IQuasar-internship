  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to 1) observe the course of pain, 2) utilization of opioid pain medication,&#xD;
      and 3) possible effect of a behavioral intervention delivered via an automated mobile phone&#xD;
      messaging robot in patients undergoing surgical treatment of a traumatic orthopaedic injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients presenting to a University Hospital Level 1 trauma center indicated for&#xD;
      operative fixation of a traumatic upper or lower fracture were considered for the study. A&#xD;
      partial Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act waiver was granted for this&#xD;
      investigation to allow research team members to review potential subject's medical record for&#xD;
      any condition meeting exclusion criteria. Eligible patients consenting to the study will be&#xD;
      assigned a unique study identification number (ID). A master database linking patient ID to&#xD;
      patient name and medical record number will be housed on a password protected and encrypted&#xD;
      departmental server location, which only research personnel can access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a basic demographics survey and preoperative/baseline patient&#xD;
      reported outcome surveys at enrollment, including the Patient-reported outcomes measurement&#xD;
      information system (PROMIS) Pain Intensity 1A short form, PROMIS Pain Intensity 3A short&#xD;
      form, PROMIS Pain Interference 8A short form, and PROMIS 8A Emotional Distress-Anxiety 8A&#xD;
      short forms. Following completion of these surveys, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio using a random number generator into one of two study groups. The intervention group&#xD;
      will receive mobile messages communicating the behavior intervention following surgery. The&#xD;
      control group will not receive the intervention. Subjects will not be blinded to their study&#xD;
      group. Participants randomized to the intervention group were subsequently enrolled into the&#xD;
      automated mobile messaging protocol and received a confirmation message welcoming them to the&#xD;
      study, which was reviewed with them by the research assistant. Subjects were instructed that&#xD;
      they were only required to read all messages, no responses were required. No other aspects of&#xD;
      patient care including surgical approaches, medications prescribed, or postoperative&#xD;
      instructions differ between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of enrollment and assignment of study group, each participant's medical&#xD;
      record will be reviewed to obtain the following data that will be recorded in the research&#xD;
      study database: Age, Sex, BMI, Medical Comorbidities, Psychological Comorbidities, Substance&#xD;
      Abuse History, and presence of preoperative outpatient opioid pain medication utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the intervention group will being receiving the mobile messaging intervention the&#xD;
      day following surgery. The mobile messaging intervention consists of twice per day mobile&#xD;
      messages, morning and evening, starting on postoperative day one and ending on postoperative&#xD;
      day 14. Messages communicated to study participants employ the principles of Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment therapy, otherwise known as ACT, which has been used in the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      pain. Prior to discharge, patients will be seen by a research team member to review the&#xD;
      opioid pain medication they are prescribed at discharge and instructed to have their pill&#xD;
      bottle available to them to provide a pill count at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single instance of follow-up will take place on postoperative day 14. This will occur&#xD;
      either in clinic or over the phone with a research team member. At this time, participants&#xD;
      will be asked how many tablets of their opioid pain medication they consumed since discharge&#xD;
      and to confirm with the amount tablets remaining. Additionally, subjects will fill out a&#xD;
      second set of the patient reported outcome surveys completed at enrollment. Collection of&#xD;
      these follow-up items marks the end of the subject's participation in the study. No data&#xD;
      collection planned following the two week study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that subjects receiving the behavior intervention delivered via an&#xD;
      automated mobile messaging robot would report consuming less opioid pain medication during&#xD;
      the study period, and demonstrate better patient reported outcome survey scores than controls&#xD;
      at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial pilot cohort was recruited in order to obtain the data to run the power analysis&#xD;
      that determined the population size for the randomized portion of the study. The preliminary&#xD;
      study recorded the amount of opioid medication tablets utilized by these patients over a&#xD;
      two-week postoperative period.&#xD;

    <description>Patient-reported outcomes measurement information system Pain Intensity (PROMIS) 3A short form scores collected from all participating subjects.&#xD;
PROMIS Pain Intensity 3A short form is a 3 question survey measuring an individual's pain over the past 7 days. It utilizes a scale of 1 (no pain) to 5 (very severe pain) for all questions. The scores for the 3 questions are summed and then matched to a corresponding t-score for the instrument. The corresponding t-score is the final, reportable score and can range from 30.7 to 71.8 for the PROMIS Pain Intensity 3A instrument. Higher t-score values represent worse pain outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) Pain Interference 8A short form scores collected from all participating subjects.&#xD;
The PROMIS Pain Interference 8A short form is an 8 question survey that measures how much pain has interfered in the respondent's life over the past 7 days. It utilizes a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) for all questions. The scores for all 8 questions are summed and then matched to a corresponding t-score for the instrument. The corresponding t-score is the final, reportable score and can range from 40.7 to 77.0 for the PROMIS Pain Interference 8A instrument. Higher t-score values represent worse pain interference outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) Emotional Distress-Anxiety 8A short form scores collected from all participating subjects.&#xD;
The PROMIS Emotional Distress-Anxiety 8A short form is an 8 statement survey that measures how much emotional distress, specifically due to anxiety, a respondent has experienced over the past 7 days. It utilizes a scale of 1 (never) to 5 (always) for all the statements. The scores for all 8 statements are summed and then matched to a corresponding t-score for the instrument. The corresponding t-score is the final, reportable score and can range from 37.1 to 83.1 for the PROMIS Emotional Distress-Anxiety 8A instrument. Higher t-score values represent worse anxiety caused emotional distress outcomes.&#xD;
