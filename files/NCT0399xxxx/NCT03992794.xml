      The results of the SIDED study (doi: 10.1186 / s13054-019-2329-5) showed that MR-proADM can&#xD;
      be a good biomarker to establish the prognosis of patients attended in the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) due to suspected infection. MR-proADM could be useful to help making-decision&#xD;
      regarding admission or discharge of patients, and in addicion to determine the need to apply&#xD;
      or not early antibiotic treatment. However, despite analyzing more than 2,500 patients from 8&#xD;
      countries, the original study had a number of limitations. Samples of the biomarkers were&#xD;
      retrospectively analyzed in a device that is not routinely used in the ED (Kryptor, Thermo&#xD;
      Fisher, Germany). The availability of MR-proADM at the point of care could facilitate its&#xD;
      widespread use in all EDs. This study is conducted to confirm the results of the SIDED study&#xD;
      by using a device at the patient's bedside that allows the quantitative determination of the&#xD;
      MR-proADM and procalcitonin biomarkers, instead of using a Kryptor platform.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant improvements in diagnostic and preventative measures, the incidence of&#xD;
      sepsis has continued to escalate rapidly in hospitalized patients, with mortality rates&#xD;
      ranging between 10 - 54%, depending on the level of severity. The earliest possible&#xD;
      identification and assessment of sepsis patients entering the Emergency Department (ED) is&#xD;
      therefore crucial in providing the patient with the most appropriate management and treatment&#xD;
      strategy at the earliest time point possible. Indeed, an early identification of patients&#xD;
      with an infection and at a high risk of cardiovascular and organ dysfunction can lead to an&#xD;
      earlier individualised treatment, a potential reduction in the number of clinical&#xD;
      complications, and an overall decrease in hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adrenomedullin (ADM), a 52 amino acid peptide, is a member of the calcitonin peptide family&#xD;
      and is widely expressed in many tissues and organs, although its main sources of production&#xD;
      include the endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. Adrenomedullin can act as both a&#xD;
      hormone and cytokine (often termed a &quot;hormokine&quot;) in an autocrine and paracrine manner, and&#xD;
      its potent vasodilatory and hypotensive response is elicited through an initial increase in&#xD;
      cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, and a subsequent production of nitric oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of adrenomedullin in homeostasis is illustrated by its central role in the up-&#xD;
      and down-regulation of cytokines and other mediators, as well as its own stimulatory and&#xD;
      inhibitory effect on cytokine production. Indeed, Interleukin (IL)-1β and tumour necrosis&#xD;
      factor (TNF) are two of the most potent stimulators for adrenomedullin production and&#xD;
      adrenomedullin itself is up-regulated by hypoxia, bacterial products and shear stress,&#xD;
      amongst many other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, adrenomedullin has been shown to have a variety of physiological functions,&#xD;
      including immune-modulating, direct bactericidal, diuretic and potent vasodilatory activity,&#xD;
      and in healthy conditions, circulates at low picomolar concentrations. However, plasma levels&#xD;
      are significantly up-regulated in many diseased states in proportion to disease severity such&#xD;
      as hypertension, renal failure, lower respiratory diseases and septic shock, due to either&#xD;
      damage to the endothelial cells or microvascular and microcirculatory impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This allows clinicians to determine the patients most at risk of developing complications&#xD;
      upon their admission to the ED or ICU, in order to rapidly triage and administer the most&#xD;
      effective treatment, in the shortest space of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, reliable measurement of ADM is challenging due to a number of issues, such as a&#xD;
      short half life of 22 minutes, rapid degradation by proteases and binding to complement&#xD;
      factor H. The measurement of its stable precursor molecule, MR-proADM, provides a solution to&#xD;
      these problems, since reliable measurements in relation to adrenomedullin can be made in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio, thus allowing changes in protein concentrations to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of deaths in patients suffering from sepsis occur due to multiple organ failure,&#xD;
      related to the primary infection. However, complications leading up to initial organ&#xD;
      dysfunction and failure include factors such as an impaired microcirculation, enhanced&#xD;
      microvascular permeability, a decrease in the number of perfused capillaries, endothelial&#xD;
      cell apoptosis and an abnormal systemic blood flow to organ systems. Few tools currently&#xD;
      available have the ability to accurately assess these early physiological changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vasodilatory and microcirculatory properties of adrenomedullin are therefore of&#xD;
      significant importance during the pathophysiology and progression of sepsis, with increased&#xD;
      levels being shown to lead to a decreased vascular resistance and a significantly increased&#xD;
      microvascular blood flow in the liver, small intestine, kidney and spleen. Indeed, the&#xD;
      production of adrenomedullin has been shown to have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  protective properties against endothelial permeability and consequent organ damage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  protective effects in organs in response to bacterial induced shock&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the ability to stabilize the microcirculation in inflammation - a hallmark of organ&#xD;
           failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the ability to restore endothelial stability in infected organs due to prevention of&#xD;
           undesired inflammatory decompartmentalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crucially, the body can facilitate the localized cellular production and release of&#xD;
      adrenomedullin in order to meet the specific perfusion requirements of individual organs,&#xD;
      which can be crucial in maintaining blood supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst current benchmarks of sepsis which include lactate and SOFA scores can accurately&#xD;
      assess the degree of tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction at any given time point, elevated&#xD;
      MR-proADM levels can accurately reflect the early microvascular changes that occur in the&#xD;
      build up to subsequent organ damage and dysfunction, the majority of which are extremely&#xD;
      difficult to detect using standard clinical techniques, biomarkers or severity scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical use of MR-proADM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, MR-proADM levels can provide the treating physician with an accurate reflection of&#xD;
      abnormalities in the microcirculation before the patient develops any form of organ&#xD;
      dysfunction or adverse clinical signs become apparent, thus providing an earlier warning of&#xD;
      any developing complications associated with the infectious condition. Indeed, even when&#xD;
      diagnostic biomarkers such as PCT, CRP or lactate are either initially low or decreasing&#xD;
      satisfactorily, patients might still be at considerable risk of further complications, which&#xD;
      can be highlighted through elevated MR-proADM values. In these cases, an immediate transfer&#xD;
      to a more intensive ward or department and an early, rapid and goal directed therapeutic&#xD;
      treatment would most likely be required in order to achieve the best possible clinical&#xD;
      outcome for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, resolving issues in the microcirculation/endothelium can be indicative of&#xD;
      an improvement in clinical status, and illustrated by low MR-proADM values. Accordingly, even&#xD;
      in the presence of elevated laboratory or other biomarker values and poor clinical signs, the&#xD;
      patient in question may develop no further physiological complications apart from the&#xD;
      pre-existing microbial infection itself, which when treatment is correctly initiated, can&#xD;
      facilitate an earlier transfer onto a less acute ward, consequently saving the healthcare&#xD;
      provider valuable resources such as physician time, hospital beds and overall financial&#xD;
      budget.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the SIDED study (doi: 10.1186 / s13054-019-2329-5) showed that MR-proADM&#xD;
      measurement at presentation could accurately assess disease severity and identify specific&#xD;
      patient populations based on the likelihood of subsequent disease progression. This was of&#xD;
      particular importance in patients with few pathophysiological signs and symptoms, as&#xD;
      indicated by low SOFA, qSOFA or NEWS scores, where initial treatment may either be withheld,&#xD;
      delayed or insufficient. Our study therefore, for the first time, highlights the use of&#xD;
      MR-proADM in potentially identifying this patient population in order to initiate appropriate&#xD;
      treatment strategies at the earliest opportunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of this study, two clinically important uses for MR-proADM can be&#xD;
      proposed: (i) an early escalation of treatment in patients with MR-proADM concentrations ≥1.5&#xD;
      nmol/L, thus identifying an already high level of disease severity or a high potential for&#xD;
      further development and progression, and (ii) a decreased number of hospital admissions&#xD;
      allowing a safe increase in out-patient treatment in patients with MR-proADM concentrations&#xD;
      &lt;0.9 nmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of the biomarkers were in SIDED study retrospectively analyzed in a device that is&#xD;
      not routinely used in the ED (Kryptor, Thermo Fisher, Germany). The availability of MR-proADM&#xD;
      at the point of care could facilitate its widespread use in all EDs. This study is conducted&#xD;
      to confirm the results of the SIDED study by using a device at the patient's bedside (Samsung&#xD;
      IB10 platforms) that allows the quantitative determination of the MR-proADM and procalcitonin&#xD;
      biomarkers, instead of using a Kryptor platform, and obtaining the biomarkers results in no&#xD;
      more than 20 minutes.&#xD;
