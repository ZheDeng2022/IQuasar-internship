      8. Trial design: Type: Parallel, two arm, randomized clinical trial. Allocation ratio: 1:1&#xD;
      Superiority framework&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Methods A) Participants, interventions &amp; outcomes 9. Study settings: Diagnosis in&#xD;
      outpatient clinic of Oral and Maxillofacial surgery at the faculty of dentistry, Cairo&#xD;
      University, Urban area, Cairo Governorate, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery will be in O.R rooms or in the outpatient clinic of the same faculty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient preparation The operation can be performed under general anesthesia. mental nerve&#xD;
      blocks will be given and infiltration for hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After allowing adequate time for vasoconstrictor effects to take place, the incision is&#xD;
      initiated in a layered approach through the labial mucosa and is continued through the&#xD;
      mentalis muscles and periosteum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure of the symphyseal bone is undertaken using periosteal elevators and the mental&#xD;
      nerves are visualized bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The roots of the incisors and canines should be localized and bone cuts should be made at&#xD;
      least 5 mm inferior to the root apices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The roots of canines can impede the operation and limit the size of graft. Similarly, the&#xD;
      surgeon should stay at least 5 mm away from the inferior border of the symphysis and the&#xD;
      mental foramina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone cuts can be made with a bur or reciprocating saw under copious saline irrigation. When&#xD;
      the desired bone cuts have been completed, thin straight or curved osteotomes are then used&#xD;
      to deliver the graft Hemostasis can be achieved using resorbable hemostatic agents or fibrin&#xD;
      glue. Long-lasting local anesthetic, e.g. bupivacaine, can be applied to the area to achieve&#xD;
      longer analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wound closure is done in two layers with a resorbable suture for the muscle layer and&#xD;
      fast-resorbing suture for the mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexible skin tape can be used on the chin for 3-5 days to reduce swelling and prevent wound&#xD;
      dehiscence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Layered Endural approach to TMJ making wedge in eminence by mallet &amp; chisel (green stick&#xD;
      fracture), then wedging piece of chin graft to increase the height of the eminence creating&#xD;
      an obstacle to treat dislocation by manipulation of patient mandible intra operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional mandibular movements were reproduced to confirm absence of subluxation and&#xD;
           checked for interference and any required adjustments made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A multilayer closure of the incisions will be accomplished using Vicryl sutures (88).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group ; CT scan will be done with the following criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
      bony window for facial bones, axial cuts, minimal slice thickness, minimal intervals between&#xD;
      the cuts, guantry tilt equals zero and finally DICOM files on CD .then, Using cad cam&#xD;
      software (mimics 15) , the virtual design and surgery will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Preparation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All surgeries will be performed under general anaesthesia (naso-endotracheal intubation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then the entire periarticular region and overlying skin will be infiltrated by 2%&#xD;
           lidocaine (20 ml lidocaine + adrenalin 1%) via a 25 gauge needle as an additional&#xD;
           anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Benzyl penicillin 2 MIU in combination with dicloxacillin 1 g will be administered&#xD;
           intravenously as prophylactic antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A line is drawn between the lateral eyebrow and tragus. The articular fossa and condylar&#xD;
           head is located 10 mm anterior to the tragus and 2-5 mm below this line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The temporofacial branch has relatively a constant course and vector being on a line&#xD;
           located 0.5 cm below the tragus of the ear, in the direction of the eyebrow and passing&#xD;
           1.5 cm above the lateral eyebrow. Just anterior to the condylar head where the articular&#xD;
           eminence will be identified by palpation and marked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TMJ will be exposed using the endural incision line and the articular eminence will be&#xD;
      identified&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To locate the articular eminence precisely, tissue must be exposed layer by layer until&#xD;
           the articular eminence is located. Then, a tunnel will be formed using blunt dissection&#xD;
           so that the front wall of the articular capsule can be exposed completely.(89-90-91 )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient specific PEEK eminence will be inserted and secured with two to three&#xD;
           pre-planed screws .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional mandibular movements were reproduced to confirm absence of subluxation and&#xD;
           checked for interference and any required adjustments made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A multilayer closure of the incisions will be accomplished using Vicryl sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups masseter muscle scarification through intra oral approach will be done with&#xD;
      post-operative intermaxillary fixation using ivy loops&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative instructions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Oral Maxillo-fac Surg Clin North Am (Quinn PD, 2000):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following postoperative protocol will be used for patients of both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Broad-spectrum antibiotics (penicillin V 1 g, or clindamycin 600 mg) and non-steroidal&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) will be prescribed for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be told to stay on a soft diet for 5 days and encouraged to resume a&#xD;
           normal diet as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiotherapy will start on postoperative day 1, and patients will be encouraged to&#xD;
           increase the exercise program as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be advised to continue physiotherapy for at least 1 year and possibly&#xD;
           longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cone Beam CT (CBCT) imaging will be performed at the first follow-up visit in order to&#xD;
           visualize the position of the patient specific titanium eminence, as well as the&#xD;
           position of the retention screws and their relationships to the surrounding vital&#xD;
           structures following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit: (every month till 4 month after operation) For group I: Regular follow up with&#xD;
      measuring maximum inter incisal distance with a caliper , check normal mandibular movement &amp;&#xD;
      other problems like pain ,discomfort &amp; swelling For group II: Regular follow up with&#xD;
      measuring maximum inter incisal distance with a caliper , check normal mandibular movement &amp;&#xD;
      other problems like pain ,discomfort &amp; swelling&#xD;
