      The aim of this study is to further evaluate this minimally invasive SSLF technique with&#xD;
      respect to safety, clinical effectiveness, and patient satisfaction. The procedure will be&#xD;
      performed in women electing to undergo surgical repair of their prolapse who wish to preserve&#xD;
      their uterus, and will be evaluated using standardized measures and questionnaires.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate sacrospinous ligament fixation using an incision-free technique - a&#xD;
      technique that was developed with the goal of offering a technically simple, safe, and&#xD;
      effective alternative to surgical prolapse repair procedures. When compared to previously&#xD;
      reported SSLF methods, this technique has undergone novel modifications with the intent of&#xD;
      maximizing efficacy and minimizing invasiveness. First, each sacrospinous ligament is&#xD;
      approached trans-vaginally using a small diameter, low profile needle as the delivery&#xD;
      platform for the anchoring unit. Secondly, the suspension is bilateral, thus maintaining&#xD;
      vaginal length and width without deviation or narrowing of the vagina as might occur with a&#xD;
      traditional (unilateral) sacrospinous repair. And third, using bio-degradable sutures and a&#xD;
      securing element that stabilizes the fixation as opposed to performing an incision in the&#xD;
      vaginal wall for suturing enables an incision-free procedure leaving the vagina free of any&#xD;
      device after a period of several weeks.&#xD;
