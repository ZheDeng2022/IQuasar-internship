    <textblock>
      A defect of the immune response has been described in patients with severe liver disease.&#xD;
      This immune-paresis is partly driven by a compensatory anti-inflammatory response following a&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome and affects the innate immune response. The innate&#xD;
      immune defect has been described in patients with advanced cirrhosis and more significantly&#xD;
      in patients with acute liver failure or acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). The&#xD;
      monocytes/macrophages pro-inflammatory response and finally the antimicrobial response are&#xD;
      thus strongly impaired, leading to higher sepsis risk. The monocytes/macrophages phenotype&#xD;
      associated with these functional alterations has been widely described, with a weaker&#xD;
      expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen - DR isotype (HLA-DR) on the monocytes surface,&#xD;
      correlated with poor outcomes. The low monocytic expression of HLA-DR, its functional and&#xD;
      clinical impact has been widely described in the context of septic shock with similar&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver transplantation (LT) is often the only therapeutic option for patients with advanced&#xD;
      liver failure. Post-transplant survival of the most severe patients is similar to the&#xD;
      survival in the whole population of LT patients, but the complication rate remains higher,&#xD;
      with a major risk of infection. Currently used immunosuppression protocols do not take into&#xD;
      account the quality of pre-transplant immune response. Some treatments, such as&#xD;
      corticosteroids, which are widely used for the induction of post-transplant&#xD;
      immunosuppression, may affect the innate immune response. However, it has been shown that low&#xD;
      expression of post-transplant monocyte HLA-DR was associated with a greater risk of septic&#xD;
      complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of this study is to focus on the evolution of a robust marker of immune&#xD;
      dysfunction, HLA-DR monocyte expression, before and following LT, and to analyse its post LT&#xD;
      expression depending on the level of pre-transplant expression as well as its association&#xD;
      with post-transplant complications. This study will bring new insights for the design of a&#xD;
      prospective study on the relevance of adapting post-transplant immunosuppression protocols to&#xD;
      HLA-DR expression on monocytes surface, which is a robust marker of the innate immune&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of innate immune dysfunction pre-LT by quantification of monocytic HLA-DR&#xD;
      expression and monitoring of its post-LT kinetics may be relevant for assessing&#xD;
      post-transplant immune status and adapting immunosuppressive therapy. A descriptive,&#xD;
      observational study associating clinical and biological data is needed to confirm the&#xD;
      relevance of HLA-DR expression quantification on the surface of monocytes in a population of&#xD;
      selected patients, before and after LT. These data will allow setting up a prospective&#xD;
      interventional study reporting the possible benefit of post-transplant immunosuppressive&#xD;
      treatment modulation, according to the HLA-DR monocyte dosage and its kinetics evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to describe the association between evolution of&#xD;
      monocytic HLA-DR expression on monocytes/macrophages surface during the first month after LT&#xD;
      and the occurrence of one of the 2 following clinical events reflecting a post LT immune&#xD;
      dysfunction (acute cell rejection and sepsis).&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome will be the kinetics of HLA-DR expression on the monocytes / macrophages surface during the first month after LT as a function of pre-LT status (Nadir, normalization delay of HLA-DR expression) and its association with 2 clinical events reflecting post-LT immune dysfunction (acute cell rejection and sepsis).&#xD;
Expression of HLA-DR is measured by the number of receptors expressed by monocytes and measured by flow cytometry at different times: at inclusion (D0), Month 3, Month 6, the day of LT and twice a week for 1 month in post LT.</description>
