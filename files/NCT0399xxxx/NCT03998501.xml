  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A substantial proportion of public safety personnel (PSP) develop service-related&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is associated with a range of negative outcomes&#xD;
      and its exact underlying neurophysiological mechanism is still not well understood. Cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT) is commonly prescribed to treat PTSD, and recent studies suggest&#xD;
      that it may be effective in preventing the condition. We have developed a 5-session class&#xD;
      focused on teaching introductory CBT skills to prevent and manage psychological distress, and&#xD;
      we are currently in the process of launching a clinical trial to demonstrate its&#xD;
      effectiveness in preventing PTSD and related conditions in PSP. In the proposed adjunctive&#xD;
      study to this trial, we will quantitate the brain connectivity signature that is specific to&#xD;
      the PTSD-resilience, and examine whether the classes increase this resilience-related brain&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our ultimate research goal is to develop and validate a preventive strategy for PTSD. We aim&#xD;
      to 1) demonstrate neurophysiological evidence (using fMRI) of preventive CBTm classes for&#xD;
      PTSD, and 2) validate the utility of the proposed imaging-based biomarker for PTSD-related&#xD;
      resiliency. Emerging evidence suggests that a program such as CBTm classes could promote&#xD;
      resiliency to PTSD in healthy individuals at high risk for trauma exposure. Further, our&#xD;
      preliminary brain imaging data analysis suggests that we can quantitate the brain&#xD;
      connectivity pattern that may reflect resilience to PTSD. We thus hypothesize that CBTm will&#xD;
      increase the PTSD resilience-related brain connectivity pattern expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this novel pilot imaging study, we will recruit 40 PSP without PTSD or other mental&#xD;
      disorder from 120 participants participating in our larger clinical trial. Twenty will be&#xD;
      from each arm (CBTm and wait-list). The effect of CBTm on fMRI-based measures will be&#xD;
      compared between arms.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be enrolled in our on-going parallel study - &quot;Cognitive Behaviour Therapy with&#xD;
             Mindfulness Course for Building Workplace Resilience: A Pilot Randomized Controlled&#xD;
             Trial&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  if they have received psychological or medication treatment for a mental disorder in&#xD;
             the past 6 months or if they score above the clinical cutoff on the following&#xD;
             self-report symptom measures: Posttraumatic Checklist-5 (PCL-5) score &gt;37; Patient&#xD;
             Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score (depression) &gt;10, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7&#xD;
             (GAD-7) score &gt;7, and the presence of suicidal ideation in the past six months.&#xD;
             Individuals falling below these cutoff scores will receive further diagnostic&#xD;
             assessment by a supervised PhD graduate student in Clinical Psychology. Those meeting&#xD;
             criteria for PTSD or other mental disorder in the past 12 months as assessed by the&#xD;
             Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) or the Mini International&#xD;
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI v.7.0.2) will also be excluded. Finally, we will&#xD;
             exclude individuals with any contraindication to MRI (e.g., claustrophobia and metal&#xD;
             implants).&#xD;
