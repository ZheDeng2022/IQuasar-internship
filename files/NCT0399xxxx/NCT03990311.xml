  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial in which maintenance hemodialysis patients will be&#xD;
      provided with salt restricted 'dialysis friendly' meals and compared to a control arm&#xD;
      receiving usual care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients randomized to the intervention arm will receive 2 months of meals plus dietary&#xD;
      counseling. Counseling will continue for an additional 3 months while the control arm will&#xD;
      have 5 months of usual care followed by 2 months of meal provision. Effects on interdialytic&#xD;
      weight gain, achievement of target dry weight, intradialytic hypotension episodes, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and a volume assessment using lung U/S to assess lung water will be measured. Salt&#xD;
      sensitivity will be tested throughout the study. Self reported questionnaires about the&#xD;
      burden of adhering to the low salt diet and the level of adherence with it will be completed&#xD;
      at baseline and throughout the study. The investigator hypothesizes that the prepared meals&#xD;
      with prime patients behavior and may alter salt taste perception and that these effects will&#xD;
      be sustained after the prepared meals have stopped.&#xD;
