  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about whether taking the medication, Prazosin, immediately and&#xD;
      during the weeks immediately following a traumatic event can help to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Early post traumatic event sleep disturbance&#xD;
      predicts the later development of PTSD. Prazosin has shown some effectiveness in reducing&#xD;
      trauma related nightmares and sleep disturbance. We hypothesize that regulating sleep&#xD;
      immediately after a sexual assault will reduce PTSD and diminish symptoms.&#xD;

      This study plans to learn more about whether taking the medication, Prazosin, in the weeks&#xD;
      immediately following a traumatic event can help to reduce the risk of developing&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Test the efficacy of the drug prazosin in decreasing PTSD symptom severity as&#xD;
      compared to placebo at 3 months post rape as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD&#xD;
      Scale version 5 (CAPS-5, primary outcome) as well as associated secondary outcomes (PTSD&#xD;
      diagnosis rate, sleep scores, and depression symptoms) at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a: Severity score on the CAPS-5 will be significantly lower in rape victims randomized to&#xD;
      receive prazosin within 24 hours of at the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH) Emergency&#xD;
      Department and continue on a titrated dose for one month compared to the control group at 3&#xD;
      months post rape. Secondarily, PTSD diagnosis rate will be lower in the prazosin group versus&#xD;
      the control group at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b: Participants randomized to receive prazosin will have better sleep scores as measured by&#xD;
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and PSQI Trauma addendum at 3 months post rape as&#xD;
      compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1c: Severity scores for major depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9) will be significantly lower in rape victims randomized to receive&#xD;
      prazosin as compared to the control group at 3 months post rape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1d: Sleep scores as measured by the PSQI and PSQI Trauma addendum will be positively&#xD;
      correlated with PTSD symptom severity as measured by the CAPS-5 such that higher (worse)&#xD;
      sleep scores are associated with more PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Many studies have shown that sleep disturbances and nightmares that occur directly&#xD;
      after a traumatic event are a good predictor of the development of PTSD. Prazosin has been&#xD;
      shown to improve PTSD-related sleep disturbance, including nightmares. If prazosin can&#xD;
      effectively treat sleep disturbance in the weeks immediately following a traumatic experience&#xD;
      and decrease the rate of PTSD and the severity of symptoms, then it could possibly become the&#xD;
      standard of care for individuals exposed to a traumatizing event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief overview of methods: Females between the ages of 18 and 50 years will be recruited&#xD;
      directly from the ED at University of Colorado Hospital with the assistance of the Forensic&#xD;
      Nurse Examiners. Those who elect to take part in this study and complete the informed consent&#xD;
      process will be randomized to receive either prazosin or placebo. This is a double-blind&#xD;
      study, so neither the participant nor the study doctor/team will know whether a participant&#xD;
      is in the treatment (prazosin) or control (placebo) group. Participants will receive three&#xD;
      2mg tabs and three 1mg tbs for titration purposes (prazosin or placebo equivalent) before&#xD;
      they leave the hospital, with instructions to take the first dose (2 mg) 1 hour before bed,&#xD;
      the first night after being seen in the ED. Study staff will follow up the next day to&#xD;
      inquire about the participant's general condition, possible side-effects, sleep, and to&#xD;
      schedule the first study visit (at ~72 hours after treatment in ED). PTSD and posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress symptoms, symptoms of depression, suicidality, medication compliance, side-effects and&#xD;
      adverse events will be monitored and assessed by study personnel at weekly study visits for&#xD;
      the duration of the med trial (~6 weeks; 3 weeks on medication and 2-3 weeks of tapering off&#xD;
      of medication) and again at 3-months post. However, participants will be instructed to report&#xD;
      any changes or concerns as needed. Each participant will also complete a daily sleep log for&#xD;
      the duration of their participation in the study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants in this study will include 40 adult females who complete consent (20 per arm), ages 18-50 years, who are evaluated and treated at the University of Colorado Hospital after an alleged sexual assault on their person. Randomization will be completed by the pharmacy and study condition (prazosin/treatment vs. placebo/control) masked throughout the data collection portion of the study. Participants will attend weekly visits during the 3-week medication trial and 2-3 week tapering off of medication, followed regular check-in phone calls with study staff between stopping the medication and the follow-up assessments at the final study visit (approx. 3 moths post study enrollment).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in PTSD symptoms and severity - Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale - 5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>The full interview takes 45-60 minutes to administer and will be given at baseline, at approximately 31 days post event, and at three months.</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale-5 (CAPS-5) - Past Month &amp; Past Week. The CAPS is the gold standard in PTSD assessment and the total score will serve as the primary outcome. The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview to make a current (past month) diagnosis of PTSD, a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD, and assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. The full interview takes 45-60 minutes to administer and will be given at baseline, at approximately 31 days post event, and at three months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>The PSQI will be completed weekly through study completion (average three months).</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a 19-item self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month interval. The questionnaire takes 10-15 minutes to complete. Total score from PSQI will be a secondary outcome of sleep with higher score indicating poorer sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index - Trauma Addendum (PSQI-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>The PSQI-A will be completed weekly through study completion (average three months).</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI-A is a 7-item self-report questionnaire administered in conjunction with PSQI to examine the frequency of seven disruptive nocturnal behaviors common to PTSD among adults. Total score on PSQI-A will be a secondary outcome of trauma-associated sleep issues.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>It takes about five minutes to complete and will be assessed weekly for the first seven weeks of participation and at three months/study completion (at each study visit).</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a 10-item self-report questionnaire used in screening, diagnosing, monitoring, and measuring the severity of depression. Using an independent structured mental health professional interview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score of 10 or more corresponded to good sensitivity and specificity (both 88%) for major depression.33 Total score will be a secondary outcome of depression symptom severity and score &gt;=10 will be used to indicate major depression at 3 months.</description>
