&#xD;
          -  'High risk' rectal cancer, or rectal cancers that are considered marginally perable&#xD;
             where there is a significant risk of positive surgical margin:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  T3 or T4, and / or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumour infiltrating perirectal fat and/ or mesorectal fascia, and / or Involvement of&#xD;
             pelvic lymph nodes, and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumour invading surrounding structures or peritoneum or vasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function as defined by: absolute neutrophil&#xD;
             count &gt;= 1.5 x 109/L, hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/L, platelets &gt;= 100 x 109/L, serum creatinine&#xD;
             level &lt; 1.5 x ULN (or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;=50 ml/min, whichever is&#xD;
             worse), total bilirubin &lt;=1.5 x the upper limit of normal, alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
             (ALT) &lt; 3 upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known distant metastasis, even if the metastasis has been resected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of another invasive malignancy within the last 5 years, except for treated&#xD;
             basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or breast DCIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Upper rectal cancer that is located above the peritoneal reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with synchronous colon and rectal cancers are not excluded as long as: (1)&#xD;
             these tumors are considered as two separate primaries (i.e. not metastasis or a&#xD;
             contiguous part of a large primary), (2) both tumors are not causing imminent&#xD;
             obstruction; (3) pelvic radiotherapy is not considered a contraindication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary tumour associated with any one of the following features:Frank intestinal&#xD;
             obstruction, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Endoscope unable to pass through the tumour's lumen plus worsening local obstructive&#xD;
             symptoms. Note: Patients with such features should be assessed by the surgical team&#xD;
             regarding stomal bypass prior to study enrolment. Such patients can still be&#xD;
             considered for study enrolment after undergoing stomal bypass.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Previous pelvic radiotherapy&#xD;

             within the last 14 days are still eligible, as long as the patient has sufficiently&#xD;
             recovered from the surgery at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known cardiac disease that is symptomatic or poorly controlled, including cardiac&#xD;

             life-threatening and require ongoing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to take capecitabine tablets uncrushed by the oral route (e.g.&#xD;
             enteral feeding). Patients with significantly impaired gastrointestinal integrity and&#xD;
             absorption are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known and untreated bilateral hydronephrosis and/or hydroureters (or&#xD;
             unilateral hydronephrosis and/or hydroureters in any patient with a single kidney) are&#xD;
             excluded. The obstruction should be treated with ureteric stent(s) or percutaneous&#xD;
             nephrostomy(s) prior to study enrolment. Patients with unilateral hydronephrosis&#xD;
             and/or hydroureters and adequate renal function (i.e. as stated in the eligibility&#xD;
             criteria: serum creatinine level &lt; 1.5 x ULN, or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;=50&#xD;
             ml/min - whichever is worse) are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on warfarin therapy. Patients on low molecular weight heparin are not&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
