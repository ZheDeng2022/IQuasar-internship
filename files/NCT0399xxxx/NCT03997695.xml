  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a 6-week core stabilization exercise (CSE)&#xD;
      program with and without kinesio taping on pain, fatigue, health status, quality of life,&#xD;
      sleep quality and depression in woman with fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were allocated into two groups as CSE and CSE plus kinesio taping group. Pain,&#xD;
      fatigue, health status, quality of life, sleep quality and depression were assessed at the&#xD;
      baseline and after 6-weeks treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A 6-weeks prospective randomized controlled trial examined the effects of core stabilization&#xD;
      exercise (CSE) plus kinesio taping (KT) compared to CSE alone on pain, fatigue, health&#xD;
      status, quality of life, sleep quality and depression in woman with FM. The trial was&#xD;
      approved by the Ethics committee of Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University (Approval time and&#xD;
      number: 17.01.2018-14). The study was performed in compliance with Helsinki Declaration where&#xD;
      applicable. The patient's recruitment started in February 2018. The patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia according to the criteria of the 1990 American College of Rheumatology&#xD;
      participated in the study. Prior to the treatment and after 6-weeks treatment, participants'&#xD;
      pain level, fatigue, health status, quality of life (QoL), psychological status and sleep&#xD;
      quality were assessed. Assessments were realized by face-to-face interview method.Patients&#xD;
      who participated in CSE group performed CSE program alone, whereas patients in CSE+KT group&#xD;
      performed CSE program with KT application. The treatment was carried out 2 days a week for 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
