  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit obese subjects with pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes for the&#xD;
      proposed clinical study for 5 visits. After informed written consent is obtained, subjects&#xD;
      will be admitted to the Clinical Research Center, and will undergo upper endoscopic injection&#xD;
      of Botox into the duodenal wall. The investigators anticipate that injections of Botox into&#xD;
      the duodenal wall will result in significant weight loss and improvements in glucose&#xD;
      tolerance and duodenal nutrient sensitivity. Subjects will be studied over a period of 6&#xD;
      months. Subjects will be asked to complete 5 study visits: On the first visit, each subject&#xD;
      will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test. At visit 2, subjects will undergo an&#xD;
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy procedure for the delivery of Botox to the duodenal wall. Visits&#xD;
      3-5 will be made 1, 3, and 6 months later. On every study visit, body weight and body&#xD;
      composition will be recorded and oral glucose tolerance test will be performed. Nutrient&#xD;
      sensing test will be performed at visits 1 and 3.&#xD;

      Obese subjects (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes will be&#xD;
      recruited by solicitation flyers, advertisements, and mass emails. Subjects who do not&#xD;
      qualify for bariatric surgery, or subjects who are awaiting insurance approval for a&#xD;
      bariatric procedure at the Center of Surgical Weight Loss at Vanderbilt University Medical&#xD;
      Center will also be contacted via emails and telephone calls. Subjects will be directed to&#xD;
      contact the researcher (Drs. Abumrad and Sundaresan) directly for more information. The&#xD;
      recruiter will review inclusion and exclusion criteria and explain the study procedures,&#xD;
      duration of the study and potential risks. If the subject indicates interest, screening will&#xD;
      be performed to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo an initial screen by the study coordinator or research staff to assess&#xD;
      eligibility and ability to comply with the study requirements. Prior to each study visit,&#xD;
      subjects on oral anti-diabetic medications will be asked to discontinue these medications 4&#xD;
      days prior to their study visit. Diabetic subjects will be instructed to monitor their&#xD;
      pre-prandial blood glucose during this time and to contact the study physician if their blood&#xD;
      glucose levels are greater than 250 mg/dL for two consecutive readings. The study physician&#xD;
      may instruct the subject to initiate short-term insulin therapy or resume their oral&#xD;
      anti-diabetic medications; in either case the subject will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual diet and physical activity levels for 1&#xD;
      week prior to each study visit and to arrive fasted for every visit (only water after&#xD;
      dinner).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be recruited for 5 study visits. After informed, written consent is&#xD;
      obtained, subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Research Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will arrive after an overnight fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will undergo standard physical examination; anthropometric measurements (height,&#xD;
           weight, waist and hip circumference) perform body composition assessment via dual-energy&#xD;
           x-ray absorptiometry imaging will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline glucose tolerance will be assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be handed a visual analog scale questionnaire designed to capture their&#xD;
           perceived hunger and satiety sensations, food preferences, cravings, and feeding&#xD;
           behavior prior to intervention. The questions will be explained by the researcher and&#xD;
           subjects will be instructed to bring in the completed questionnaire on their second&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be provided snacks and asked to return at 7 pm for the nutrient sensing&#xD;
           test to be performed the following day. The subject will be fed a standardized meal and&#xD;
           restricted to water after 8:00 pm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn for determination of fasting plasma insulin, and gut hormones&#xD;
           including ghrelin, Gastric inhibitory peptide, glucagon like peptide-1, pancreatic&#xD;
           polypeptide and Peptide YY.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject will then consume a standardized 250 kcal liquid mixed meal containing 40 g&#xD;
           carbohydrates, 6 g fat, and 9 g protein within 10 minutes. Blood will be drawn at 15,&#xD;
           30, 60, and 120 minutes after consumption following which subject will be discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 2 (within 2 weeks after the first visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy procedure for the delivery of BOTOX to&#xD;
           the duodenal wall, to be performed by Dr. Patrick Yachimski at the Vanderbilt&#xD;
           Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Suite. The investigators have been exempted from&#xD;
           Investigational New Drug (IND) regulation for the proposed testing by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be monitored for at least two hours and discharged with instructions for&#xD;
           follow-up and contact information of the physicians' team (Drs. Abumrad, Yachimski).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits 3-5 (1, 3, and 6 months after endoscopy): On every study visit, body weight,&#xD;
      body composition, food intake, and feeding behavior will be recorded and post-absorptive&#xD;
      glucose tolerance will be performed. Nutrient sensing test will be repeated at visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (Study visits 1 and 3-5):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 0: Subjects will be fasting overnight (and restricted to water only after 8 pm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1: Blood will be drawn for determining fasting blood glucose levels. At 8:00 am&#xD;
           subjects will drink a solution of 75 grams dextrose in 300 ml of water in 10 minutes.&#xD;
           Blood will be drawn at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min post ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject will be fed a standardized snack and discharged around noon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic delivery of BOTOX (Study Visit 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will arrive fasted at the GI Suite in the main hospital at Vanderbilt&#xD;
           University for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Under the supervision of an anesthesiologist, subjects will be given combination of&#xD;
           intravenous medications, so they fall asleep. Dr. Yachimski will then pass the&#xD;
           endoscope, a long, flexible tube with light, video camera and channel for small&#xD;
           instruments including syringes through the esophagus and stomach, pylorus into the&#xD;
           junction of the 1st and 2nd parts of the duodenum. Botox (100 units dissolved in 200 μL&#xD;
           of sterile, preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride) will be injected along the medial&#xD;
           (mesenteric) border, into the duodenal muscle wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post endoscopy Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following completion of endoscopy procedure and emergence from anesthesia, subjects will&#xD;
           be monitored in the dedicated post-anesthesia care unit prior to discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be provided written instructions regarding potential signs and symptoms of&#xD;
           adverse events, including fever, pain, bleeding, and muscle weakness. They will be&#xD;
           provided the physician call number for any questions or issues that may arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrient sensing test (study visit 1 and 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1: After oral glucose tolerance test subjects return at 7:00 pm. They will be fed a&#xD;
           standardized meal and fasted overnight (restricted to water after 8:00 pm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 2: At 8:00 am, blood will be drawn for determination of fasting plasma insulin and&#xD;
           gut hormones stated above. Subject will then consume a standardized 250 kcal liquid&#xD;
           mixed meal containing 40 g carbohydrates, 6 g fat, and 9 g protein to be administered&#xD;
           over a 10-min period. Blood will be drawn 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes later. At the end&#xD;
           of the study, subject will be provided a standardized meal/snack and discharged.&#xD;
