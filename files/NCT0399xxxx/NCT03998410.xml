  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate Lung Doppler signals (LDS) among patients&#xD;
      presenting to the emergency department with acute dyspnea, in order to determine the&#xD;
      diagnostic value of this non-invasive method to discriminate ADHF causing dyspnea from any&#xD;
      other cause i.e., non-ADHF causes of dyspnea.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea (shortness of breath) is a common symptom affecting as many as 25% of patients seen&#xD;
      in ambulatory settings. It can be caused by many different underlying conditions, some of&#xD;
      which arise acutely and can be life-threatening, making rapid clinical evaluation and&#xD;
      targeted diagnostic studies of central importance. A number of disorders cause dyspnea,&#xD;
      including acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD), asthma, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, metabolic acidosis, neuromuscular weakness,&#xD;
      and others. The overlapping clinical presentations of these conditions and comorbid diseases&#xD;
      can make the diagnostic evaluation of dyspnea a significant challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute heart failure (AHF) is a major cause of serious morbidity and death in the general&#xD;
      population and one of the most common medical causes of hospitalization among people aged&#xD;
      over 60. Patients presenting to the ED with ADHF must be evaluated and treated rapidly to&#xD;
      ensure the best possible outcomes. The diagnosis should be made as soon as possible and&#xD;
      therapy initiated. Delayed diagnosis at presentation may also result in patients being&#xD;
      inappropriately transferred to non-specialist wards, resulting in longer stays, increased&#xD;
      re-admission and poorer outcomes. The key to improving the time to diagnosis depends on the&#xD;
      clinical evaluation alongside a readiness to initiate relevant additional tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that the TPD has the potential to differentiate between the cardiac&#xD;
      cause of dyspnea and any other cause.&#xD;
