&#xD;
          1. Signed and dated, written informed consent form (ICF) prior to any trial-specific&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a SIRPα polymorphism including at least one V1 allele will be selected&#xD;
             (i.e., homozygous V1/V1 or heterozygous V1/V2 in separate cohorts in escalation [Step&#xD;
             1] and only homozygous V1/V1 in expansion cohorts [Step 2]); SIRPα polymorphism will&#xD;
             be assessed in blood sampling (patient DNA) in a central laboratory; V1 allele is&#xD;
             understood to include V1 and V1-like alleles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In Step 1: Patients with histologically or cytologically documented&#xD;
             advanced/metastatic primary or recurrent malignancies who failed or are not eligible&#xD;
             to standard therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
             In Step 2: Patients with histologically or cytologically documented&#xD;
             advanced/metastatic primary or recurrent solid tumors who failed or are not eligible&#xD;
             to standard therapy with the following tumour types: NSCLC, TNBC, pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
             melanoma, HNSCC, RCC, UC, SCL, gastric cancer, CRC and ovarian cancer. Patients&#xD;
             included in Step 2 must have no alternative treatment and have been previously treated&#xD;
             with the standard of care therapy including chemotherapy, targeted therapy and/or&#xD;

             treatment administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Biopsy sites should be carefully selected by the investigator so that it is safe for&#xD;
             the patient and subsequent biopsy can be performed at the same location; also if&#xD;

             male subjects participating in the study may use hormone based contraceptives as one&#xD;
             of the acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug&#xD;
