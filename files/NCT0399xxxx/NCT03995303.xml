  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of short hospital stays, and nutritional status worsening for geriatric patients,&#xD;
      time to improve this is limited. It seems necessary to integrate nutritional support after&#xD;
      discharge, to prevent the consequences of malnutrition on health and physical capability.&#xD;
      This study tests whether nutrition support using NCP (Nutrition Care Process) (1) in&#xD;
      combination with delivered meals designed for old adults, improves nutritional status, muscle&#xD;
      strength, physical function, quality of life and rehospitalization and mortality rates after&#xD;
      discharge, compared to currently used care (2 = control) along with historical data.&#xD;
      Participants (N = 200), will be randomized into two groups, the intervention will last 24&#xD;
      weeks. A dietitian (Ph.D. student) visits participants in the intervention group 5 times&#xD;
      during the study period. Outcome parameters will be measured before discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital, at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks. Data on hospital readmission and mortality will be&#xD;
      followed up at 6 months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition or disease: Malnutrition Intervention/treatment: NCP by a dietitian and free food&#xD;
      constructed to fulfill protein and energy needs for the group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is common in older people admitted to the hospital and can worsen after&#xD;
      discharge. Therefore, it seems necessary to integrate nutritional support not only during the&#xD;
      hospital stay but also in the period after discharge. The aim of this Randomized Controlled&#xD;
      Trial (RCT) is to test whether nutritional support provided by a dietitian, using Nutrition&#xD;
      Care Process in combination with delivered meals designed for the needs of older adults&#xD;
      (group 1), improves nutritional status, muscle strength, physical function, quality of life&#xD;
      and as a secondary outcome re-hospitalization and/or mortality of geriatric patients with&#xD;
      malnutrition risk after discharge compared to currently used standard care (group 2 =&#xD;
      control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time and work plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need identification and product ideas ready&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Packaging material ready&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate of the feasibility of meals for old adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allowances from the ethical committee, the data protection committee, the Ph.D.&#xD;
           committee of the Faculty of Food Science and Nutrition at the University of Iceland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The last participant recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 36 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Database ready&#xD;

&#xD;
      Methods-Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 24-week randomized controlled trial will randomize the participants (N = 200) to two&#xD;
      groups. The dietitian (Ph.D. student) will perform a total of 5 home visits during the study&#xD;
      period to participants in the intervention group. Meals will be delivered weekly to the&#xD;
      participants. Outcome parameters will be measured just before discharge from the hospital and&#xD;
      after 12 weeks and at 24 weeks in the home of the participants. Data on hospital re-admission&#xD;
      and mortality will also be followed up at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the intervention is to implement individual dietetic advice and optimize&#xD;
      participants' nutritional status by following the Nutritional Care Process*, involving&#xD;
      nutritional assessment, diagnosis, intervention, monitoring, and evaluation. Dietary&#xD;
      counseling, motivation, and education will help to maintain participants' body weight, and&#xD;
      ensure that energy and protein requirements as well as for other critical nutrients are&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *The Nutrition Care Process (NCP) reflects the current state of the art in nutrition care and&#xD;
      is designed to improve the consistency and quality of individualized care for patients and&#xD;
      the predictability of the patient outcomes. It is not intended to standardize nutrition care&#xD;
      for each patient, but to establish a standardized process for providing care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the aim, the dietitian (Ph.D. student) will meet the participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group, six times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The day before discharge where baseline measurements will be done,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 week after discharge,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 weeks after discharge,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 weeks after discharge,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  9 weeks after discharge, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 weeks after discharge where endpoint measurements will be done. The dietitian (Ph.D.&#xD;
           student) will perform an individual nutritional assessment focusing on dietary intake,&#xD;
           activity level and weight of each participant, as a basis for developing an&#xD;
           individualized nutrition care plan consistent with estimated nutritional requirements&#xD;
           and nutritional rehabilitation goals. Total fluid, energy- and protein requirements will&#xD;
           be estimated for each patient. To assess dietary intake, the dietitian will perform a&#xD;
           dietary history interview at each visit to determine fluid, energy and protein intake of&#xD;
           the participant. Strategies for achieving fluid, energy and protein requirements and&#xD;
           achieving compliance included dietary counseling with attention to nutritional risk&#xD;
           factors, timing, size and frequency of meals, recommendations for nutrient dense foods&#xD;
           and drinks, and provision of educational material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If relevant, the dietitian will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  initiate the prescription of oral nutritional supplements with high energy and protein&#xD;
           density that will be reimbursed by Health Insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contact providers of meals-on-wheels to change the meals to high energy and protein&#xD;
           dense menu or to mashed/puréed food.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recommend use of vitamin D, calcium and other vitamins-minerals considered necessary to&#xD;
           achieve optimal nutritional status,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Invite home care and community nursing staff to participate in home visits to achieve&#xD;
           the best possible outcome for the patient by interdisciplinary collaboration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If considered relevant the participants will receive a short consultation by telephone by the&#xD;
      dietitian to give advice and to stimulate compliance to the proposed nutritional care plan&#xD;
      in-between the home visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will meet the dietitian/staff for baseline, 12 weeks and at the 24-week&#xD;
      endpoint measurements. The control group will not receive any dietary counseling or education&#xD;
      during the study period which reflects current clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ph.D. students' contributions A Ph.D. student in clinical nutrition (Berglind Soffía&#xD;
      Blondal) will be the project manager of the intervention study on a day-to-day base. The&#xD;
      student will be supervised by Prof. Alfons Ramel and Assoc. Prof. Ólöf Guðný Geirsdóttir,&#xD;
      both on the Faculty of Food Science and Nutrition. The student will be involved in&#xD;
      application work to the ethical committee, screening, conduct of the intervention study, data&#xD;
      work and writing of scientific papers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Landspitali- University&#xD;
      Hospital of Iceland and informed written consent will be obtained from all participants. The&#xD;
      study can only improve the nutritional status of geriatric patients that take part in the&#xD;
      intervention groups. The participants in the control group, however, won't get any&#xD;
      nutritional interventions and therefore have a greater risk of re-admissions and a worse&#xD;
      overall outcome compared to the intervention groups.&#xD;
