  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective natural history study of CIPN in approximately 200 participants&#xD;
      receiving taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) for breast cancer or vincristine for lymphoma.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled over approximately 1-year. Demographic data, medical history,&#xD;
      electronic PROs, ClinROs and NF-L will be assessed at Baseline. The Observation Period will&#xD;
      initiate with the first dose of chemotherapy and conclude with the last dose of chemotherapy.&#xD;
      During the Observation Period, participants will be evaluated for the development of CIPN&#xD;
      using PROs and ClinROs. NF-L will be measured at various timepoints corresponding with&#xD;
      treatment regimen schedules throughout the Observation Period. The Post Chemotherapy&#xD;
      Follow-up Period will begin with the first visit after the last dose of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      conclude 6 months after the last dose of chemotherapy. During the Post Chemotherapy Follow-up&#xD;
      Period, participants will be evaluated for CIPN using PROs and ClinROs. NF-L will also be&#xD;
      measured at the beginning and at the end of the Post-Chemotherapy Follow-up Period. PROs will&#xD;
      be assessed electronically on a monthly basis.&#xD;

        The study will enroll approximately 200 participants from a total of approximately 10 sites&#xD;
        in the United States. Each participant will participate for a duration of up to 1 year&#xD;
        after the first dose of chemotherapy. Approximately 130 breast cancer participants will be&#xD;
        enrolled (approximately 65 participants receiving paclitaxel and 65 receiving docetaxel).&#xD;
        Approximately 65 participants with lymphoma receiving vincristine will be enrolled&#xD;
