    <textblock>
      The EquiMolar Oxygen and Nitrous Oxyde mix (EMONO) is listed by the ANSM (National Agency for&#xD;
      the Safety of Medicines and Health Products) as drugs with enhanced surveillance. EMONO is a&#xD;
      gas composed equally of oxygen and nitrous oxide, presented in bottle. The University&#xD;
      Hospital of Nantes is currently conducting a general evaluation of the EMONO use in the&#xD;
      hospital context. The department of odontology is part of this movement and wants to study&#xD;
      the anxiolytic effect expected during dental care under MEOPA in children in the Dental Care&#xD;
      Center. This analysis follows a previous study (MEOPAeDent) that subjectively took into&#xD;
      account this anxiolysis.&#xD;

      The EquiMolar Oxygen and Nitrous Oxide Mix (EMONO) is listed by the ANSM (National Agency for&#xD;
      the Safety of Medicines and Health Products) as drugs with enhanced surveillance. EMONO is a&#xD;
      gas composed equally of oxygen and nitrous oxide, presented in bottle. It has had a marketing&#xD;
      authorization in France since 2001. Until 2009, it was reserved for hospital use and&#xD;
      emergency vehicles; and indicated in the analgesia of short-term painful acts or during&#xD;
      medical assistance. urgency in adults and children, dental sedation in children and frail&#xD;
      subjects, and obstetrics. The actual benefit was considered important by the Transparency&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2009, a modification of the MAH for EMONO-based specialties has authorized their&#xD;
      release from the hospital reserve, which can now be issued for professional use in city and&#xD;
      dental surgery. Given the risks associated with the use of EMONO, in particular its potential&#xD;
      for abuse and dependence, the ANSM conditioned its availability outside health facilities to&#xD;
      the implementation of a common national RMP. This measure was also accompanied by a national&#xD;
      monitoring of pharmacovigilance and addictovigilance. The latter is under the responsibility&#xD;
      of CEIP-A of Nantes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University Hospital of Nantes is currently conducting a general evaluation of the use of&#xD;
      EMONO in the hospital context. The department of odontology is part of this movement and&#xD;
      wants to study the anxiolytic effect expected during dental care under EMONO in children in&#xD;
      the Dental Care Center. This analysis follows a previous study (MEOPAeDent) that subjectively&#xD;
      took into account this anxiolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of this study will allow us to improve the good use of MEOPA for dental care.&#xD;

    <description>The criterion for assessing the child's stress based on the care taken will be the significant variation in heart rate at another point in the treatment session: at the time of the end of the inhalation and care. Comparison will be made between children having pulptomy or extraction.</description>

    <description>A Veerkamp Modified VENHAM Anxiety Assessment Scale will also be used before and after dental care ( from 0 to relaxed to 5 for extremely stressed) by the dentist. Comparison will also be made between chidren having pulpotomy or extraction.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children from 3 to 15 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requiring dental treatment under EMONO including local anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not opposed, as well as parents, to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having a sufficiently cooperative attitude to allow the installation of the monitoring&#xD;
             equipment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use of EMONO for dental care must be a first time for the child&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The excluded patients will be those whose number of care is too important, justifying&#xD;
             a general anesthesia. Similarly, patients who do not require anesthesia for their care&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
