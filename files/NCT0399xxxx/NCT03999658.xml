    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy, as measured by the objective response rate, of STI-3031,&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, global Phase 2 basket study to investigate the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of STI-3031 in patients with selected relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory (R/R) malignancies. The study will be conducted as separate Phase 2, single arm&#xD;
      substudies for each of the indications below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with PD-L1 gene translocation, copy gain,&#xD;
           amplification, polysomy detectable by a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay&#xD;
           or Epstein-Barr virus positivity (EBV+) as assessed by EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER)&#xD;
           testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biliary tract cancers (BTC) (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma), extrahepatic&#xD;
           cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer)&#xD;
