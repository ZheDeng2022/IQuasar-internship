  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure (HF) have an amelioration in clinical outcomes during a&#xD;
      restricted dietary salt intake. To date, they experienced an amelioration of functional New&#xD;
      York Association Heart (NYHA) class, reduction of hospital admissions, and mortality, in a&#xD;
      percentage about 60%. However, these data have been not investigated in CRTd patients with HF&#xD;
      under a condition of restricted vs. normal dietary salt intake. In the present study authors&#xD;
      will evaluate clinical outcomes in patients treated by Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy with&#xD;
      a defibrillator (CRT-d) and restricted dietary salt intake (group 1) in addition to&#xD;
      conventional heart failure (HF) therapy vs. CRTd patients under conventional dietary salt&#xD;
      intake and conventional HF therapy (group 2). The study will be conducted during a 12-months&#xD;
      of follow-up, to evaluate the prognosis of CRTd patients treated with restricted (n 271) vs.&#xD;
      a matched cohort of CRTd patients treated with normal salt dietary intake in addition to&#xD;
      conventional HF therapy (n 288). Authors' opinion is that, restricted salt intake in addition&#xD;
      to conventional HF therapy might significantly reduce body weight and heart chambers volumes&#xD;
      in CRTd patients, leading to a significant improvement of ejection fraction and of the 6&#xD;
      minutes walking test (6MWT), and to a reduction of the arrhythmic burden. Consequently,&#xD;
      restricted salt intake in addition to conventional HF therapy might reduce hospital&#xD;
      admissions for heart failure worsening.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiac Resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRTd) is a valid treatment for&#xD;
      patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricle ejection fraction (HFrEF). Indeed,&#xD;
      CRTd might induce an amelioration in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, with a&#xD;
      improvement of left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), and a reduction of hospital&#xD;
      admissions for failing heart worsening. It is relevant to report that this ameliorative&#xD;
      effect is seen only in a percentage about 70% of CRTd treated patients, that are called CRTd&#xD;
      responders. However, about 30% of patients do not respond to CRTD, and they experience a&#xD;
      worse clinical prognosis with an increasing trend toward heart failure (HF) disease&#xD;
      progression, hospital admissions, and deaths. These patients are defined &quot;CRTd non&#xD;
      responders&quot; . Actually, there is an increasing trend to find the mechanisms causing this&#xD;
      therapeutic failure, such as a growing necessity to find new treatments to ameliorate CRTd&#xD;
      effects, and to improve clinical outcomes in HFrEF patients with CRTd. In this setting,&#xD;
      authors might speculate that salt and liquid retention represent a relevant pathogenic&#xD;
      mechanism to cause worsening of NYHA class, with higher rate of hospital admissions for HF&#xD;
      worsening and worse prognosis. Indeed, numerous studies reported the importance of a&#xD;
      restricted vs. normal dietary salt intake in patients with HF to ameliorate clinical&#xD;
      prognosis. Intriguingly, there are not studies investigating the effects of restricted&#xD;
      dietary salt intake in failing heart patients with CRTd. Secondly, it is not well know how a&#xD;
      restricted vs. normal dietary salt intake can affect clinical prognosis in CRTd patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, the study hypothesis was that, a restricted dietary salt intake in addition to&#xD;
      conventional anti-HF therapy as compared to the normal dietary salt intake in addition to&#xD;
      conventional anti-HF drugs therapy might ameliorate heart function, and clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      a population of HFrEF patients treated by CRT-d. Moreover, in this study authors will&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of restricted vs. normal dietary salt intake in addition to conventional&#xD;
      anti-HF in a population of failing heart patients treated by CRT-d. To date, in this study&#xD;
      patients affected by HFrEF after CRT-d implant will be randomly divided in patients receiving&#xD;
      restricted dietary salt intake plus conventional anti-HF therapy vs. patients under&#xD;
      conventional dietary salt intake plus anti-HF therapy. In these patients authors will&#xD;
      investigate at 12 months follow up all cause of deaths, cardiac deaths, hospitalizations for&#xD;
      HF worsening, CRT-d responders rate, and the arrhythmic burden: atrial fibrillation (AF)&#xD;
      events, ventricular tachycardia (VT) events, ventricular fibrillation (VF) events, internal&#xD;
      cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shocks, and strokes events.&#xD;
