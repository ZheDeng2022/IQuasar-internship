  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study validates Lifelight® First, a software application, in a laboratory setting.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo testing to obtain measurements from one or more of the four vital&#xD;
      signs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of vital signs is an essential part of any clinical assessment and is undertaken&#xD;
      regularly on patients accessing healthcare services. The accuracy of these measurements is of&#xD;
      vital importance as decisions regarding the urgency of medical review and subsequent&#xD;
      management are often influenced by these measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of vital signs as part of normal medical care requires a level of medical /&#xD;
      nursing skill or patient training. Observations can be altered by stress or anxiety making&#xD;
      the results less representative of the patient's clinical state. This is particularly&#xD;
      recognised in the measurement of blood pressure but stress can also alter heart and&#xD;
      respiratory rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular community and/or home monitoring of vital signs is useful in older populations and&#xD;
      those with long-term conditions; standard of care methods can be labour intensive for health&#xD;
      care providers, leading to greater financial burdens for health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifelight® First is software which allows non-invasive, non-contact measurement of these&#xD;
      observations. It can be used on a tablet (e.g. Apple® iPad®) that possesses an integral&#xD;
      camera. The use of computer technology is now commonplace in society so the general public&#xD;
      are likely to be accepting of this as a non-threatening method of measurement, thus reducing&#xD;
      the impact of anxiety on the results. Lifelight® First therefore has potential application&#xD;
      within various areas of the health care system, it could also be useful in settings where&#xD;
      direct access to health care is limited or as a part of a telemedicine service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed to evaluate the safety and performance of Lifelight® First, an&#xD;
      investigational medical device. The data will be used to support the CE marking of the&#xD;
      Lifelight® First device. The study design has been based upon the guidance in ISO standards&#xD;
      and also within published scientific literature. Ultimately the data points to be obtained&#xD;
      and methodology will be required to follow this guidance in order to obtain the CE mark.&#xD;
