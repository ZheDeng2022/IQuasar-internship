    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this single arm phase 2 trial is to assess the response rate&#xD;
      [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] of combined nivolumab and HD IL-2 in&#xD;
      subjects with metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Response will be performed after&#xD;
      each course of nivolumab and IL-2 using RECIST 1.1. Patients will be treated for one course&#xD;
      past best response for a maximum of 3 courses.&#xD;

      PrimaryObjective Determine the overall response rate (complete response and partial response)&#xD;
      for patients receiving anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) and high dose IL-2 (HD IL-2) in subjects with&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma who have previously progressed on anti-PD-1&#xD;
      therapy. Response assessment will be performed using revised RECIST guideline (v 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize safety, tolerability and adverse effects (AE) profile of nivolumab with HD&#xD;
           IL-2 in subjects with metastatic malignant melanoma or renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure Progression-Free Survival (PFS) using RECIST 1.1 after completion of at least&#xD;
           one course of therapy (2 doses of nivolumab, 2 cycles of HD IL-2) for subjects enrolled&#xD;
           in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ExploratoryObjectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in archived diagnostic&#xD;
           tumor tissue with best clinical response for subjects with metastatic melanoma and renal&#xD;
           cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate myeloid-derived suppressor cells and T-cell subsets in peripheral blood during&#xD;
           therapy with best clinical response (RECIST criteria) and treatment outcome in subjects&#xD;
           with metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma. Data will be collected prior to each&#xD;
           treatment and after each course of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Course length will be 35 days. Subjects will receive 480 mg IV of nivolumab on day 1 of the cycle. The patient will be admitted to UCSD Jacobs Medical center for standard HD IL-2 which will be administered every 8 hrs for up to 14 doses days 8-12 per institutional practice. The patient will be readmitted days 22-28 for HD IL-2 every 8 hrs for up to 14 doses. Nivolumab 480 mg IV will be administered day 35. Scans for response will occur 4 weeks after day 35 nivolumab dose and response will be determined by RECIST 1.1 to determine if the patient will receive the next course.</description>
