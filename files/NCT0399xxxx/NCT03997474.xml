      This is a first-in-human, open-label, multi-centre, phase I/IIa study to characterize the&#xD;
      safety and clinical activity autologous clonal neoantigen reactive T cells (cNeT)&#xD;
      administered intravenously in adults with metastatic or recurrent melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will initially enter the study for procurement of tumour materials required to&#xD;
      manufacture ATL001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following manufacture of ATL001, the product will be given back to eligible patients&#xD;
      following lymphodepletion. Patients will be followed up for a period of 24 months post ATL001&#xD;
      infusion in the study. Patients will then be requested to enter a separate long term follow&#xD;
      up protocol for a further 5 years (total 84 months)&#xD;
