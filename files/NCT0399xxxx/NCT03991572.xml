      Study of individualized accurate targeting rTMS intervention on motivational anhedonia of&#xD;
      treatment resistant depression and brain network mechanism&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before treatment, Magnetic resonance images of each participant were acquired from scanner of&#xD;
      the same type (3.0T, Discovery GE750w). As the key role of nucleus accumbens (NACC, -7.5,&#xD;
      5.5, 9) in anhedonia, the accurate target of left dlPFC was defined as the strongest&#xD;
      functional connectivity with NACC. Each treatment session was under neuronavigation with a&#xD;
      Visor neuronavigation system (ANT Neuro, Enschede, Netherlands) for coil positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent a medical evaluation that included physical examination and routine&#xD;
      laboratory studies before and after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)&#xD;
      treatment. Patients were randomly allocated to real group or sham group by coin toss. A&#xD;
      threshold of 3 points on the Hamilton Depression scale has been specified by the National&#xD;
      Institute for Health and Care Excellence to determine a clinically meaningful difference&#xD;
      between active pharmacotherapy and placebo. We plan to enroll minimum total sample size of 29&#xD;
      participants in real and sham group respectively according to the Power and Sample Size&#xD;
      program. The decision to enroll a patient was always made prior to randomization. Patients&#xD;
      were studied using a double-blind design. The participants, clinical raters, and all&#xD;
      personnel responsible for the clinical care of the patient remained masked to the allocated&#xD;
      condition and allocation parameters. Only the rTMS administrators had access to the&#xD;
      randomization list. They had minimal contact with the patients, and no role in assessing&#xD;
      depression. Each patient would be treated for continuous 15 days by rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the rTMS treatment, depression symptom of each participant was assessed by the&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Self-Rating Scale. The anhedonia severity&#xD;
      was evaluated by The Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale, the Self-Report Apathy Evaluation&#xD;
      Scale, Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale, the Motivation and Pleasure Scale. The&#xD;
      neuroimaging data was collected using functional magnetic resonance imaging scan in&#xD;
      multimodalities, resting electroencephalography, and event-related potentials during monetary&#xD;
      incentive delay task, and Iowa-gambling test. The participants had also received a battery&#xD;
      measure of neuropsychological tests (standardized tests to investigate their cognitive&#xD;
      problems). After the last treatment, the same scales and neuroimaging scan were used again to&#xD;
      assess the treatment effect of the rTMS and the underlying brain mechanism. Each participant&#xD;
      was interviewed in detail about the adverse event of the rTMS intervention during the past 15&#xD;
      days. A month after the last treatment, each participant received follow-up visit by&#xD;
      telephone to access the persistent effect of the intervention. Every participant should take&#xD;
      part in the study in voluntary and sign an informed consent form before the study.&#xD;
