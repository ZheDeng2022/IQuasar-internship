  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients seen with Stage 1-2 pelvic organ prolapse (POP) who have failed conservative&#xD;
      treatments will be offered to participate in a sham controlled RCT of outpatient therapy with&#xD;
      the Fotona Smooth Erbium Yag Laser. Patients will be randomised to either outpatient laser&#xD;
      treatments or sham treatments. Patients will be blinded to which arm they have been&#xD;
      randomised. Patients will be asked to complete appropriate relevant symptom and quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaires and prolapse scoring, prior to treatment and at each monthly treatment&#xD;
      and then 6 and 12 months following the final treatment. At 6 months following final&#xD;
      treatment, Sham patients will be un-blinded and offered the laser therapy if they wish.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with symptomatic stage 1-2 POP, who have failed / declined conservative therapy&#xD;
      will be informed about the study and invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility for inclusion into the study has been confirmed and written consent has been&#xD;
      obtained, the patient will be invited for a baseline visit. At this visit the patient will&#xD;
      have their medical history confirmed and have all Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification Score&#xD;
      (PoP-Q) measurements made. They will be given the ICIQ Vaginal Symptom (ICIQ-VS) and Pelvic&#xD;
      Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire (PISQ-12) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised and blinded to their allocated arm: active treatment or sham&#xD;
      treatment (2:1, treatment : Sham).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo 4 outpatient treatment visits. The timing of visits will be from 1&#xD;
      month apart. Before each treatment, they will have their urine tested for infection (dipstick&#xD;
      urinalysis) and a pregnancy test (not required if had hysterectomy / sterilised). If&#xD;
      urinalysis is negative, they will be receive an outpatient ProlapLase treatment which lasts&#xD;
      20 minutes. They will be given a leaflet outlining what to expect and a contact number if&#xD;
      they have any concerns or questions. They will be asked about any deleterious effects since&#xD;
      their last appointment, have a PoPQ score recorded and asked to complete a Patient Global&#xD;
      Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) questionnaire. Patients will routinely receive 4&#xD;
      treatments. Each treatment will be 4 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to attend a follow up visit 6 months after the 4th treatment. They&#xD;
      will be asked if they are happy to continue to participate in the trial and if happy, asked&#xD;
      to complete International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ-VS), Pelvic Organ&#xD;
      Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire (PISQ-12) and Patient Global&#xD;
      Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) symptom questionnaires and undergo a Pelvic Organ Prolapse&#xD;
      Quantification Score (PoP-Q) score. Patients will be asked about any Adverse Event / Serious&#xD;
      Adverse Event since involvement in the study. Patients randomised to the Sham arm will be&#xD;
      un-blinded at 6 months and offered the treatments (x4) if they wish. They will then be&#xD;
      followed up at 6 and 12 months after treatment.&#xD;
