  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) is a rare, lifethreatening, chronic disease of&#xD;
      complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) characterized by acute onset of renal&#xD;
      impairment, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The estimated incidence&#xD;
      of aHUS is approximately 0.5 per million per year. aHUS affects both adults and children, but&#xD;
      is observed primarily in children and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atypical HUS commonly develops due to dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway and&#xD;
      can be sporadic (80%) or familial(20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical course of aHUS is often unpredictable and can be dependent upon the specific&#xD;
      genetic abnormality present within the complement system, if any, and/or triggering events&#xD;
      associated with complement activation or inflammation, including autoimmune disease,&#xD;
      transplant, pregnancy, infection, metabolic conditions, and drug use. In patients with&#xD;
      dysregulated complement activity, such as those with complement mutations commonly observed&#xD;
      in aHUS, the kidney vasculature is often the site of thrombosis stemming from endothelial&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cemdisiran has been designed to reduce the level of C5 mRNA in the liver, thereby reducing&#xD;
      levels of circulating C5 protein, inhibiting terminal complement pathway activity, and&#xD;
      preventing formation and deposition of the MAC (C5-b9) on endothelial cells in the kidney. As&#xD;
      a result, complement-mediated endothelial cell damage in patients with aHUS and subsequent&#xD;
      progression to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) may be reduced.&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Any severe systemic disorder that could interfere with the evaluation of the study&#xD;
             treatment (e.g. hepatic disease) that in the opinion of the Investigator would affect&#xD;
             the outcome of the study or interfere with interpretation of results;&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Failure to satisfy the Investigator of fitness to participate for any other reason or&#xD;
             any condition (e.g. severe depression or psychiatric disorder) that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator, could increase the subject's risk by participating in the study or&#xD;
             confound the outcome of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. If female, the subject is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant&#xD;
             before, during, or within 90 days after last dose; or intending to donate ova during&#xD;
             such time period;&#xD;

         21. The subject has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a history&#xD;
             of alcohol abuse within one year prior to screening. Alcohol abuse is defined as&#xD;
             regular weekly intake of &gt;14 units (unit: 1 glass of wine [125 mL] =1 measure of&#xD;
             spirits=1/2 pint [0.25 mL] of beer). Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per&#xD;
             day for the duration of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Patients with a poor prognosis that is expected to limit their life expectancy to less&#xD;

&#xD;
         24. History of intolerance to subcutaneous (SC) injection(s) or significant abdominal&#xD;
             scarring that could potentially hinder cemdisiran administration or evaluation of&#xD;
