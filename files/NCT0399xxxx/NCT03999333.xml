  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pain management for type-3 Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction remains a significant clinical&#xD;
      challenge and the current therapeutic outcome is often frustrating and may lead to addiction&#xD;
      of opioid pain medication. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a viable option for pain&#xD;
      management, but its usage has been limited to short-term inpatient clinical trials or&#xD;
      experimental settings. In the proposed study, we will determine the long-term efficacy of VR&#xD;
      intervention on pain management in patients with SOD type 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves an initial screening visit and one follow-up visit at the end of the&#xD;
      6-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will receive self administered VR intervention, in additional to&#xD;
      standard-of-care treatment for pain. The study also includes 6 weeks of monitoring period (2&#xD;
      weeks before, 4 weeks during, and 2 weeks after the VR intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the aims of the research are achieved, the study will demonstrate that virtual reality&#xD;
      intervention may be used as a new method for pain management. This may lead to reduction in&#xD;
      usage of opioid pain medication.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of chronic biliary type abdominal pain (RUQ pain, pain radiates to the right&#xD;
             flank, scapula, or shoulder, or pain that stimulates gallbladder symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pancreatic pain (epigastric or left upper quadrant pain, pain that is exacerbated by&#xD;
             some food, or pain that radiates to the back) for at least 3 months prior to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  absence of abnormal liver and pancreas chemistry or abnormal abdominal imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  average pain score of greater than or equal to 3 out of 10 on the numeric rating scale&#xD;
             (NRS) for at least the average of 3 episodes each week&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects on antidepressants for pain control should take the medication for a minimum&#xD;
             of one month prior to the baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with SOD with depressive and/or anxiety disorders who receive&#xD;
             psychopharmacologic treatment must be on stable medication dose for at least 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with access to a cell phone, able to speak, read, and write English will be&#xD;
             enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence for acute or chronic pancreatitis, biliary stones, or bile duct&#xD;
             strictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior sphincterotomy must have had the procedure at 3 months&#xD;
             prior to the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of motion sickness and vertigo and anyone experiencing active&#xD;
             nausea or vomiting (including pregnant women) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of seizures or epilepsy will also be excluded to limit the&#xD;
             theoretical risk of inducing seizures with VR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of significant psychiatric disorders or any conditions that, in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion make the subject unsuitable for study participation will be&#xD;
             reason for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-English speaking subjects or subjects unable to consent to study due to cognitive&#xD;
             difficulty will not be included in the study.&#xD;
