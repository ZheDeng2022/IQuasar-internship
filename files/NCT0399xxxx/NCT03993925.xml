    <textblock>
      In the current era of highly effective direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, the remaining&#xD;
      obstacles to elimination of chronic HCV infection are identification of the high-risk groups,&#xD;
      linkage to continued care and prevention of re-infection. It is estimated that 70-80% of&#xD;
      patients with chronic HCV are unaware of their infection. Besides, public health education is&#xD;
      limited and most patients are not aware that the current standard-of-care is highly&#xD;
      effective, well tolerated and no longer require weekly subcutaneous injections. From a survey&#xD;
      in Hong Kong in 2014, among 234 newly diagnosed HCV patients, only 20% agreed to undergo&#xD;
      treatment. There is no universal screening programme for chronic hepatitis C infection in&#xD;
      Hong Kong. and known high-risk patients include people who inject drugs (PWID), persons with&#xD;
      certain medical conditions including those on hemodialysis, HIV infected, those with prior&#xD;
      transfusion or organ transplantation. In this study, the investigators plan to reach out to&#xD;
      PWIDs in rehabilitation programs to provide rapid point-of-care screening for chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C infection, and to provide linkage to care for those diagnosed with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C.&#xD;

      Existing data on HCV sero-prevalence in these patients in Hong Kong is however fragmented&#xD;
      especially in non-hospitalized persons. From the year 2014 surveillance report prepared by&#xD;
      Department of Health (DH), anti-HCV prevalence rate among PWID under DH's methadone clinics&#xD;
      was 46.2%. Two major issues remain in view of the high seroprevalence rate in this subgroup.&#xD;
      Firstly, HCV RNA positivity was not reported and it is unknown whether these patients are&#xD;
      still chronically infected. Many of patients are not directed to subsequent confirmatory&#xD;
      tests and if they are chronically infected, they need to be linked to care. Secondly, data&#xD;
      does not exist for PWID who are receiving substance abuse counselling or rehabilitation&#xD;
      treatment programs under agencies which are not run by DH or the Hong Kong Hospital&#xD;
      Authority. These are run by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as Barnabas&#xD;
      Charitable Service Association providing training centre and half-way house for residence,&#xD;
      and religious organizations providing rehabilitation centres. These subjects belong to&#xD;
      high-risk group of harbouring undiagnosed chronic HCV and thus should be tested and linked to&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, the first step in screening for HCV utilizes enzyme immunoassay for the&#xD;
      antibody against HCV. Fortunately, newer rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) can be used as a tool&#xD;
      to screen subjects by providing point-of-care diagnosis on site. For instance, the OraQuick®&#xD;
      HCV test (OraSure Technologies, Inc) is FDA-approved and CLIA-waived, with more than 98%&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity for qualitative detection of anti-HCV antibody in finger stick or&#xD;
      venepuncture whole blood. As the volume of blood required is much smaller, subjects only need&#xD;
      a finger stick for testing and results will be available within 20-40min. Subjects having&#xD;
      positive results from RDT will proceed with venepuncture for collection of whole blood which&#xD;
      will be sent back to our laboratory for confirmatory testing of anti-HCV antibody and HCV&#xD;
      RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon confirmation of diagnosis, subjects should be linked to care for further management.&#xD;
      Ideally, all patients with chronic HCV should be treated regardless of severity of liver&#xD;
      disease unless liver decompensation has developed necessitating liver transplantation before&#xD;
      treatment or limited lifespan is expected even with DAA treatment. In Hong Kong, due to&#xD;
      limited health care resources and lack of comprehensive insurance coverage schemes, DAA&#xD;
      cannot be universally prescribed to every patient. Risk stratification is the strategy&#xD;
      adopted by the Hospital Authority to prioritize those patients with more advanced liver&#xD;
      disease, as defined by advanced liver fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis (F4), to receive subsidized&#xD;
      DAA treatment. If all patients with different risk profiles are linked to care in the same&#xD;
      manner, those with more advanced disease will suffer from delayed assessment and subsequent&#xD;
      treatment due to the long waiting time (in terms of 1-2 years) to be seen by specialist. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to set up an integrated linkage-to-care clinic for all patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed chronic HCV. Patients will be assessed in a timely manner. A dedicated&#xD;
      research nurse will provide counselling and education to the patients. The nurse will then&#xD;
      arrange on-site liver stiffness measurement with Fibroscan®, as well as phlebotomy for liver&#xD;
      function test assessment. Patients with F3/F4 or significantly impaired liver function shall&#xD;
      be directed to specialist via a fast track protocol to facilitate timely treatment, instead&#xD;
      of the routine clinic appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mission of our department is to promote health in the field of Hepatology. The&#xD;
      investigators have a team of dedicated professionals to provide high-quality services to&#xD;
      patients in our community. Besides, our team actively participates in various kinds of&#xD;
      liver-related basic science and clinical studies with numerous scientific contributions, and&#xD;
      therefore is very experienced and well equipped with laboratory back up for liver-related&#xD;
      research. The investigators have previously conducted a large-scale population-based study in&#xD;
      10,256 Hong Kong subjects for detection of seroprevalence rates of viral hepatitis, which&#xD;
      showed that sero-prevalence rate of HCV to be 0.5% in the general community. The&#xD;
      investigators are determined to fill the knowledge gap of the rate of chronic HCV infection&#xD;
      in high-risk groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cohort study. The investigators will form an outreach team and conduct&#xD;
      visits to the halfway house and rehabilitation centres run by non-governmental organisations&#xD;
      (NGOs). The investigators will perform rapid diagnostic test (RDT) in these people who&#xD;
      injected drugs (PWIDs) who have already started rehabilitation in these institutions. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to conduct site visits every 4 - 8 weeks. The consent and potential impact&#xD;
      of this study will be explained to subjects, followed by obtaining consent and blood taking.&#xD;
      Subjects will also be asked to fill in a questionnaire, including information on age, gender,&#xD;
      place of birth, ethnic origin, chronic medical illness, prior viral hepatitis infection,&#xD;
      history of receiving HCV treatment and risk factors for contracting HCV (e.g. prior&#xD;
      transfusion, intravenous drug use, tooth extraction or gum surgery, skin tattooing). Subjects&#xD;
      will then have finger stick, which will be used for RDT as a point-of-care HCV screening&#xD;
      test. If the RDT result is positive, the subject will then proceed with formal venepuncture&#xD;
      for whole blood, which will be tested for confirmatory anti-HCV and HCV RNA (HCV genotype&#xD;
      will also be determined for HCV RNA positive samples) in our own laboratory. The&#xD;
      investigators will actively contact subjects confirmed with the diagnosis of chronic HCV. The&#xD;
      research nurse will contact them to attend the integrated linkage-to-care clinic for&#xD;
      counselling, education and risk stratification. During the clinic visits, risk stratification&#xD;
      according to the liver status will be done by 1) physical examinations to document the&#xD;
      clinical liver status, 2) comprehensive blood investigations including liver function tests,&#xD;
      platelet counts and clotting profiles and 3) Fibroscan® to assess the fibrosis status.&#xD;
