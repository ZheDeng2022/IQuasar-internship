      Study drug and dosage form : Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HB-MSC1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose and route of administration : 60 × 106 cells or 120 x 106 cells to be injected as 30&#xD;
      individual intramuscular injections, once at V0 within 48 hours to 2 weeks maximum after the&#xD;
      revascularization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator, dose and route of administration : Placebo, injected as 30 individual&#xD;
      intramuscular injections, once at V2 within 48 hours to 2 weeks maximum after the&#xD;
      revascularization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study centers : 3 centers in France&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Evaluation of the feasibility and systemic and local tolerance of an implantation,&#xD;
      via intramuscular route, of allogenic HB-MSC1, associated with a revascularization procedure,&#xD;
      in patients suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Preliminary evaluation of efficacy and dose effect relationship of the MSC&#xD;
      implantation in hemodynamic, anatomical and functional terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory: Constitution of a serum bank of the patients included in the study for&#xD;
      inflammation and auto immunity biomarkers analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design : This will be a multicenter Phase IIa study, consisting in a first, open-label,&#xD;
      ascending dose feasibility and safety stage followed by a randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy stage.&#xD;

      Demographics, baseline and follow-up characteristics: descriptive statistics. Primary&#xD;
      analysis: Descriptive statistics for the rate of patients with high grade AEs (grade 2 and&#xD;
      more), related to the cell implantation will be computed in each arm, with its two-sided 95%&#xD;
      CIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dose arm will be compared to the control arm by computing the absolute difference and&#xD;
      the relative risk between the active dose arm and the control arm, together with their 95%&#xD;
      two-sided CIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The p-values for the comparisons of the difference between the observed absolute rate to 0&#xD;
      and of the relative risk to 1 will be computed, but it is not expected that the study will&#xD;
      have sufficient power to detect a significant difference on either of the two statistics&#xD;
      (absolute difference or relative risk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy analysis: The primary efficacy criterion (TcPO2) will be compared between&#xD;
      each dose group versus the control group to test for a superiority of MSC over control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tested hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Null hypothesis: mean (MSC dose i) ≤ mean (Control)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alternative hypothesis: mean (MSC dose i) &gt; mean (Control) A mixed - model for repeated&#xD;
           measures will be used to model the evolution of TcPO2 over time. The significance of the&#xD;
           time by treatment interaction will be used to test the two hypotheses. Model adjusted&#xD;
           means (LS means) and their differences between treatment arms will be computed at each&#xD;
           timepoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LS-Means for change from baseline to 180 days will be used as the primary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other efficacy analyses: the same analysis model (mixed - model for repeated measures) will&#xD;
      be used for all the other continuous efficacy endpoints.&#xD;
