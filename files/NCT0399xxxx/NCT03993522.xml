  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A coronary chronic total occlusion refers to the long term complete blockage of a blood&#xD;
      vessel supplying the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise is beneficial for patients with heart problems, including people with narrowed blood&#xD;
      vessels. However, exercise has not previously been tested in patients with a completely&#xD;
      blocked blood vessel. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate exercise testing in&#xD;
      participants with a coronary chronic total occlusion, and to see if the physiological changes&#xD;
      that occur are reproducible when participants are re-tested. Secondly, the study will see if&#xD;
      sustained exercise is safe in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will make 3 visits to our Laboratory. During the first two visits participants&#xD;
      will complete symptom limited exercise tests using a stationary bike for approximately 8-12&#xD;
      minutes. The bikes' resistance will gradually increase until participants choose to stop or&#xD;
      the researcher ends the test. Participants will wear a mask that collects exhaled breath for&#xD;
      testing, and will be connected to an electrocardiogram (heart trace monitor), and blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff for monitoring throughout the test. During visits one and three patients will&#xD;
      also have blood taken pre and post exercise. Researchers will analyse how the amount of&#xD;
      oxygen consumed with increasing exercise relates to the participants' heart rate. A plateau&#xD;
      in these measures would indicate a change in the heart's blood supply resulting in reduced&#xD;
      function. The participants' third visit will involve cycling under the same conditions as&#xD;
      previous visits. However, during this test participants will be asked to cycle continuously&#xD;
      for 20 minutes at a resistance set by the researchers. This level of resistance is determined&#xD;
      from the results of the first test, as the point at which changes in blood flow and heart&#xD;
      function occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last five minutes of the test patients will have an echocardiogram (heart scan), to&#xD;
      look at the heart function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research will be to investigate whether or not changes in the&#xD;
      heart's blood supply and function can be seen in coronary chronic total occlusion patients,&#xD;
      by investigating information collected during a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Secondly, can&#xD;
      these patients exercise safely at this level for an extended period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiology department at Castle Hill Hospital treats approximately 40 patients each year&#xD;
      who have a single chronic total coronary occlusion. Researchers will recruit 12 consecutive&#xD;
      patients who have a complete blockage of one of the major blood vessels to the heart. These&#xD;
      recruits will be found either when the diagnosis is made (during a coronary angiogram when&#xD;
      dye is injected into the heart blood vessels), or from the dedicated departmental database at&#xD;
      Castle Hill Hospital. Patients will be identified by a member of their usual clinical team.&#xD;
      Potential participants will be given a patient information leaflet, explaining the aims of&#xD;
      the research and what the study involves. A minimum of 48 hours later, patients will be given&#xD;
      a follow up call by a member of their usual clinical care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this call if patients are interested in participating they will be asked for their&#xD;
      verbal consent to be contacted by the research team, and given the opportunity to ask&#xD;
      questions about the study. Patients will then be invited to attend Castle Hill Hospital to&#xD;
      discuss the trial in more detail. Patients will be given the chance to ask questions and&#xD;
      explain any concerns they have about the research. They will also be reminded that inclusion&#xD;
      in the research is voluntary, and that they can choose to leave the study at any time. Once&#xD;
      informed consent has been obtained by a member of the research team, participants will&#xD;
      proceed with the baseline assessment (Visit 1). Questions will then be asked about their&#xD;
      previous medical history, current condition, and medications they are taking. Basic&#xD;
      information will also be collected from the participants; such as height, weight, resting&#xD;
      heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, (to measure the electrical activity of the heart),&#xD;
      echocardiogram (ultrasound imaging of the hearts function, involving gel being placed on the&#xD;
      chest and a hand-held device pressed to the area), and a pre-test blood sample. Following&#xD;
      these measures, the participant will be asked to ride a stationary bike against increasing&#xD;
      resistance until they can no longer continue (approx. 8-12 minutes). During this exercise&#xD;
      they will have their exhaled air (collected via mask), heart rate, blood pressure, and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram measured throughout. After completing the test a final blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a minimum of 72 hours and a maximum of 2 weeks, participants will be invited back for&#xD;
      visit 2. This visit will include a brief health assessment and will otherwise follow the same&#xD;
      structure as the previous visit, minus the blood samples pre and post exercise, and resting&#xD;
      echocardiogram (heart scan). The purpose of the second visit is to see if the results of the&#xD;
      test are reproducible. The main aim of the test is to see if there is a point that can be&#xD;
      identified when the heart is no longer able to work any harder. In healthy individuals, as&#xD;
      they cycle harder, the oxygen taken from the lungs with each heartbeat would gradually&#xD;
      increase. This would be visible to the researchers in the results of the test. When the body&#xD;
      is working hard the heart is forced to work hard too. It does this by increasing its stroke&#xD;
      volume, which is the amount of blood it squeezes out to the body with each beat. If the&#xD;
      stroke volume increases then the amount of oxygen taken each heart beat will increase. If the&#xD;
      participant in the test is a patient with a coronary chronic total occlusion then the&#xD;
      research team expect that this will not follow the same path. Under normal conditions like&#xD;
      sitting, standing, walking and perhaps light cycling it is possible for this patient's heart&#xD;
      to supply enough blood to the muscles. However, because the heart itself is a muscle it too&#xD;
      needs more oxygen and therefore more blood if it is going to work harder. As the participant&#xD;
      exercises, the heart will try to increase it's stroke volume to supply more oxygen.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, because the heart has a blocked vessel it will not receive enough blood to be&#xD;
      able to increase its stroke volume. Therefore, the amount of oxygen taken each beat will not&#xD;
      increase beyond a certain point, and the researchers should see this as a flattening in the&#xD;
      results of the test. The research team will use the data collected from the first and second&#xD;
      visit to see if this flattening point exists for each participant. If this point is seen in&#xD;
      both tests the researcher will prescribe exercise at this level for the third visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 72 hours and a maximum of 2 weeks after visit 2, patients will be invited back&#xD;
      for their third and final visit. This visit will again begin with a brief health assessment&#xD;
      before measures of resting heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and a blood sample&#xD;
      are collected. Participants will then be asked to pedal a stationary bike this time at a&#xD;
      personalised resistance for 20 minutes, whilst exhaled gas, heart rate, blood pressure and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram are monitored. During the final 5 minutes of exercise the participant will&#xD;
      be given a stress echocardiogram (ultrasound scan of the heart). As in visit 1 a blood sample&#xD;
      will be taken from the participant after exercise has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All visits will occur within the department of Cardiology at Castle Hill Hospital. This is a&#xD;
      pilot study and therefore, the number of participants has been determined based on previous&#xD;
      experience of performing these tests on patients with non-occlusive coronary disease.&#xD;
