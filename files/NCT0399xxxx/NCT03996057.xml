  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infection and are especially&#xD;
      common in postmenopausal women, who often experience recurrent UTIs. Women with recurrent&#xD;
      UTIs are commonly treated with antibiotics, but side effects, collateral damage to commensal&#xD;
      bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance result from frequent antibiotic use. It is paramount&#xD;
      that researchers develop non-antibiotic treatment strategies for UTIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several non-antibiotic strategies may be successful in preventing recurrent UTIs in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women, including low-dose vaginal estrogen, d-mannose, and methenamine&#xD;
      hippurate. Methenamine hippurate (MH) is interesting as it causes few side effects, kills&#xD;
      bacteria by denaturing bacterial proteins, RNA, and DNA, and does not develop resistance.&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of daily methenamine on the incidence of UTI.&#xD;
      However, women often require multiple therapies in order to prevent recurrence. There are&#xD;
      currently few guidelines to help clinicians identify optimal treatment regimens for&#xD;
      non-antibiotic prevention of UTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility of developing a sequential,&#xD;
      multiple assignment, randomization trial (SMART); and examine the treatment effect of MH in&#xD;
      combination with vaginal estrogen (VET) and D-mannose on prevention of UTI. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to examine the efficacy of the addition of MH to low dose VET and d-mannose in the UTI&#xD;
      prevention through randomization to MH + VET + D-mannose vs continuing VET + D-mannose alone.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients who have symptomatic, culture-proven&#xD;
      UTI during a 3 month treatment period. The investigators hypothesize that women on low dose&#xD;
      VET, d-mannose, and MH will be less likely to have recurrent UTI than those with VET and&#xD;
      d-mannose alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses a pragmatic, longitudinal approach that mimics patients' clinical experiences&#xD;
      and physicians' decision points during management of UTI prophylaxis. Through this&#xD;
      randomized, controlled pilot study, this proposal would allow the investigators to examine&#xD;
      the feasibility of conducting a larger-scale, adaptive study trial, and estimate the&#xD;
      treatment effect of a non-antibiotic regimen augmented with MH in women who continue to&#xD;
      develop recurrence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infection and are especially&#xD;
      common in postmenopausal women, who often experience recurrent UTIs. Women with recurrent&#xD;
      UTIs are commonly treated with antibiotics, but side effects, collateral damage to commensal&#xD;
      bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance result from frequent antibiotic use. The Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention estimate that drug resistance contributes to 23,000 deaths,&#xD;
      2,049,442 illnesses, and $20 billion dollars in excess direct healthcare costs in the United&#xD;
      States annually. Thus, it is paramount that researchers develop non-antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      strategies for UTIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several non-antibiotic strategies may be successful in preventing recurrent UTIs in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women. One is low-dose vaginal estrogen, which may decrease the rate of&#xD;
      recurrent UTIs by decreasing inflammation, promoting bladder repair, and promoting retention&#xD;
      of lactobacilli. Another is d-mannose, a natural sugar that may decrease bacterial adherence&#xD;
      to the urothelium. Methenamine hippurate has regained interest recently. First, it causes few&#xD;
      side effects. Second, it functions by producing formaldehyde in the urine, which kills&#xD;
      bacteria by denaturing bacterial proteins, RNA, and DNA. Thus far, no methenamine-resistant&#xD;
      bacteria have been reported to develop in vivo. Lastly, several studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that 2 grams daily of methenamine reduces the incidence of UTI and is likely comparable to&#xD;
      the antibiotic nitrofurantoin for UTI prophylaxis. However, in the investigators' clinical&#xD;
      experience, women often require multiple therapies in order to prevent recurrence. There are&#xD;
      currently few guidelines to help clinicians identify optimal treatment regimens for&#xD;
      prevention of UTI. The clinical challenge is to optimize individual treatment regimens by&#xD;
      maximizing efficacy and minimizing the number of medications, cost, side effects, and&#xD;
      nonadherence for each individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to 1) examine the feasibility of developing a sequential,&#xD;
      multiple assignment, randomization trial (SMART) and 2) examine the treatment effect of&#xD;
      methenamine hippurate in combination with vaginal estrogen and D-mannose on prevention of&#xD;
      UTI. This adaptive study design allows the investigators to examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      non-antibiotic prophylaxis and initiation of subsequent preventative therapies based on&#xD;
      individual responses. It is a pragmatic, longitudinal approach that mimics patients' clinical&#xD;
      experiences and physicians' decision points during management of UTI prophylaxis. Given the&#xD;
      efficacy and relative safety of methenamine hippurate, the investigators are particularly&#xD;
      interested in its efficacy among those who have had suboptimal response to vaginal estrogen&#xD;
      and D-mannose. The timing of this study is ideal, as the investigators are also currently&#xD;
      conducting a trial of vaginal estrogen plus D-mannose in postmenopausal women. Through this&#xD;
      randomized, controlled pilot study, this proposal would allow the investigators to examine&#xD;
      the feasibility of conducting a larger-scale, adaptive study trial on the use of methenamine&#xD;
      hippurate in combination with vaginal estrogen plus D-mannose, and estimate the treatment&#xD;
      effect of a non-antibiotic regimen augmented with methenamine hippurate in women who continue&#xD;
      to develop recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a planned extension of a previously proposed clinical trial on d-mannose and&#xD;
      vaginal estrogen (IRB#:201711120); however, any postmenopausal women with a history of&#xD;
      recurrent UTI, who then develop UTI while on a combined prophylaxis regimen of d-mannose and&#xD;
      vaginal estrogen will be eligible for the randomized controlled trial on methenamine&#xD;
      augmentation. The investigators plan to examine the efficacy of the addition of methenamine&#xD;
      hippurate to low dose vaginal estrogen and d-mannose in the UTI prevention through&#xD;
      randomization to methenamine + vaginal estrogen + D-mannose vs continuing vaginal estrogen +&#xD;
      D-mannose alone. Patients will be randomized to either the addition of methenamine hippurate&#xD;
      or continuing with vaginal estrogen + D-mannose alone. The primary outcome will be the&#xD;
      proportion of patients who have symptomatic, culture-proven UTI during a 3 month treatment&#xD;
      period. The investigators hypothesize that women on low dose vaginal estrogen, d-mannose, and&#xD;
      methenamine hippurate will be less likely to have recurrent UTI than those with low dose&#xD;
      vaginal estrogen and d-mannose alone. As part of the study, baseline information and vaginal,&#xD;
      urine, and fecal samples may be taken. Additionally, as part of examining feasibility of a&#xD;
      larger study, recruitment, retention, refusal, non-compliance, and adherence rates will be&#xD;
      collected. Patients who decline or drop out of the study will be contacted to answer&#xD;
      questions on reasons for refusal or withdrawal. Subjects who undergo randomization will&#xD;
      either add methenamine to their ongoing vaginal estrogen + D-mannose, or continue on vaginal&#xD;
      estrogen + D-mannose alone. They will receive weekly calls or text reminders to record study&#xD;
      diaries and to take their medications. Patients will follow up at the end of 3 months, at&#xD;
      their usual follow up appointment, for routine examination, questionnaires, and urine and&#xD;
      possible vaginal and fecal samples. Follow up may be extended up to 1 month prior or 6 months&#xD;
      afterward their baseline visit (2-6 months after the baseline visit) for those who do not&#xD;
      make their 3 months appointment. The investigators also plan to describe the uropathogen&#xD;
      profile and antibiotic resistance of UTIs that occur during prophylaxis with vaginal estrogen&#xD;
      + d-mannose, with or without methenamine hippurate. Lastly, the investigators hope to examine&#xD;
      the impact of a non-antibiotic prophylaxis regimen that includes methenamine hippurate on the&#xD;
      bladder microenvironment as well as the urinary, vaginal, and intestinal microbiomes.&#xD;
