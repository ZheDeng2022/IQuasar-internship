    <textblock>
      The Purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that administration of an S-nitrosylating&#xD;
      (SNO) agent can improve tissue oxygenation during transfusion of packed red blood cells&#xD;
      (RBCs).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transfusion is the most common therapeutic intervention employed to maintain and/or improve&#xD;
      tissue and end-organ oxygen delivery. Despite the conceptual simplicity of this treatment&#xD;
      recent studies indicate that RBC infusion often produces little clinical benefit and may&#xD;
      actually harm the recipient by exacerbating rather than correcting anemia-induced tissue&#xD;
      hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main driver/regulator of tissue oxygenation is blood flow not blood oxygen content. In&#xD;
      turn flow into the microvasculature is controlled by small molecules called S-nitrosothiols&#xD;
      (SNOs), the most important of which is S-nitrosylated hemoglobin (SNO-Hb).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators determined that storage of human blood leads to rapid losses in SNO-Hb that&#xD;
      are precisely paralleled by losses in the ability of stored RBCs to dilate blood vessels and&#xD;
      thereby deliver oxygen. The investigators have now recently completed an autologous human&#xD;
      blood transfusion that confirms the pre-clinical findings in that administration of 1 unit of&#xD;
      packed RBCs to young healthy subjects did not improve tissue oxygenation and reduced&#xD;
      circulating SNO-Hb levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This novel mechanism for the loss of physiological activity in banked blood and, more&#xD;
      importantly, a putative intervention for its correction, raise the possibility that&#xD;
      restoration of NO bioactivity could correct the deficit in oxygen delivery. As such, The&#xD;
      Investigators plan to repeat our transfusion study with the addition of administering an&#xD;
      S-nitrosylating agent during RBC infusion.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open-label phase I trial. Healthy young adult volunteers that would considered eligible by American Red Cross standards to donate blood will be screened by qualified practitioners for eligibility to participate in the above mentioned study. We anticipate an accrual number of 20, with subjects randomized to receive their blood (n=15) or saline (n=5) while breathing an SNO agent.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Oxygenation Defined as change in arterial blood oxygenation</measure>
    <time_frame>pre infusion and post infusion (every 3 to 6 hours, for 24 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>tested by arterial blood oxygen content difference - arterial blood gas (ABG)&#xD;
An ABG is a blood test that measures the acidity, or potential of hydrogen (pH), and the levels of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from an artery. The test is used to check the function of the patient's lungs and how well they are able to move oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.&#xD;
The aforementioned five components all have different normal values and represent different aspects of the blood gas. According to the National Institute of Health, typical normal values are:&#xD;
pH: 7.35-7.45 Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2): 75 to 100 mmHg Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2): 35-45 mmHg Bicarbonate (HCO3): 22-26 milliequivalent/Liter (mEqL) Oxygen saturation (O2 Sat): 94-100%</description>

    <description>tested by venous blood oxygen content difference - venous blood gas (VBG).&#xD;
An ABG is a blood test that measures the acidity, or pH, and the levels of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from an a vein. The test is used to check the function of the patient's lungs and how well they are able to move oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.&#xD;
