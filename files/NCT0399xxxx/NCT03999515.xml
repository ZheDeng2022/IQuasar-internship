  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well erdafitinib in combination with abiraterone acetate or&#xD;
      enzalutamide works in treating patients with double negative prostate cancer. Erdafitinib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Testosterone can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Abiraterone acetate lowers the&#xD;
      amount of testosterone made by the body. This may help stop the growth of tumor cells that&#xD;
      need testosterone to grow. Enzalutamide blocks the use of testosterone by the tumor cells.&#xD;
      Giving erdafitinib with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer compared to abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide alone.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally (PO) once daily (QD) or enzalutamide PO&#xD;
      QD on days 1-21. Patients also receive erdafitinib PO QD on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21&#xD;
      days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

             be in the best interest of the subject (e.g., compromise the well-being) or that could&#xD;
