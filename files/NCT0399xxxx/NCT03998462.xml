  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy of Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR),to improve HRQoL,&#xD;
      cognition, and mood, as well as to determine the longevity of the treatment response in&#xD;
      individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;

      Eligible study participants will be randomly assigned to one of two interventions: 1)&#xD;
      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction for Parkinson's disease; MBSR-PD or 2) Creative Education&#xD;
      Care (CEC). Study visits may be held remotely, via online video format (Webex). Interventions&#xD;
      are held within a group format consisting of approximately 6-10 individuals with PD. Groups&#xD;
      will meet once per week for over a 9-week period. All participants will be administered a&#xD;
      battery of neuropsychological tests to measure HRQoL, cognition (e.g., executive function,&#xD;
      attention, memory), and mood (i.e., anxiety, depression, and apathy), as well as motor&#xD;
      symptoms, disease severity, and mindfulness engagement/practice. Tests will be administered&#xD;
      at baseline, 9 weeks (post-treatment), and 6- and 12-months (follow-up assessments) by an&#xD;
      examiner blinded to group assignment.&#xD;
