  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, topical antihistamines and corticosteroids are mainly used for itching relief.&#xD;
      However, the over the counter antihistamines are not effective on all itch conditions.&#xD;
      Acetaminophen is a popular and widely used OTC drug for pain relief. Although its mode of&#xD;
      action is still unknown, recent studies have shown that acetaminophen indirectly activates&#xD;
      cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Recent studies have shown that topical cannabinoid agonists are&#xD;
      effective for itch relief, the efficacy of topical acetaminophen will be tested for&#xD;
      non-histaminergic itch relief.&#xD;

      This will be a single-blinded, vehicle-controlled randomized study in healthy controls to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of the topical gel formulation with three differing concentrations of&#xD;
      acetaminophen (APAP) for itch relief. To detect medium effects of the treatments with a given&#xD;
      Î± of 0.5 and an error probability of 0.05, with a power of 0.95, the number of participants&#xD;
      needed is 36 (10 within post hoc pairwise comparisons).&#xD;
