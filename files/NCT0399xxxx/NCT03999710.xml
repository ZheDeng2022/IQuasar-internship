    <description>All participants have locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer, Stage II-III. Treatment will consist of durvalumab administered concurrently with thoracic radiation consisting of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. Patients will be monitored weekly during on-treatment visits. Durvalumab will then be continued up to 1 year as maintenance or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Optional Research MRIs (Does not apply to the Alliance Sites. Research MRIs will only be done at MSKCC)</description>
