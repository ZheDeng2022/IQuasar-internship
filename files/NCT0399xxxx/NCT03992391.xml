    <textblock>
      This is a three phase study to develop and implement an adolescent suicide prevention program&#xD;
      in a community mental health setting. In Phase 1, needs assessments using qualitative&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted at in a community mental health clinic with suicidal teens and&#xD;
      their parents, and with community experts including therapy staff who serve patients at a&#xD;
      community mental health clinic. In Phase 2, the investigators will develop a new treatment&#xD;
      manual that is guided by information obtained in the previously completed needs assessment.&#xD;
      The investigators will pilot the program with one group of adolescents (N=10), and make&#xD;
      iterative revisions based on feedback. Training sessions will be implemented. In Phase 3, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct an open trial of a group for 40 adolescents at the community&#xD;
      mental health clinic to assess feasibility of recruitment, implementation, satisfaction, and&#xD;
      outcome. Program outcomes will be utilization, patient and family satisfaction ratings, and&#xD;
      improvement in depression and suicide risk measures at discharge from the program and at one&#xD;
      month and six months follow-up. In addition, rate of suicidal events (suicide attempt,&#xD;
      hospitalization) at one month and six months post-discharge will be compared to historical&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;

      In Phase 1, the investigators will develop interviews and data collection guides. The&#xD;
      investigators will interview 10 current patients and parents at a community mental health&#xD;
      clinic (for a total of 20 individuals). The investigators will elicit respondent perspectives&#xD;
      relating to: (a) utilization of care (b) treatment targets (c); parent/family participation&#xD;
      and (d) session format. Also, as part of Phase 1, the investigators will conduct interviews&#xD;
      with the 8 treatment providers at a community mental health clinic. In addition to exploring&#xD;
      the content of treatment modules of the intensive outpatient program (IOP) program, the&#xD;
      investigators will share responses from patients and parents, and will solicit provider&#xD;
      feedback regarding those responses. Building on patient-reported needs, the investigators&#xD;
      will solicit provider expectations, requisite elements and other concerns regarding&#xD;
      implementation of an intensive treatment program in community mental health clinic settings.&#xD;
      Coders will independently read the transcripts and code for common elements. Developing a&#xD;
      codebook to document procedures, the investigators will compare and contrast codes and&#xD;
      respective quotations across respondents. Coding discrepancies will be discussed and&#xD;
      conflicts between raters resolved using a third investigator. The investigators will present&#xD;
      the preliminary manual content to clinician respondents to explore feasibility of the&#xD;
      proposed intervention. Data will be coded and analyzed using standard qualitative approaches&#xD;
      and will guide the manual development and intervention components to be used in Phases 2 and&#xD;
      3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, the investigators will incorporate responses into a draft of treatment manual,&#xD;
      and train a group of community mental health clinic staff to deliver treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators will test this adapted manual with an open trial to test feasibility and&#xD;
      piloting of the intervention and outcome measures. Patients and parents will complete the&#xD;
      Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Adolescents (QIDS-A). Client Satisfaction&#xD;
      Questionnaire (CSQ) will be obtained at discharge. Participants will complete the&#xD;
      Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ), Concise Health Risk Tracking (CHRT) , and the&#xD;
      Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale (ACSS) at both intake and discharge, Clinicians will&#xD;
      complete the Clinician Checklist and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at&#xD;
      baseline and discharge. The investigators will conduct exit interviews completed with both&#xD;
      the parent and patient, to assess the acceptability of treatment. The investigators will&#xD;
      obtain feedback about perceived effectiveness of the treatment, the appropriateness of&#xD;
      treatment targets, identification of other targets or approaches that would have been more&#xD;
      helpful, and barriers to participation. The investigators will obtain similar feedback from&#xD;
      the treating clinicians. Based on patient, family, and clinician feedback, a satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire (patient and parent), and outcome data from the open trial, the manual,&#xD;
      treatment program structure can be modified in Phase 3 to improve feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability. The investigators will collect follow-up information at 1 month and 6 months&#xD;
      following the patient's final session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 3, participants will be 40 adolescents who present to the community mental health&#xD;
      clinic with a recent suicide attempt or significant suicidal ideation with a plan or intent.&#xD;
      Participants must be English-speaking, although parents must be able to speak Spanish.&#xD;
      Participants can have unipolar or bipolar disorder, conduct or oppositional disorder, eating&#xD;
      disorder, or alcohol or substance use or abuse, all of which are common comorbidities in the&#xD;
      suicidal adolescent sample. Excluded are those with current psychosis, mania, alcohol or&#xD;
      substance dependence, autism spectrum disorders, &lt;80% of ideal body weight, or low&#xD;
      intelligence quotient (IQ) based on clinical judgement (if concerns about intellectual&#xD;
      capabilities are evident at assessment), as these conditions may require more intensive&#xD;
      interventions or limit comprehension of the intervention components. The program will include&#xD;
      1-2 hours of group therapy once weekly, and utilize Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and&#xD;
      Dialectical Behavior Therapy components focusing on skills to reduce risk factors associated&#xD;
      with suicidal behaviors. The selection and emphasis on specific skills will be based on input&#xD;
      during the early phases of the project. Length of treatment is expected to be 6-8 weeks,&#xD;
      depending on individual patient need. Adolescents also will receive individual and/or family&#xD;
      therapy, and will be referred to a psychiatrist for medication management as needed. In&#xD;
      addition, parents will attend a 1-hour biweekly skills-based parent group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures. Patients and parents will complete the Quick Inventory of Depressive&#xD;
      Symptomatology - Adolescents (QIDS-A). Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) will be&#xD;
      obtained at discharge. Participants will complete the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire&#xD;
      (INQ), Concise Health Risk Tracking (CHRT), and the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale&#xD;
      (ACSS) at both intake and discharge, Clinicians will complete the Clinician Checklist and the&#xD;
      Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at baseline and discharge. The investigators&#xD;
      will collect follow-up information at 1 month and 6 months following each patient's final&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
