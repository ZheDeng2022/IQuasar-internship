  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SLC-391 is a novel, potent and specific small molecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      AXL with desirable potency and pharmaceutical properties. It has demonstrated&#xD;
      antiproliferative activity against different tumour cell lines in vitro and efficacy in&#xD;
      different animal models including nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), chronic myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (CML) and (acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models. It has also exhibited strong synergy with&#xD;
      other approved targeted therapies in different animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first clinical study with SLC-391. The goals of this study are to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic profile of SLC-391, and then to identify a&#xD;
      safe and pharmacologically active dose for evaluation in subsequent cohorts or clinical&#xD;
      studies. In addition, change from baseline of possible blood biomarkers (soluble AXL and Gas&#xD;
      6) may be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, multicentre, phase 1, dose-escalation, first in human study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of SLC-391 administered orally (once or twice daily) in 21-day cycles to&#xD;
      subjects with advanced solid tumours.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will employ a 3+3 dose-escalation design. Cohorts (same dose level) of 3 to 6 evaluable subjects will participate in a dose-escalation scheme in which the dose of SLC-391 will be increased in each consecutive cohort. Evaluation of a cohort of ≥ 3 subjects that have completed a 21-day cycle (cycle 1) is required prior to defining a new SLC-391 dose and schedule for the next cohort. Dose-escalation decisions by the Data Review Committee will take into account all available data including PK/pharmacodynamic data and the safety profile of prior cohorts. Based on all available emerging data, alternative dosing schedules, frequency, or dose reductions may be considered.</intervention_model_description>
