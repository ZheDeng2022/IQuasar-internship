  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Prostate 8-II study is a 2-year randomized controlled trial of testing different&#xD;
      combinations of educational and supportive tools related to diet and exercise to evaluate&#xD;
      biological, clinical, and quality of life outcomes in men choosing radical prostatectomy as&#xD;
      treatment for prostate cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a PI initiated, randomized controlled trial of four exercise and diet interventions&#xD;
      among 200 men opting for radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The Prostate 8-II study&#xD;
      enrolls men up to 8 weeks prior to surgery and participants remain on study for 24 cycles&#xD;
      after surgery (1 cycle=28 days). After obtaining written informed consent, enrolled subjects&#xD;
      will be scheduled for the baseline assessments. All participants will receive Group A&#xD;
      educational materials and tools, but these will be distributed at different times based on&#xD;
      group assignment. The other 3 groups will receive different combinations of exercise (Group&#xD;
      B), diet (Group C) and exercise and diet (Group D) tools. Men in all arms will be asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires at baseline, pre-surgery, and at cycles 6 12 &amp; 24 post-surgery, and&#xD;
      complete blood and urine collection, diet recall, and accelerometer measurement at select&#xD;
      time points. Specimens from biopsy and radical prostatectomy will be reviewed by the&#xD;
      investigators' collaborator, GenomeDx, for RNA characterization and assessment of the genomic&#xD;
      risk scores. Patients will be followed for 30 days after completion of the 2-year 24-cycle&#xD;
      intervention period or removal from the study, or until death, whichever occurs first for any&#xD;
      treatment-related adverse events. Following the completion of the intervention, we will&#xD;
      follow the patient's treatment and disease status on a yearly basis, for 3 more years.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of patients with detectable levels of Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months and 24 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Detectable PSA will be defined based on current practice at the time of analysis. Point estimate and 95% confidence interval of the proportion of detectable PSA at 6 months and 2 years post-surgery for each group will be reported. In addition, Pearson's Chi-square test will be used to test if there are differences in the proportion of detectable PSA at least 6 weeks post-surgery among the groups. If there is a significant difference observed, a 2-sample proportion test to compare Groups B, C, and D, separately, with Group A and one another for each post-intervention time point will be performed. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the recurrence proportion will be obtained for each group</description>

    <measure>Changes in Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) expression patterns (focusing on change between biopsy and RP)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of intervention on changes in mRNA expression patterns using the 1.4 million marker Affymetrix 1.0 Human Exon Array, in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate biopsy and prostatectomy tissue to determine which genes are differentially expressed from biopsy to RP within each group. If the expression is significantly different in at least one of the groups, the change of RNA expression level will be compared among all groups by ANOVA. If there is a significant difference observed, we will perform pairwise comparisons among the groups. Multiple testing adjustment will be done by controlling false discovery rate</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decipher score (focusing on change between biopsy and RP)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of genomic classifiers, using the 1.4 million marker Affymetrix 1.0 Human Exon Array, in FFPE (formalin-fixed paraffin embedded) prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy tissue. Each score ranges from 0 to 100 and can be interpreted as a probability of progression. The 2-sample proportion test will be used to compare the proportion of reduction in the genomic score between Groups B, C, and D, separately with Group A first. Significant mean changes in the Decipher score will be tested using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). If there is a significant difference observed, pairwise comparisons among the groups will be performed. A regression model will be built using an indicator for group and stratification factors such as age at diagnosis and surgical parameters (e.g., CAPRA-S) which have been determined to be potential covariates.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, and 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EPIC-26 will be used to determine the impact of quality of life issues on the sexual function domain. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and the raw score of each item is then transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale.

    <measure>Change in scores on the SF-12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a 12-item questionnaire used to assess generic health outcomes from the patient's perspective. The SF-12 consists of a subset of 12 items from the SF-36® Health Survey (SF-36) and measures two composite outcomes assessing mental health composite score (MCS) and physical health composite scores (PCS). The PCS &amp; MCS are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health. The absolute change in item score by group from baseline up to 12 months was used to assess the quality of life/psychosocial impact on the patients with a larger scores indicating a greater degree of change on physical and mental health.</description>

    <description>The Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire measures the frequency and duration of various types of physical activity (strenuous, moderate, light) and each is weighted by multiplying the frequency by a corresponding multiplier (x9, x5, x3 respectively) during a typical 7-Day period. The weekly leisure activity score = (9 × Strenuous) + (5 × Moderate) + (3 × Light). A score of 24 units or more indicates a status of &quot;Active&quot;, 14 - 23 units &quot;Moderately Active&quot; and &lt; 14 units &quot;Insufficiently Active/Sedentary&quot;.</description>
