  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is the commonest operation of childhood and results in considerable pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remifentanil is a potent, ultra short acting opioid with a long- established safety record in&#xD;
      paediatric anaesthesia that is used to provide intraoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence from adult studies that remifentanil increases postoperative pain, although&#xD;
      this may be ablated if propofol (rather than inhalational anaesthesia) is used or if the&#xD;
      remifentanil is tapered rather than abruptly discontinued at the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analgesic effect of gradual withdrawal of remifentanil at the end of surgery has not been&#xD;
      studied in children and may have significant clinical implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary measure of efficacy will be the dose of fentanyl rescue analgesia in the&#xD;
      peri-operative period (1 mcg.kg-1 bolus for &gt;20% increase in pulse, blood pressure or&#xD;
      movement intraoperatively or a FLACC(Face, Legs, Arms, Cry, Consolablity) score of &gt;5 in&#xD;
      recovery).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of the commonest childhood operations in the world; approximately 9200&#xD;
      children have their tonsils removed every year in Norway alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain following the procedure is significant and notoriously difficult to mange.&#xD;
      It´s management is potentially complicated by nausea and the risk of tonsillar infection or&#xD;
      re-bleeding. Post-tonsillectomy pain in children is persistent, with 75% of children&#xD;
      experiencing significant pain for the first three days and 50% still suffering with&#xD;
      significant pain one week after the procedure. As well as delaying recovery, reducing oral&#xD;
      intake of food and drink and disturbing sleep, post tonsillectomy pain has been shown to&#xD;
      result in more than 50% of patients and their parents consulting their primary care physician&#xD;
      in the post operative period, with the ensuing costs to the families and healthcare&#xD;
      providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is worth noting, that despite significant postoperative pain and potential complications,&#xD;
      recovery after adeno / tonsillectomy is excellent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operative nature of tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy necessitates the provision of&#xD;
      general anaesthesia to the child. The technique must ensure sufficient depth of anaesthesia&#xD;
      and analgesia and protection of the airway from blood and surgical debris. Whilst there are a&#xD;
      wide variety of anaesthetic techniques employed to achieve these goals,Total Intra Venous&#xD;
      Anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil has been shown in previous studies to be&#xD;
      superior to volatile based (gas) anaesthesia, resulting in less post operative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, less long term adverse behavioural changes, improved quality of emergence from&#xD;
      anaesthesia, and less environmental pollution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of remifentanil and propofol TIVA in children is well established and has been in use&#xD;
      since at least the year 2000 for children undergoing tonsillectomy. Despite this the effects&#xD;
      of remifentanil dosing on post-operative pain has not been studied in children undergoing&#xD;
      tonsillectomy, though it may play a significant role.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Two syringes will be simultaneously infused during the operation. One will contain normal saline solution and the other remifentanil solution. Prior to the end of the operation one of the syringes will have a step wise decrease in infusion rate whilst the other will be abruptly stopped at the end of surgery.&#xD;
The syringes will be prepared according to randomisation in the hospital pharmacy and the identity of each syringe will be masked from all those involved in the study. The syringe randomisation will be de-coded following completion of recruitment.</masking_description>

    <description>The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale or FLACC scale is a well validated measurement used to assess pain for children or individuals that are unable to communicate their pain. The scale is scored in a range of 0-10 with 0 representing no pain. The scale has five criteria, which are each assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
Thus the face component is scored as 0 for no particular expression or smile, 1 for an occasional grimace and 2 for a constant quivering chin or clenched jaw.&#xD;
The 0-2 score from each of the 5 domains is summated to give a total score between 0 and 10.&#xD;
A lower pain score indicates a better outcome than a high pain score.</description>

    <time_frame>From the cessation of anaesthesia until the 28th day following discharge from the day case surgical unit.</time_frame>
    <description>The Parents' Post Operative Pain Measure (PPOMP) is a well validated 15 point questionnaire used to measure childrens' pain after moderately or severely painful procedures.&#xD;
The parents are asked to complete the survey between particular times each day (e.g between supper and bed time). The questionnaire consists of 15 YES / NO questions such as: &quot;When your child was recovering from surgery between supper and bed time today did s/he...&#xD;
Cry more easily than usual ? YES / NO&#xD;
Refuse to eat? YES/ NO&#xD;
Want to be closer to you than usual? YES / NO.&#xD;
The YES response are scored as 1 and the NO responses scores as 0. The sum score ranges from 0 to 15.&#xD;
A lower pain score indicates a better outcome than a high pain score.</description>
