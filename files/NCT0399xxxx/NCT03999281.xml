        Population included ages 18- any age, males 50.5 % and females 49.5%, There was more males&#xD;
        in the diabetic subset and more females in the venous subset.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Theraskin applied to lower extremity wound during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Over 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Males and Females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. lower Extremity wound due to diabetic neuropathy or venous insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Documented palpable pedal pulse (dorsalis pedis and/or posterior tibialis arteries&#xD;
             and/or palpable bypass graft), or ankle brachial index (ABI) in the range of &gt; 0.8 to&#xD;
             &lt; 1.1 or Tcpo2 &gt; 40 mm Hg from the foot at the time of the initial allograft&#xD;
             applicaton&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In subjects with multiple wounds only the largest wound receiving the allograft was&#xD;
             included and considered the target wound&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Initial wound size &gt;1 cm 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. All wound locations within the lower extremity (defined as below the knee) and wound&#xD;
             durations included&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Concomitant Negative pressure wound therapy was allowed as this could have been an&#xD;
             anchoring technique for the allograft&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Concomitant antibiotics ( topical, oral, or intravenous) were allowed as it was not&#xD;
             possible to determine whether administration of antibiotics was due to a true&#xD;
             infection at the target wound site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Wound etiologies other than diabetic neuropathy or nevous such as trauma, burns,&#xD;
             sickle cell anemia, necrobiosis lipoidica , pyoderma gangrenosum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Wound not present for at least 30 days and showing lack of progression for at least 30&#xD;
             days prior to application of Theraskin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Other ulcer treatments besides study allograft during the study period ( study period&#xD;
             definition: time of first allograft application up to 20 weeks) were not included in&#xD;
             this study. These concomitant treatments specifically include hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
             treatments, venous ablation procedures, revascularization procedures including lower&#xD;
             extremity bypass grafts or angioplasties or stents, application of additional growth&#xD;
             factors, biologic products containing cells or other tissue-derived products, matrix&#xD;
             components, or enzymatic debriders. Subjects were allowed to receive standard of care&#xD;
             therapy with the study allograft, which included debridement, moist dressings or&#xD;
             compression dressings depending on wound etiology, and off-weighting depending on&#xD;
             wound location.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with revascularization procedures (defined as lower extremity bypass grafts,&#xD;
             angioplasties, or stents) within 30 days of initial TheraSkin application were&#xD;
             excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with successful surgical correction or intervention aimed at improving venous&#xD;
             return in the target limb, such as venous ablation procedures, within 30 days of&#xD;
             initial TheraSkin application were excluded&#xD;
