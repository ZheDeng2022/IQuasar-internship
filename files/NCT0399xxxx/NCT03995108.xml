  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has a double-blind, placebo-controlled Randomized Period and an Open-Label&#xD;
      extension Period. The primary objective of the Randomized Period is to demonstrate the&#xD;
      efficacy of mavorixafor in participants with WHIM syndrome as assessed by increasing levels&#xD;
      of circulating neutrophils compared with placebo, and relative to a clinically meaningful&#xD;
      threshold. The primary objective of the Open-Label Period is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of mavorixafor in participants with WHIM syndrome. Participants are allowed to&#xD;
      continue treatment in the Open-Label extension Period, if regionally applicable, until&#xD;
      mavorixafor becomes commercially available, or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor.&#xD;
