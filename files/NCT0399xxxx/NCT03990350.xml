    <textblock>
      The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract is filled with millions of bacteria that can affect our&#xD;
      health. These bacteria are linked with our overall health including obesity risk. In the&#xD;
      United States the Hispanic population is one of the ethnic groups at higher risk of&#xD;
      developing obesity. In this study the team will investigate differences in the GI bacterial&#xD;
      composition between Hispanic and Caucasian children, and potentially demonstrate a&#xD;
      correlation between the composition of metagenome and a higher risk to develop obesity. This&#xD;
      will be done by collecting stool samples and comparing the bacteria found in the stool of&#xD;
      Hispanic children (with and without obesity) and Caucasian children (with and without&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;

      I. SPECIFIC AIMS There are a vast number of microbes in the human gastrointestinal tract (GI)&#xD;
      including bacterial, fungal and protozoal microorganisms which all together make our&#xD;
      microbiome. Over the last years evidence has shown that the GI microbiome is linked with our&#xD;
      overall health including obesity risk. The GI microbiota can influence both sides of the&#xD;
      energy balance that includes factors influencing energy utilization from the diet and factors&#xD;
      that play a role in the regulation of energy expenditure and storage by influencing host&#xD;
      genes (1, 2). Studies of demonstrated that overweight and obesity rates are among the highest&#xD;
      for Hispanic children in the United States. It is estimated that in the US 47% of Hispanic&#xD;
      children are overweight and 31% have obesity, compared to 35% and 21% respectively for&#xD;
      Caucasian non-Hispanic children. Literature has shown environment factors are associated with&#xD;
      childhood obesity in Hispanic children including: parental influences, screen time, physical&#xD;
      activity behavior, socioeconomic status/food security, and sleep duration (3,4). Thus far&#xD;
      there have been no studies having investigated if there are significant differences in the&#xD;
      gut microbiome of Hispanic children; moreover, whether these differences (taxonomy or gene&#xD;
      expression) puts them at higher risk to develop obesity compared other ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict there are significant GI microbiome differences between Caucasian&#xD;
      non-Hispanic children and Hispanic Children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Confirm differences in microbiome between Caucasian non-Hispanic children (with and&#xD;
      without obesity) and Hispanic children (with and without obesity) in this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Hispanic children will have a lower fecal bacterial diversity compared to&#xD;
      Caucasian non-Hispanic children that is associated with more overall adiposity and impaired&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis determined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Next generation metagenomic &quot;whole genome/shotgun&quot; sequencing of DNA from fecal samples of&#xD;
      cohorts which includes Hispanic children with obesity, Hispanic children without obesity,&#xD;
      Caucasian non-Hispanic children with obesity and Caucasian non-Hispanic children without&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Bioinformatics computational analysis comparing the four groups to determine beta&#xD;
      diversity (relative taxonomic) abundance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Obesity is a serious health risk in the United States. The&#xD;
      prevalence of childhood obesity has increased over the last two decades. According the U.S.&#xD;
      Department of health and Human Services, recent date showed that the prevalence of obesity&#xD;
      higher among youth aged 6-11 year and adolescents aged 12-19 years compared with children&#xD;
      aged 2-5 years of age. The Hispanic population is among the most affected ethnic groups in&#xD;
      the United States. Approximately 47% of Hispanic children are overweight and 31% have&#xD;
      obesity. Multiple factors have been found to play a role in the development of childhood&#xD;
      obesity in Hispanic children, including: parental influences, screen time, physical activity&#xD;
      behavior, socioeconomic status/food security, and sleep duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last few years there has been a research interest in understanding the development&#xD;
      and pathogenesis of obesity. Recent studies have found that the gut microbiota plays in an&#xD;
      important role in the triggering and the development on obesity. The GI microbiota can&#xD;
      influence both sides of the energy balance that includes factors influencing energy&#xD;
      utilization from the diet and factors that play a role in the regulation of energy&#xD;
      expenditure and storage by influencing host genes. In a study by Hou, they evaluated the 16S&#xD;
      rRNA gene, the enterotypes and quantity of gut microbiota among obese children and a healthy&#xD;
      control cohort. In this study they found that the composition of the gut microbiota showed&#xD;
      significant differences between obese children and healthy controls. The results indicated&#xD;
      that the phyla of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the predominant fecal microbiome in both&#xD;
      cohorts but the relative abundance ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (F/B) in the obese&#xD;
      cohort was significantly higher than that in the healthy controls. Firmicutes are associated&#xD;
      with genes involved in carbohydrate catabolism and is rich in obese individuals, while&#xD;
      Bacteroidetes are linked with diminished body mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time there have been no studies that have investigated if there are significant&#xD;
      differences in the gut microbiome of Hispanic children; moreover, whether these differences&#xD;
      (taxonomy or gene expression) puts them at higher risk to develop obesity compared other&#xD;
      ethnic groups. The study team feels it is important to identify possible microbiome&#xD;
      differences in the Hispanic population that may put them at a higher risk of developing&#xD;
      childhood obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS INCLUDING STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Study Subjects/Experimental&#xD;
      Design The investigators will recruit and enroll 4 cohorts including 6 Hispanic children with&#xD;
      obesity, 6 Hispanic children without obesity, 6 Caucasian non-Hispanic children with obesity&#xD;
      and 6 Caucasian non-Hispanic children without obesity. Obesity will be defined as a BMI &gt;95%.&#xD;
      Enrollment age will be between 6-12 years of age. The investigators will obtain baseline&#xD;
      characteristics at the time of enrollment, including anthropometric measures (weight, length,&#xD;
      BMI), dietary history (including 24 hour recall diary and a food frequency questionnaire),&#xD;
      and physical activity history (Physical activity questionnaire). The investigators will&#xD;
      obtain medication history, including history of use antibiotics, steroids and probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary and Physical activity measurement At fecal collection, investigators will obtain&#xD;
      dietary information for the patient using a 30-food item food frequency questionnaire and a&#xD;
      24-hour food recall diary. Diet records will be analyzed using the Nutrient Data System for&#xD;
      Research software (Minneapolis, MN). The investigators will determine intake of macro- and&#xD;
      micronutrient intake as well as patterns of dietary intake using the latent class&#xD;
      (person-centered approach) as well as factor (data-based approach) analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect physical activity data on the patient using the Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C) and will analyze with Spearman correlation&#xD;
      coefficients. Clinical data management will be the responsibility of the principal&#xD;
      investigator and GI fellow/co-investigator and will use a secure database, REDCap, through&#xD;
      Nemours' REDCap system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal Sample Collection With permission from the parent/guardian, stool collected in a&#xD;
      sterile container will be brought within 12 hours of defecation from home or the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic to a separate clinical laboratory where feces will be collected through use of&#xD;
      FLOQswab brush x 3 (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) The swabs will be pre-labeled with a&#xD;
      de-identified code reflecting patient number, sample number, and date and the sample will be&#xD;
      placed into dry ice then transferred to a -80 degrees Celsius freezer until retrieval by the&#xD;
      research staff for transfer to CHOP Microbiome Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial DNA Isolation DNA will be extracted from samples using the DNeasy PowerSoil kit&#xD;
      using the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Shotgun libraries will be&#xD;
      generated from 1 ng of DNA using the NexteraXT kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Libraries&#xD;
      will be sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using 2x125bp chemistry in High Output mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioinformatics processing and statistical analysis Differences in weight gain, HgbA1c,&#xD;
      physical activity associated with nutritional diet records or other outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      using t-test or Mann Whitney U test, adjusting for covariates. The relationship between&#xD;
      nutrition records and outcomes will be further examined using mixed effects models, adjusting&#xD;
      for the effect of key physical activity or dietary variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FASTQ files will be analyzed using an established computational pipeline developed at&#xD;
      Nemours.&#xD;
