      B-HAPPY is an implementation project to study the process by which pre-exposure prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PrEP) is introduced and integrated into a specific international health system facing high&#xD;
      rates of HIV incidence among men who have sex with men. The study will use a stepped wedge&#xD;
      design to compare implementation outcomes across eight municipalities in Yunnan, China.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      B-HAPPY is an implementation science project that will introduce and evaluate the&#xD;
      implementation of PrEP among over 1000 men who have sex with men (MSM), in eight&#xD;
      municipalities in Yunnan, China. The project aims to compare the effectiveness of two&#xD;
      implementation strategy bundles: 1) Standard Implementation: comprising the strategies that&#xD;
      the Yunnan Center for Disease Control and Prevention would usually use to introduce HIV&#xD;
      prevention innovations in the absence of the proposed study; and 2) Enhanced Implementation:&#xD;
      standard implementation enhanced by a SIC-guided approach to plan and implement PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a stepped-wedge design, where sites will go through four study periods: a&#xD;
      Pre-Baseline Period (Routine Service with no PrEP Implementation), a Baseline Period&#xD;
      (Standard Implementation of PrEP), an Experiment Period (Enhanced Implementation of PrEP),&#xD;
      and a Post-Experiment-Observation Period. Sites are randomized to the timing of the&#xD;
      intervention initiation, with 2 sites moving from Standard Implementation to Enhanced&#xD;
      Implementation every 6 months. The intervention condition changes over time and the&#xD;
      intervention effect is the difference in outcomes between the Baseline and Experiment&#xD;
      Periods, and the Post-Experiment and Baseline Periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the proposed study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate whether the addition of SIC-guided PrEP delivery (Enhanced Implementation)&#xD;
           to standard health system PrEP delivery improves services outcomes. Through a&#xD;
           stepped-wedge randomized trial across eight Yunnan municipalities, within site change&#xD;
           over time will be examined; timing of introduction of Enhanced Implementation will be&#xD;
           randomized across four cohorts of two sites each. Client-services outcomes include&#xD;
           progress to achieving the &quot;Five-80s&quot; (patient PrEP awareness, screening, offering,&#xD;
           initiation, continuation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the implementation process and efficiency of the Enhanced versus Standard&#xD;
           implementation approaches. Using the Stages of Implementation Completion (SIC) and Cost&#xD;
           of Implementing New Strategies (COINS) tools, sites will be monitored for implementation&#xD;
           process and resource use. Outcomes will include proportion of implementation activities&#xD;
           completed; duration of each implementation phase; and cost and resource allocation for&#xD;
           completion of each implementation phase.&#xD;
