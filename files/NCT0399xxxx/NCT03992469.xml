  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is the major form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affecting adults.&#xD;
      It is a life-long disease characterized by chronic and relapsing inflammation of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. CD has multiple clinical phenotypes and disease severities that&#xD;
      determine which therapy the study team utilizes. Currently, there are numerous treatment&#xD;
      options for subjects with moderate-severe CD, but few that are approved to treat and maintain&#xD;
      remission for the one-third of patients who present with mild-to-moderate disease. The study&#xD;
      team hypothesizes that Butanol Purified Food Allergy Herbal Formula-2 (B-FAHF-2) will be safe&#xD;
      and effective for maintaining remission of mild-to-moderate CD and can fill this therapeutic&#xD;
      void. CD affects 241 per 100,000 adults in the United States and the incidence in both adults&#xD;
      and children has increased in the past 60 years. One such potential therapy is Food Allergy&#xD;
      Herbal Formula-2 (FAHF-2) which was originally developed to treat food allergy and has&#xD;
      received FDA investigational new drug approval under the botanical drug title for treating&#xD;
      patients with multiple food allergies. A completed phase I study showed that FAHF-2 is safe&#xD;
      and well tolerated. A Phase II trial revealed that a high pill burden with FAHF-2 caused poor&#xD;
      compliance. A butanol purified form of FAHF-2 (B-FAHF-2) is a more concentrated form of&#xD;
      FAHF-2 which has also received an IND (FDA IND#77,468) and reduces the pill burden and&#xD;
      improves compliance. Interestingly, the herbal components in B-FAHF-2 have long been used in&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to treat gastrointestinal disorders including colitis. The&#xD;
      study team has shown that B-FAHF-2 non-toxically inhibits TNF-#, a major inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine involved in CD, as well as multiple other pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by&#xD;
      human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and intestinal mucosa from subjects with CD.&#xD;
      In addition, the study team has shown that FAHF-2 prevents disease progression in a murine&#xD;
      model of colitis. The study team hypothesizes that B-FAHF-2 will be safe and effective for&#xD;
      treating mild-to-moderate CD and can fill this therapeutic void. The study team proposes to&#xD;
      investigate the safety and tolerability of B-FAHF-2 in subjects with mild-to-moderate CD. The&#xD;
      goal is to establish safety and tolerability and explore efficacy at maintaining remission in&#xD;
      this select patient population. Importantly, the study team will also determine the&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic effects of B-FAHF-2 on PBMCs and intestinal mucosa to determine if there&#xD;
      are immunologic alterations that would indicate that controlled efficacy evaluations of&#xD;
      B-FAHF-2 are warranted. The new IND number is 143453. The FDA has completed their safety&#xD;
      review of this protocol and has concluded that the study team's clinical trial may proceed&#xD;
      with the proposed clinical investigation for Crohn's disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team's current proposed study uses the same investigational agent, B-FAHF-2, being&#xD;
      studied for food allergy under an active IND, and seeks to determine if this formula is safe&#xD;
      for the treatment of mild-to-moderate CD. The study team's major goal focuses on safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, beneficial immunomodulatory effect, and preliminary clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      B-FAHF-2 to maintain remission in subjects with mild-to-moderate CD. B-FAHF-2 is currently&#xD;
      undergoing a phase II clinical trial for treatment of food allergy, thus increasing the ease&#xD;
      of obtaining an FDA IND for B-FAHF-2 use in CD. Preliminary data were generated in the study&#xD;
      team's ongoing FAHF-2 and B-FAHF-2 studies on food allergy and IBD. In developing a botanical&#xD;
      drug from a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, standardization of product is key to&#xD;
      ensure safety, consistency, and potency. An IND for B-FAHF-2 has been accepted by the FDA,&#xD;
      and is documented that the product's quality, safety and standardized methodology have been&#xD;
      demonstrated. To date, the study team has demonstrated the safety of B-FAHF-2 in animal&#xD;
      models and the safety and tolerability of B-FAHF-2 in patients, including adults and children&#xD;
      with food allergy. The most specific data relevant to this proposal are the suppression by&#xD;
      FAHF-2/B-FAHF-2 of TNF-alpha production by PBMC's and intestinal specimens from children with&#xD;
      CD and the abrogation of colitis in a murine model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD is a life-long chronic, relapsing, immune mediated inflammatory disease characterized by&#xD;
      inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment is aimed at controlling mucosal&#xD;
      inflammation, and thus symptoms of the disease, by inducing and then maintaining remission.&#xD;
      Since CD causes abdominal pain, decreased appetite, malabsorption and diarrhea, children are&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable because inadequate nutrition can lead to potentially irreversible&#xD;
      growth stunting and delayed maturity. There is a lack of maintenance therapies for children&#xD;
      and adults with mild-to-moderate disease since many of the medications used to treat CD.&#xD;
      including steroids, immunomodulators and biological therapies are geared towards treating&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe disease. The most commonly used medications for treatment and maintenance&#xD;
      of remission in mild-to-moderate CD are 5-ASA compounds and antibiotics but they are not FDA&#xD;
      approved and the literature does not support their utility in CD. Based on the inhibition of&#xD;
      TNF-alpha by B-FAHF-2 and FAHF-2 in vitro, the study team hypothesizes that B-FAHF-2 will be&#xD;
      safe and effective therapy that will fill this therapeutic void. The study team proposes to&#xD;
      test the safety and tolerability of B-FAHF-2 in subjects with recently diagnosed&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate CD that responds to induction with Entocort EC. To minimize any potential&#xD;
      risk by exposing a large number of subjects to treatment: the study team will conduct the&#xD;
      study in subjects 18-30 years old to assess for safety, tolerability and determine&#xD;
      immunological and/or efficacy signals (subjective and objective measures). Since B-FAHF-2 is&#xD;
      likely to be slow to work, subjects will be induced with Entocort EC for 8 weeks. Responders&#xD;
      will then be enrolled in the trial. The safety and tolerability trial is eight weeks long,&#xD;
      double blind, placebo controlled dose escalation trial of B-FAHF-2 in subjects who responded&#xD;
      to induction therapy with Entocort EC. This portion of the study will serve to ensure safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of B-FAHF-2. Subjects will be seen every 2 weeks and contacted by phone in&#xD;
      between study visits to assess for any adverse events (AEs). This will be followed by a 6&#xD;
      month long, open-label exploratory extension trial of B-FAHF-2 monotherapy to ensure the&#xD;
      sub-chronic safety as well as determine of there is any efficacy or immunologic alteration to&#xD;
      pursue in randomized efficacy trials. During this phase, subjects will have follow-up visits&#xD;
      every 4 weeks to assess for AEs and efficacy outcomes. In addition, a subset of 4 subjects&#xD;
      will participate in PK studies for one of the visits during this phase. The exploratory&#xD;
      efficacy phase of the study will be conducted in a population of subjects naive to&#xD;
      immunomodulators, systemic steroids and biologics. This study population will provide us with&#xD;
      an opportunity to determine the safety and immunologic effects of B-FAHF-2 in CD without the&#xD;
      interference of systemic immunomodulating medications.&#xD;
