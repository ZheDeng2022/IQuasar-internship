    <textblock>
      Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a devastating eye disease and at present there are no known&#xD;
      treatment options that can alter the rate of vision loss and eventual blindness. In a series&#xD;
      of studies in animal models, the effects of exposing cones in the periphery of the retina to&#xD;
      a large excess of oxygen results in progressive oxidative damage to cone photoreceptors and&#xD;
      cone cell death. Cone cell death gradually spreads from the periphery of the retina toward&#xD;
      its center, narrowing the visual field and eventually resulting in tunnel vision. Compared to&#xD;
      control patients, those with RP showed significant reduction in the reduced to oxidized&#xD;
      glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) in aqueous humor and a significant increase in protein carbonyl&#xD;
      content. This demonstration of oxidative stress and oxidative damage in the eyes of patients&#xD;
      with RP, suggests that oxidative damage-induced cone cell death in animal models of RP may&#xD;
      translate to humans with RP and support the hypotheses that (1) potent antioxidants will&#xD;
      promote cone survival and function in patients with RP and (2) aqueous GSH/GSSG ratio and&#xD;
      carbonyl content on proteins provide useful biomarkers of disease activity in this patient&#xD;
      population. Orally administered N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been found to be a particularly&#xD;
      effective antioxidant that promotes prolonged cone survival and maintenance of cone function&#xD;
      in a mouse model of RP. Since oral and/or topical administration of NAC is feasible for&#xD;
      long-term treatment in humans, and NAC has a good safety profile, there is good rationale to&#xD;
      test the effect of NAC in patients with RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative damage has been implicated in several diseases including cystic fibrosis, chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. The effect of oral&#xD;
      NAC has been tested in these indications in several clinical trials providing extensive&#xD;
      safety data. In COPD, NAC 600mg bid improves airway function and reduces the frequency of&#xD;
      acute exacerbations. Doses of up to 1800mg/day have been well-tolerated in the treatment of&#xD;
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) toxicity is treated with a loading&#xD;
      dose of 140 mg/kg NAC followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 17 doses. Normal volunteers&#xD;
      tolerated a dose of 11.2 grams NAC/day for three months without any serious undesirable&#xD;
      effects and in another study a dose of 500mg/kg/day was tolerated. The most frequent adverse&#xD;
      events associated with the oral administration of NAC are gastrointestinal in nature and&#xD;
      include vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, abdominal pain and nausea (incidence rate &gt;1/1000 to&#xD;
      &lt;1/100). Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock and&#xD;
      anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction (incidence rate &lt;1/10,000), dyspnea, bronchospasm&#xD;
      (incidence rate &gt;1/10,000 to &lt;1/1000), angioedema, tachycardia, urticaria, rash and pruritus&#xD;
      (incidence rate &gt;1/1000 to &lt;1/100) have been reported less frequently. Finally, reports of&#xD;
      headache, tinnitus, pyrexia, blood pressure decreased (incidence rate &gt;1/1000 to &lt;1/100),&#xD;
      face edema and hemorrhage have also been collected with oral NAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the FIGHT-RP 1 Study, the investigators used escalating doses of NAC effervescent tablets&#xD;
      (from 600 mg in Cohort 1 to 1800 mg in Cohort 3). The maximum tolerated dose was 1800 mg&#xD;
      twice a day which will be continued in this study.&#xD;
