    <textblock>
      This trial evaluates the addition of rituximab to standard of care in the treatment of&#xD;
      antibody-mediated rejection in kidney transplant patients. The trial will involve adults and&#xD;
      children. Half of participants will receive standard of care (methylprednisolone, intravenous&#xD;
      immunoglobulin and plasma exchange), while the other half will receive standard of care and&#xD;
      rituximab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic antibody-mediated rejection (cAMR) is the leading cause of kidney transplant failure.&#xD;
      Fifty percent of kidney transplant patients who develop acute antibody-mediated rejection&#xD;
      (aAMR) will develop evidence of cAMR within 1 year of the acute rejection episode. There is&#xD;
      currently no evidence on how to treat aAMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned research is a randomised controlled trial, which compares an acceptable and&#xD;
      commonly used therapy, which will be referred to as &quot;standard of care&quot;, with an additional&#xD;
      agent, rituximab, added to the &quot;standard of care&quot; treatment. The participants with be&#xD;
      randomised in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Standard of care&quot; will include optimisation of the participant's baseline anti-rejection&#xD;
      medications and therapy to remove the antibodies which have developed against the kidney&#xD;
      transplant, which are causing the damage. This is called plasma exchange. The participants&#xD;
      will also receive therapy to reduce inflammation and reduce their immune response to their&#xD;
      kidney transplant. This will be achieved using corticosteroids and intravenous&#xD;
      immunoglobulins, respectively. These therapies have been used to treat aAMR for many decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention arm will consist of the &quot;standard of care&quot; treatment, with the addition of a&#xD;
      drug called rituximab, which will be administered in 2 separate doses. Rituximab is itself an&#xD;
      antibody, which binds to certain cells in the body involved in antibody production, called B&#xD;
      cells. Following the administration of rituximab, the number of B cells is reduced, which&#xD;
      affects antibody production. Rituximab is commonly used in transplantation for this&#xD;
      indication, as well as for other conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both arms will be followed up to determine if there is a difference in the&#xD;
      time to transplant failure and/or transplant function.&#xD;

    <description>A QoL score is obtained according to the answers to the EQ-5D-5L/EQ-5D-Y questionnaires. The QoL score comprises of 2 numbers. The first is a 5-digit number for the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system describing the 5 dimensions asked in the questionnaire. For example 11111 indicates no problems on any of the 5 dimensions whilst 55555 indicates extreme problems on all of the 5 dimensions. The second number is the EQ-VAS (EuroQoL-Visual Analogue Scale) score. This is a value between 0 and 100 where 0 is the worst health the respondent can imagine and 100 is the best health.</description>
