      The goal of this randomized treatment study is to formally compare quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with at least one pN0 hemi-neck after resection of a squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      oral cavity treated with a primary radiation therapy versus a secondary targeted radiation&#xD;
      therapy approach, to provide a high level of evidence to guide the selection of treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;

      The goal of this randomized treatment study is to formally compare quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with at least one pN0 hemi-neck after resection of a squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      oral cavity treated with a primary radiation therapy versus a secondary targeted radiation&#xD;
      therapy approach, to provide a high level of evidence to guide the selection of treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will require a sample size of 90 patients randomized in a 2:3 between the two arms.&#xD;
      Arm 1 (standard radiation therapy to tumor location and surrounding area) and Arm 2 (targeted&#xD;
      radiation therapy to tumor location).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for a total of 5 years.&#xD;
