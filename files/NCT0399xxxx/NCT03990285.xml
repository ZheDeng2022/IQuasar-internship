  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with histologically proven glioblastoma (GBM) who are suspected to have progression&#xD;
      and are candidates for a surgical resection according to standard of care may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Subjects may participate in this study if they are at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging will be used to evaluate fluciclovine uptake at&#xD;
      sites of suspected progression before planned surgery. In addition, clinical brain MRI with&#xD;
      and without contrast will be used to evaluate the tumor pre-operatively. This is a&#xD;
      non-therapeutic trial in that imaging will not be used to direct treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators anticipate enrolling up to 30 subjects who will undergo a clinical brain MRI&#xD;
      examination with and without contrast and a research 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT scan of the&#xD;
      brain prior to surgery. They will also have a blood draw preoperatively to collect samples&#xD;
      for cfDNA analysis. PET/CT imaging sessions will include an injection of approximately 5 mCi&#xD;
      (range for most studies is anticipated to be 5 mCi +/- 20%) of 18F-Fluciclovine.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study in subjects with a histologically proven diagnosis of glioblastoma (GB)&#xD;
      who have completed chemoradiation and now have new contrast enhancing lesions or lesions&#xD;
      showing increased enhancement ( 25% increase) who are recommended for a clinical surgical&#xD;
      resection. Subjects may participate in this study if they are at least 18 years of age, most&#xD;
      participants will be receiving care at the clinical practices of the University of&#xD;
      Pennsylvania. Subjects who come to the University of Pennsylvania for diagnosis and/or&#xD;
      treatment of GB and who meet the study inclusion criteria may be approached by study&#xD;
      personnel for recruitment into this study. Subjects will be approached about study&#xD;
      participation regardless of race or ethnic background. Investigators anticipate enrolling up&#xD;
      to 30 participants. Subjects who consent but do not complete the study imaging will be&#xD;
      considered not evaluable and will be replaced. Accrual will likely occur over approximately&#xD;
      1-2 years. After undergoing screening assessments and verifying eligibility for study&#xD;
      participation subjects will undergo a research 18FFluciclovine PET/CT scan of the brain and a&#xD;
      clinical brain MRI with and without gadolinium contrast, all baseline imaging will be done&#xD;
      prior to (within 1 week) of the surgical procedure. The PET-CT and MRI can be performed in&#xD;
      any order.&#xD;

    <description>Axumin is a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical that has been studied in vivo in humans in a number of tumor types with positron emission tomography (PET/CT). 18F-Fluciclovine is a fluorine-18 labeled synthetic amino acid analog that is FDA approved as a PET imaging agent for prostate cancer recurrence, however, it has also been tested in other tumors. Investigators will use a typical dose of 18F-fluciclovine that is used for clinical studies in glioblastoma. This will be 5 mCi (approximate range for most studies is anticipated to be 5 mCi +/- 20%), but a lesser dose may be injected if, in the opinion of a Nuclear Medicine Authorized User, complete imaging data could be generated.</description>
