      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People have 2 memory systems. One helps them learn skills and the other helps them learn&#xD;
      facts. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) uses electronic currents to&#xD;
      activate brain cells. This can make small changes in how brain systems operate. Researchers&#xD;
      will use rTMS to change how memory systems work and to see if changing one system causes the&#xD;
      other to change too. This could help find ways to improve learning and memory in people with&#xD;
      memory disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how different memory systems work with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-40 who are not pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be screened with a neurological exam if they haven t had one from&#xD;
      NINDS in the past 2 years. They may have urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will have 5-10 visits at NIH. Each visit will last 1-6 hours. Visits&#xD;
      1-4 will each take place 1 day apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 1, participants will have an MRI and take memory tests. For MRI, they will lie on a&#xD;
      table that slides in and out of a cylinder that takes pictures of their brain. They will also&#xD;
      have rTMS. For rTMS, a metal coil is held on their scalp. Brief electrical currents pass&#xD;
      through the coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visits 2 and 3, participants will have rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 4, participants will have an MRI and do memory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About a week later, participants will have visit 5. They will have an MRI and do memory&#xD;
      tests. Participants may be asked to have more visits if any technical problems occur.&#xD;
      Participants involvement will last 2 weeks.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Behavioral Neurology Unit studies the human brain systems underlying learning and&#xD;
      adaptation with the ultimate goal of finding interventions to make these processes more&#xD;
      efficient. We are interested in whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)&#xD;
      can alter functional connectivity (FC) and behavioral efficiency in two memory networks in&#xD;
      the brain: the hippocampal network, which supports the storage and retrieval of recallable&#xD;
      facts, concepts, and events, and the striatal network, which supports the storage and&#xD;
      retrieval of skills and habits. Additionally, because these networks interact behaviorally&#xD;
      and can interfere with each other, an important question is whether neuromodulation of one&#xD;
      network changes connectivity and efficiency in the other network. Pilot data from our group&#xD;
      suggest that exogenous stimulation of one network causes it to expand its range of FC and&#xD;
      co-opt resources from the other, which is a potential mechanism for the observed behavioral&#xD;
      interaction. This study is designed to test a) whether rTMS- modulates within-network FC and&#xD;
      memory supported by that network, and b) whether this also causes FC and behavioral changes&#xD;
      in the other network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy Volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study contains four between-subjects experiments and is a mixed inter-/intra subject&#xD;
      design. Experiment 1 will use nominally excitatory stimulation targeting the hippocampal&#xD;
      network to increase FC within the hippocampal network. We also expect to increase FC between&#xD;
      the hippocampal and striatal networks, increased declarative memory, and a possible decrease&#xD;
      in procedural, learning. Experiment 2 will use excitatory stimulation targeted to the&#xD;
      striatal network. We expect this to cause stronger within- network FC in the striatal&#xD;
      network, increased FC between the hippocampus and the striatal network and concomitant&#xD;
      behavioral effects. Experiments 3 and 4 will be similar except that we will target nominally&#xD;
      inhibitory stimulation to these networks and look for the inverse results. FC will be&#xD;
      measured under resting and task-activated conditions and active rTMS will be compared to&#xD;
      vertex sham.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the change in FC produced by rTMS within the targeted network.&#xD;
      Between-network FC changes and corresponding memory changes will be secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      Exploratory measures will include correlations between individual cognitive differences&#xD;
      (questionnaires and NIH Toolbox scores), and our primary and secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
