  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern life is characterized by a 24-hour lifestyle in which food intake is no longer&#xD;
      restricted to daytime. As a result, people nowadays tend to eat throughout the day. When food&#xD;
      is being consumed the energy is both used and stored for later use. Eating for a prolonged&#xD;
      period of time makes it unnecessary for the body to use its energy storage. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the decreased use of energy stores has detrimental effects on our sugar&#xD;
      balance, mainly on insulin sensitivity. Conversely, eating within a limited period during the&#xD;
      day could improve insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes by an increased use of&#xD;
      energy reserves, specifically liver sugar stores. Therefore, this study examines the effect&#xD;
      of eating within a limited time frame during the day on insulin sensitivity and liver sugar&#xD;
      stores of people with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Modern life is characterized by a 24-hour lifestyle in which food intake is no longer&#xD;
      restricted to daytime. Interestingly, the majority of people spread their food intake over&#xD;
      ~15 hours per day. This implies that most people experience a relatively short&#xD;
      post-absorptive (fasting) state during night time. Normally, the body relies heavily on&#xD;
      hepatic glycogen content to provide glucose and energy during the night, and glycogen stores&#xD;
      will therefore decrease over night. In the morning, ingested carbohydrates will be taken up&#xD;
      rapidly to replenish glycogen stores. It is hypothesized that in people with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (T2DM) hepatic glycogen stores may not fully deplete overnight and that restricting&#xD;
      food to a shorter period of time during the day will lead to a reduction of hepatic glycogen&#xD;
      stores, and thereby improve whole-body insulin sensitivity at the beginning of the day.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate if time restricted feeding (TRF) leads to&#xD;
      a reduction in overnight-fasted hepatic glycogen stores and improvement in insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in adults with T2DM.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of this study, it is not possible to mask the intervention effect for the investigator or the participant. During randomisation, the intervention arms will be coded with 1 and 2 and the independent researcher will be unaware which intervention is assigned to which letter. With this approach, concealed allocation will be guaranteed. Additionally, the person in charge with the data quality check and the data analyses will be blinded for the interventions using this same randomisation codes to generate unbiased results.</masking_description>
