  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and test the efficacy of the combination&#xD;
      of radium-223 dichloride and pembrolizumab in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) with bone metastases who either have not received any systemic therapy for&#xD;
      their advanced disease or have progressed on prior immunologic checkpoint blockade with&#xD;
      antibodies against the programmed cell death protein-(ligand) 1 (PD-1/PD-L1). In this study&#xD;
      researchers want to measure tumor shrinkage in response to treatment and how long that&#xD;
      shrinkage lasts and gather information on safety. Pembrolizumab is an immunologic checkpoint&#xD;
      blocker that promotes an immune response against the tumor. Radium-223 dichloride is an alpha&#xD;
      particle-emitting radioactive agent which kills cancer cells.&#xD;
