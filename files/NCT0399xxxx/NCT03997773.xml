      This project focuses on evaluating a postpartum health promotion intervention among families&#xD;
      where the mother has prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The intervention focuses on&#xD;
      the individual, family and health system levels. The aim is to increase quality of life and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes among women with prior GDM and their families.&#xD;

      Face-it: A Health Promotion Intervention for Women with Prior Gestational Diabetes and their&#xD;
      Families&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: The aim of the Face-it project is to increase quality of life and reduce the risk of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (T2DM) among women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (pGDM) and their&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: Women with pGDM are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Partners and&#xD;
      offspring of women with GDM are also at elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      related cardiometabolic conditions. Thus, not only are women with prior GDM at high risk of&#xD;
      T2DM and related cardiometabolic conditions, their children and spouses are as well. Since&#xD;
      the cumulative incidence of T2DM increases substantially within the first five years after&#xD;
      delivery (Kim et al. 2002) there is a strong interest in identifying feasible and effective&#xD;
      interventions in this time-period. Evidence from the state-of-the-art Diabetes Prevention&#xD;
      Program suggests that intensive lifestyle intervention can reduce the risk of T2DM among&#xD;
      women with pGDM (Ratner et al. 2008). However, sustainable changes in such behaviours are&#xD;
      difficult and many women do not follow lifestyle recommendations after delivery (Stage et al.&#xD;
      2004). Given the highly elevated risk in this group, this is a substantial missed opportunity&#xD;
      for health promotion aimed at prevention of T2DM for not only the mother, but the entire&#xD;
      family. It is vital that efforts are based on a thorough understanding of the barriers to&#xD;
      health promoting behaviours and involve carefully tailored solutions to overcome these&#xD;
      barriers. The investigators hypothesise that a health promotion intervention that focuses on&#xD;
      enhancing motivation, health literacy, action competences and social involvement in women&#xD;
      with pGDM and their families will reduce diabetes risk and improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Face-it is a two-arm parallel-group randomised clinical trial with women as the unit&#xD;
      of randomization comparing a health promotion intervention with a usual care control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS, RECRUITMENT AND ELIGIBILIGY: Women with pGDM will be recruited from obstetric&#xD;
      departments at Aarhus University Hospital (AUH), Odense University Hospital (OUH) or&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet (RH) around 24-40 weeks of pregnancy by a health care professional. To be&#xD;
      eligible for enrolment into the study, women should also be able to provide written informed&#xD;
      consent in Danish. Exclusion criteria is that the participants may not be participating in&#xD;
      other postpartum intervention trials with a possible impact on the Face-it trial. Women with&#xD;
      diabetes identified at baseline will be excluded. Partners of women and the new-born&#xD;
      offspring are also invited to participate in the study. Informed consents are obtained from&#xD;
      1) woman and new-born offspring, including permission to obtain information from the medical&#xD;
      record and blood samples for research biobank (woman only), 2) from partner, including blood&#xD;
      samples for research biobank. A separate consent 3) is obtained for collection of blood for&#xD;
      future biobank. In case of non-participation in the study, women are asked for consent to&#xD;
      collect information from the medical record including health characteristics of woman and&#xD;
      offspring related to pregnancy and birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE AND RANDOMISATION: Based on prior studies, a mean difference in BMI after 1 year&#xD;
      between the intervention and control groups for the women of -1.0 kg/m2 and standard&#xD;
      deviation of 2.5 is expected. A sample size of 225 women will be required to detect such a&#xD;
      difference in BMI when using a 2:1 randomisation procedure, a power of at least 80% and type&#xD;
      1 error of 5% (two-sided). The sample size increases to 460 women to allow for assuming 30%&#xD;
      loss to follow-up between baseline and follow-up and another 30% will withdraw during the&#xD;
      prolonged period from recruitment to baseline data collection and randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1/3 of participants will be randomised to the control group and 2/3 to the intervention&#xD;
      group. The randomization procedure has been generated by an independent statistician and will&#xD;
      be in blocks of 6/9/12/15 with a separate randomization at each of the three recruitment&#xD;
      locations. Allocation will be concealed from both the participant and the investigators, who&#xD;
      have the clinical and research responsibility, until baseline data have been collected,&#xD;
      eligibility confirmed, and participation accepted. However, neither participants nor the&#xD;
      investigators will be blinded to the participants intervention or control status after this&#xD;
      point, but the status will be blinded for the analyst. A randomization list will be kept&#xD;
      securely at the study site by an investigator with clinical responsibility. Both the&#xD;
      intervention and usual care group will be part of the evaluation of the Face-it trial and&#xD;
      therefore invited to baseline and follow-up clinical examinations. Participants will be&#xD;
      informed by a research assistant about whether they have been allocated to the control or&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: The intervention has been developed in a thorough and iterative co-creation&#xD;
      process with health care providers and families, where the mothers has pGDM to ensure that it&#xD;
      is carefully tailored to the needs and challenges of the target group and enhance its&#xD;
      sustainability. The three major components of the intervention are: 1) Health visitors as the&#xD;
      core healthcare providers, 2) digital health technology, and 3) a structured cross-sectoral&#xD;
      communication system in the healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL: Participants in the control group will receive usual care practice, including&#xD;
      recommended glucose control measures 3 months and one year after birth. Participants will&#xD;
      receive advice about a healthy lifestyle according to the national recommendations from the&#xD;
      Danish Health and Medicines Authority . Participants in the control group will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the health examination at baseline and follow-up and thereby obtain&#xD;
      information about own health when attending the two clinical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES AND DATA COLLECTION: There are two study visits planned for each participant&#xD;
      (women with pGDM, her partner and baby). Visit 1 (baseline) will take place 10-14 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum. Visit 2 (follow-up) will take place around 12 months postpartum. The measurements&#xD;
      taken at the visits are dependent on whether the participant is a women with pGDM, partner or&#xD;
      offspring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with measurements of glucose and insulin at 0, 30&#xD;
           and 120 minutes (women with pGDM only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples including fasting glucose, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity&#xD;
           Index, hbA1c, plasma lipids/ triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL (women with pGDM&#xD;
           and partners)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical measures. Investigations on women with pGDM and their partners will include&#xD;
           BMI, height, weight, waist- and hip circumference, body fat, blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical measures on offspring will include height, weight, abdominal- and head&#xD;
           circumference (at one-year follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire. Detailed information will be collected about socio-demographic and&#xD;
           -economic details, dietary-, physical activity-, and sleep patterns; quality of life,&#xD;
           stress, depression, self-perceived health, health literacy, motivation for behaviour&#xD;
           change, social support, self-efficacy, risk perception and knowledge about diabetes risk&#xD;
           in women with pGDM and their partners. Information about obstetric history and&#xD;
           breastfeeding will also be collected from women with pGDM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective measures of physical activity and sedentary patterns (subgroup)&#xD;
