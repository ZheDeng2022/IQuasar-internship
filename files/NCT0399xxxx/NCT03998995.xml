  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explored the feasibility, acceptability and perceived the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) 'game' in the rehabilitation of children with upper limb&#xD;
      injuries. The objectives of the clinical trial were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To qualitatively assess the perceptions of child and parent regarding the acceptability&#xD;
           of the game and equipment, and their perceptions of its effectiveness in reducing pain&#xD;
           and discomfort and facilitating movement, compared to usual physical therapy&#xD;
           experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To qualitatively assess physical therapy practitioners' perceptions of the&#xD;
           effectiveness, usability, feasibility, and acceptability of VR in their clinical setting&#xD;
           with this client group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. IVR rehabilitation game as an intervention will be acceptable to child patients and&#xD;
           their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. IVR rehabilitation game experience will show less procedural pain, discomfort, and&#xD;
           difficulties to movement, compared to usual physical therapy experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IVR rehabilitation game will demonstrate any perceived disadvantages as a therapeutic&#xD;
           intervention, compared with usual rehabilitation care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. IVR rehabilitation game will demonstrate usability in the clinical setting during the&#xD;
           rehabilitation of a small sample of children with varying ULIs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with upper limb and hand injuries often have to undergo repetitive therapeutic&#xD;
      exercises to regain or maximise function and movement which can be painful, uncomfortable and&#xD;
      tedious, reducing compliance and limiting the movement and function achieved. There is a&#xD;
      growing body of literature demonstrating the effectiveness of VR in reducing pain (e.g. in&#xD;
      burns). Its effectiveness in rehabilitation, especially in children, is a promising but&#xD;
      under-researched area. This study was focus on an under-researched target group in relation&#xD;
      to IVR interventions, children undergoing physical therapies to enhance or optimise the upper&#xD;
      limb and hand movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT AND INFORMED CONSENT 10 children were recruited, plus one parent from&#xD;
      each, and members of the clinical team of physiotherapists involved in their care. If&#xD;
      considered suitable for the research, participants were introduced to the study and recruited&#xD;
      via clinical staff responsible for their care. Staff was asked to provide information sheets&#xD;
      to those who show interest in participation, including separate sheets for both child and&#xD;
      parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, having discussed the study with their child and other family members, parents were happy&#xD;
      for their child to participate, and the child also wishes to participate, parents were asked&#xD;
      to let a member of their clinical team know and arrangements were made for the date and time&#xD;
      when the research will be take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group: clinical staff involved in physical therapy for children where the VR&#xD;
      intervention has been trialed was invited verbally, by letter or email to participate in a&#xD;
      focus group after the trial is complete, and provided with an information sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having expressed an interest in hearing more about the study, based on a simple verbal&#xD;
      explanation provided by staff, potential parents and children were provided with full,&#xD;
      printed information (age-appropriate for children) about the study to read and consider in&#xD;
      their own time. The information included a statement that participation is not obligatory and&#xD;
      reassurance that refusal to participate will not affect their care, also explain that having&#xD;
      decided to participate, the parent and child will be free to change their mind before, during&#xD;
      or immediately after the study (prior to data analysis), without giving a reason. Advice was&#xD;
      provided regarding how to withdraw their consent. Details regarding confidentiality,&#xD;
      anonymity, data access, storage, and retention also were provided. It was suggested that the&#xD;
      person retain the Information sheet for future reference and in order to make contact with&#xD;
      the research team. Parents/children who, having read the information sheet and discussed the&#xD;
      study together, wish to participate was asked to let the clinical staff know. Clinical staff&#xD;
      contacted IP and made arrangements for him to visit the Unit on one of the child's&#xD;
      appointment dates, to conduct the research. Shortly prior to using the VR for the trial on&#xD;
      the day and before written consent was taken, the child was offered a 5-10 minute exposure to&#xD;
      activities in the VR game (e.g. archery activity, rock climbing activity), to familiarise&#xD;
      themselves, check there are no problems, and avoid unnecessary distractions and confusion&#xD;
      during the procedure itself. If there were any problems or the child becomes unhappy about&#xD;
      participation at this stage, they were reassured that they don't have to participate if they&#xD;
      prefer not to and can also withdraw at any point during trial themselves if they wish. They&#xD;
      were reminded verbally at this stage that deciding the study is not for them would have no&#xD;
      consequences whatever for their future treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the child and their parent, having read the Information Sheet, expressed a wish to&#xD;
      participate, tried out the equipment, and asked any questions they have, wish to go ahead,&#xD;
      the parent was asked to sign a consent form and the child was asked to complete an assent&#xD;
      form. This was done in the presence of a clinician on the research team, ahead of the&#xD;
      intervention being implemented. Copies was be retained by the team, given to participants,&#xD;
      with one copy kept in the child's medical notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS A short interview was conducted with each child and their parent&#xD;
      (together) after each trial and was audio recorded. These interviews took place in a quiet,&#xD;
      private location near to where the physiotherapy and trial have taken place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups with staff took place after all children's trials, in a quiet and private&#xD;
      environment and at a time convenient for participants. Interviews and focus groups were&#xD;
      guided by pre-written schedules and audio-recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thematic analysis was applied to all the resulting qualitative data, resulting from&#xD;
      interviews with each child and parent, and focus group with therapeutic staff. This involved&#xD;
      a process of careful reading, coding and comparison in order to identify important patterns&#xD;
      in the data, focused on answering the aims of the study. Themes were generated based upon the&#xD;
      analysis process, which were discussed and refined within the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING On consenting to participate, participants were given a code&#xD;
      (e.g. 01C, 01P for child01, parent01), by which they were identified for the duration of the&#xD;
      study and in reports. A file linking participant identity to codes was created, password, and&#xD;
      stored securely within a study file on a SHU password protected computer, as well consent&#xD;
      forms. The lead investigator, IP, collect all data. He was audio record interviews and the&#xD;
      focus group. Password protected digital recorders was used during interviews/focus groups to&#xD;
      ensure data safety whilst on the ward and in transit back to the office. Recordings were&#xD;
      saved as audio files on University-based password protected computers, then deleted. Audio&#xD;
      files were used to create transcripts in the form of word documents, and both were securely&#xD;
      stored in password protected computer files held by research team members. No one from&#xD;
      outside the research team will have access to any information by which participant identity&#xD;
      and data can be linked. The SHU and MRC Guidelines for research with human participants were&#xD;
      followed in all aspects of the research, including data confidentiality. No one from the&#xD;
      research team (who is not also a member of participants' clinical team) will require access&#xD;
      to participants' medical records. Clinicians in the research team may make use of medical&#xD;
      records - and their knowledge of their patients - in deciding whether to introduce the&#xD;
      parent/child to the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent forms are kept in locked cabinets in the locked office of the SHU-based project&#xD;
      manager, SL. The cabinets themselves are kept locked (by key) at all times and only the&#xD;
      key-holder will be able to access office and cupboards. Data collected for the study will be&#xD;
      treated with the utmost care, retained within the research team, password&#xD;
      protected/encrypted, and no one outside the team will have access. Personal information is&#xD;
      securely stored within the SHU-based password protected computer files and separately from&#xD;
      anonymised raw data. Files are password protected and encrypted for transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymised transcriptions made from the audio files and these are also saved as password&#xD;
      protected files, identified by participant code. In reports, quotes from individuals will be&#xD;
      only identified by participant code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout, data are stored securely and a study file maintained by SL. If the team is&#xD;
      disbanded prior to this time, data will be stored at Sheffield Hallam University's research&#xD;
      archive, SHURDA. Data will be collected and retained in accordance with the Data Protection&#xD;
      Act 1998. All source documents will be retained for a period of 10 years following the end of&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY ASSESSMENTS The Oculus Rift Virtual Reality headset was used with a laptop computer&#xD;
      and all equipment was safety tested by the university before it used on participants.&#xD;
      Appropriate health and safety measures were taken throughout the sessions, with each session&#xD;
      limited to 15 minutes, with breaks in-between. Playing virtual reality games can sometimes&#xD;
      cause disorientation, dizziness or nausea in some people, for example, those with severe&#xD;
      motion sickness. However, in the most recent versions of this technology, and in our own&#xD;
      recent trials of similar games, adverse reactions have been rare. Virtual rock climbing can&#xD;
      also create anxiety in some children, especially if they suffer from vertigo. To check they&#xD;
      were happy with the experience of VR before their sessions start, children were provided with&#xD;
      a short 'test' session in the headset before parent and child agree to continue. Once the&#xD;
      trial is underway, we asked the participating children to let us know straight away if they&#xD;
      begin to feel uncomfortable or unwell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was monitored and audited in accordance with the Monitoring Standard Operating&#xD;
      Procedures of the Directorate of Research &amp; Innovation at Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust. All study related documents will be made available on request for monitoring and&#xD;
      audits by the Sponsor, the Health Research Authority and the relevant Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The study has been reviewed and approved by Sheffield Hallam&#xD;
      University Research Ethics Committee, NHS Research Ethics Committee, and the Research and&#xD;
      Development Dept. at Sheffield Children's Hospitals. The study was conducted in compliance&#xD;
      with a Research Ethics Committee favourable opinion, Health Research Authority approval and&#xD;
      Confirmation of Capacity &amp; Capability at all participating sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference for Harmonisation of&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social&#xD;
      Care (2nd Edition).&#xD;

    <description>The interviews try to reflect on their experience using IVR concerning technology acceptance, emotional affect, usability and future deployment. In particular the interviews focused on four main areas: (1) the attitudes towards the VR rehabilitation session (e.g., &quot;What did you like/dislike about the VR session compared to the normal therapy session?&quot;); (2) the perceived difficulty and pain levels (e.g., &quot;Compared to normal therapy sessions what was the pain you felt?&quot;); the system usability / acceptability (e.g., &quot;What is your overall impression regarding the VR rehabilitation?&quot;); and the future VR deployment (e.g., &quot;In the future, could you see this kind of therapy as a form of rehabilitation?&quot;).</description>

    <description>An Oculus Rift VR Headset and a set of Oculus Touch Controllers was used as interactivity device. Two scenarios of IVR rehabilitation game were offered to the patients: 1) Archery based on behind-the-neck overhead press, using a quiver on the user back to encourage bending their arm and firing the arrow to help with stretching exercises and 2) Climbing based on an overhead arm raise exercise.&#xD;
Each child will took part in a single IVR trial during their rehabilitation care with the physiotherapist, supported by IP, the games expert/researcher. Timing of participation was approximately 15 minutes of trial with each scenario of game. A short interview was conducted with each child and their parent (together) after each trial, and a focus group was conducted with the clinical staff.</description>
