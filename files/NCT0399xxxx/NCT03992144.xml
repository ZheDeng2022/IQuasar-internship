      Background: One of the commonest post-operative complications after tooth extraction is dry&#xD;
      socket; it can be defined as postoperative pain in and around the tooth extraction site,&#xD;
      which increases in severity at any time between 3rd to 5th post-operative days along with&#xD;
      disintegrated blood clot within the tooth extraction socket with or without halitosis. The&#xD;
      exact etiology is unclear therefor prevention remains the main beneficial therapy. Various&#xD;
      factors are thought to play an important role in etiology of dry socket including, anaerobes,&#xD;
      fibrinolysis, traumatic extractions, frequent spiting and rinsing, oral contraceptive pill&#xD;
      and smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous approaches have been tried for prevention of dry socket; include antiseptic&#xD;
      mouthwashes, anti-fibrinolytic agents, antibiotics, intra-socket dressings and medicated&#xD;
      packing into the extraction wound for example chlorohexidine mouthwashes, warm saline rinses,&#xD;
      gelatin sponges, occlusive dressings and oxidized cellulose sponge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study is to compare the role of single preoperative oral dose of metronidazole&#xD;
      with amoxicillin in hindrance of dry socket compared to conventional therapy after removal of&#xD;
      mandibular third molar of class 2 impaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To find out effective treatment for prevention of dry socket among preoperative&#xD;
      single oral dose of metronidazole and amoxicillin compared to conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A double blind randomized control trial in which patients requiring surgical&#xD;
      extraction of lower 3rd molar of class 2 impactions were selected for this study. Patients&#xD;
      were randomly divided into 3 groups, one of the groups had received single preoperative oral&#xD;
      dose of metronidazole one hour before extraction, second group was treated with single oral&#xD;
      dose of amoxicillin an hour before tooth extraction and third group was treated with&#xD;
      conventional therapy. Patients were asked to visit on 5th postoperative day or before it in&#xD;
      case the pain persist or reoccur.&#xD;

      Background Dry socket is one of the commonest problems that occur after extraction of molars.&#xD;
      It can be described as a painful inflammatory condition that occurs due to non-formation or&#xD;
      early displacement of a blood clot from a tooth extraction site before the healing of wound&#xD;
      occurs. Clinical presentation of dry socket is intense ache, bad breath, hollow socket due to&#xD;
      displacement of blood clot and exposure of bone. Pain produced by dry socket is known to last&#xD;
      from 7 to 14 days. Incidence of dry socket is approximately 3% for routine extractions and&#xD;
      can go beyond 30% for impacted lower third molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tooth impaction is a pathological condition in which a tooth fails to erupt to the occlusal&#xD;
      level of its normal position. Lower third molars are the most commonly impacted teeth. The&#xD;
      prevalence of third molar impaction ranges from 16.7% to 68.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple factors are associated with dry socket formation. such as patient's age, Gender,&#xD;
      extraction in posterior region of mouth, smoking status, oral contraceptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of dry socket perhaps lies somewhere from 5% to 20% worldwide.It ranges broadly&#xD;
      between 0.9% and 21% in United Kingdom and 3.5% in Siri-Lankan. Incidence of dry socket in&#xD;
      Pakistani population is reported 13.8%20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of dry socket after extraction of impacted third molars is about 25-30%33.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third molar is the most frequently impacted tooth and its prevalence ranges from 16.7% to&#xD;
      68.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Data collection was done from the patients requiring surgical extraction of&#xD;
      mandibular third molars class two impaction, at outpatient department of oral and&#xD;
      maxillofacial department of Dow university health sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After explaining&#xD;
      the purpose of the study and its associated benefits and risks, consent was obtained from the&#xD;
      patients. Patients were randomly divided into 3 groups. Ethical approval was obtained from&#xD;
      institutional review board of DUHS, Karachi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower 3rd molars with class 2 impaction, both genders, aged between 18 to 40 years were&#xD;
      included in the trail. Whereas smokers, alcoholic patients, pregnant and nursing mothers,&#xD;
      those taking anticoagulant, oral contraceptives, already taking antibiotics, with renal or&#xD;
      hepatic dysfunction, allergic to antibiotics and reluctant to participate were excluded from&#xD;
      the trail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients were operated by R2 postgraduate trainee of oral and maxillofacial&#xD;
      surgery department, under local anesthesia, inferior alveolar and long buccal nerves were&#xD;
      anesthetized. Incision was given, flap was elevated and osteotomy and/or tooth section was&#xD;
      done depending on the case. Round and fissured burs were used to remove the bone with low&#xD;
      speed micrometer straight hand piece. Normal saline was used as coolant and irrigating&#xD;
      solution. After extraction of the tooth, socket was irrigated and flushed with normal saline.&#xD;
      Sutures were given with 3-0 silk material and a roll of sanitized gauze was placed over the&#xD;
      extraction socket and patients were asked to bite on it for at least 40 minutes. prescribed.&#xD;
      Post-operative instructions were given to the patients both verbally as well as in written&#xD;
      form. On fifth post-operative day patients were examined with naked eye under the light of&#xD;
      dental unite. Those diagnosed with dry socket were treated with alveogel after irrigating and&#xD;
      flushing the socket with normal saline.&#xD;
