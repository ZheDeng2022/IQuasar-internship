  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even at the disease onset, about 70% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from&#xD;
      cognitive impairment that impacts quality of life. Currently, some speed processing tests are&#xD;
      used, such as SDMT ( symbol digit modalities test ), CSCT (information treatment speed&#xD;
      evaluation) and WAIS-IV (Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale ). Their inconvenient are the&#xD;
      improvement of scores in test-retest, and some difficulties doing the tests due to motor or&#xD;
      visual impairment that might be reported. The XO test is fast, cheap and easy to use during&#xD;
      medical consult by neurologists. It seems to be correlated to results of speed processing&#xD;
      tests, and probably to some executive functions tests too. Asthenia, anxiety, depression and&#xD;
      pain are likely to have a negative influence on tests results. Screening every patients with&#xD;
      a short test aims to detect patients with cognitive impairment earlier. After a positive&#xD;
      screening test, and to better characterize cognitive impairment, they will undergo a&#xD;
      neuropsychological test battery. Depending on the alteration, adapted workstation, financial&#xD;
      support, technical and human helps will be implemented in order to improve the daily-living&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to approve the XO as a screening test of cognitive impairment in MS patients.&#xD;
      We will study the relationship between XO test, and SDMT, CSCT, WAIS-IV, and also with&#xD;
      questionnaires about pain, asthenia (FSS, Fatigue Severity Scale), anxiety and depression&#xD;
      (HAD, Hospital Anxiety and Depression ). The XO test will be standardized using a healthy&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

      This study aims to approve the XO as a screening test of cognitive impairment in MS patients.&#xD;
      We will study the relationship between XO test, and SDMT, CSCT, WAIS-IV, and also with&#xD;
      questionnaires about pain, asthenia (FSS), anxiety and depression (HAD). The XO test will be&#xD;
      standardized using a healthy population. 140 multiple sclerosis patients (90 relapsing&#xD;
      remitting, and 50 progressive) and 400 healthy controls must be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple sclerosis patients included must :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be men or women aged 18 or more&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MacDonald criteria, 2017)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of relapse in the previous month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be mother-tongue French, or speaking French fluently&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be covered by French social security&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls included must :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be men or women aged 18 or more&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suffer from no pathology that might be incompatible with the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who can't be included :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients or controls declining participation to the study, or legally protected,&#xD;
           pregnant or breastfeeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients suffering from another neurological disease, psychiatric disorder, or&#xD;
           developmental abnormalities that were diagnosed before multiple sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with cranial trauma, relapse that ended less than 1 month before, or depression&#xD;
           in the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with severe motor or visual disabilities There are 4 centers. This is a&#xD;
           prospective cohort study, in which data will be collected during a single appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The score obtained doing XO test is the dependent variable that will be compared to the&#xD;
      variables due to speed processing and executive functions tests. Test-retest of XO test will&#xD;
      also be assessed. The percentage of wrong answers doing XO test will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is going to last 18 months. Every patient (140) and healthy control (400) will fill&#xD;
      in all the tests and questionnaires, except FSS (fatigue severity scale), in a random order&#xD;
      during a single appointment. The FSS will be filled in by patients only. All 400 healthy&#xD;
      controls will be divided in 20 groups of 20 people, due to gender, age (5 classes: 18-33,&#xD;
      34-43, 44-54, 55-64, and more than 65 years old), and level of education (graduated or not).&#xD;
      60 of them will undergo the XO test at the beginning and again at the end of the appointment&#xD;
      to investigate the test-retest effect.&#xD;
