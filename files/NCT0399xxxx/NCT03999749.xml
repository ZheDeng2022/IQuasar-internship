  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, single arm study. The study will consist of an assessment of&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of tocilizumab administered concurrently at 4 mg/kg every 6 weeks&#xD;
      for 5 doses in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab for four induction doses to week 12,&#xD;
      then maintenance nivolumab alone up to one year to patients with advanced melanoma. Treatment&#xD;
      will be divided into induction and maintenance phases. It is anticipated that this clinical&#xD;
      study will inform the use of this 3-drug combination for further phase II and/or phase III&#xD;
      clinical testing. The trial will include an assessment of the pharmacodynamic activity of&#xD;
      tocilizumab administered in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent&#xD;
             Ethics Committee (IEC)-approved written ICF in accordance with regulatory and&#xD;
             institutional guidelines. This must be obtained before the performance of any&#xD;
             protocol-related procedures that are not part of normal patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, tumor biopsies, and other requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be either Stage IIIb/c/d or Stage IV melanoma according to the&#xD;
             American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) (8th edition) and have&#xD;
             histologically-confirmed melanoma that is felt to be surgically unresectable in order&#xD;
             to be eligible. Please refer to the AJCC 8th edition Cancer Staging Manual for a&#xD;
             description of tumor, lymph node, metastasis, and staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All melanomas, except ocular/uveal melanoma, regardless of primary site of disease&#xD;
             will be allowed; mucosal melanomas are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received prior anticancer treatment for metastatic disease (for&#xD;
             example, but not limited to, systemic, local, radiation, radiopharmaceutical).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exceptions: Surgery for melanoma and/or post-resection brain radiotherapy (RT) if CNS&#xD;
             metastases and adjuvant RT for locoregional disease after resection and/or prior&#xD;
             treatment with adjuvant IFN-alpha, ipilimumab or nivolumab (as described in Exclusion&#xD;
             Criterion 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have their disease status documented by a complete physical&#xD;
             examination and imaging studies within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Imaging studies must include computerized tomography (CT) scan of chest, abdomen,&#xD;
             pelvis, and all known sites of resected disease in the setting of Stage IIIb/c/d or&#xD;
             Stage IV disease, and brain magnetic resonance imaging ([MRI]; brain CT is allowable&#xD;
             if MRI is contraindicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The complete set of baseline radiographic images must be available before treatment&#xD;
             initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor tissue from the resected site of disease must be provided for biomarker analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treated CNS metastases must be without MRI evidence of recurrence for at least 4&#xD;
             weeks after treatment. Patients must be off immunosuppressive doses of systemic&#xD;
             steroids (10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for at least 14 days prior to study drug&#xD;
             administration, and must have returned to neurologic baseline status postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The 4-week period of stability is measured after the completion of the neurologic&#xD;
             interventions (i.e., surgery and/or radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition to neurosurgery to treat CNS metastases, adjuvant radiation after the&#xD;
             resection of CNS metastasis is allowed. Immunosuppressive doses of systemic steroids&#xD;
             (doses &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) must be discontinued at least 14 days&#xD;
             before study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior surgery that required general anesthesia must be completed at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             before study drug administration. Surgery requiring local/epidural anesthesia must be&#xD;
             completed at least 72 hours before study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal labs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient Re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment of a patient that has&#xD;
             discontinued the study as a screen failure (i.e., patient has not been dosed/has not&#xD;
             been treated). If re-enrolled, the patient must be re-consented and satisfy all&#xD;
             eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             [hCG] hormone) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of&#xD;
             contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 5 half-lives of&#xD;
             study drug plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle). The half-life of nivolumab and&#xD;
             ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. WOCBP should therefore use an&#xD;
             adequate method to avoid pregnancy for a total of 23 weeks post treatment completion&#xD;
             (Section 4.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for&#xD;
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 5&#xD;
             half lives of the study drug (s) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover). The half&#xD;
             lives of nivolumab and ipilimumab are up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. Men&#xD;
             should therefore use an adequate method of contraception for a total of 31 weeks post&#xD;
             treatment completion (Section 4.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt&#xD;
             from contraceptive requirements. However, they must still undergo pregnancy testing as&#xD;
             described in this section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with carcinomatosis meningitis or a history of current ocular/uveal melanoma&#xD;
             are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous nonmelanoma malignancies are excluded unless a complete&#xD;
             resection or remission was achieved at least 2 years prior to study entry and no&#xD;
             additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period&#xD;
             (exceptions include, but are not limited to, nonmelanoma skin cancers, in situ bladder&#xD;
             cancer, in situ gastric cancer or gastrointestinal stromal tumor, in situ colon&#xD;
             cancers, in situ cervical cancers/dysplasia, or breast carcinoma in situ).&#xD;

             alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment are permitted to enroll. For any cases of&#xD;
             uncertainty, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator be consulted prior to&#xD;
             signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;&#xD;
             10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14&#xD;
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids are permitted in the&#xD;
             absence of active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy for melanoma with the following exceptions which are allowed: 1) surgery&#xD;

             biotherapy, limb perfusion) that is administered after a prior complete resection&#xD;
             other than adjuvant radiation after neurosurgical resection or resection of&#xD;

             or the need for treatment with medications known or suspected of producing prolonged&#xD;
             QTc intervals on electrocardiogram (ECG).&#xD;
