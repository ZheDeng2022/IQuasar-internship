  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacteremia is defined as pathogenic bacteria presence in blood as evidenced by positive blood&#xD;
      cultures. These bacteremia have significant consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      (ref. 1,2,3). They can lead to a state of septic shock that is life-threatening for the&#xD;
      patient and must be treated as a matter of urgency. Any delay in treatment is detrimental to&#xD;
      the patient. Management is based on prescription of probabilistic antibiotic therapy as soon&#xD;
      as bacteremia is suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint Joseph (GHPSJ), as soon as a blood culture is known to&#xD;
      be positive, the Mobile Clinical Microbiology Unit (UMMC) is notified in real time. The UMMC&#xD;
      infectiologist, in consultation with the microbiologist, evaluates microbiological data and&#xD;
      compares them with clinical data in order to prescribe probabilistic antibiotic therapy in&#xD;
      the patient's bed. The possible adaptation of antibiotic treatment then depends on the&#xD;
      results of antibiotic susceptibility test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early adaptation of antibiotic treatment to antibiotic susceptibility data, to reassess&#xD;
      ineffective treatment or to reduce antibiotic therapy spectrum, significantly improves&#xD;
      patient prognosis: it is therefore important that the laboratory makes antibiotic&#xD;
      susceptibility test results available to the clinician as early as possible.&#xD;

      The standard method based on diffusion on agar medium on conventional CBM allows antibiotic&#xD;
      susceptibility results the test to be rendered within 24 hours. Many so-called rapid methods&#xD;
      (Accelerate PhenoTM system, VITEK 2 Rapid Identification and Susceptibility Testing&#xD;
      System,...) have been developed to improve antibiotic susceptibility testing speed from&#xD;
      positive blood cultures. However, these approaches are costly and not exhaustive in terms of&#xD;
      antibiotic panels tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mueller-Hinton Rapid-SIR (MHR-SIR) i2a medium has been developed. It is an agar medium&#xD;
      allowing an early reading of antibiotic susceptibility test due to contrasting agents&#xD;
      presence in culture medium which facilitates antibiotic susceptibility test results reading&#xD;
      in less than 8 hours on a majority of fast-growing bacteria, in particular Enterobacteriaceae&#xD;
      and golden staphylococci.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective evaluation of the Mueller-Hinton Rapid-SIR (MHR-SIR) medium's performance&#xD;
      directly from blood cultures was conducted in GHPSJ laboratory and published in 2018 with&#xD;
      very satisfactory results obtained in less than 8 hours with a correlation &gt; 97% compared to&#xD;
      the standard MH method (Results published in DMID ref.5) at a very moderate cost of 5 euros&#xD;
      for 16 antibiotics in free choice; The additional cost compared to the traditional MH is 20%&#xD;
      or 0.4 euros per agar. In view of excellent results of the study, this technique has replaced&#xD;
      the traditional MH technique in GHPSJ laboratory since January 2017, allowing UMMC to propose&#xD;
      more quickly adaptations of probabilistic antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the MHR-SIR medium has never been evaluated in a clinical context. The objective&#xD;
      of this pioneering study is to routinely evaluate the rendering clinical impact of the rapid&#xD;
      antibiotic susceptibility test MHR-SIR (i2a) after 8 hours of incubation directly from the&#xD;
      blood cultures.&#xD;
