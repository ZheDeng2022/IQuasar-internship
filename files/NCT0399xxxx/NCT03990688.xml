  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AK3280 is being developed to further improve the long-term efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      treatment options for patients with fibrotic disorders.This study will evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      AK3280 treatment on renal function and safety, and the PK of AK3280 compared with placebo in&#xD;
