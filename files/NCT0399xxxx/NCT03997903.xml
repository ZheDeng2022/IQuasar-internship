  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, the investigators propose to evaluate the biochemical effects of imatinib&#xD;
      on sickle red blood cells (RBCs). Patients will be administered imatinib mesylate orally&#xD;
      following the guidelines previously established for use of imatinib in other disorders. The&#xD;
      biochemical effects of imatinib on sickle RBCs will be examined, including changes in their&#xD;
      levels of band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation and the abundances of RBC-derived microparticles in&#xD;
      their blood. In addition, the patients will be monitored for symptoms of sickle cell disease&#xD;
      (SCD). The investigators expect band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation to decrease dramatically in&#xD;
      patients treated with imatinib. The investigators also anticipate a reduction in the numbers&#xD;
      of RBC-derived microparticles in circulation (quantitated by assaying the number of&#xD;
      glycophorin A positive microparticles in peripheral blood samples by flow cytometry. Most&#xD;
      importantly, the investigators expect to see a reduction in the frequency of vaso-occlusive&#xD;
      crises, and possibly acute chest syndrome and utilization of opioids. The study duration is&#xD;
      planned as 6 months in order to provide adequate time for potential change in the primary&#xD;
      endpoints (e.g. percent irreversibly sickled cells).&#xD;
