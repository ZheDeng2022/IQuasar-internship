  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an eye tracking impairment sensor can detect&#xD;
      cannabis-induced impairment after using cannabis.The overall objective is to correlate&#xD;
      measures collected from the eye tracking sensor with measures related to cannabis impairment&#xD;
      (e.g., plasma THC levels, self-reported cannabis subjective effects, cognitive effects).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a single-visit clinical laboratory study to evaluate the initial&#xD;
      efficacy of an eye tracking sensor to detect cannabis-related impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be experienced but not frequent cannabis users without evidence of heavy&#xD;
      alcohol or illicit drug use or other physical or mental health illness. Participants will&#xD;
      come in for one screening visit, and those who consent, are eligible, and enroll will&#xD;
      complete one experimental laboratory session involving smoking of 50% of 1 active&#xD;
      (approximately 4.0% THC) cannabis cigarette. Assessments will be collected after-cannabis&#xD;
      smoking up to 4 hours. Participants will be sent home from the laboratory via taxi.&#xD;
