      A Phase 2, Pilot Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Fostamatinib in the Treatment of&#xD;
      Chronic Active Antibody Mediated Rejection in Renal Transplantation&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The commonest cause of renal transplant failure worldwide is rejection, a process whereby the&#xD;
      recipient's immune system recognises the transplant kidney as foreign and attacks it. One&#xD;
      common form of rejection is due to the recipient developing antibodies against their kidney&#xD;
      transplant. Spleen tyrosine kinase is a molecule present in immune cells which is important&#xD;
      in the process of antibody mediated damage. Fostamatinib is a drug which inhibits spleen&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will recruit 10 patients who have a renal transplant and a diagnosis of&#xD;
      antibody mediated rejection. Patients will be given Fostamatinib for 12 months and will&#xD;
      undergo a renal biopsy at 6 months and at a 12 months in order to determine whether the&#xD;
      histological signs of antibody mediated rejection have either improved or not progressed.&#xD;

    <measure>Concentration of Protein in urine</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Level of proteinuria will be assessed by collected a urine samples which will be sent to the clinical laboratory and the protein/creatinine ratio will be calculated. The normal value of the protein/creatinine ratio should be &lt;10, anything higher than this indicated that the kidney is &quot;leaky&quot; and functioning abnormally. Levels of proteinuria will be compared pre and post treatment</description>

    <measure>eGFR ( Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) assessed by a blood test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>GFR is Glomerular Filtration Rate and it is a key indicator of renal function. The normal eGFR is 60 or more. If your eGFR is less than 60 for three months or more, your kidneys may not be working well. Th eGFR of participants will be compared pre and post treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Donor specific antibody levels</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of donor specific antibody present will be compared pre and post treatment. Each participant will have their Donor specific antibodies measured at baseline pre treatment, this specific antibody or antibodies will be re-measured post treatment and the level (MFI) of the antibody/antibodies will be compared to pre treatment levels.</description>
