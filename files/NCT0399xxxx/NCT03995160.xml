  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study will be to compare functional outcomes, basic morphology results, number&#xD;
      of blood transfusions, costs of hospitalization, and inflammation factors, following total&#xD;
      knee replacement (with use of one type of endoprosthesis) comparing use of closed suction&#xD;
      drainage (CSD). Use of closed suction drainage may have influence on patients functional&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary knee osteoarthritis will be included in a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      and assigned to total knee arthroplasty with or without closed suction drainage. Subjects&#xD;
      will be evaluated preoperatively, 1-day, 3-, 6- and 12-month postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in morphology results will be measured by comparing preoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      levels of haematocrite, haemoglobin, erythrocytes, and platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in the number of blood transfusions will be measured by analyzing the number of needed&#xD;
      transfusion of packed red blood cells in the postoperative period during stay in the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in levels of inflammation factors will be measured by analyzing the level of&#xD;
      C-reactive protein in first and third day postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in body temperature wille be measured daily by analyzing body temperature from day of&#xD;
      the surgery until the day of discharge from the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of haematoma will be evaluated daily in the postoperative period by clinical&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in Western Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Score&#xD;
      will be measured from baseline (can be measured anytime to a maximum of one month before&#xD;
      surgery) 3,6 and 12 months post-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in Western Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Function&#xD;
      Score will be measured from baseline (can be measured anytime to a maximum of one month&#xD;
      before surgery) 3,6 and 12 months post-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs of hospitalization will be measured by comparing cost of hospitalization between two&#xD;
      analyzed groups&#xD;
