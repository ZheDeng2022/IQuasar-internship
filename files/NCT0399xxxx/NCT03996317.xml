  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperoxygenation for resuscitation of abnormal fetal heart rate tracings has been routine&#xD;
      obstetric practice. However, there have not been any studies to support this practice. Recent&#xD;
      literature have either found no associated benefit to intrapartum maternal oxygen&#xD;
      administration, or in a number of studies demonstrated higher risk of neonatal complications.&#xD;
      Despite these studies, the evidences have not been adequate to change the clinical practice&#xD;
      because the majority of these studies either focused on biological differences rather than&#xD;
      clinical outcomes data or were retrospective rather than randomized trials. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators propose a large single center randomized clinical trial to determine the&#xD;
      effects of maternal hyperoxygenation therapy for the treatment of fetal heart rate tracing&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous fetal heart rate tracing is part of the standard practice during intrapartum&#xD;
      obstetric management. The goal of fetal heart rate monitoring is to identify early signs of&#xD;
      fetal distress during labor, initiate effective interventions to improve fetal outcomes and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of cesarean and operative vaginal delivery, and when interventions fail to&#xD;
      improve the fetal status, to help guide the decision to proceed with operative delivery in&#xD;
      order to minimize fetal/neonatal morbidity as a result of fetal intolerance to labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four major components to fetal heart tracing that guide obstetric management:&#xD;
      baseline, variability, acceleration, and deceleration (uterine contraction pattern is also&#xD;
      assessed to guide management). When one or more of these components are outside of normal&#xD;
      values, it may be associated with fetal hypoxemia/acidemia. The typical management of these&#xD;
      abnormal findings include maternal reposition, IV fluid bolus, increase maternal blood&#xD;
      pressure, stopping uterine contractions, amnioinfusion, and maternal oxygen. The goal of&#xD;
      therapy is to increase maternal blood flow to the uterus and therefore improve&#xD;
      maternal-placental perfusion, increase oxygen delivery to and carbon dioxide removal from the&#xD;
      fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal oxygenation is part of the standard management of fetal tracing abnormalities&#xD;
      nationwide, and is part of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)&#xD;
      guideline for this specific indication. Its use intuitively make sense, as one of the major&#xD;
      concerns with fetal tracing abnormalities is the development of fetal hypoxemia leading to&#xD;
      anaerobic metabolism and the ensuing development of metabolic acidosis. However, clinical&#xD;
      evidence to support its use is lacking. This is partly due to the long-ingrained culture of&#xD;
      routine oxygen delivery on Labor and Delivery across the country, therefore no clinical&#xD;
      trails were considered until recently. More importantly, from a physiologic standpoint, the&#xD;
      fetal hemoglobin has significantly higher oxygen affinity compared to adult hemoglobin.&#xD;
      Therefore, increasing maternal oxygen saturation does not lead to significant change in fetal&#xD;
      oxygen saturation in general. In addition, some of the reasons for the development of fetal&#xD;
      hypoxemia and acidemia are due to placental insufficiency or umbilical cord compression. In&#xD;
      these circumstances, there is limited oxygen delivery in the fetal circulation at the&#xD;
      maternal-fetal interface and therefore maternal oxygen therapy will have limited effects on&#xD;
      fetal oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is growing concern regarding the potential risks associated with&#xD;
      supraphysiologic oxygen levels. At a cellular level, hyperoxygenation increased the&#xD;
      production of oxygen free radicals, which results in cell damage. This is reflected in the&#xD;
      neonatal literature regarding hyperoxygenation during neonatal resuscitation, including&#xD;
      higher risk for respiratory and neurologic complications, the American Academy of Pediatrics&#xD;
      (AAP) no longer recommend initial neonatal hyperoxygenation during resuscitation. There are&#xD;
      similar concerns in oxygen use during obstetric management in recent literature. A number of&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated higher risk of neonatal complications associated with maternal&#xD;
      intrapartum hyperoxygenation (3-6). However, the evidences have not been adequate to change&#xD;
      the clinical practice because the majority of these studies either focused on biological&#xD;
      differences rather than clinical outcomes data or were retrospective rather than randomized&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the ingrained nature of maternal oxygen therapy, the lack of clinical evidence in favor&#xD;
      of its use, and concerns regarding potential harm, large scale clinical trials are needed to&#xD;
      assess the risks and benefits of the current standard practice. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      propose a large single center randomized clinical trial to determine the effects of maternal&#xD;
      hyperoxygenation therapy for the treatment of fetal heart rate tracing abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial interventions include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal heart rate abnormalities include one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent decelerations: more than 2 in a 20 minute period Minimal or absent variability&#xD;
      Fetal bradycardia Fetal tachycardia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine fetal resuscitation measures will be taken for fetal heart rate abnormalities at the&#xD;
      discretion of the obstetric team. These may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal repositioning IV fluid bolus Anesthesiology management of hypotension Stopping&#xD;
      oxytocin infusion Administering Terbutalin Amnioinfusion Operative vaginal delivery Cesarean&#xD;
      delivery In addition to above management options, patient will be assigned to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms through computerized randomization Treatment arm 1 Routine labor management at&#xD;
      the discretion of the obstetric team Maternal oxygenation with 10L non-rebreather mask will&#xD;
      be given with any above fetal heart rate abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal oxygenation is discontinued at the resolution of fetal tracing abnormality or after&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment arm 2 Routine labor management at the discretion of the obstetric team Maternal&#xD;
      oxygenation is withheld unless indicated for maternal pulse oximetry is less than 92%&#xD;
