  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients seen with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) that have failed conservative treatments&#xD;
      will be offered to participate in a sham controlled RCT of outpatient therapy with the Fotona&#xD;
      Smooth Erbium Yag laser. Patients will be randomised to either outpatient laser treatments or&#xD;
      sham treatments. Patients will be blinded to which arm they have been randomised. Patients&#xD;
      will be asked to complete appropriate relevant symptom and quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
      prior to treatment and then at 6 and 12 months following the final treatment. At 6 months&#xD;
      Sham patients will be un-blinded and offered the laser therapy if they wish.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with urodynamically proven SUI, who have failed/declined conservative therapies&#xD;
      and their history suggests mild to moderate SUI, will be informed about the study and&#xD;
      consented if they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be invited to attend a screening visit. At this visit, they will be asked to&#xD;
      perform a standardised 1 hour pad test. Their medical history will be checked and they will&#xD;
      undergo a clinical and vaginal examination, pregnancy test and dip stick urinalysis.If their&#xD;
      1 hour pad weight is &gt;2g and &lt;25g and they meet all other inclusion / exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      they will be eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Baseline visit, the patient will have medical history confirmed, and be asked to&#xD;
      complete a standing and supine (lying) cough test. They will be given the International&#xD;
      Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and Pelvic Organ&#xD;
      Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire (PISQ-12) questionnaire. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomised using a computer randomisation programme and blinded to their allocated&#xD;
      arm: active treatment or sham treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo 3 outpatient treatment visits. The timing of visits will be 1&#xD;
      month apart. At each visit they will be asked if they have any further questions and if they&#xD;
      are happy to continue to participate in the study. If happy to participate, they will have&#xD;
      their urine tested for infection (dipstick urinalysis) and pregnancy test at each treatment&#xD;
      appointment. If urinalysis is negative, they will receive an outpatient Incontilase laser&#xD;
      treatment. At each of their 3 outpatient appointments, they will be asked about any&#xD;
      deleterious effects since their last appointment and asked to complete an ICIQ-SF and Patient&#xD;
      Global Impression of Improvement questionnaire (treatment 2 onwards). Patients will receive 3&#xD;
      treatments in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to attend a follow up visits 6 &amp; 12 months after the 3rd treatment&#xD;
      and asked to complete ICIQ-SF, PISQ-12 and PGI-I symptom questionnaires and undergo a&#xD;
      clinical examination. They will be asked to perform a cough test supine (lying) and standing&#xD;
      and at 6 and 12 months also perform a 1 hour pad test as described earlier (see appendices).&#xD;
      Patients randomised to the Sham arm will be un-blinded at 6 months and offered the treatment&#xD;
      if they wish and followed up for six months.&#xD;
