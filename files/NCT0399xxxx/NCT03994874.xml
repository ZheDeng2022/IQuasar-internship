  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, unblinded, adaptive design clinical trial to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of PolyCore (Polydextrin, L-Carnitine, D-xylitol) peritoneal ultrafiltration (PUF)&#xD;
      in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include adults HFrEF patients, that despite guidelines directed medical&#xD;
      therapy still retain a congestive heart failure (HF) picture. During the study, patients&#xD;
      should remain on their prescribed heart failure medications and the same dosing schedule for&#xD;
      the duration of the study unless investigators determine medically necessary to change.&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned randomly to receive either PolyCore PUF (over the top of their&#xD;
      prescribed heart failure medications), for 6 months, or to the control arm receiving stable&#xD;
      medical therapy according to international guidelines and comprehensive of loop diuretic&#xD;
      (furosemide) dose till to 2.5mg/kg/day, without PUF therapy. The PUF ultrafiltration will be&#xD;
      performed with a single nightly exchange, with 2 liters PolyCore solution, lasting 12-14&#xD;
      hours, for 6 months. An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be convened for&#xD;
      this study and will review the results of the trial at regular intervals to protect patients&#xD;
      participating in the study. An adaptive interim analysis will be performed when in each group&#xD;
      20 patients have completed 6 months in the study, for analysis of the primary outcome. The&#xD;
      purpose of the adaptive interim analysis is to calculate the final study sample size.The DSMB&#xD;
      will closely examine the interim primary efficacy results, respecting the confidentiality and&#xD;
      integrity of data, to investigate the final sample sizes necessary to complete the study.&#xD;
