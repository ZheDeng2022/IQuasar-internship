  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee replacement (TKR) is a bony and soft-tissue procedure and much attention has been&#xD;
      given to the alignment of the components, which is relatively easy to quantify. Recently,&#xD;
      substantial healthcare resources have been devoted to the development and use of computer&#xD;
      navigation and patient-specific instrumentation systems that achieve neutral mechanical&#xD;
      alignment. However the conventional assumption that mechanically aligned TKR leads to the&#xD;
      best implant survival has been brought into doubt. Although mechanically aligned TKR improves&#xD;
      function, 20 % of patients remain dissatisfied according to reports from Canada, England and&#xD;
      Wales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to improve patient satisfaction recent developments have included the&#xD;
      individualization of component alignment with the goal of achieving pre-arthritic alignment&#xD;
      through restoration of the axes of rotation, a technique called kinematic alignment (KA). The&#xD;
      outcomes of kinematic alignment have been assessed in case series but so far only one&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) [Digital Object Identifier&#xD;
      (DOI)10.1302/0301-620X.96B7.32812 Published 1 July 2014] undertaken in the USA has compared&#xD;
      the clinical results of kinematic alignment using patient-specific instruments with the&#xD;
      traditional technique of mechanical alignment, demonstrating a substantial benefit in&#xD;
      postoperative patient pain relief and function. Therefore, for direct comparison between&#xD;
      kinematic aligned and mechanically aligned surgical techniques for total knee replacement,&#xD;
      the investigators would like to undertake a pilot study prior to a larger RCT and recruit a&#xD;
      cohort of 15 patients undergoing kinematical aligned TKR. The investigators will use the same&#xD;
      device as was used in a previous mechanically aligned study undertaken at our hospital (REC&#xD;
      ref: 12/NE/0293 Attune, DePuy, Warsaw IN, in 35 patients based on the same eligibility&#xD;
      criteria who will act as controls), which will allow the opportunity to estimate the standard&#xD;
      deviation in the control arm in preparation for the larger RCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to be able to undertake a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the efficacy&#xD;
      of kinematic alignment versus conventional mechanical alignment for total knee replacement a&#xD;
      robust assessment of the expected standard deviation of the primary outcome measure (Oxford&#xD;
      Knee Score [OKS]) in both arms of the proposed RCT must be undertaken, hence this pilot&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether there are improved postoperative outcomes in the investigative arm using&#xD;
      the following patient reported outcomes: Knee Implant Performance (PKIP - pre and post&#xD;
      surgical), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Knee Society Score (KSS),&#xD;
      Knee Noise and Front of Knee Pain Score and Quality of Life score EQ-5D which will be&#xD;
      completed at baseline(pre-operatively) and post-operatively at 6 weeks (normal clinical&#xD;
      follow up), 1 year (normal clinical follow up) and 2 years. In addition, x-rays of the knee&#xD;
      (AP, lateral &amp; skyline) will be taken at the same time. These outcomes are identical to the&#xD;
      data collected in the previous mechanically aligned study which will be used as the control&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much attention has been given to the alignment of the components in total knee replacement&#xD;
      (TKR) and this is relatively easy to quantify, particularly in the coronal plane. However,&#xD;
      due to the development and use of computer navigation and patient-specific instrumentation&#xD;
      systems that achieve neutral mechanical alignment, the conventional assumption that&#xD;
      mechanically aligned TKR leads to the best implant survival has been brought into doubt.&#xD;
      Although mechanically aligned TKR improves function, 20 % of patients remain dissatisfied&#xD;
      according to reports from Canada, England and Wales. The relationship between in-range and&#xD;
      varus (turned inward toward the mid line of the body to an abnormal degree) and valgus&#xD;
      (turned outward) outlier categories of the limb and implant survival of a primary total knee&#xD;
      replacement is weak at 15 years. Leaving a limb, knee, or tibial component within a natural&#xD;
      range of varus does not reduce implant survival at 3, 5, 7, and 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development of individualization of component alignment and the goal of achieving&#xD;
      pre-arthritic alignment through restoration of the axes of rotation, the kinematic alignment&#xD;
      technique has shown in case series and one RCT in the USA a substantial benefit in&#xD;
      postoperative patient pain relief and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For direct comparison between kinematic aligned and mechanically aligned surgical techniques&#xD;
      for total knee replacement, the investigators will conduct a pilot study prior to a larger&#xD;
      RCT and recruit a cohort of 15 patients undergoing kinematic aligned TKR. The investigators&#xD;
      will use the same device as was used in a previous mechanically aligned study undertaken at&#xD;
      our hospital (REC ref: 12/NE/0293 Attune, DePuy, Warsaw IN, in 35 patients based on the same&#xD;
      eligibility criteria who will act as controls), which will allow the opportunity to estimate&#xD;
      the standard deviation in the control arm in preparation for the larger RCT.&#xD;
