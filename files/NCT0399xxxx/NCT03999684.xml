  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is studying how safe and effective all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), is to treat&#xD;
      advanced adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)&#xD;
      for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to see how effective all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is in&#xD;
      treating tumor. Other reasons for conducting the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine for how long all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) may reduce the size or slow&#xD;
           down the growth of tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released in the bloodstream as an&#xD;
           indication of the disease activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To better understand mechanisms of tumor resistance to ATRA&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma with evidence&#xD;
             of recurrent, metastatic or advanced, unresectable disease that is not amenable to&#xD;
             curative surgery with or without radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have at least one RECIST v1.1 measurable non-CNS based lesion, as&#xD;
             defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one&#xD;
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for&#xD;
             nodal lesions) equal to or greater than 1 cm with CT scans or MR imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to undergo fresh tissue core needle biopsy prior to study&#xD;
             registration and repeat tumor biopsy while on study for correlatives. Willingness to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic therapy: At least 2 weeks must have elapsed since the end of prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy, biological agents (4 weeks for anti-cancer monoclonal antibody&#xD;
             containing regimens) or any investigational drug product, with adequate recovery of&#xD;
             treatment-related toxicity to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 grade ≤ 1 (or tolerable grade 2)&#xD;
             or back to baseline (except for alopecia or neuropathy). Any number of prior therapies&#xD;
             for recurrent/metastatic ACC are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;

          -  Participants must have documentation of a new or progressive lesion on a radiologic&#xD;
             imaging study performed within 12 months prior to study registration (progression of&#xD;
             disease over any interval is allowed) and/or new or worsening disease-related symptoms&#xD;
             within 12 months prior to study registration. This assessment is performed by the&#xD;
             treating investigator. Evidence of progression by RECIST v1.1 criteria is not&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below (within 14&#xD;
             days prior to study registration):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL without transfusion within 7 days of treatment&#xD;

               -  creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above 1.5x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  coagulation profile INR ≤ 1.5x ULN unless the participant is receiving an&#xD;
                  anticoagulant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  triglyceride level &lt; 500 mg/dL or &lt; 5.7 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  cholesterol level &lt; 400 mg/dL or &lt; 10.34 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline tumor measurements must be documented from imaging within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             study registration. Other non-laboratory tests must be performed within 28 days prior&#xD;
             to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study registration. Female subjects of childbearing&#xD;
             potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test repeated within 72&#xD;
             hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is&#xD;
             positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female and male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate&#xD;
             method of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after&#xD;
             completion of tretinoin administration. Contraception is required before starting the&#xD;
             first dose of study medication through 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and&#xD;
             preferred contraception for the subject. There is a significant risk of fetal&#xD;
             malformation if pregnancy occurs while on tretinoin at any dose level, even if for&#xD;
             short exposure periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic disease impinging on the spinal cord or threatening spinal cord&#xD;
             compression. Patients that have had previous treatment of disease with impinging on&#xD;
             the cord with either surgery or radiotherapy with clinical or radiographic evidence of&#xD;
             response or stability are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may&#xD;
             participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for&#xD;
             at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment), and have no evidence&#xD;
             of new or enlarging brain metastases. This exception does not include carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability, because of their poor&#xD;
             prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would&#xD;
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent administration of other cancer specific therapy or investigational agents&#xD;
             during the course of this study is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant, or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father&#xD;
             children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening&#xD;
             or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. Pregnant&#xD;
             women are excluded from this study because tretinoin has the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated on this protocol. Women who could potentially become pregnant while undergoing&#xD;
             treatment on this protocol must be willing to use 2 methods of contraception.&#xD;
