  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this university study is to evaluate the use of an advanced dental sedation&#xD;
      technique involving two syringe-type pumps called Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) pumps. Two&#xD;
      oral surgeons and a general dentist from New Zealand are assisting a Canadian research team&#xD;
      as they study this intravenous sedation technique and its use in dental offices. This&#xD;
      sedation technique is broadly used in other parts of the world and is known to reduce anxiety&#xD;
      and discomfort during dental or medical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The New Zealand Dental Council and Health Canada have approved the drugs involved and the TCI&#xD;
      pumps. In this study, one pump will be used to administer a sedative drug called propofol and&#xD;
      the other to administer a pain-relief analgesic drug called remifentanil. The pumps and drugs&#xD;
      are licensed in New Zealand and Canada and are not experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These pumps are operated by special software modules that are specific to each drug, and a&#xD;
      computer within the pump controls the pump operation allowing a stable and constant level of&#xD;
      drug in the blood stream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your oral surgeon or dentist will titrate or add small amounts of drug till the you are quite&#xD;
      relaxed before proceeding with your dental treatment. The dentist has overall control of the&#xD;
      pump and the amount of drug given and can change the amount if it is too little or too much&#xD;
      for you, or completely stop the pump if necessary for safety..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TCI sedation, including your dental treatment will be conducted by two oral surgeons and&#xD;
      a general dentist in their respective New Zealand dental offices. Each clinician is well&#xD;
      trained and experienced with this form of sedation.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate (conscious) sedation is a common pharmacological approach to managing psychological&#xD;
      anxiety and physical pain associated with dental procedures including surgery. While&#xD;
      maintaining patient responsiveness to verbal and tactile stimuli, safety of conducting&#xD;
      moderate sedation in dental clinic is well documented with infrequent complications.&#xD;
      Preferred drug choices for administering moderate intravenous (i.v.) sedation are midazolam&#xD;
      (benzodiazepine sedative) and fentanyl (opioid analgesic) because their safety and efficacy&#xD;
      have been well established and are currently considered the Standard of Care (SoC) worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of drugs intended for general anesthesia to provide moderate (conscious) sedation is&#xD;
      increasingly being considered for dental sedation as there are a number of benefits when&#xD;
      compared to the SoC. For example, propofol has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and&#xD;
      absence of lingering side-effects; drugs (propofol and remifentanil) with fast onset and&#xD;
      offset times are most useful for balancing adequate hypnosis/analgesia with rapid recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical research study will explore the potential benefits of controlled administration&#xD;
      of propofol (hypnotic agent) and remifentanil (opioid analgesic agent) utilizing two Target&#xD;
      Controlled Infusion (TCI) pumps for moderate i.v. sedation by a sedationist/operator in a&#xD;
      dental office-based environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized care for moderate (conscious) sedation is guided by the following principle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs and techniques used to provide moderate (conscious) sedation for dental treatment&#xD;
      should carry a margin of safety wide enough to render loss of consciousness unlikely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of sedation must be such that the patient remains conscious and is able to both&#xD;
      understand and respond to verbal commands either alone or accompanied by light tactile&#xD;
      stimulus; Modified Ramsay Sedation score of 3 or 4 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current SoC for i.v. dental sedation in Canada and New Zealand is the administration of a&#xD;
      single benzodiazepine agent alone or in combination with an opioid analgesic agent to achieve&#xD;
      moderate or conscious sedation whereby the patient responds to voice or light tough stimulus&#xD;
      throughout the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to explore the advantages/disadvantages and risks/benefits of&#xD;
      TCI interventional sedation technique in an dental office-based environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasingly, the controlled use of propofol and remifentanil utilizing pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      programmed syringe pumps called Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) pump are being considered as&#xD;
      an alternative option for dental sedation for the operator/sedationist and their sedation&#xD;
      team. Is this sedation technique a viable option to the SoC?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the TCI system, specific pharmacokinetic algorithms have been developed for each drug,&#xD;
      accounting for drug distribution, elimination, and metabolism, thus providing a stable,&#xD;
      constant concentration of drug at the plasma (blood) or brain level. The drugs used are short&#xD;
      acting, thus the clinician can quickly titrate the drugs to the desired sedative effect and&#xD;
      if necessary can incrementally increase or decrease the drug's sedative/analgesic effect to&#xD;
      meet patient's needs and procedural stimulus. In sum, the short-acting nature of the drugs,&#xD;
      combined with a specified delivery algorithm have the potential in allowing better patient&#xD;
      care in dental office setting through adapting dosage to patient needs, thus allowing better&#xD;
      control, a shorter recovery time with early home readiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequacy of procedural sedation depends on the maintenance of brain propofol and remifentanil&#xD;
      concentrations which are clinically appropriate and in equilibrium with levels in the plasma.&#xD;
      The best way to achieve this state is from TCI dedicated pharmacokinetic pumps. These devices&#xD;
      solve the complex equations which describe the distribution of agents between compartments&#xD;
      and allow for rapid adjustments in targets to achieve the desired clinical effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Canada has approved the use of propofol and remifentanil for on-label use for dental&#xD;
      sedation and anesthesia, and has approved the Alaris PK infusion pump with TCI for use in&#xD;
      Canada. New Zealand Dental Council has also approved and permitted propofol and remifentanil&#xD;
      and the Alaris PK infusion pump for dental sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologist's Moderate Sedation Guidelines 2018 provides guidance&#xD;
      and recommendations that include sedative/analgesic medications intended for general&#xD;
      anesthesia (propofol and remifentanil) can also be safely administered for moderate sedation&#xD;
      across health professions and environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A published research study exploring the use of TCI pump technology in medicine to the year&#xD;
      2015, conservatively estimated the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use worldwide &gt;90 countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TCI pump sales &gt;60,000 units.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anesthesia and sedation &gt;20 million administrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Commercial usage of TCI process &gt;2 decades in clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Lobb is unaware of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any dentist/dental specialist in Canada using propofol and remifentanil with TCI&#xD;
           technology for moderate sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any dental college in Canada that has issued a permit to use propofol and remifentanil&#xD;
           with TCI technology for moderate sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Canadian university involved in clinical research using propofol and remifentanil&#xD;
           with TCI technology for dental sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, to advance important and relevant Canadian clinical research in the administration of&#xD;
      propofol and remifentanil with TCI pumps for sedation dentistry, Dr. Lobb has invited dental&#xD;
      experts outside of Canada to partner with a research team from the University of Alberta. The&#xD;
      following reasons justifies this rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral surgeons in New Zealand have been world leaders in the use of TCI sedation in dentistry&#xD;
      for over a decade. The two pump TCI sedation process has become a Standard of Care in a&#xD;
      number of dentist/dental specialist offices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The New Zealand dental group licensed to administer propofol and remifentanil with TCI pump&#xD;
      technology includes oral surgeons, oral and maxillofacial surgeons and general dentists,&#xD;
      with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &gt;10 years' experience with TCI sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &gt;40,000 collective administrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two New Zealand oral surgeons and a general dentist have consented to participate in&#xD;
           this clinical research study. All three are experienced TCI sedation practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical phase of this research study will be completed within their respective&#xD;
           dental practice facilities in New Zealand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  he population numbers and demographic profile of New Zealand is quite similar to&#xD;
           Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The type of dental surgery and general dentistry performed in New Zealand is similar in&#xD;
           scope to that practiced by Alberta dental practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the research is to validate a sedation technique that is proposed to&#xD;
      be more controllable and less intrusive to patients. Specifically, in this prospective pilot&#xD;
      study, we seek to determine the safety, effectiveness, and comparability of the controlled&#xD;
      administration of propofol and remifentanil utilizing two TCI syringe pumps for moderate&#xD;
      sedation in dentistry through establishing, identifying, and refining a study protocol in&#xD;
      this pilot study in preparation for a larger study, or a replication study in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods/Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, pilot study, with the TCI sedation and clinical component of the study&#xD;
      being completed by two oral surgeons and one general dentist in New Zealand. The rationale&#xD;
      for having the sedation and clinical treatment performed in New Zealand is there are no&#xD;
      dentists/dental specialists licensed by the Alberta Dental Association and College to use&#xD;
      this form of i.v. sedation in Alberta at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatment will occur at the oral surgery offices of Drs. Don Macalister and David Chrisp&#xD;
      in Auckland and Taruanga respectively, and general dental office of Dr. Graham Shaw in&#xD;
      Auckland, New Zealand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 patients are the requirement for this pilot study across three sites. This&#xD;
      study will be of nine months' duration, from September 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019, or when 40&#xD;
      patients have been successfully recruited to the study at each site oral surgery site and 20&#xD;
      at the general dentistry site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous sedation study participants will receive the established TCI dental i.v. sedation&#xD;
      consistent to each oral surgeon and general dentist office protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating oral surgeons/dentist will abide by any research protocols established by&#xD;
      the New Zealand Ethics Office, and the University of Alberta, Research Ethics Office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the sedation: the use of appropriate physiologic and electronic monitoring,&#xD;
      standardized intravenous administration sets, TCI infusion pumps, personnel, record keeping&#xD;
      and discharge criteria will be used. Brain function monitoring (pEEG) provides additional&#xD;
      information to the clinician during titration of propofol and remifentanil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-sedation, all patients are followed up with a phone call and if there are any concerns,&#xD;
      the patients will be seen immediately. In the event of any problems or concerns after hours,&#xD;
      the phone number of the oral surgeon/dentist is available on the post-sedation instruction&#xD;
      sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following the sedation and prior to discharge, the participants will be asked a&#xD;
      series of questions from the patient satisfaction questionnaire. In the follow-up portion of&#xD;
      the study, participants will be asked the same series of questions from the patient&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire; 24 - 48 hours following the sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TCI sedation involves the use of controlled administration of propofol and remifentanil&#xD;
      utilizing two TCI pumps (Alaris PK infusion pump with TCI). The software models used in New&#xD;
      Zealand differ slightly from that currently available in Canada. In New Zealand effect-site&#xD;
      or brain level software (Schnider for propofol and Minto for remifentanil) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Canada, the licensed software for the same pump is plasma level software (Marsh for&#xD;
      propofol and Minto for remifentanil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The propofol TCI models (Schnider or Marsh) prove highly effective in combination with&#xD;
      remifentanil TCI. Clinical practice demonstrates there is no 'best' TCI model for propofol.&#xD;
      The clinician should become familiar with the model which matches the patient characteristics&#xD;
      of their usual patient population. Regardless of pharmacokinetic model used, clinical&#xD;
      monitoring of the patient remains an important and integral part of the sedation team's role&#xD;
      and patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dental procedures will be what is normally performed in each New Zealand office, and the&#xD;
      scope of these procedures is similar to that performed by dental practitioners in Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent t-test and analysis of covariance will be used to compare differences in safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness measures as described. Box M test will be used to evaluate comparability of&#xD;
      variance between sites. A statistical covariate will also be used to conduct comparison of&#xD;
      results taking account of the risk associated with patient demographics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected from patients will first be processed such that values across multiple&#xD;
      time-points, collected through survey and patient record, will reflect as one record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incomplete or problematic records will be removed from the analysis. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      will be presented for all measures of secondary objectives, confidence interval estimates,&#xD;
      proportion and statistical tests will be conducted to evaluate safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
