      gastroenteritis, respiratory infections will be excluded. The study will be conducted for&#xD;
      half a year, 5 cans of Youluck infant formula are provided for each subject during the test&#xD;
      period. The Youluck infant formula is sponsored free of charge by glac biotech Co., Ltd.&#xD;
      During hospitalization, the infant will be feed by same group of experienced nurses and all&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics were defined as an ''live microorganisms, which, when administered in adequate&#xD;
      amounts, conferred a health benefit on the host. Before 2005, some animal experiments&#xD;
      indicated that probiotics could help weight gain. In 2006, there was a team observed the&#xD;
      growth of infants who received infant formula with probiotics. The study found that infants&#xD;
      who received infant formula with probiotics for half a year had higher height and weight than&#xD;
      infants who received regular formula, and the defecation frequency was increased. So far,&#xD;
      clinical studies had proved that probiotics had an efficacy on gastrointestinal immune&#xD;
      regulation. Some studies had found that concentrated preparations mixed with various&#xD;
      probiotics had therapeutic effects on inflammatory bowel diseases. The latest double-blind&#xD;
      study of infants with acute diarrhoea showed that oral dehydration supplements enriched&#xD;
      probiotics and zinc could reduce the severity of diarrhoea on day 2 without any side effects.&#xD;
      Therefore, more and more probiotic clinical studies had suggested that probiotics could be&#xD;
      used to regulate gastrointestinal related diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to statistics, the proportion of atopic dermatitis in infants and children&#xD;
      worldwide is about 10-20%, and about 30% of toddlers with more than three episodes of&#xD;
      wheezing bronchitis may develop persistent asthma. Therefore, how to effectively prevent the&#xD;
      occurrence of allergic diseases was still an urgent goal for infants and young children.&#xD;
      There is now evidence in mice and humans of an early-life &quot;critical window&quot; in which the&#xD;
      effects of gut microbial dysbiosis are most influential in human immune development.&#xD;
      Investigators showed that infants at risk of asthma exhibited transient gut microbial&#xD;
      dysbiosis during the first 100 days of life. Inoculation of the relatively lower abundance of&#xD;
      the genus to asthmatic mice ameliorated airway inflammation. These results enhanced the&#xD;
      potential for future microbe-based diagnostics and therapies, potentially in the form of&#xD;
      probiotics, to prevent the development of asthma and other related allergic diseases in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, respiratory infections were diseases that needed attention during the growth&#xD;
      phase of infants and young children. The most common treatment for respiratory infections or&#xD;
      acute otitis media in infants and young children was using antibiotics, but antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment might lead to antibiotic resistance and intestinal microbial disorders, which might&#xD;
      promote colonization of pathogens. In recent years, probiotics had attracted more and more&#xD;
      attention for the prevention of respiratory infections. For example, investigators showed&#xD;
      that using Bifidobacterium probiotics in children before 2 years old might reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of respiratory infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above studies, Investigators will use infant formula with probiotics to infants.&#xD;
      The study will assess the growth, incidence of allergies, gastroenteritis and respiratory&#xD;
      infections of infants. This observational study will be conducted at the China Medical&#xD;
      University Children's Hospital performed a double-blind randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be divided into three groups, the experimental group: (I) probiotic A formula,&#xD;
      (II) probiotic B formula; control group: (III) regular formula (Youluck infant formula).&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria included: (1) the normal spontaneous delivery (NSD) full-term health&#xD;
      infants (≧37 weeks) and birth weight more than 2500 grams and (2) subjects who are expected&#xD;
      to breastfeed are eligible for the trial after informed consent form is signed by the&#xD;
      parents. Exclusion criteria included: infants with chronic diarrhea, hemangioma, cerebral&#xD;
      hemorrhage, severe asphyxia (stage III), fetal chromosomal abnormalities, cyanotic congenital&#xD;
      heart disease, intestinal hypoplasia or abnormal immune function after birth, liver failure,&#xD;
      breastfeeding within two months after birth, taking other probiotic products within two weeks&#xD;
      after birth, treatment with antibiotics during acute infection and diagnosis of allergies,&#xD;
      gastroenteritis, respiratory infections will be excluded. The study will be conducted for&#xD;
      half a year, 5 cans of Youluck infant formula are provided for each subject during the test&#xD;
      period. The Youluck infant formula is sponsored free of charge by glac biotech Co., Ltd.&#xD;
      During hospitalization, the infant will be feed by same group of experienced nurses and all&#xD;
      infants will be monitored for adverse conditions such as vomiting, diarrhea or bloating every&#xD;
      day. After the study is completed, the remaining probiotic milk powder will be subjected to&#xD;
      high temperature and high pressure for sterilization, and then placed in an infectious&#xD;
      garbage bag or infective trash can, and destructed by a cleaning company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is based on the literature. The incidence of enteritis, allergic&#xD;
      disease or respiratory infection in infants is about 30%. Investigators assume that the&#xD;
      experimental group has a 50% improvement compared with the control group. If investigators&#xD;
      allow 5% chance of type 1 error (α=0.05) and 10% chance of type 2 error (β=0.1), then the&#xD;
      required sample size in each group will be 60 people (total 180 infants in three groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research data will be based on International Business Machines Statistical Product and&#xD;
      Service Solutions (IBM SPSS) for analytical statistics. Normally distributed data were&#xD;
      analyzed using Student's t-test two-tailed assay, and non-normally distributed data were&#xD;
      analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Data were presented as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation (SEM) or median, with P values &lt; 0.05 being considered statistically significant.&#xD;
