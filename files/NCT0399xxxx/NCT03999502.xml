  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population&#xD;
      in the Western World. Approximately 250 million subjects worldwide and 30 million subjects in&#xD;
      the US suffer from GERD. Among the 12 million Americans who suffer from daily heart-burn (the&#xD;
      main symptom of GERD) almost 5 million do not respond completely to medications and many more&#xD;
      do not want or cannot take medications due to side-effects (1). The goals of treatment in&#xD;
      GERD are to relieve symptoms, heal esophagitis if present, prevent recurrence of symptoms and&#xD;
      esophagitis, and prevent complications. Medical acid-suppressive therapy with proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitors (PPIs) heals esophagitis, relieves symptoms and improves quality of life. However,&#xD;
      acid suppressive therapy does not correct the underlying pathophysiology of dysfunction of&#xD;
      the lower esophageal sphincter and hence symptoms of reflux due to weakly acidic or non-acid&#xD;
      reflux persist in the majority of subjects who present with symptoms persisting on PPIs&#xD;
      (regurgitations) (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormalities in the structure and function of the esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) such as a&#xD;
      permanently open EGJ, a hiatal hernia, a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and&#xD;
      transient LES relaxations (t-LESR) are the main pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to GERD&#xD;
      (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric&#xD;
      content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients (4,5). However,&#xD;
      there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the&#xD;
      surgical procedure (6,7). The results reported from operations performed in community&#xD;
      hospital lower volume centers have been different than those achieved in centers of&#xD;
      excellence. It has been reported that between 23% and 62% of patients who have undergone&#xD;
      laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication use acid suppression medications at long-term follow-up.&#xD;
      Due to these issues patient and physician acceptance of surgical procedures remains low and&#xD;
      is mainly limited to patients with severe GERD or those non-responsive to medications. For&#xD;
      these reasons, less invasive endoscopic techniques to treat GERD have been developed during&#xD;
      the last 2 decades, which may be categorized into 3 groups: (1) sewing/plication at the&#xD;
      cardia and EGJ, (2) radiofrequency (RF) thermal therapy to the LES, and (3)&#xD;
      injection/implantation of biopolymers at the EGJ. Minimally invasive endoluminal procedures&#xD;
      for GERD are designed to provide long-lasting symptom relief and abolish or lessen medication&#xD;
      dependency. Most endoluminal modalities that were introduced into clinical practice have&#xD;
      failed due to lack of long-term efficacy, complications, or interruption of commercialization&#xD;
      due to financial difficulties of the companies that developed the techniques (8,9).&#xD;
      Endoscopic sewing/plication techniques comprised mucosal plications (Endocinch) that were not&#xD;
      clinically useful because the plications were not durable, and full-thickness&#xD;
      (serosa-to-serosa) plications allowing prolonged durability (NDO Plicator device and Esophyx&#xD;
      device). The data from the RCTs with Plicator device were encouraging and the finding of&#xD;
      better results with multiple plications without an increase in adverse events supported that&#xD;
      this device could have clinical utility. However, the company ceased operations in 2008 and&#xD;
      the device is no longer clinically available (10). Transoral incisionless fundoplication&#xD;
      (TIF) using Esophyx showed promising results in open studies (11). However, long-term&#xD;
      follow-up revealed that a majority of patients required either ongoing PPI use or were&#xD;
      referred for LNF owing to persistent symptoms (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endomina-v2 (Endo Tools Therapeutics SA, Rue Auguste Piccard 48, 6041 GOSSELIES, Belgium) is&#xD;
      a CE marked device that can be attached to an endoscope inside the body and allows&#xD;
      manipulation of angulated tools during a peroral intervention. It offers the possibility to&#xD;
      perform transoral surgical full thickness sutures and transoral endoscopic gastroplasty has&#xD;
      shown to be safe and effective at mid-term follow-up in obese patients (13). The ability to&#xD;
      perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety&#xD;
      and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD,&#xD;
      unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use.&#xD;
