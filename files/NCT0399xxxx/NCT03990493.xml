    <textblock>
      The purpose of this arm of the study is to evaluate the safety of PV-001-DC (autologous&#xD;
      monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate) when given in combination with&#xD;
      PV-001-DV (Dengue Virus-1 strain #45AZ5) at the dose levels that were identified in the prior&#xD;
      2 arms and to determine if the combination can treat advanced melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a prescribed amount of PV-001-DV injected into one of their melanoma&#xD;
      tumors. Patients will go to the clinic and have a needle placed in a vein. The PV-001-DC&#xD;
      product will be infused into the patient's vein. Approximately every 3 weeks, for a total of&#xD;
      4 treatments, patients will receive additional infusions of PV-001-DC Patients will be at the&#xD;
      clinic for at least 1 hour following the end of each PV-001-DC infusion and if they feel&#xD;
      fine, they may go home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 49 days after the first infusion, patients will have a scan to see if their&#xD;
      tumors have changed in size. Other scans may be performed during the study at different&#xD;
      times. Patients will also have their blood and small samples of tumors tested for changes to&#xD;
      the immune system. After 365 days, the trial will be completed for that patient.&#xD;
