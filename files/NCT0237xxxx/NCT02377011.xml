  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial to test the whether remote delivery of cognitive based therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) is clinically and cost effective when compared to treatment as usual in adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults with depression who self-harm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self harm is one of the five leading causes of admission to acute hospital with rates&#xD;
      increasing by nearly 50% from 2003-2009 (South West Public Health Observatory, 2012).&#xD;
      Re-admission within 30 days is frequent. People who repeatedly self harm are at high risk for&#xD;
      suicide and and as a result suicide, self-harm and crisis are priorities for CCGs and HWBs in&#xD;
      the East Midlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NICE Clinical Guideline 133 on longer-term treatment of self-harm recommends between 3 to&#xD;
      12 sessions of psychological treatment involving problem solving and alternative coping.&#xD;
      Presently however, the biggest at risk group for self-harm and suicide is not offered any&#xD;
      psychological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that mobile phones are a highly acceptable method of engaging adolescents&#xD;
      with depression in psychological treatments such as CBT (Whittaker et al 2012). Furthermore a&#xD;
      systematic review has show that treatment delivery via remote technology is just as effective&#xD;
      as face-to-face in people with anxiety or depression (Bee et al, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study therefore has the following aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To optimise and determine the acceptability and feasibility of engaging and retaining&#xD;
           patients with depression who repeatedly self-harm in a remotely delivered (through video&#xD;
           calling/telephone) CBT intervention over 10 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To outline the barriers and drivers to delivering both the study and the remotely&#xD;
           delivered PS CBT intervention and how barriers to the interventions are addressed&#xD;
           through a network of practice or other means.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the recruitment and retention into the study and the remotely delivered PS therapy&#xD;
           are feasible and acceptable, then we will determine the clinical effectiveness and cost&#xD;
           effectiveness of the intervention versus treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If the intervention (pilot study) proves to be clinically effective and cost effective&#xD;
           then the barriers and drivers to implementation in all counties in the East Midlands&#xD;
           will be explored using a network of practice linking with NHS organisations, strategic&#xD;
           clinical networks, and the AHSN (see qualitative analysis of barriers and drivers to the&#xD;
           implementation of the intervention below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents and young adults who receive problem solving cognitive behaviour therapy (plus&#xD;
      treatment as usual) will report greater reduction in their depressive symptoms (as measured&#xD;
      using Beck depression inventory 2) from baseline to 6 months in comparison to those receiving&#xD;
      treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will be to observe a change over 12 months on measures of depression,&#xD;
      hopelessness and suicidality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study configuration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare two groups: participants will be randomly assigned to the TAU group&#xD;
      (control group) or the remotely delivered PS CBT (and TAU) group (intervention group).&#xD;
