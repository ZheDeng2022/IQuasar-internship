    <textblock>
      Up to one-third of patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 die suddenly mainly from&#xD;
      arrhythmias. Sleep apnea is prevalent in myotonic dystrophy (DM1) patients. Among the serious&#xD;
      complications from sleep apnea, the most alarming are arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death&#xD;
      (SCD). Diagnosis of sleep apnea using simple tools in ambulatory cardiology practice may&#xD;
      improve therapy of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with DM1&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA), the most common form of sleep&#xD;
      disordered breathing (SDB), are prevalent in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).&#xD;
      Among the serious complications from sleep apnea, the most alarming are cardiovascular,&#xD;
      including arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Diagnosis of SDB using simple tools in&#xD;
      ambulatory cardiology practice may lead to an important primary or additional therapy to&#xD;
      supplement the use of drugs or devices in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that DM1 patients with severe oxygen desaturations (Oxygen desaturation index&#xD;
      &gt;15/hour of sleep and/or cumulative time spent below 90% of SaO2 above 5% of time of&#xD;
      recording) will exhibit three fold more nocturnal arrhythmias compared to DM1 group without&#xD;
      oxygen desaturations during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this project we will address the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a relationship between the severity of oxygen desaturations during sleep and&#xD;
           nocturnal arrhythmias? We will address this question in a prospective study with seven&#xD;
           nights of at home recordings with a multimodal holter EKG assessing together&#xD;
           arrhythmias, thoracic impedance (in order to estimate respiratory movements) and SaO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The specific proarrhythmic role of REM sleep will be assessed during a single night full&#xD;
           polysomnography and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients suffering from myotonic dystrophy (DM1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DM1 patients participating in the clinical cohorts of Grenoble, Saint-Etienne and&#xD;
             Montpellier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients implanted or not with pacing devices or cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients treated or not by non invasive ventilation (NIV) at home. As a majority, of&#xD;
             the patients with DM1 are poorly adherent with NIV they continue to exhibit&#xD;
             significant desaturation during night. Truly compliant patients (mean daily&#xD;
             duration&gt;6/h night) will be studied as a predefined subgroup to assess the protective&#xD;
             effect of NIV for suppressing oxygen desaturations and avoiding occurrence of&#xD;
             nocturnal arrhythmias.&#xD;
