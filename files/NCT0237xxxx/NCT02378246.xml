      THE ULTIMATE GOAL of this project is to answer the question &quot;In MILD IODINE DEFICIENCY (ID),&#xD;
      should 150 μg iodine/day be administered to pregnant women with a normal diet, to attain a&#xD;
      normal cognitive development of the fetus or is there no cognitive deficit from mild ID and&#xD;
      no extra iodine is needed?&quot;. To answer this question, the investigators planned a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial of iodine supplementation during pregnancy in Sweden (SWIDDICH) with&#xD;
      the follow-up of childrens' COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT at 18 months, 3.5, 7 and 14 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine deficiency (ID) is associated with thyroid morbidity and, especially in children, with&#xD;
      impaired cognitive development. Sweden introduced iodine fortification of table salt 1936 and&#xD;
      mental retardation due to severe ID is eradicated. Is mild ID during pregnancy also&#xD;
      eradicated? If not, is this of importance? A national study performed by the investigators in&#xD;
      2007 showed iodine sufficiency in general population, but there are no pregnancy data. Local&#xD;
      studies have raised concerns for mild ID during pregnancy in Sweden and a trans-sectional&#xD;
      national study is currently ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burning question for Sweden and the whole world is: is mild ID during pregnancy of&#xD;
      importance for the developing brain of the fetus? Two large observational studies have shown&#xD;
      association between mild ID during pregnancy and lower verbal IQ or educational performance&#xD;
      at school-aged children. The world needs a randomized placebo-controlled trial (RTC)&#xD;
      comparing the cognitive outcome in children exposed to mild ID during fetal life with&#xD;
      children exposed to normal iodine levels during fetal life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our HYPOTHESIS is that pregnant women in Sweden have mild ID and that children exposed to&#xD;
      mild ID during fetal life have a lower cognitive development, compared to children to mothers&#xD;
      taking 150 ug iodine supplementation during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MAIN AIM of the SWIDDICH trial is to determine if children exposed to mild iodine&#xD;
      deficiency (ID) during fetal life achieve worse cognitive development compared to children&#xD;
      exposed to normal iodine status reached by maternal iodine supplementation.&#xD;

      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if children exposed to mild iodine deficiency (ID) during fetal life&#xD;
           achieve worse cognitive development compared to children exposed to normal iodine status&#xD;
           reached by maternal iodine supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare urinary iodine concentration (UIC), thyroglobulin (Tg), free&#xD;
           tetraiodothyronine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in pregnant women on 150&#xD;
           µg iodine or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare milk iodine concentration (MIC) in colostrum, and TSH in the first 200&#xD;
           newborn children to pregnant women receiving 150 µg iodine or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine deficiency increases the risk for hypothyroidism and goiter and during the pregnancy&#xD;
      for abortion or cognitive and other abnormalities of the baby. According to the WHO&#xD;
      recommendations, UIC during pregnancy should be 150-249 ug/L. In 2007 a national study showed&#xD;
      iodine sufficiency in Swedish general population. It is debated whether or not iodine shall&#xD;
      be given to pregnant women in iodine sufficient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research group started this randomized iodine intervention in pregnant women in 2012. The&#xD;
      first hypothesis was that iodine supplementation of 150 µg/day is needed during pregnancy in&#xD;
      Sweden in order to ensure normal iodine and thyroid hormone status in mothers and newborn&#xD;
      children and that pregnant women in Sweden suffer from mild iodine deficiency (ID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a substantial gap of knowledge with regards to whether mild ID during fetal life&#xD;
      entails negative consequences on cognition. Two large observational studies have shown&#xD;
      association between mild ID during pregnancy and lower IQ or educational performance in&#xD;
      school-children. The only two randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) studying mild ID in&#xD;
      pregnancy were either too small for safe conclusions to be drawn ( Brucker-Davis et al,&#xD;
      n=86), or did not manage to separate groups based on iodine levels (the MITCH study,&#xD;
      Melse-Boonstra et al, n=839). The need for a RCT with sufficient sample size remains. This&#xD;
      led the research team to form a second hypothesis within the trial: children exposed to mild&#xD;
      ID during fetal life have lower cognitive development compared to children to mothers taking&#xD;
      150 ug iodine supplementation during pregnancy. The decision to expand the trial was made and&#xD;
      the target number of participants to be recruited increased from 200 to 1275 in order to&#xD;
      reach enough power to follow-up the childrens' cognitive development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective placebo-controlled trial of children whose mothers got iodine&#xD;
      supplement 150 µg/day or placebo (a multivitamin preparation without iodine) during pregnancy&#xD;
      (week 10±2 until delivery). The target number participants during pregnancy is 1275 to enable&#xD;
      sufficient power in the children follow-up (n=788). The main outcome is intelligence quotient&#xD;
      (IQ) at 7 year of age. Cognitive development in children will be also assessed at 18 months,&#xD;
      3.5, and 14 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy part&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women from more than ten maternity care centers in Sweden are randomized to daily&#xD;
      receive a multivitamin tablet with 150 µg iodine or placebo (multivitamin without iodine).&#xD;
      The intervention starts at pregnancy week 8-12 and ends directly post-partum for the first&#xD;
      200 women and at pregnancy week 36±2weeks for the remaining participants. This time point may&#xD;
      be adjusted to local circumstances, depending on when during the third trimester the routine&#xD;
      visit at maternity care center takes place. Participants are included after the first visit&#xD;
      by a midwife. Urine sample for UIC and U-creatinine, and blood sample for thyroid hormones,&#xD;
      thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroglobuline (Tg) and thyroperoxidase antibodies&#xD;
      (TPO-ab) are collected and a simple questionnaire is filled in at week 10±2 weeks of&#xD;
      pregnancy and placebo/iodine is started. Selenium and iron is also measured. The same&#xD;
      measurements are collected in week 25±1 week and week 36±2 weeks. Directly after delivery&#xD;
      (within 5 days), MIC and UIC in the first 200 mother as well as UIC and TSH in their newborn&#xD;
      child were collected and a simple questionnaire is filled in. Weight, length and APGAR in the&#xD;
      child and pregnancy complications are registered. Blood is also frozen for future analyses&#xD;
      and access to medical files is accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel 90 healthy female controls from Skaraborg area stratified for age and smoking&#xD;
      habits are collected from a randomized sample attained by the Swedish Tax Agency. UIC,&#xD;
      u-creatinine, FT4, TSH, Tg, TPO-ab, and samples to be frozen are collected and a&#xD;
      questionnaire is filled in. Selenium and iron is analyzed in blood sample from the first 200&#xD;
      pregnant women and from controls. The primary purpose for having a control population is to&#xD;
      ascertain that the normal population in the area of Skaraborg is iodine sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 18 months ± 1 month psychomotor development is assessed by means of ASQ (Ages and Stages&#xD;
      Questionnaire). At 3,5 years ± 2 months the IQ is measured (WPPSI-IV), behavior is assessed&#xD;
      (CBCL questionnaire) and urine is collected for UIC measurement. At 7 years ± 3 months the&#xD;
      following are assessed: IQ (WISC IV), motor development (Movement ABC), behavior (CBCL),&#xD;
      symptoms related to attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, 5-15 Nordic&#xD;
      questionnaire). Additionally, at 7 years ± 3 months urine is collected for UIC measurement,&#xD;
      blood sample is taken for thyreoglobulin (Tg), thyroid hormones and deiodinases, and MRI of&#xD;
      the brain is performed in a subsample. At 14 years ± 6 months all these, except for the&#xD;
      Movement ABC, are repeated. On all occasions information on socio-economic status and other&#xD;
      possible confounders are collected by means of questionnaires filled by parents and by&#xD;
      children (14 years).&#xD;
