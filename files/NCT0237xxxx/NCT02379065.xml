  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are looking at whether a new type of nebuliser (a machine used to deliver&#xD;
      drugs to the airways) is better at delivering drugs to the lungs of people with Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), compared with the current nebulisers used in Emergency&#xD;
      Departments. The investigators will randomly allocate patients who come into the Emergency&#xD;
      Department with an acute episode of the COPD into either the standard nebuliser group or the&#xD;
      new nebuliser group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive the same medications, it is only the method of delivering them which&#xD;
      will be different.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease presents a significant burden on Emergency Departments&#xD;
      and acute medical services, accounting for approximately 90,000 hospital admissions a year,&#xD;
      with an average stay lasting 11 days. COPD accounts for 10% of acute hospital admissions,&#xD;
      therefore any method of improving health outcomes and reducing the burden on acute services&#xD;
      will benefit patients twofold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of acute COPD is based on clinical indicators such as patient perceived&#xD;
      breathlessness, arterial blood gas analysis and respiratory rate. Although breathlessness is&#xD;
      a subjective marker, multiple scoring systems have been devised in an attempt to standardise&#xD;
      this in order to see an objective improvement in the patient. One of the most commonly used&#xD;
      and repeatedly validated scoring systems is the BORG score, which has been shown to&#xD;
      effectively demonstrate improvement in breathlessness in the emergency setting .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nebulised bronchodilator therapy is the mainstay of treatment, as described in the National&#xD;
      Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines. Delivery of bronchodilators (salbutamol and&#xD;
      ipratropium) is through a standard facemask - in this Trust it is a Phillips Respironic©&#xD;
      mask. Drugs delivery is variable through a nebuliser mask and it is difficult to measure&#xD;
      exactly how much of the drug is being delivered to the more distal bronchial tree.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this can be highly variable between patients depending on how well the mask fits&#xD;
      and patient tolerance, amongst other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various attempts have been made to improve drug delivery in acute setting such as a spacer&#xD;
      and a hood (within paediatric asthmatic patients) , . However, they have all showed that the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes are the same regardless of the method of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment is based on a combination of objective and subjective parameters. Within&#xD;
      the Emergency Department, these include both patient and clinician perception of improvement&#xD;
      in symptoms (primarily shortness of breath). Assessment also includes more objective&#xD;
      measurements such as oxygen saturation, arterial blood gas measurements and end tidal CO2&#xD;
      measurements when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many challenges that we face specifically within the Emergency Department with&#xD;
      patients with COPD. As we are seeing patients as soon as they enter the hospital, initial&#xD;
      therapy may have already been administered by the ambulance service so any assessment will be&#xD;
      slightly biased and the patient may initially appear better than they actually are.&#xD;
      Furthermore, there are often burdens on Emergency Departments during busy periods during the&#xD;
      winter, meaning it is not always possible to give patients instant treatment or to be seen&#xD;
      immediately by a doctor, particularly if there are more unwell patients based on the triage&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, some of the more objective measures used in previous trials such as bedside&#xD;
      spirometry are not practical in the Emergency Department for several reasons. Firstly, when a&#xD;
      patient is acutely short of breath they will not be able to perform spirometry properly.&#xD;
      Secondly, as this is not something done routinely in the Emergency Department, both doctors&#xD;
      and nurses may not be properly trained to carry this out and we may obtain falsely high or&#xD;
      low results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aerogen Aeroneb Solo© is a new nebuliser which is hypothesised to increase drug delivery&#xD;
      to peripheral bronchi. Previous studies have showed that it delivers up to 4 times more drug&#xD;
      than jet nebulisers and up to 3 times as much as metered dose inhalers. However, this will be&#xD;
      its first study with the adapter in human subjects and its first study specifically for COPD.&#xD;
