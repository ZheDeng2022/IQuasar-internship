      The purpose of this research project is to test the effectiveness of nivolumab versus&#xD;
      nivolumab together with ipilimumab for the treatment of melanoma brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible to join this study if they are aged 18 years or above and have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with melanoma with brain metastases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND Brain metastases are a common and serious complication of metastatic melanoma. Up&#xD;
      to 50% of patients develop brain metastases during the course of their illness, and&#xD;
      approximately 20% of patients have them at first presentation with metastatic disease. The&#xD;
      prognosis for melanoma patients with brain metastasis is generally very poor with a median&#xD;
      overall survival ranging from 2.8 to 4 months and a large proportion of up to 95% of these&#xD;
      patients will ultimately die as a direct result of their brain metastases. The prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with melanoma brain metastases has not changed between 1986 and 2007. The five year&#xD;
      survival rate is 15% for late stage disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOCAL TREATMENT OPTIONS There are 3 treatment modalities used for the local management of&#xD;
      brain metastases: surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and whole brain radiotherapy&#xD;
      (WBRT). Surgery and SRS are directed to the tumour volume only, whereas WBRT delivers&#xD;
      lower-dose radiotherapy to the whole brain, including areas of no overt tumour. Surgery is&#xD;
      not limited by the size of the tumour; however, it is dependent on the lesion being&#xD;
      surgically accessible. In appropriately selected patients (lesions &gt;3 cm and minimal&#xD;
      symptoms), SRS is considered equivalent to surgical resection; however, this has been&#xD;
      addressed in only 1 randomised controlled trial that was stopped early because of poor&#xD;
      accrual. No statistically significant difference was found in survival or local tumour&#xD;
      control. In solid tumours, WBRT remains the treatment modality of choice in those where&#xD;
      surgery or SRS are contraindicated because of tumour size, number, or location. The role of&#xD;
      WBRT is to palliate symptoms because, despite response rates of 60%, median survival is less&#xD;
      than 5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SYSTEMIC THERAPY OPTIONS Systemic chemotherapy has shown little benefit in the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma, including those with brain metastases. It is usually reserved for those&#xD;
      who have central nervous system (CNS) progression despite surgery and/or radiotherapy, or in&#xD;
      those patients with rapidly progressing or symptomatic extracranial disease. The response&#xD;
      rate in the brain for the most active chemotherapy agents temozolomide and fotemustine is&#xD;
      &lt;10% in large clinical trials, thus patients with brain metastases have been excluded from&#xD;
      most systemic therapy clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab was the first systemic treatment proven to extend survival in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma, and has activity in progressing brain metastases in patients who are not&#xD;
      taking corticosteroids for neurological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are potent selective BRAF inhibitors proven to increase survival&#xD;
      in patients with V600 BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma and have activity in brain metastases.&#xD;
      Although there is unprecedented proven activity of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in a large&#xD;
      clinical trial of patients with untreated V600 BRAF-mutant brain metastases, this represents&#xD;
      only 40% of the metastatic melanoma population, and responses are rarely durable. Brain&#xD;
      metastases remain a major clinical problem, and an unmet medical need for patients with both&#xD;
      BRAF-mutant and wild-type metastatic melanoma. And yet, all major clinical trials continue to&#xD;
      exclude such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNOTHERAPY Cancer immunotherapy rests on the premise that tumours can be recognized as&#xD;
      foreign rather than as 'self' and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system.&#xD;
      An effective immune response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveillance of&#xD;
      tumour antigens expressed on cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune&#xD;
      response and cancer cell death. This functions by aborting the emergence of tumours as they&#xD;
      arise and/or causing tumour shrinkage where it is present. Meanwhile, tumour progression may&#xD;
      depend upon the acquisition of traits that allow cancer cells to evade immune surveillance&#xD;
      and an effective immune response. This evasion may occur by exploiting any of the checkpoints&#xD;
      that control the regulatory immune response, including the display of antigens and control of&#xD;
      co-stimulatory pathways that affect the proliferation of cells involved in immunity. Current&#xD;
      immunotherapy efforts attempt to break the apparent tolerance of the immune system to tumour&#xD;
      cells and antigens by either introducing cancer antigens by therapeutic vaccination or by&#xD;
      modulating regulatory checkpoints of the immune system - either directly by stimulation of&#xD;
      immune cells by antibodies directed to receptors on T and B cells or indirectly by cytokine&#xD;
      manipulation. T-cell stimulation is a complex process involving the integration of numerous&#xD;
      positive, as well as negative, co-stimulatory signals in addition to antigen recognition by&#xD;
      the T-cell receptor (TCR). Collectively, these signals govern the balance between T-cell&#xD;
      activation and tolerance to antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIVOLUMAB Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the negative&#xD;
      immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed cell&#xD;
      death-1/PCD-1) with immunopotentiation activity. The efficacy and safety of nivolumab is&#xD;
      being explored in 3 ongoing melanoma phase 3 trials in previously treated or treatment na√Øve&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPILIMUMAB In a study investigating the safety and activity of ipilimumab specifically in&#xD;
      patients with brain metastases, ipilimumab was shown to have activity in some patients with&#xD;
      advanced melanoma and brain metastases, particularly when metastases are small and&#xD;
      asymptomatic and in patients who do not need corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, the drug&#xD;
      had no unexpected toxic effects in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIVOLUMAB COMBINED WITH IPILIMUMAB Preclinical and preliminary clinical evidence suggests a&#xD;
      synergy between nivolumab and ipilimumab. While PD-1 and CTLA-4 are both co-inhibitory&#xD;
      molecules, evidence suggests that they use distinct mechanisms to limit T cell activation.&#xD;
      The preliminary clinical evidence has demonstrated a higher frequency of patients with&#xD;
      substantial tumour burden reduction for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Improved&#xD;
      overall survival associated with substantial tumour burden reduction has been noted with&#xD;
      immunotherapies. For instance, improved overall survival has been noted in metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma patients obtaining a complete response to IL-2. If this observation is also&#xD;
      applicable to treatment with nivolumab combined with ipilimumab then there could also be the&#xD;
      potential for large improvements in overall survival compared to ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Initially, this study will recruit patients with melanoma brain metastases who&#xD;
      have received no prior local treatment for their intracranial metastatic disease and who are&#xD;
      asymptomatic (Cohort 1) and in parallel, patients who have been previously treated for their&#xD;
      brain metastases, have symptoms, or have concurrent leptomeningeal disease (Cohort 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab is currently under investigation in a phase&#xD;
      III trial in previously untreated metastatic melanoma (NCT01844505). That study however&#xD;
      excludes those patients with active brain metastases. This current study will therefore enrol&#xD;
      a third group of patients with brain metastases who have received no prior treatment for&#xD;
      their metastatic disease and who are asymptomatic to receive combined nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab (Cohort 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment to cohort 3 will commence once the first 6 patients from cohort 1 have received&#xD;
      at least 3 doses of study treatment (equivalent to 6 weeks) and have a satisfactory adverse&#xD;
      event record. A satisfactory record is deemed where ‚â§ 2 patients experience neurological&#xD;
      CTCAE grade 3 or above nivolumab-related adverse events. Following this safety assessment, if&#xD;
      no safety signals are detected, patients will continue to be recruited to this cohort to&#xD;
      enable a complete patient group of 30. To minimise bias, treatment allocation to cohort 3 and&#xD;
      the remainder of cohort 1 will be assigned by unequal randomisation ratio to achieve an&#xD;
      overall balance of 30 patients receiving nivolumab 3 mg/kg (including the 6 patients from&#xD;
      cohort 1) and 30 patients receiving the combination treatment. Randomisation to the remaining&#xD;
      cohort 1 and all of cohort 3 will be stratified by participating site to minimise potential&#xD;
      differences between patients who present to the different sites, or because of differences&#xD;
      between the sites themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTINUED TREATMENT IN SELECT CASES OF PROGRESSIVE DISEASE Accumulating clinical evidence&#xD;
      indicates some patients treated with immune system stimulating agents may develop progression&#xD;
      of disease (by conventional response criteria) before demonstrating clinical objective&#xD;
      responses and/or stable disease. enhanced inflammation within tumours could lead to an&#xD;
      increase in tumour size which would appear as enlarged index lesions and as newly visible&#xD;
      small non-index lesions. Over time, both the malignant and inflammatory portions of the mass&#xD;
      may then decrease leading to overt signs of clinical improvement. Alternatively, in some&#xD;
      individuals, the kinetics of tumour growth may initially outpace anti-tumour immune activity.&#xD;
      With sufficient time, the anti-tumour activity will dominate and become clinically apparent.&#xD;
      Therefore, patients will be allowed to continue study treatment after initial&#xD;
      investigator-assessed RECIST 1.1 defined progression if they are assessed to be deriving&#xD;
      clinical benefit and tolerating study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of traditional RECIST criteria in patients treated with immunotherapy may&#xD;
      lead to premature discontinuation of treatment in a patient who will eventually respond to&#xD;
      treatment or have prolonged disease stabilization. Disease progression may occur in&#xD;
      extracranial lesions whilst patients may continue to have disease stabilisation or response&#xD;
      of their intracranial melanoma disease, and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRACRANIAL RESPONSE USING FET-PET FET PET (18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine [FET]) will be used as&#xD;
      a separate and independent modality to MRI brain scans to assess metabolic response of the&#xD;
      brain metastases to immune therapy. FET PET has been extensively evaluated in humans. FET-PET&#xD;
      has shown to be valuable in the management of brain tumours. It is not known what the effect&#xD;
      of lymphocytic infiltration which occurs with immune therapy is on MRI brain, so it is&#xD;
      important to have a separate modality to predict benefit and assess response. FET-PET&#xD;
      demonstrates the change in cell proliferation (change in SUV [standardised uptake value] from&#xD;
      baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FET-PET will be used to assess to determine response to study treatment. The FET PET findings&#xD;
      will be compared with conventional imaging. Only cohorts 1 and 3 will be assessed with this&#xD;
      modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLOOD AND TISSUE BIOMARKERS Blood will be collected to examine serum chemokines, cytokines,&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, lymphocyte and T cell subsets and myeloid derived suppressor cells&#xD;
      (MDSC) to assess correlation with disease response or progression. In patients with&#xD;
      sufficient archival melanoma tissue from metastatic sites, a baseline tumour PD-L1 level,&#xD;
      immune markers and genetics of response and resistance will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If available, tumour tissue following progression of disease will also be tested for immune&#xD;
      and genetic markers. Early work has indicated these biomarkers may be predictive of&#xD;
      responders to study treatment. In a phase 1 study of 90 patients receiving nivolumab at&#xD;
      different dose levels, high pre-treatment NY-ESO-1 and MART-1-specific CD8+ T cells were&#xD;
      associated with progression of disease. At week 12, increased peripheral-blood T regulatory&#xD;
      cells and decreased antigen-specific T cells were associated with progression. PD-L1 tumour&#xD;
      staining was associated with responses to nivolumab, but negative staining did not rule out a&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

    <description>Ipilimumab is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activation. Ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation. The mechanism of action of ipilimumab's effect in patients with melanoma is indirect, possibly through T-cell mediated anti-tumour immune responses.</description>
