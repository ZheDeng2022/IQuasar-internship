  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The share of young workers falling into early work disability is an increasingly important&#xD;
      problem in Norway. Early withdrawal or exclusion from the labor market leads to large&#xD;
      individual and societal costs. The SEED-trial is a randomized controlled trial aiming to&#xD;
      provide evidence-based knowledge about different approaches to prevent permanent disability&#xD;
      and increase labor market participation in this important and vulnerable group. The trial&#xD;
      includes young adults aged 18-30 years who are at risk of early work disability, and the&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 interventions, both aimed at facilitating&#xD;
      participation in working life:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Traditional Vocational Rehabilitation (TVR), offering training and preparation for the&#xD;
           labor market in a sheltered environment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Supported Employment (SE), focusing on competitive employment in real-life settings&#xD;
           without long-lasting preceding training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both interventions are currently provided by The Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration&#xD;
      (NAV). Supported Employment was introduced recently and is currently being implemented, while&#xD;
      traditional vocational rehabilitation with sheltered employment has been around for years.&#xD;
      However, no Norwegian controlled studies have been conducted on these practices in this&#xD;
      population. The current study will therefore provide new knowledge of the effect of&#xD;
      traditional as well as new and promising interventions to increase labor market participation&#xD;
      and prevent early disability.&#xD;
