      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Tuberculosis (TB) is a lung infection caused by bacteria. When people with TB cough, they&#xD;
      may spread these bacteria. Researchers are looking for new TB medicines. They want to find a&#xD;
      faster way to tell if a drug might combat TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn the effect of different anti-TB drugs on microbiological, radiographic and&#xD;
      immunologic markers in people with TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults age 18-65 who weigh 30-90 kg and have common TB bacteria that can be treated with&#xD;
      common TB medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be admitted to the hospital for screening. They will have medical&#xD;
           history, physical exam, and chest radiograph. They will give blood, urine, and sputum&#xD;
           samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be put in 1 of 8 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get one or a combination of TB medicines daily for about 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each day, participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will discuss side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  May have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will spit mucus into a cup. They may breathe in saline water through a nebulizer to make&#xD;
           them cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have blood taken 3-4 times during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 2-3 Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed&#xD;
           Tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans. FDG is a radioactive sugar molecule which helps measure&#xD;
           TB disease in the lungs. It will be injected into a vein. Participants will lie in a&#xD;
           scanner that takes pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Around study day 14, participants will leave the hospital. They will be referred to a&#xD;
           local TB clinic. There they will get the standard 4 TB medicines. Those in group 8 will&#xD;
           already be on these medicines and will have another FDG-PET/CT on day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be in the study for up to 28 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early bactericidal activity (EBA), which measures decline in serial sputum colony forming&#xD;
      unit (CFU) counts over the first 2-14 days of treatment, has been used extensively as a means&#xD;
      of initially evaluating the potency of individual or combinations of antituberculous agents.&#xD;
      This approach is endorsed by the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development and the US FDA.&#xD;
      However, EBA seems to correlate poorly with the relative ability of an agent to prevent&#xD;
      relapse and produce a durable cure (often referred to as sterilizing activity ). The reasons&#xD;
      for this discrepancy may have to do with a limitation of sputum measurements to capture&#xD;
      populations that persist beyond airway surfaces in discrete lesions such as granulomas,&#xD;
      nodules, or cavities. The elimination of these persistent populations depend on the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic properties of a regimen and may be better captured by biologic and functional&#xD;
      markers that can reflect dynamic treatment effects within these relevant host environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies of the response to TB chemotherapy have identified promising new biomarkers of&#xD;
      sterilization in 2 areas. First, immunologic changes appear to have potential in small&#xD;
      subject cohorts to predict sterilizing cure within 1 month after commencing treatment.&#xD;
      Second, 18F-FDG PET/CT has been used in tuberculosis as a qualitative means of assessing drug&#xD;
      response in small case series at multiple time points, starting as early as 1 month. PET&#xD;
      activity reflects uptake and phosphorylation of FDG by neutrophils and macrophages, and CT&#xD;
      provides structural information on disease pathology. Hence, PET/CT data may offer additional&#xD;
      insights into lesion-specific sterilizing activity. This study will add 18F-FDG PET/CT scans&#xD;
      and immunological assays at 0, 2, and (in the HRZE arm) 4 weeks to standard EBA methodology&#xD;
      using regimens containing isoniazid (INH [H]), rifampin (RIF [R]), pyrazinamide (PZA [Z]),&#xD;
      moxifloxacin (MXF [M]), and ethambutol (EMB [E]). We hypothesize that drug regimens&#xD;
      associated with higher sterilizing activity (e.g., containing rifampin or pyrazinamide) will&#xD;
      show distinctive early cytokine and chemokine patterns and discrete, quantifiable changes on&#xD;
      PET/CT in certain lesion types during the 2-week period, compared to drug regimens with poor&#xD;
      sterilizing activity (e.g., containing isoniazid or moxifloxacin). Demonstration of such an&#xD;
      association would provide rationale for including radiologic and immunologic analysis,&#xD;
      alongside conventional EBA, in early phase clinical studies of novel drugs, and would also&#xD;
      provide important new insights into the biology of human and bacterial responses to TB drugs.&#xD;
