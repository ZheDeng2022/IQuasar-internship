  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel care (BC) is a time-consuming and cumbersome activity of daily living for most&#xD;
      individuals with SCI. Previous studies have reported that the average time to complete a BC&#xD;
      routine is 45 minutes; 10-20% of SCI individuals report BC routines lasting for more than 1&#xD;
      hour. In past studies, the investigators have shown that a medication called neostigmine can&#xD;
      increase bowel activity and thus, promote bowel movement. The investigators have successfully&#xD;
      used this medication with traditional and novel methods of colonoscopic preparations, and&#xD;
      have shown that it improves the quality of these preparations. In this study, we would like&#xD;
      to test the applicability of this medication to bowel care routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the addition of this medication to the beginning of regular&#xD;
      bowel regiments will significantly decrease the time and effort needed to complete BC, thus&#xD;
      improving patient perception of their BC routines and quality of life. SCI individuals&#xD;
      followed by the James J Peters VA Medical Center (JJPVAMC) SCI Medical Service are admitted&#xD;
      on a routine basis for inpatient respite care, therapy, and/or annual physicals. Such&#xD;
      inpatient stays typically range in duration from 1 week to 3 weeks, during which the patient&#xD;
      undergo BC routines assisted by the inpatient care team. BC routines are typically performed&#xD;
      every other day, or thrice weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) in &quot;Blue Rooms&quot; located on the&#xD;
      inpatient SCI wards (IE and ID). The bowel care routine, including duration of procedure, use&#xD;
      of assistive medications or devices, and completeness of bowel care are documented in the&#xD;
      patients' electronic medical chart (CPRS) by care providers. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      perform the described protocol in individuals who have been admitted to the hospital for&#xD;
      routine care and are otherwise healthy. In doing so, the investigators can ensure that&#xD;
      patients are vigilantly monitored during each BC session, and that any changes in BC pattern&#xD;
      are accurately observed and documented. Furthermore, by performing these procedures on an&#xD;
      inpatient basis, study investigators can ensure the consistency of care and daily routine,&#xD;
      allowing for better control of study conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Part 1: IV Screening Twenty subjects with chronic SCI (&gt;1 year) and difficulty with&#xD;
      evacuation (DWE) managed by a regular, thrice weekly BC routines will be recruited for study&#xD;
      participation. In order to determine eligibility for the study, the subject will have to&#xD;
      undergo an IV screening to test whether or not they are responsive to the drug treatment&#xD;
      (neostigmine-glycopyrrolate). If the subject responds (bowel movement) to the IV treatment,&#xD;
      they will be allowed to continue on to part 2 of the study. If patient does not have a&#xD;
      successful bowel movement, then they will be considered a non-responder and study&#xD;
      participation will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Baseline and Dose Titration Once eligibility has been determined, and subject consent&#xD;
      has been obtained, each subject will undergo 1 week of baseline observation after admission.&#xD;
      An abdominal x-ray (KUB) will be performed, the SCI Bowel Survey and Treatment Satisfaction&#xD;
      Questionnaire (TSQM) will be administered, and the subject's weight determined. Each subject&#xD;
      will continue with regular bowel care as an inpatient, and after 1 week, all of the baseline&#xD;
      measurements (KUB, weight and surveys) will be repeated. This will be followed by a 2 visit-&#xD;
      dose titration study of concomitantly administered, transcutaneous neostigmine methylsulfate&#xD;
      (NEO) and glycopyrrolate (GLY). Each visit will be scheduled on a BC day. All procedures will&#xD;
      take place in the &quot;Blue Room&quot; located in the SCI inpatient ward. Subjects will be prone&#xD;
      throughout the duration of the study, in a stretcher routinely used during bowel care. As&#xD;
      part of the setup, subjects will be instrumented with blood pressure cuff; intravenous access&#xD;
      will be obtained at a peripheral vein (if one is not available), as a precautionary measure,&#xD;
      since the drug will be administered via an Iontophoresis transdermal patch. Heart rate will&#xD;
      be continuously monitored throughout the procedure through finger oximetry. Symptoms will be&#xD;
      assessed every 5 minutes for the first 30 minutes, and then at 1 hour post drug&#xD;
      administration. Once the subject has a positive response to one of the two doses, or the&#xD;
      higher dose has been performed, the dose titration will be stopped. If the subject has a&#xD;
      positive response (bowel movement within 60 minutes of drug administration) he/she will be&#xD;
      eligible to continue to the third study phase. If the subject does not respond to either&#xD;
      dose, the subject will be considered a non-responder and study participation will be&#xD;
      discontinued. We expect that about 1/3rd of the subjects will be non-responders, or will be&#xD;
      lost to attrition; therefore, we are prepared to over-recruit by 5 subjects in order to&#xD;
      ensure that at least 15 subjects will be eligible to complete the second part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be stopped once the patient experiences a bowel movement within 30 minutes of&#xD;
      administering ION NEO because the protocol objective will have been achieved. If the patient&#xD;
      should experience cardiopulmonary side effects when receiving the ION NEO on the lower doses&#xD;
      that are not effectively reversed by the ION GLY, the study will be stopped. In addition, the&#xD;
      study investigators reserve the right to stop the study should they have any other safety&#xD;
      concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3: 2 Week Treatment Each subject will be assessed for their perception of their current&#xD;
      BC routine using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-Appendix 1),&#xD;
      and their bowel habits using the bowel survey (Appendix 2).The subject will then be asked to&#xD;
      continue with their normal BC routine for two weeks during their inpatient stay, with the&#xD;
      exception that NEO and GLY will be administered at the beginning of each BC session as an&#xD;
      adjunct to each subject's normal routine. Each BC session will be documented by a study team&#xD;
      member including the time needed to complete BC, methods used (i.e. number of enemas used,&#xD;
      oral laxatives, suppositories, digital stimulation, abdominal massage) and the quality and&#xD;
      completeness of the bowel movement. Heart rate, oxygenation and blood pressure will be&#xD;
      monitored continuously. Subjects will be weighed at baseline, once after each week of&#xD;
      treatment and once at the post treatment follow-up visit. After two weeks of treatment, each&#xD;
      subject will undergo a final KUB and be reassessed for their perception of the BC routine for&#xD;
      the past two weeks using the TSQM and their bowel habits (bowel survey).&#xD;
