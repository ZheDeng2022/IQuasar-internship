      This study is aimed to study the safety and feasibility of electrical muscle stimulation&#xD;
      (EMS) in suppression of tremor from various causes especially for rest tremor in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      Study method as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects will be provided the information on this research study and informed&#xD;
           consent will be sought for every subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects (30 PD patients and 30 others tremor patients) will be interviewed by a&#xD;
           movement disorders specialist or a trained interviewer for their demographic and&#xD;
           clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All PD patients will be examined for the severity of Parkinson's disease by a movement&#xD;
           disorders specialist according the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS),&#xD;
           Hoehn and Yahr score, and tremor rating scale, during the 'on period' in order to&#xD;
           determine the additional effect of EMS for suppression of tremor. Physical examinations&#xD;
           of each patient will be recorded by the video recording for later reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All essential tremor and dystonic tremor patients will be examined by a movement&#xD;
           disorders specialist for the tremor severity according to the Fahn, Tolosa, Marin Tremor&#xD;
           Rating Scale. Physical examinations of each patient will be recorded by the video&#xD;
           recording for later reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient will be determined for feasibility to use EMS and safety of EMS. Pain will&#xD;
      determined by visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be monitored their hand tremor at resting position and postural&#xD;
           position. The tremor analysis with accelerometer and gyroscope system (Parkinson Monitor&#xD;
           V0.006 Beta) and the surface EMG (Nicolet EDX Viking) will be conducted. The surface EMG&#xD;
           electrode will place over thenar muscle of the hand, which is the most predominant sided&#xD;
           of tremor, for quantitative measurement and determination of tremor physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants data from surface EMG will be applied to The Matlab™ program (MathWorks&#xD;
           Inc.) in order to modify the qualitative signals into quantitative parameters and&#xD;
           performing the high-dimensional feature vectors, and later to determine the different&#xD;
           efficacy in pulse amplitude of electrical muscle stimulation on feature vectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The electrical muscle stimulation (Intensity™ Twin Stim® III) will be conducted by&#xD;
           placement the 2 self-adhesive electrode (size 1.5 inches * 1.5 inches) over thenar&#xD;
           muscle and 1st&amp;2nd interrosseous muscle of the hand, which is the most predominant sided&#xD;
           of tremor. The EMS will be stimulated PD patients on the rest position, whereas the&#xD;
           other tremors patients in both rest position and postural position. The pulse amplitude&#xD;
           will be slowly titration until provided the tetanic muscle contraction (motor threshold)&#xD;
           without pain (all applied frequency is 50 Hz).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All of examination will be taken for 30 minutes for each one subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and clinical data: age, gender, clinical diagnosis, disease's duration and&#xD;
           severity score for each subject according to establishing standard rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tremor parameters form Parkinson Monitor V0.006 Beta will be collected in both before&#xD;
           and during EMS as 5 parameters: Peak magnitude, RMS, Angle, Frequency, Q&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pulse amplitude from EMS will be recorded in every titration in order to determine&#xD;
           the efficacy of EMS in difference pulse amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The surface EMG and acceleration signal in difference pulse amplitude will be extracted&#xD;
           and clustered data in order to analyze by using Matlab™, and performed the&#xD;
           high-dimensional feature vectors for quantitative interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The statistical analysis in this study is based from SPSS program version 17.&#xD;
      Categorical data will be analyzed for frequency and percentage. Continuous data will be&#xD;
      analyzed by mean and standard deviation (SD). Non-parametric study would be preferred if the&#xD;
      small sample size or in case of distribution of data do not present as normal distribution&#xD;
      (determined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The repeated ANOVA will be used for determined the&#xD;
      efficacy of difference pulse amplitude on tremor suppression and the efficacy of EMS in the&#xD;
      difference times in follow up periods.&#xD;
