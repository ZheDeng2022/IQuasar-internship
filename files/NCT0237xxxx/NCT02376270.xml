  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population is aging worldwide, which requires more attention to health needs and leads to&#xD;
      a dramatic increase in health care costs. Prevention or delay of onset of disorders&#xD;
      associated with aging is needed. Dietary intake of pectin, a dietary fiber, may have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on gut health parameters, i.e. intestinal barrier function, immune&#xD;
      function and microbial composition. As intestinal barrier function may be compromised in the&#xD;
      elderly we will investigate whether the effects of pectin on selected parameters of gut&#xD;
      health differ between young vs. older individuals. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of aging on pectin-induced changes in intestinal permeability.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study has seven secondary objectives. This study conforms to a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind and placebo-controlled design including two parallel arms.The study population&#xD;
      consists of Healthy human volunteers (male and female), 18-40 and 65-75 years old, BMI 20-30&#xD;
      kg/m2. One group will receive 7.5 grams of pectin supplements twice daily for four weeks. A&#xD;
      second group will receive 7.5 grams of placebo supplements twice daily for four weeks. Before&#xD;
      and after the supplementation period, several measurements will take place. The main study&#xD;
      parameter is the change in urinary sugar excretion ratio before and after the intervention&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
