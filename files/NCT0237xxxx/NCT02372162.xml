      This single center, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized observational study in patients&#xD;
      with advanced HCC. The patients qualify either to a local treatment with transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization (TACE) or to a systemic treatment with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib.&#xD;
      The aim of this feasibility study is to get a comprehensive image and molecular fingerprint&#xD;
      of individual tumors, with the intention to govern therapy decisions. Furthermore, to improve&#xD;
      the care of patients that get progressive disease under treatment, the investigators have to&#xD;
      improve the investigators understanding of the development of therapy resistance, which will&#xD;
      improve patient care at the time point of progressive disease. Therefore, the data of 20&#xD;
      patients in each group will be used to identify molecular and / or image patterns, that can&#xD;
      be used to predict treatment responses and thus govern an optimized individual cancer&#xD;
      treatment for patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;

      A single-center, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized clinical trial. The two treatment&#xD;
      groups to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE): 20 patients that are treated with TACE will&#xD;
      get an image and molecular fingerprint of the tumor prior to the first treatment with TACE, a&#xD;
      second image fingerprint between week 2 - 4 after the first treatment with TACE, and a third&#xD;
      image and molecular fingerprint at the time point of progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B Sorafenib: 20 patients that are treated with Sorafenib will get an image and&#xD;
      molecular fingerprint of the tumor prior to the first treatment, between week 2 and 3 after&#xD;
      the start of treatment and at the time point of progressive disease.&#xD;

             severe valvular heart disease, or a myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to the&#xD;
             trial entry.&#xD;
