      Thyroid Associated Ophthalmopathy is condition affecting the eyes of about 10% of patients&#xD;
      with Graves disease. Its combination of protrusion affecting the looks of the patient and&#xD;
      pain is often severely affecting the quality of life among these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment for this illness today is intravenous glucocorticoids together with&#xD;
      methotrexate. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of rituximab on patients&#xD;
      that do not respond to or relapse after conventional therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse autoimmune hyperthyroidism or Graves' disease (GD) is a common condition mainly&#xD;
      affecting women with 2-3% prevalence The increased production of thyroid hormones in GD is&#xD;
      driven by autoantibodies directed against the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor&#xD;
      (TRab). In most cases, this autoimmunity will also affect other tissues, above all the&#xD;
      orbital tissue by mechanisms not fully understood -Thyroid Associate Ophthalmopathy (TAO).&#xD;
      Symptoms and signs can be mild (grittiness, dry eyes, periorbital swollen, chemosis,&#xD;
      redness)-moderate (double eye vision, exophthalmia or severe (optic nerve compression,&#xD;
      corneal ulcers). Serious-moderate ocular engagement in TAO is seen in approximately 10% of&#xD;
      patients with GD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not only has the hyperthyroidism a marked impact on mental health, but the presence of TAO&#xD;
      has an additional negative impact on the well-being of these patients, even many years after&#xD;
      successful treatment of the hyperthyroidism. It has been suggested that smoking and stress&#xD;
      are negative prognostic factors for the course of TAO indicating that a vicious circle. MRI&#xD;
      may detect earlier changes than CT that can be used to predict the course of TAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of treatment are to retain euthyroidism which can be achieved by anti thyrostatic&#xD;
      drugs (ATD), radioiodine treatment or surgery (where patients are pre-treated with ATD) and&#xD;
      to avoid TAO as long as possible. If moderate-severe TAO occurs, high dose if intravenous&#xD;
      glucocorticoids (GC) are the gold standard considering the side effects. However, many&#xD;
      patients are non-steroid responders and for them no treatment except for acute orbital&#xD;
      decompression, retro bulbar irradiation and later reconstructive surgery can be offered. When&#xD;
      patients relapse immediately after steroids often per oral steroids are given although not&#xD;
      recommended from the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab (RTX) is a mouse-human chimeric antibody designed towards pre B and mature B&#xD;
      lymphocytes and that blocks B-cells activation without affecting the regenerating of B cells&#xD;
      from stem cells or the plasma cells immunoglobulin production. TAO is a B- lymphocyte&#xD;
      mediated disease and in two studies RTX inhibits the active phase of TAO. In a study by&#xD;
      Khanna et al a positive effect from RTX is observed in six steroid resistant patients with&#xD;
      TAO with a decrease of the inflammation in the orbit, even though no effect on strabismus or&#xD;
      proptosis was observed. In another study by Salvi et al , RTX treatment is compared with&#xD;
      steroids as a first line treatment for TAO and after 30 weeks of follow up in an unrandomised&#xD;
      study design. RTX decreased the activity and severity significantly compared to the steroid&#xD;
      group. No relapse was observed in the RTX group but in the steroid group (10%). In the RTX&#xD;
      all patients improved, but in the steroid group only 65%. There were more side-effects in the&#xD;
      steroid group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection criteria All patients with indication for i.v GC will be evaluate for the study.&#xD;
      The patients are recruited consecutively from the region as we are a tertial referral center&#xD;
      and iv steroids for TAO is not given on local hospitals..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and study design All patients aged 18-70 years in the western region in Sweden with&#xD;
      TAO and indication for iv GC (CAS ≥4) will be evaluated for this prospective open study with&#xD;
      RTX+MTX to GC non-responders. If GC respondent but relapsing after 12 weeks of iv GC&#xD;
      treatment, patients will be randomized to RTX+MTX or per oral GC+MTX. If non respondent after&#xD;
      4 weeks of intravenous steroid infusion the patient will be eligible for RTX treatment&#xD;
      Patients are seen for ophthalmological and endocrine investigations at baseline, 4, 12, 18,&#xD;
      32, 44, 56 and 68 weeks. At similar occasions anthropometric measurements, immunological&#xD;
      markers and measures of GC effects (ACTH test, body composition (not all occasions)) will be&#xD;
      performed. At baseline and after 30 weeks high quality MRI and Gallium (GA)-PET is performed.&#xD;
      Patients undergoing Ga-PET in another study focusing on pituitary imaging (principle&#xD;
      investigator HFN) will serve as controls for orbital muscles. The aim of the RTX study is to&#xD;
      recruit at least 10 patients in the RTX arm and probably 40-50 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study with this design has previously been published. The present situation does not offer&#xD;
      the patients not responding to GC or with relapses after iv GC infusions any effective&#xD;
      treatment. If the RTX proves safe and effective future non-respondent patients will be able&#xD;
      to get this treatment. In small studies RTX have had a good effect in TAO, sometimes even&#xD;
      better than GC and with less side-effects. It will also lay the ground for future studies&#xD;
      that compare RTX and GC in a randomised study design as first line treatment. If GA-PET shows&#xD;
      useful in the management of patients with TAO it may become a routine investigation.&#xD;
