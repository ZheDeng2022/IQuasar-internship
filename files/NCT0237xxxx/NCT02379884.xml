      This is a prospective observational study evaluating all patients requiring mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. Data will be gathered regarding the events prior to ventilation and the&#xD;
      indication for mechanical ventilation. In-hospital and post-admission outcome will be&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;

      Background The aging of the population associated with increased morbidity, on one hand, and&#xD;
      technological advances providing life-sustaining treatments on the other, resulted in an&#xD;
      increased number of mechanically ventilated patients in Internal Medicine wards. In a&#xD;
      previous study the investigators found that about half of the hospitalization days in&#xD;
      intermediate care units in Internal Medicine wards were utilized by older patients at the end&#xD;
      of life. The mortality at 6 months from the time of admission was greater than 70%, unrelated&#xD;
      to the type of treatment. The majority of the elderly patients surviving the acute stage were&#xD;
      transferred to chronic long-term care hospitals. The Public Health System in Israel invests&#xD;
      costly resources in providing care to mechanically ventilated patients in both acute and&#xD;
      chronic care settings, in spite of unproved benefit on the quality of life and on life&#xD;
      expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of patients and the factors affecting the decision-making process and&#xD;
           outcome in mechanically ventilated patients in Internal Medicine wards in acute care&#xD;
           hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Development of a predictive model to classifying mechanically ventilated patients by&#xD;
           outcome on the basis of patient characteristics on admission and the factors involved in&#xD;
           decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of medical resource investment according to the study model groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis Identification of parameters predicting better outcome and potential for&#xD;
      rehabilitation in elderly mechanically ventilated internal medicine patients, versus patients&#xD;
      with poorer outcome who would need palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study is a prospective observational study carried out in five Internal Medicine&#xD;
      wards and the Medical Intensive Care Unit at the Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa, Israel.&#xD;
      All patients requiring mechanical ventilation will be included. Patients' medical and&#xD;
      demographic data will be obtained from the hospital computerized record system. Data will be&#xD;
      gathered regarding the events prior to ventilation and the indication for mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. In-hospital and post-admission outcome will be monitored. Mortality at 6 months&#xD;
      will be obtained from the Israel National Population Registry. Descriptive statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed, and multivariate logistic regression analysis will be applied to&#xD;
      identify variables contributing to the need for ventilation and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of the study The approval of the 2005 Dying Patient Act in Israel, allowed for&#xD;
      withholding of certain life-sustaining interventions at end of life. However, once an&#xD;
      intervention such as mechanical ventilation has been commenced, the Law does not permit its&#xD;
      withdrawing, making the decision to ventilate a patient irreversible. There is thus a clear&#xD;
      need to improve the decision-making process related to undertaking mechanical ventilation in&#xD;
      elderly internal medicine patients. In addition, the investigators believe that the study&#xD;
      will highlight the issue and bring the policy makers to the establishing practical tools for&#xD;
      health care professionals. The investigators also hope that the study will incite the general&#xD;
      public attention to address the issue of advanced directives regarding undergoing invasive&#xD;
      treatments such as mechanical ventilation at end of life. Finally, the investigators consider&#xD;
      that adoption of a more evidence-based approach to undertaking mechanical ventilation, and&#xD;
      consideration of patients' advanced directives, by health care providers in both community&#xD;
      and in-patient settings, will lead to a better utilization of health resources and&#xD;
      improvement of end of life of care.&#xD;
