      This small pilot will allow surgeons to perform wireless breast lumpectomies using a new&#xD;
      magnetic technology. This is a continuation of a previous project testing the technology, and&#xD;
      the breast surgeons comfort level using this new technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to develop a new technique for surgical excision of lesions either&#xD;
      through surgical biopsy or lumpectomy. The current standard of care involves placing a needle&#xD;
      then slender wire through the lesion under image guidance by a radiologist. The surgeon then&#xD;
      removes the lesion using the wire as a guide. This new technique would place a magnet through&#xD;
      the lesion under image guidance by a radiologist. The surgeon would then use the MagneProbe&#xD;
      in the operating room to locate the magnet and remove the lesion. This new technique would&#xD;
      eliminate the use of a wire that protrudes from a patient's breast. This wire is usually&#xD;
      placed on the day of surgery, prior to the procedure. The goal of this new technique is to&#xD;
      eliminate wire placement and increase patient comfort throughout the day of her surgery.&#xD;

      Pilot II: Before embarking on pivotal efficacy studies, we propose a pilot II study to&#xD;
      address the ease of transition from use of the MagneWire to fully implanted MagneMarkers.&#xD;
      Before embarking on a pivotal study, comparing the wireless MagneMarker with a standard&#xD;
      breast localization wire, we propose an open label single arm pilot II study. In the pilot II&#xD;
      study each surgeon (n=3) will treat 14 cases with the MagneMarker using magnetic localization&#xD;
      alone. The outcomes of this study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Completeness of excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time for the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview: The goal of the MagneMark system is to replace the use of wires with the use of&#xD;
      fully implanted MagneMarkers. In the Pilot II trial patients will be localized on the morning&#xD;
      of their surgery comparable to the timeline utilized in a traditional wire localization&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for surgeons: Experienced breast surgeons practicing at Maimonides Medical Center&#xD;
      with full proficiency at standard wire localized excisions as well as sentinel lymph node&#xD;
      biopsy who have completed the required number of MagneWire guided excisions for training on&#xD;
      the MagneMark system. Because this is a single arm pilot there will be no blinding of the&#xD;
      surgeons involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for patients: Eligible patients have a single non-palpable breast cancer&#xD;
      (invasive or DCIS) requiring preoperative needle localization with a single wire. Lesions may&#xD;
      include discrete solitary mammographically or sonographically identified targets that can be&#xD;
      definitively identified by specimen imaging, including previously biopsied lesions that have&#xD;
      been marked by a biopsy site marker. All patients who are eligible will be consented for off&#xD;
      label use of the MagneMarker system there will be no randomization, blinding or&#xD;
      stratification of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Location: All procedures will be completed at the Maimonides Medical Center.&#xD;
      Localizations will happen in the radiology suite at the Maimonides Breast Center and&#xD;
      excisions will happen at the Ambulatory Surgery Center at Maimonides Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: For the enrolled patients participation in the trial is limited to the amount of&#xD;
      time the localization and excision procedures take, approximately 5 hours. To enroll enough&#xD;
      patients for three surgeons to complete fourteen surgeries we anticipate that recruitment&#xD;
      will continue for one calendar year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of device: The MagneJector will be used to insert a 1x20mm Arnokrome MagneMarker&#xD;
      and anchor it in position with its center anchors centered in the target. Sonographic guided&#xD;
      localizations will be performed with the MagneJector hand held while mammographic guided&#xD;
      localizations will be performed on dedicated prone stereo tables with the MagneJector mounted&#xD;
      on a rail. The Arnokrome component of the MagneMarker will be coated with Parylene, a plastic&#xD;
      polymer meeting the International Organization for Standardization 10993 standards for&#xD;
      biocompatibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration: moving through a MagneMark study procedure day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. On the day of the localization procedure, the patient will go to one of the three&#xD;
           radiologist involved in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The radiologist will insert the study device using the MagneJector.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient will be transported t the surgical suite for excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Surgery will be performed at the ambulatory surgery suite of Maimonides Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The surgeon will use the MagneProbe to identify the location of the MagneMarker as well&#xD;
           as the lesion, and remove both the MagneMarker and lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data endpoints: the rate of successful excision of the target lesion, the size and weight of&#xD;
      the specimens removed and the presence or absence of positive tumor margins will serve as&#xD;
      primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints will include the length of stay for the day of surgery&#xD;
      with the hypothesis that length of stay will be significantly reduced. Additional endpoints&#xD;
      will include comparison of the accuracy and precision of centering the marker in the center&#xD;
      of the lesion.&#xD;
