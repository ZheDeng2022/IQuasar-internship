      This is an open-label, non-randomised pilot study, to evaluate user performance and system&#xD;
      accuracy in blood Glucose monitoring system with glucose adjustment. Twelve male and female&#xD;
      volunteers aged 18-45, with a documented diagnosis of Type I diabetes for at least 12 will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study.&#xD;
