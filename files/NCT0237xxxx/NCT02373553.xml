      MB Children maintains the same postural pattern in preoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      adenotonsillectomy? The age influences the incidence of more exacerbated postural changes?&#xD;
      The proposed early physiotherapy intervention can minimize future functional deficits? Trying&#xD;
      to answer some of these questions, the objective of present study is to investigate the&#xD;
      initial kinematics of the shoulder girdle, cervical and thoracic spine in MB children pre and&#xD;
      post adenotonsillectomy and then evaluate the effects of a physical therapy intervention&#xD;
      program for MB children who persisted with postural changes.&#xD;

      Although oral breathing children be studied by otolaryngologists, allergists, orthodontists,&#xD;
      speech therapists and physiotherapists and the prevalence of mouth breathing range from 26.6%&#xD;
      to 53.3% in Brazilian studies, physical, medical and social problems arising from the Mouth&#xD;
      Breathing Syndrome(MB) are still not recognized as a public health problem. Behavioral&#xD;
      changes in sleep quality and craniofacial development and consequently the quality of life&#xD;
      after surgical, orthodontic and multidisciplinary approach to the MB children are&#xD;
      known.However, little is known about the effectiveness of early physical therapy&#xD;
      intervention, whereas postural abnormalities characteristic of mouth breathing children are&#xD;
      relevant and that the postural pattern adopted may persist into adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare linear measurements of elevation, scapular abduction and depression among MB&#xD;
           children in preoperative and postoperative adenotonsillectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the angular measurements of upper / lower rotation, external / internal&#xD;
           rotation, anterior / posterior tilt of the scapula and thoracic kyphosis, protrusion and&#xD;
           retraction of the head and shoulders of protrusion and retraction group of MB children&#xD;
           preoperative and postoperative adenotonsillectomy 3. Evaluate the impact of physical&#xD;
           therapy intervention postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Cohort cross-sectional PARTICIPANTS: The sample size calculation was based on&#xD;
      the results of Correa et al (2008) , who report similar to the effects of intervention&#xD;
      proposed in this study.45 children will be recruited from the Clinic of MOUTH BREATHING (ARO)&#xD;
      of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). To ensure adequate statistical power in&#xD;
      case of loss to follow-up will be considered sample of 55 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: 45 both male and female mouthbreathing children belonging to any racial&#xD;
      group aged 4-10 years completed INCLUSION CRITERIA: diagnosis of upper airway obstruction by&#xD;
      endoscopy (pharyngeal tonsil occupying 80% or more of the nasopharynx and / or palatine&#xD;
      tonsils 3 or 4 ), history of oral route of access and loss of passive lip seal, display good&#xD;
      understanding and whose family can signing the consent form approved by the Ethics Committee&#xD;
      of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (COEP ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: children with neurological disorders, or endocrine abnormalities that&#xD;
      compromise the normal development of growth, with the presence of ankylosis, severe lung&#xD;
      disease, congenital heart defects, craniofacial abnormalities with syndromic and who are&#xD;
      unfit to perform the procedures proposed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES Assessment and endoscopy will be held at ARO / UFMG where children will be&#xD;
      screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study. After passing the&#xD;
      COEP, officials who accept to participate in the study must sign the Instrument of Consent.&#xD;
      The collection of kinematic data will be held in the Motion Analysis Laboratory, Department&#xD;
      of Physical Therapy. The physiotherapy intervention will be held at ARO, who works regularly&#xD;
      on Thursdays for a period of three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROTOCOL: Demographic and clinical data will be collected from all participants. All&#xD;
      the measure proposed below will be obtained previously (T0) and three months after surgery&#xD;
      (T1). By completing measures based process randomisation will be performed and the patients&#xD;
      will be divided into 3 groups: GROUP 1(G1) - without physical interventions, only oral health&#xD;
      education; GROUP 2 (G2)- guidance booklet for home with some stretched exercises and GROUP&#xD;
      3(G3) exercises -physiotherapy intervention proposal for a period of three months. After&#xD;
      three months of allocation groups G1, G2 and G3 new measures will be carried out (T2). Those&#xD;
      children who are identified with persistent postural changes will be forwarded to continue&#xD;
      the specialized treatment.The G3 will be submitted to the postural reeducation through&#xD;
      lengthening of the anterior muscles and strengthening of the posterior muscles of the trunk&#xD;
      in a sitting position, in ventral and dorsal recumbency, including manual techniques,&#xD;
      stretching the sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles. Exercises for pelvic girdle&#xD;
      positioning and stretching the hamstrings muscles tibial and sural triceps are associated&#xD;
      with respiratory exercise. G2 family will receive a booklet of guidance of exercises to be&#xD;
      performed at home and the G3 will not receive targeted intervention .&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASURES: The kinematics of the shoulder girdle, cervical and thoracic spine of the&#xD;
      participants will be obtained through the System Qualysis ProReflex ® in 3 times, regarding&#xD;
      reliability. This is a photogrammetry system based on video that has four cameras with&#xD;
      illumination stroboscopy produced by a group of infrared reflectors located around the lens&#xD;
      of each camera. Infrared light designed for each camera is reflected by passive markers&#xD;
      placed on specific points or anatomical points on the body of the participants. The&#xD;
      reflection of light on passive markers is captured by cameras generating a two-dimensional&#xD;
      (2D) image of the respective positions of these markers. The triangulation of the images of&#xD;
      at least two cameras, allows the reconstruction in three dimensions (3D) passive reflective&#xD;
      of brands. Data obtained are processed by the Track Manager software. Subsequently, data are&#xD;
      transferred to the Mat Lab program (Matrix Laboratory) software, where the angular&#xD;
      measurements are calculated using the arc tangent function. For the measurements of the&#xD;
      orientation of the cervical spine, scapula, and thoracic spine, sixteen reflective tags are&#xD;
      used, 15mm diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TITLE:The orientation of the scapula includes three angular measurements (lower and upper&#xD;
      rotation / anterior / posterior tilt, internal rotation / external) and two linear&#xD;
      measurements (elevation and abduction). Upward rotation (U-Rot) A: occurs perpendicularly to&#xD;
      the anterior-posterior axis and corresponds to the lateralization of the inferior angle of&#xD;
      the scapula in relation to the spinal column on the frontal plane such that the glenoid&#xD;
      cavity is oriented upwardly. Angle A was obtained from the intersection of a straight line&#xD;
      passing through the C7 and T7 markers, a straight line passing through the medial edge of the&#xD;
      scapula over the markers on the root of the spine and a marker over the inferior angle of the&#xD;
      scapula.Scapular abduction (S-Abd) lateral shift of the scapula in relation to the spinal&#xD;
      column. Horizontal distance (B) in millimeters from the centroid point of the scapula to the&#xD;
      spinal column . Greater distance between markers indicated greater scapular&#xD;
      abduction.Scapular elevation (S-Ele): linear upward shift of the scapular over the thoracic&#xD;
      cage. C was obtained from the vertical distance in millimeters from the marker positioned&#xD;
      over C7 to the centroid point of the scapula. Greater scapular elevation indicated a lesser&#xD;
      distance between markers Measures of kyphosis of the thoracic spine, protraction / retraction&#xD;
      and protraction of the head / shoulder retraction will also be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIME FRAME: 3 months after each assessment with safety issue INTERVENTION PROTOCOLS The G3&#xD;
      will be submitted to the postural reeducation through lengthening of the anterior muscles and&#xD;
      strengthening of the posterior muscles of the trunk in a sitting position, in ventral and&#xD;
      dorsal recumbency, including manual techniques, stretching the sternocleidomastoid and&#xD;
      scalene muscles. Exercises for pelvic girdle positioning and stretching the hamstrings&#xD;
      muscles tibial and sural triceps are associated with respiratory exercise. G2 family will&#xD;
      receive a booklet of guidance of exercises to be performed at home and the G1 group did not&#xD;
      receive intervention.&#xD;
