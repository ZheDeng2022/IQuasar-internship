  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexamethasone is a steroid commonly used for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting (CINV). While effective, high dose dexamethasone is associated with numerous&#xD;
      side effects, even when used for a short duration. One such effect is elevated blood glucose,&#xD;
      or hyperglycemia. Current literature suggests increased risk of infection, poor wound&#xD;
      healing, and increased mortality in non-cancer surgical patients with steroid-induced&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. There is also evidence to support that elevations in blood glucose are&#xD;
      associated with worsened outcomes in cancer patients. Much of this data comes from cancer&#xD;
      patients that are treated in an inpatient setting where blood glucose is routinely checked.&#xD;
      Limited data is available describing the fluctuations in blood glucose following&#xD;
      dexamethasone administration in cancer patients being managed in an outpatient setting, such&#xD;
      as the Anschutz Cancer Pavilion (ACP) Infusion Clinic. This study aims to characterize the&#xD;
      effects dexamethasone has on blood glucose in cancer patients by utilizing Continuous Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring (CGM) devices. These devices are minimally invasive, are FDA approved, and can&#xD;
      produce real-time data of blood glucose fluctuations over a course of 3-7 days. By inserting&#xD;
      the devices under the skin of the abdomen, the investigators can evaluate the temporal&#xD;
      relationship between glucose abnormalities and dexamethasone administration. Results from&#xD;
      this study will not only increase the knowledge base of dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemia&#xD;
      and identify patients at increased risk, but also allow future research to be conducted in&#xD;
      order to determine if standard protocols can proactively minimize steroid-induced glucose&#xD;
      fluctuations.&#xD;
