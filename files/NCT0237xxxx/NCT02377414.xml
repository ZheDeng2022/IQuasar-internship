  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study in healthy, adult Japanese women will characterize the PK, safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of retosiban at the therapeutic doses planned to be evaluated in Phase 3. The PK data will be&#xD;
      compared to a sub-set of Caucasian women given the same dose of retosiban. This study has two&#xD;
      cohorts, cohort 1 will be a double-blind sponsor-open (subjects and investigator blinded and&#xD;
      sponsor unblinded), randomized, continuous 48 hours (h) infusion study in healthy, adult&#xD;
      Japanese women of child-bearing potential. Cohort 2 is an open label and continuous retosiban&#xD;
      48 h infusion study in Caucasian, adult, healthy women of child bearing potential. So, the PK&#xD;
      can be compared with those of Japanese women. Approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled. In&#xD;
      cohort 1, approximately 24 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to retosiban and placebo&#xD;
      (2:1 ratio) to have 18 women with 12 active, 6 placebo completed subjects. In Cohort 2, 8&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled to have 6 competed subjects. The total duration of a subject's&#xD;
      involvement in this part is anticipated to be up to 6 weeks (including the 28 day screening&#xD;
      period).&#xD;
