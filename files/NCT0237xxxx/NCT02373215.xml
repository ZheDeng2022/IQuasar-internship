  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center clinical research study with the purpose to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of nalbuphine HCl ER (extended release) tablets in&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) therapy and reporting&#xD;
      pruritus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PK of nalbuphine hemodialysis (HD) patients is unknown and will be investigated under&#xD;
      controlled dialysis conditions in the proposed clinical PK study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nalbuphine is a small molecular weight, water-soluble molecule with low protein binding&#xD;
      (approximately 50%) and a large volume of distribution. In addition, its disposition is&#xD;
      perfusion-rate limited. In the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on HD, nalbuphine&#xD;
      plasma clearance may be impacted, although it is predominantly hepatically cleared in the&#xD;
      feces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose-escalation design was selected to mimic nalbuphine use in uremic pruritus (UP)&#xD;
      patients in subsequent clinical efficacy studies whereby patients will start at a low dose to&#xD;
      minimize the AEs such as nausea and vomiting and allow the patients to develop some tolerance&#xD;
      to these particular AEs.&#xD;
