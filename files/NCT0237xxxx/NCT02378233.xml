      The aim of the study is to measure urinary milk iodine concentration (MIC), iodine&#xD;
      concentration (UIC), thyroid hormones (TSH, FT4) and thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOab) in&#xD;
      breast-feeding women, and UIC in their nursing infants to determine if the levels are&#xD;
      adequate, and to see how they can be influenced by 150 ug daily iodine supplementation in&#xD;
      breast-feeding women. The hypothesis is that there is a relative iodine deficiency in this&#xD;
      sub-population - lactating women and nursing children-, and that this can be influenced by&#xD;
      iodine supplementation. Adequate thyroid hormone and iodine levels are very important for&#xD;
      small children, when the plasticity of the brain is greatest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is as a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 221 mothers and their&#xD;
      infants. In parallel, 90 age-matched healthy non-pregnant women are recruited. Mothers are&#xD;
      randomized to 150 µg/day iodide supplementation or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women are asked for participation on a visit in pregnancy week 37, at the mother&#xD;
      health care (MVC) at Mölnlycke and Skövde. The study will run for approximately 3 months for&#xD;
      each individual and begins by sampling A (UIC, TSH, FT4, TPOab) at week 37 of the pregnancy,&#xD;
      when mothers also get randomized to 150 µg iodine or placebo. New sampling B (UIC, TSH, FT4,&#xD;
      MIC ) is collected when the baby is 3 months old. Thereafter the study is completed. In&#xD;
      parallel, 90 healthy non-pregnant, non-lactating women in the same age range are recruited&#xD;
      and followed with UIC, TSH, FT4, TPOab for 6 months as a control group. In each case a simple&#xD;
      questionnaire is filled and blood is also frozen for future analyses.&#xD;

      Are the mothers to be treated with 150 µg iodide per day during lactation to guarantee normal&#xD;
      intake of iodine in breast-milk (MIC) and normal urinary iodine concentration (UIC) in their&#xD;
      off-spring?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and Aim This prospective, placebo-controlled study focus on the question whether&#xD;
      lactating mothers shall add 150 µg iodide po to guarantee normal MIC and UIC levels in their&#xD;
      children or not, as current iodinating program does not guarantee normal levels in these&#xD;
      subgroups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary aim: To compare the MIC and UIC of the children to lactating mothers receiving&#xD;
           150 µg iodide or receiving placebo and compare to WHO recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary aim: To study UIC in the mothers during lactation compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the frequency of thyroid dysfunction in lactating women and whether it differs among&#xD;
      patients on 150 µg or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the UIC concentration in the children breast fed by mothers receiving placebo is lower&#xD;
      than the recommended levels by the WHO and if these levels are normalized with 150 µg iodide&#xD;
      to the mother this study will be the supportive study for national authorities in Sweden,&#xD;
      Europe and in the world to recommend all lactating mothers to add 150 µg when breast feeding&#xD;
      even if the country is judged iodine sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey of the field Iodine deficiency in the nature affects thyroid function The supply of&#xD;
      iodine varies in different parts of the world, mainly because of varying levels of iodine in&#xD;
      the ground water, different soils and plants, different distribution of sea-food, and&#xD;
      dissimilar diary food consumption. In many areas with depleted soils and a long distance to&#xD;
      the sea, iodine deficiency (ID) is still a major health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate dietary iodine intake is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. Low&#xD;
      iodine intake results in the development of hypothyroidism and goiter. Impaired production of&#xD;
      thyroid hormones during pregnancy affects growth and brain development in the progeny. Iodine&#xD;
      deficiency in school-age children impairs somatic growth, cognitive performance and motor&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine insufficiency outside Sweden Iodine deficiency remains a public health problem in 47&#xD;
      countries worldwide. Although most countries worldwide have implemented universal salt&#xD;
      iodization , countries like Australia, New Zealand and several European countries have been&#xD;
      reporting reoccurring iodine deficiency. Changes in food consumption patterns, legislation&#xD;
      not covering processed food and decreased salt consumption impose new challenges in ensuring&#xD;
      adequate iodine nutrition in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine sufficiency in Sweden In Sweden, goitre was first described by Carl von Linné in 1747,&#xD;
      and in the beginning of the 20th century, goitre was detected in 60% of cases in certain&#xD;
      areas (19) and in 18% of the total population . A national survey conducted in 1929 confirmed&#xD;
      endemic goitre regions located in the inner or eastern part of the country: these iodine&#xD;
      deficient areas were known as the &quot;goitre-belt&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observations contributed to initiation of the Swedish national iodine fortification&#xD;
      program for salt in 1936. Initially, 10 mg of potassium iodide (KI) was added to every&#xD;
      kilogram salt. In 1966, this was increased to the current level of 50 mg/kg salt, as goitre&#xD;
      was still prevalent in some regions of the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first national evaluation of iodine status in Sweden was performed by our group according&#xD;
      to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). Urinary iodine concentration&#xD;
      (UIC) was measured in a representative national sample of children aged 6-12 years: the&#xD;
      national median UIC was 125 μg/L, indicating optimal iodine nutrition . However, thyroid&#xD;
      volumes were higher in Swedish school children than in the international reference study,&#xD;
      which may be an effect from genetic and other environmental factors. Iodine intake is&#xD;
      considered optimal in Sweden. These findings underline the importance of regular monitoring&#xD;
      of iodine intake, especially concerning the decreased intake of table salt that is likely to&#xD;
      follow health campaigns and patients with higher need of iodine may be at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine demands increase during pregnancy and lactating The need of iodine is increased during&#xD;
      pregnancy and lactating because of the increased thyroid hormone production and enrichment of&#xD;
      iodine in breast-milk. An intake of iodide during pregnancy and breast feeding of 250 µg is&#xD;
      recommended compared to 150 µg/day in the normal population. Severe iodine deficiency in the&#xD;
      new-borne results in cretinism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most critical period except for the prenatal period for the child is the two first years&#xD;
      of life when the brain still develops. An enhanced risk period is the first 6 month of life&#xD;
      when the child is breast-feeding. During this period the child is depending on the iodine&#xD;
      concentration in the milk, which is a direct consequence of the mother iodine nutrition. When&#xD;
      the infant starts to eat, iodide is supplied from the food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have measured both thyroid hormones and MIC in women living in iodine&#xD;
      sufficient and insufficient regions, which are summarized in three reviews . Three studies&#xD;
      have evaluated iodine nutrition in infants longitudinally , whereas the most recent from New&#xD;
      Zealand is the longest; during 6 months maternal and infant iodine status were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the world and the communities of thyroid disease the question is debated whether or not&#xD;
      iodide shall be given to pregnant women. American thyroid Association (ATA) has made a strong&#xD;
      recommendation for this in fear the even mild iodine deficiency in small children may affect&#xD;
      the brain development negatively. WHO has modified their guidelines of supplementation to&#xD;
      whether the nation is regarded iodine sufficient, including sufficient levels in pregnant and&#xD;
      lactating women (category 1), where no iodide supplementation is need, or not sufficient. The&#xD;
      latter group is divided in two; one group where most patient, but &lt;90%, eat iodinated salt&#xD;
      and UIC &lt;100 (category 2) and one group with similarly low UIC but where iodized salt is&#xD;
      scarcely used (category 3). An iodine supplement of 150 µg is the recommendation in these&#xD;
      countries. However, in 2010 Mulrine et al performed a placebo controlled study the first 6&#xD;
      months postpartum. The mothers were iodine deficient, as New Zealand had not implemented an&#xD;
      iodizing program, and were supplemented with 75 or 150 µg/day. Both mother and child had UIC&#xD;
      and MIC lower than recommend by the WHO. The authors encourage a study done in the&#xD;
      circumstances of iodine sufficiency in the nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from pregnant and lactating women in Sweden are scares. Two small local studies reports&#xD;
      median UIC 145-178 µg/dag and 89 µg/l during pregnancy. More knowledge is needed to judge if&#xD;
      Swedish woman shall have and iodine supplementation of 150 µg/day or not during this&#xD;
      vulnerable period of life for their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project description Study design This is a prospective, double-blinded placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial of 221 lactating women and their children. Mothers are randomized to 150 µg/day iodine&#xD;
      supplementation or placebo for 15 weeks. In parallel 90 healthy female controls are recruited&#xD;
      from the same community stratified for age and smoking habits. Patients are included after&#xD;
      week 36 in pregnancy by the midwife and urinary iodine concentration (UIC), thyroid hormones&#xD;
      levels and thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPO-ab) are assessed and a simple questionnaire is&#xD;
      filled in by the pregnant women. Placebo/iodine is started at the same visit (allocation&#xD;
      1:1). At the visit 13 (13±1) weeks postpartum UIC, thyroid hormones levels and&#xD;
      thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPO-ab) are assessed in all mothers and a simple questionnaire is&#xD;
      filled in. MIC is measured in those who still breast-feed. UIC is measured in babies. At all&#xD;
      occasion blood specimens are taken, blood is also frozen for future analyses. Weight and&#xD;
      length are registered postnatal in the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Patients At the antenatal care unit at Mölnlycke and Skövde Health Care&#xD;
      center 221 pregnant women aged 18-40 years will be collected consecutively according to&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
