      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Heart disease is the leading cause of death and disabilities in the United States. Diets&#xD;
      high in fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of heart disease. Fruits, including red&#xD;
      tart cherries and purple aroniaberries, may be especially beneficial. Researchers want to&#xD;
      know how tart cherry and aroniaberry extracts affect heart health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the benefits of tart cherry and aroniaberry extract on vascular function and other&#xD;
      measures. These include inflammation, oxidation, and cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Men and post-menopausal women ages 55 70 in good health and with normal or slightly high&#xD;
      blood pressure or cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 6 visits. They will have blood taken at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood vessel tests. Participants will lie down. Heart rhythm will be monitored. A device&#xD;
           will be placed on the upper arm, and pictures of blood vessels will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood pressure cuff will be tightened around the lower arm for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardio-Ankle-Vascular Index (CAVI). Blood pressure cuffs will be placed on both arms and&#xD;
           legs. They will be tightened with air at the same time for a few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be assigned to one of three groups. For 3 weeks each, in random order,&#xD;
           they will take: aroniaberry capsules, tart cherry capsules, placebo capsules, and no&#xD;
           capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions online about their eating and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be keep a record of what they eat for a few periods. They will come&#xD;
           for a study visit every 3 weeks through week 15.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the leading cause of death and disability&#xD;
      worldwide. Cardiovascular disease can be age-related in both onset and progression. The aging&#xD;
      process causes failure in protective vascular mechanisms leading to pathophysiological&#xD;
      changes and increased risk of CVD. Heart healthy strategies including consumption of diets&#xD;
      rich in fruits and vegetables reduce risk and prevent CVD. There is growing experimental&#xD;
      evidence that certain fruits and berries including, cherries and aroniaberries, may be&#xD;
      cardioprotective due to their antioxidant and vasodilatory properties, and beneficial&#xD;
      modulation of immune function and inflammation. However, there are limited human studies that&#xD;
      have examined these effects. In older adults, vascular aging predominantly includes increased&#xD;
      arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction. Oxidative stress and inflammation are also&#xD;
      linked to the aging process. Therefore, this study will investigate the effects of tart&#xD;
      cherry and aroniaberry supplementation on endothelial function (flow-mediated brachial artery&#xD;
      dilation) and arterial stiffness (cardio-ankle vascular index) as indicators of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk and atherosclerosis. These measurements also provide an assessment of&#xD;
      arterial structure and function. Biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction, inflammation,&#xD;
      vascular injury, oxidation, lipids, as well as flavonoid and phenolic acid profiles will also&#xD;
      be examined. Importantly, the role of genetics and its environmental interactions as causal&#xD;
      factors in CVD are not completely understood. There is also limited data on the plasma&#xD;
      proteome and the changes in physiological processes that may result from interventions with&#xD;
      diet or nutrients. This study will explore the association between responses to tart cherry&#xD;
      or aroniaberry supplementation and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in loci related to&#xD;
      the study s outcomes and to the risk of CVD. Moreover, the association between these two&#xD;
      supplements and a proteomic panel of plasma proteins involved in several physiological&#xD;
      pathways and CVD will also be investigated. In a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial, 96 healthy older adults (ages 55-70) will be&#xD;
      given tart cherry alternating with aroniaberry supplementation daily for 3 weeks each while&#xD;
      on their usual diet. This study will include an initial screening visit followed by 6 visits&#xD;
      at 3 week intervals consisting of treatment, washout and placebo periods. This investigation&#xD;
      will provide important information on the role of flavonoidrich nutrients and their effect on&#xD;
      arterial structure and function. Relating genomic and proteomic signatures to the outcomes of&#xD;
      this study will be useful in developing future therapeutic strategies to lower CVD risk.&#xD;
