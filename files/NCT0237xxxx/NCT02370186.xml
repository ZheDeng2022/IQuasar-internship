  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe sepsis results in over 300,000 Emergency Department (ED) visits and 215,000 deaths&#xD;
      annually in the US. Currently there are no effective drug therapies for sepsis. High density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (HDL) has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic properties and is&#xD;
      protective in sepsis. Its functions in sepsis are primarily mediated by its main&#xD;
      apolipoprotein, Apo-A1, that: 1) neutralize potent bacterial toxins, 2) protect blood vessel&#xD;
      walls from damage, 3) prevent tissue damage through antioxidant properties, and 4) mediate&#xD;
      thymocyte apoptosis (critical for survival) and endogenous corticosteroid release. However,&#xD;
      recent literature presents inconsistent data on HDL functionality and shows that HDL becomes&#xD;
      non-functional during acute inflammatory states called dysfunctional HDL (Dys-HDL). Several&#xD;
      causes for Dys-HDL have been hypothesized including the presence of Apo A1 polymorphisms,&#xD;
      which may worsen the pathologic inflammatory response in sepsis and have been demonstrated in&#xD;
      early sepsis, making Dys-HDL an unstudied potential early marker. This project aims to: 1)&#xD;
      determine the presence of Dys-HDL in adult patients with early severe sepsis who present to&#xD;
      the ED (Dys-HDL will be tested using a novel cell free assay and HDL Inflammatory Index will&#xD;
      be measured), and 2) examine the relationship between Dys-HDL and cumulative organ&#xD;
      dysfunction via Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Results of this study could&#xD;
      establish Dys-HDL as an early disease marker for sepsis which is influential in the&#xD;
      development of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction.&#xD;

      Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to infection, which leads to acute organ&#xD;
      dysfunction and shock. Current therapies are aimed at normalizing hemodynamic parameters&#xD;
      during early sepsis resuscitation to reduce mortality. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      future strategies should be personalized, and should target the mediators of the septic&#xD;
      response on an individual patient basis. One of these mediators is HDL which works by&#xD;
      facilitating clearance of bacterial toxins, maintaining the integrity of the endothelium, and&#xD;
      preventing inflammation, a function performed by Apo-A1. The association of HDL with&#xD;
      cardiovascular health has been well-studied in the Caucasian and Asian populations, where&#xD;
      research has demonstrated that HDL can become pro-inflammatory and thus may not perform its&#xD;
      functions of being anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-oxidant. Such HDL is called&#xD;
      Dys-HDL. Dys-HDL or pro-inflammatory HDL may play a pivotal role in sepsis, an area that has&#xD;
      not been fully studied. The mechanism by which HDL becomes dysfunctional is one of debate,&#xD;
      but the main hypothesis is through polymorphisms of Apo-A1, possibly via the myeloperoxidase&#xD;
      enzyme, and each polymorphism produces different HDL levels and activity. These alterations&#xD;
      can lead to increased susceptibility to septic death due to inability to neutralize&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharide, loss of thymocyte apoptosis (critical for protection against sepsis) and&#xD;
      endogenous corticosteroid release, and loss of the ability to preserve HDLs antioxidant&#xD;
      properties. Dys-HDL has also been demonstrated in early sepsis and may serve as a potential&#xD;
      early disease marker. For these reasons, the investigators believe that Dys-HDL may play a&#xD;
      pivotal role in the sepsis cascade which leads to organ dysfunction and death. Aim 1.&#xD;
      Determine the presence of Dys-HDL in adult patients with early severe sepsis who present to&#xD;
      the ED. Aim 2. Examine the relationship between Dys-HDL and cumulative organ dysfunction as&#xD;
      measured by the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, a validated measure of&#xD;
      organ dysfunction in severe sepsis.&#xD;
