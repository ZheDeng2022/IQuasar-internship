      This study &quot;A Pivotal, Phase III Trial of Detecting generalized tonic-clonic seizures with a&#xD;
      Seizure Detection and Warning System in Epilepsy Patients &quot; is a phase III, pivotal,&#xD;
      prospective study of an electromyography (EMG) based seizure detection and warning system&#xD;
      (tentatively named Brain Sentinel™ Seizure Detection System) for detecting generalized&#xD;
      tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. The detection device is worn on the bicep brachii muscles and is&#xD;
      intended to alert a remote caregiver of a GTC seizure and provide a record of GTC seizure&#xD;
      activity. This is to facilitate a faster intervention to the GTC seizure, and to more&#xD;
      accurately document GTC seizure frequency in a home, skilled nursing, or inpatient setting.&#xD;

          1. Subject has a history of GTC seizures, either primary GTC or partial onset seizures&#xD;
             with secondary generalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Is being admitted to a hospital for routine vEEG monitoring related to seizures.&#xD;

             authorized representative (LAR) who can do so, prior to the performance of any study&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject and/or Primary Caregiver must be competent to follow all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Does not have a documented history of generalized seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has not had a GTC seizure within the last year AND is not expected to have a reduction&#xD;
             of anti-epileptic drugs during their hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Intracranial EEG electrodes are being used&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject's upper arm circumference not adequate for proper fit of the EMG monitor&#xD;
             (less than 14cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject/Caregiver is unable to provide consent.&#xD;
