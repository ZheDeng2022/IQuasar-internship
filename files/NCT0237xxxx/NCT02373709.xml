  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To elucidate the disease pathway of perinatal depression by identifying genetic variants&#xD;
      which could play a role in predisposing to the condition and/or lead to better understanding&#xD;
      of the pathogenesis of the condition. This is achieved by investigating for associations&#xD;
      between oestrogen receptor genetic variants and perinatal depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal (antenatal and postnatal) depression is a common complication of childbearing,&#xD;
      affecting 10 to 20% of mothers. In general, women are exposed to fluctuations in estrogen&#xD;
      level during childbearing years, especially during pregnancy and following childbirth. For a&#xD;
      subgroup of women with genetic predisposition rendering them more sensitive to such changes,&#xD;
      pregnancy or childbirth can act as a trigger for the onset of perinatal depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case control study will be conducted to evaluate the association of variants in estrogen&#xD;
      receptor and related genes with the disorder in our population. Women attending antenatal and&#xD;
      postnatal clinics will be screened with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and cases&#xD;
      will be identified. DNA from controls who are well throughout the antenatal and postpartum&#xD;
      period and cases meeting DSM IV criteria for depressive disorder will be genotyped for&#xD;
      various genetic variants. The distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes&#xD;
      and non-genetic risk factors will be compared between cases and controls and within the case&#xD;
      group. The risk factors for postnatal depression in relation to peripartum factors such as&#xD;
      demographic, obstetric, anaesthetic and pain outcomes will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As perinatal depression is known to contribute to inadequate self-care and poor compliance&#xD;
      with prenatal care, early diagnosis and treatment interventions are critical for the health&#xD;
      and well-being of both mother and infant. In the short term, identified genetic markers that&#xD;
      increase vulnerability to puerperal triggering of depression can be an additional screening&#xD;
      tool to identify at-risk expectant mothers for early management during a very critical period&#xD;
      for mother, infant, and family. In the long run, it may lead to identification of new&#xD;
      pathways or treatment targets for this common but under-studied disorder.&#xD;
