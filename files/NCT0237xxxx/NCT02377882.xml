      The investigators tried to explore an alternative non-depolarizing muscle relaxant&#xD;
      (rocuronium) and its optimal dosage to replace succinylcholine for IONM during thyroid&#xD;
      surgery.Time frame of outcome measure was during 30 to 70min after rocuronium injection.&#xD;
      Specific time points at which the will be assessed and for EMG signals will be presented.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy is the most common and serious complication after&#xD;
      thyroid surgery, and ranks among the leading reasons for medicolegal litigation of surgeons.&#xD;
      Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) are being applied to prevent RLN injury during thyroid&#xD;
      surgery. IONM has been used as a means not only to localize and identify the RLN, but also to&#xD;
      predict cord function and elucidate the surgical pitfalls during preparation of RLN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle relaxant is necessary for general anesthesia; it can facilitate tracheal intubation&#xD;
      and stable conditions for surgery. However, the use of muscle relaxant might diminish the EMG&#xD;
      response during IONM and interfere with the interpretation of IONM results. Eighty patients&#xD;
      were randomized to receive one (group 1, n=40) or two (group 2, n=40) effective dose (ED95)&#xD;
      of rocuronium to facilitate EMG endotracheal tube insertion. Evoked potentials were obtained&#xD;
      per 5 minutes by stimulating vagus nerve from the time point of 30 to 70 minutes after&#xD;
      administration of rocuronium. The magnitude of evoked potential at each time point and&#xD;
      tracheal intubating condition were compared between groups. Accelerometry [twitch (% TW)] was&#xD;
      used to monitor the quantitative degree of neuromuscular transmission. The aim of this study&#xD;
      was to explore an alternative non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (Rocuronium) and its optimal&#xD;
      dosage to replace succinylcholine for IONM. The ED95 of rocuronium is 0.3mg/kg and 2×ED95 is&#xD;
      generally recommended as a standard intubation dosage.&#xD;

V2 signal-The final testing of the vagus nerve EMG signals was performed after complete hemostasis of the operative field.&#xD;
The amplitude (μV) of V1 and V2 signals and the correlated degree of neuromuscular transmission (% TW) were recorded and analyzed.</description>
