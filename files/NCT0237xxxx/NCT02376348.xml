  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tanzania launched a National Strategy for scaling-up voluntary medical male circumcision in&#xD;
      2010, and aims to circumcise 2.8 million males by 2015. In September 2009, Jhpiego's Maternal&#xD;
      and Child Health Integrated Program (MCHIP) launched a PEPFAR-funded voluntary medical male&#xD;
      circumcision (VMMC) program which has circumcised over 110,000 males in Njombe and Iringa&#xD;
      regions by June 2012. In line with the national strategy, the target age for the program was&#xD;
      10-34 years, but 80% of clients were aged 10-19 years. There is an urgent need to increase&#xD;
      the proportion of older men (aged 20 years and above) who become circumcised, to have&#xD;
      greatest impact on the HIV epidemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to maintain high client flow in sites, the Iringa service delivery model is flexible&#xD;
      in terms of how, where and when services are delivered. Approaches include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Static sites: These sites offer regularly scheduled VMMC services several days a week.&#xD;
      Services are offered year round rather than periodically. Volume tends to be low (20-50&#xD;
      clients a week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Outreach sites: VMMC services are offered periodically at health facilities. A team&#xD;
      composed of providers 'borrowed' from other regional health facilities visits the sites for a&#xD;
      2-3 week period and offers VMMC 6 days a week. This is typically a high volume setting, in&#xD;
      which 40-120 circumcisions are performed a day, depending on the number of beds which can be&#xD;
      set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Campaign: Campaigns happen 2-3 times a year, and may include both static and outreach&#xD;
      sites. Campaigns are high volume, concerted approaches to VMMC where multiple facilities are&#xD;
      running coordinated VMMC service delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These services are complemented by demand creation activities (mass media, interpersonal&#xD;
      activities and outreach activities) designed to recruit and motivate new clients, and a text&#xD;
      messaging information system which is advertised through radio and other means, providing&#xD;
      potential clients advice on where VMMC is offered, the benefits of VMMC, and post-surgery&#xD;
      reminders for wound care, follow-up visits and safer sex. The intensity of the demand&#xD;
      creation depends on the size of campaign. In general, static sites do not have any demand&#xD;
      creation but outreach and campaigns do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will take place at outreach sites; however, the study will not stop&#xD;
      on-going VMMC services provided at static sites to young men but rather encourage older males&#xD;
      to come as well as young boys. Outreach sites have larger potential client size than static&#xD;
      sites because the catchment area round the outreach sites have generally not had access to&#xD;
      VMMC in the past and clients show up in large numbers to be served, whereas in static sites,&#xD;
      clients trickle through in lower volume. Outreach activities can be scheduled at the&#xD;
      convenience of the program. By using outreach activities, the proposed research, can be more&#xD;
      easily scheduled into the study's data collection timeframe (compared to campaign sites which&#xD;
      are on a highly prescribed schedule).&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT FINDINGS In February 2011, Jhpiego co-investigators on this study&#xD;
      conducted qualitative research in 3 districtsin Iringa (Iringa Municipality, Njombe and&#xD;
      Mafinga), with the aim of understanding men's and women's views on appropriate age for&#xD;
      circumcision, perceptions on circumcision, barriers and facilitators to older men seeking&#xD;
      circumcision, and seasonality[9]. Identified barriers among older men included shame&#xD;
      associated with older men getting circumcised, as it was seen to be an age-inappropriate&#xD;
      activity, concerns of older men about their partners being faithful to them during the&#xD;
      healing period, concerns about loss of income during the healing period, and concern around&#xD;
      erections causing damage to the penis or delay wound healing. The facilitating factors&#xD;
      included that circumcised men were seen as cleaner, safer from diseases, and more sexually&#xD;
      desirable to women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploration of preferences for service delivery showed that participants had a strong&#xD;
      preference for a model in which boys and men were provided separate services. There was also&#xD;
      support for all-male service providers to alleviate concerns about embarrassment at having&#xD;
      women view/touch the penis and the possibility that an erection could occur during the&#xD;
      procedure. There was little support for including female partners accompanying their partners&#xD;
      to the facilities. There was a marked preference for the cold season (June-August) for three&#xD;
      reasons: fewer farming responsibilities, school being out, and a cold temperature which is&#xD;
      perceived to facilitate wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this research, we anticipate that the targeted VMMC strategy evaluated in this&#xD;
      research will include demand-creation strategies using focused informational communication&#xD;
      messages for men aged over 20 years, and increased information and education for female&#xD;
      partners. Service delivery strategies may include separate services for men versus boys and&#xD;
      increasing the role of male service providers. The targeting strategy will be finalised&#xD;
      during Study 1, and implemented and evaluated during Study 2.&#xD;
