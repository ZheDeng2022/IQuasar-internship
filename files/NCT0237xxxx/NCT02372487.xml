    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized trial is to detect whether or not the use of Sildenafil citrate&#xD;
      therapy will increase the amniotic fluid volume expressed in term of amniotic fluid index&#xD;
      measured via ultrasound for fetuses of pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios, and to&#xD;
      compare the outcomes of Sildenafil-treated pregnancies with similar pregnancies that will&#xD;
      remain Sildenafil-naïve.&#xD;

      Women who will be referred to the maternity ward of both hospitals for a checkup and have the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be offered admission for at least 24 hours to have complete rest&#xD;
      aiming to increase the placental blood circulation of the uterus, which by itself can improve&#xD;
      the amniotic fluid level. Patients will be randomly allocated into two groups according to a&#xD;
      trial sequence determined via a computer generated random table. The trial sequence is hidden&#xD;
      into opaque sequenced envelopes as each envelope contains an assignment for a single patient.&#xD;
      Patients in first group will receive 2 liters of isotonic saline through intravenous infusion&#xD;
      over a period of 4 hours using a rate of 250 ml per hour in addition to sildenafil citrate&#xD;
      therapy (Viagra®) as 25 mg 3 times daily and the same fluid regimen will be used in control&#xD;
      group but without sildenafil citrate treatment. During hospital course maternal monitoring&#xD;
      will be done using maternal vital signs for early detection of any manifestations of fluid&#xD;
      overload while fetal monitoring will be done using non-stress test and all patients less than&#xD;
      34 completed weeks will receive dexamethasone in a total dose of 24mg to enhance fetal lung&#xD;
      maturity in case expedited delivery is needed. Fasting will also be recommended during fluid&#xD;
      therapy in case any emergency interference is required then all patients will resume their&#xD;
      usual daily diet and fluid intake. All patients will then undergo sonography after 24 hours&#xD;
      for reassessment of amniotic fluid index and those who will show an improvement of at least&#xD;
      20% will be discharged home and for those who still show no results the same regimen will be&#xD;
      repeated. Discharged patients in first group will be asked to continue sildenafil citrate&#xD;
      therapy (Viagra®) as 25 mg 3 times daily plus a daily oral fluid intake of 2 liters while&#xD;
      those in the control group will be asked only to have 2 liters daily oral fluid. Outpatient&#xD;
      monitoring in both groups will depend on twice weekly non-stress test and once weekly&#xD;
      amniotic fluid index and biophysical profile. Readmission and inpatient therapy using same&#xD;
      protocol in each group will be indicated at any time if amniotic fluid index reduced to ≤ 5&#xD;
      cm. All patients also will be instructed to undergo periods of bed rest and, also they will&#xD;
      be educated to count fetal kicks and to report immediately to the hospital if being&#xD;
      unsatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will be monitored till they will go into spontaneous labor or till&#xD;
      delivery will be indicated. The primary outcome measure will be the values of amniotic fluid&#xD;
      index before and after therapy in each group and between both groups. The secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures will be mode of delivery, gestational age at birth, fetal birth weight, and fetal&#xD;
      and neonatal outcomes (Apgar scores, umbilical artery acid-base analysis at birth, and the&#xD;
      need for transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit) which will be analyzed for the study&#xD;
      and control groups.&#xD;
