  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is few information about the association between supraventricular arrhythmia different&#xD;
      from atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial Flutter and the risk of stroke. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that the presence of atrial tachycardia would lead to atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation and recurrent stroke in patients hospitalized for cryptogenic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators study the association of atrial tachycardia (AT), defined as four or more&#xD;
      consecutive premature atrial beats, and AF, recurrent stroke and cardiovascular mortality in&#xD;
      192 consecutive patients hospitalized because of cryptogenic stroke. The follow-up was 12&#xD;
      months for all population&#xD;

      The investigators review all consecutive patients that were hospitalized from stroke in our&#xD;
      hospital (Neurology department) between January 2010 and September 2013, and who had the&#xD;
      diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke at discharge. All patients routinely underwent 24-hour ECG&#xD;
      recording and an echocardiography during the hospitalization. The investigators have a global&#xD;
      population of 210 patients who met these characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators analyze the presence of atrial tachycardia in 24-hour ECG register in&#xD;
      patients with cryptogenic stroke. The investigators consider atrial tachycardia as four or&#xD;
      more consecutive atrial ectopic beats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators analyze baseline characteristics (cardiovascular risk factors, renal&#xD;
      function, left atrial size _measured in M mode echocardiography in long paraesternal axis_&#xD;
      and total number of premature atrial complexes in the 24-hour ECG monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are stratified according to the presence or absence of atrial tachycardia in&#xD;
      24-hour ECG data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators follow the clinical events (AF, recurrent stroke or death) of patients from&#xD;
      the electronical medical data of general physician and the re-hospitalizations for recurrent&#xD;
      ictus in our hospital (which is the reference hospital of the zone) and mortality during 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
