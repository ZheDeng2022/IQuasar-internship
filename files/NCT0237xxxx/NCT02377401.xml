  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zanamivir is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the influenza virus neuraminidase.&#xD;
      Intravenous (IV) zanamivir is being developed for treatment of hospitalized patients with&#xD;
      influenza, especially for those patients who may be in greatest need of parenteral influenza&#xD;
      antiviral agents. This study is a pharmacokinetic (PK) study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles of IV zanamivir 300 milligrams (mg) and 600&#xD;
      mg in Chinese healthy subjects. Subjects will be randomized to receive either 300 mg or 600&#xD;
      mg IV zanamivir as a single dose followed by repeated dose every 12 hours (h) for 5 days.&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted or will return to study center for a follow-up visit, 7 days after&#xD;
      the last dose or withdrawal from the study. Total number of subjects planned for enrollment&#xD;
      will be 24 such that approximately 10 subjects complete dosing and critical assessments in&#xD;
      each dose cohort. The total duration of the study will be approximately 6 weeks from&#xD;
      screening to follow-up.&#xD;
