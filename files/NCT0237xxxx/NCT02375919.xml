      The Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria (PERC) is an 8-item rule, that was derived and&#xD;
      tested to rule out the diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) in the Emergency Department (ED)&#xD;
      amongst low risk patients. Even though meta analyses have confirmed the safety of its&#xD;
      utilization, equipoise remains - especially in European country where the prevalence of PE is&#xD;
      higher than in the US- on whether this rule could be safely applied to all low risk emergency&#xD;
      patients with a suspicion of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PROPER Trial is a non inferiority , cluster randomized trial. All centers will recruit&#xD;
      patients with a suspicion of PE and a low pre test probability. To rule out the diagnosis of&#xD;
      PE, center will use the usual diagnostic strategies with D-dimeres measurement for 6 months,&#xD;
      and PERC based strategy for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group (usual strategy), patients will be tested for D-dimeres, followed if&#xD;
      positive by a Computed Tomography of Pulmonary Artery (CTPA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group (PERC Based), patients will be first assessed with PERC score. If&#xD;
      PERC=0, then the diagnosis of PE will be exclude with no supplemental investigations. If&#xD;
      PERC&gt;0, then patients will undergo the usual strategy, with D-dimeres measurement +/- CTPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the failure percentage of the diagnostic strategy, defined as&#xD;
      diagnosed deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or PE at 3 month follow up, among patients for whom PE&#xD;
      has been initially ruled out.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) in the Emergency Department (ED) is crucial. As&#xD;
      emergency physicians fear to miss this potential lethal condition, PE tends to be&#xD;
      overdiagnosed with potential source of unnecessary risks and no clear benefit in terms of&#xD;
      outcome. PERC is an 8-item block of clinical criteria that can identify patients who can&#xD;
      safely be discharged without further investigation in the ED for the diagnosis of PE. The&#xD;
      endorsement of this rule could markedly reduce the number of irradiative imaging studies,&#xD;
      length of stay in the ED, and rate of adverse event resulting from both diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic means. Several retrospective and prospective studies have shown the safety and&#xD;
      benefits of PERC rule for PE diagnosis in low risk patients. However, no randomized study has&#xD;
      yet compared the benefit/risk ratio of PERC based strategy with the standard diagnosis&#xD;
      strategy and thus validated its endorsement in this setting. We hypothesize that in patients&#xD;
      with a low gestalt clinical probability and a PERC negative, PE can be safely ruled out and&#xD;
      the patient discharged with no further testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a controlled, cluster randomized trial in Europe (N=15). Each center will be&#xD;
      randomized on the sequence of period intervention: 6 months intervention (PERC based&#xD;
      strategy) followed by 6 months control (usual care), or 6 months control followed by 6 months&#xD;
      intervention with 2 months of &quot;wash-out&quot; between the two periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the non inferiority of a PERC based&#xD;
      diagnosis strategy for PE low risk emergency patients, compared to the standard strategy of&#xD;
      D-dimer testing, on the occurrence of non-diagnosed thrombo-embolic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the failure percentage of the diagnostic strategy, defined as&#xD;
      diagnosed DVT or PE at 3 month follow up, among patients for whom PE has been initially ruled&#xD;
      out. Exclusion of PE in the ED is made upon negative D-dimere result or negative CTPA in both&#xD;
      groups, or negative PERC in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the reduction of unnecessary irradiative imaging studies and adverse events. To&#xD;
      assess the reduction in ED length of stay, undue onset of anticoagulation regimen and&#xD;
      associated adverse events. To assess the reduction of hospital admission, readmission, and&#xD;
      mortality at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of CTPA and related adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of stay in the ED (hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anticoagulant therapy administration and adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission to the hospital following ED visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All causes re hospitalization at 3 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death from all causes at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups will have a different work up for the diagnosis of PE in the ED as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERC based strategy: work up for diagnosis of PE includes calculation of PERC. If all PERC&#xD;
      criteria are negative, no further testing for PE is recommended. If at least one criterion is&#xD;
      positive, then the patient undergoes sensitive D-dimer testing, with subsequent CTPA if&#xD;
      positive. In case of negative D-dimer result, PE will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard strategy: conventional work up for diagnosis of PE. Every low risk patient will&#xD;
      undergo sensitive D-dimer testing, with subsequent CTPA if positive. In case of negative&#xD;
      D-dimer, PE will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with chest pain or dyspnea will be screened and included in the ED by emergency&#xD;
      physicians and research assistant. If the treating emergency physician or local investigator&#xD;
      considers that the patient has a sufficient clinical suspicion of PE that he needs formal&#xD;
      work up for this diagnosis, and that this suspicion is low enough to discard this suspicion&#xD;
      in case of negative D-dimer, then the patient will be eligble and asked for written informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When recruiting a patient, the emergency physician or local investigator will have to confirm&#xD;
      in written that he answered &quot;yes&quot; to the two following sentences:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This patient has a clinical suspicion of Pulmonary Embolism, and this diagnosis needs to be&#xD;
      formally ruled out or confirmed before discharge I estimate the empirical clinical&#xD;
      probability of Pulmonary Embolism as low&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written informed consent has been obtained, the patient can be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be followed up by phone interview or hospital visit at three months&#xD;
      (13 weeks) by a clinical research technician. The time frame of three months could be subject&#xD;
      to minor adjustement, and will occur between day 84 and day 98. Follow up visit or interview&#xD;
      will seek the occurrence of thrombo-embolic event (DVT documented with ultrasonography of the&#xD;
      lower limbs or venous CT, or PE documented with positive CTPA or high probability V/Q lung&#xD;
      scan), death, return visit to the ED, hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All medical record pertaining to the patient from this timeframe will be sought and analysed&#xD;
      by the local investigator, to found report of thrombo-embolic event, or adverse events from&#xD;
      CTPA or anticaogulation. In the cases of death, or report of a thrombo-embolic event, the&#xD;
      file will be analysed by a comitee of three independent experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method of adjudication has been described and validated in all major previous diagnostic&#xD;
      studies on PE.&#xD;
