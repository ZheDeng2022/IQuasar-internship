  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the most common cause of childhood death worldwide. Millions of children survive,&#xD;
      but are left with impaired health. Sepsis-related Acute Kidney Injury (sAKI) is increasingly&#xD;
      recognized as a significant factor associated with long-term mortality among different&#xD;
      patient populations. Renal dysfunction and subsequent chronic kidney disease is implicated in&#xD;
      the development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The investigators overall&#xD;
      hypothesis is that, in the pediatric population, sepsis-related AKI will have unrecognized,&#xD;
      long-term consequences with regard to kidney function, endothelial function, blood pressure&#xD;
      control, and overall health.&#xD;

      This will be a three-arm cross-sectional control-cohort outpatient evaluation. Subjects with&#xD;
      sAKI and a random selection of non-sAKI subjects who agree to participate in another study of&#xD;
      quality of life survey will be asked to participate in the outpatient study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to come in to the Clinical Research Center for 24-hour monitoring and participate in&#xD;
      the outpatient study where urinary and serum studies to measure glomerular filtration rate,&#xD;
      renal plasma flow followed by blood pressure monitoring, peripheral arterial and applanation&#xD;
      tonometry.&#xD;
