    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate humanized CD19 redirected autologous T cells (or huCART19&#xD;
      cells) in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ leukemia and lymphoma that was&#xD;
      previously treated with cell therapy. This study is targeting pediatric patients aged 1-24&#xD;
      years with CD19+ B cell malignancies with no available curative treatment options (such as&#xD;
      autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation) who have a limited prognosis with&#xD;
      currently available therapies and were previously treated with a B cell directed engineered&#xD;
      cell therapy product.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male and female subjects with documented CD19+ B cell malignancies and no available&#xD;
        curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic SCT) who have limited&#xD;
        prognosis (several months to &lt;2 year survival) with currently available therapies will be&#xD;
        enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Eligible diseases: CD19+ leukemia or lymphoma. In general, these will be patients&#xD;
             with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ALL without curative options for therapy, including those not eligible for&#xD;
                  allogeneic SCT. Patient may be in any complete response, or patient may have&#xD;
                  active disease but responding or stable after most recent therapy.The intent is&#xD;
                  not to enroll patients with no degree of disease control or rapidly increasing&#xD;
                  disease burden between enrollment and cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Diffuse large cell lymphoma or other high-grade NHL, previously identified as&#xD;
                  CD19+ including residual disease after primary therapy and not eligible for&#xD;
                  autologous SCT; relapsed after prior autologous SCT; beyond 1st CR with relapsed&#xD;
                  or persistent disease and not eligible or appropriate for conventional allogeneic&#xD;
                  or autologous SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients previously treated with B cell directed engineered cell therapy are eligible&#xD;
             if they meet one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. partial response or no response to prior cell therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. relapsed after prior cell therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. demonstrated B cell recovery suggesting loss of engineered cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented CD19 expression (after previous B cell directed cell therapy, if&#xD;
             applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age 1 to 24 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Expected survival &gt; 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dl and less than 2.5x normal for age&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Bilirubin &lt;2.0 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate pulmonary function defined as &lt; Grade 3 hypoxia&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate cardiac function defined as LVSF ≥ 28% confirmed by ECHO&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate performance status (Lansky or Karnofsky score ≥50)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with relapsed disease after prior allogeneic SCT (myeloablative or&#xD;
             non-myeloablative) will be eligible if they meet all other inclusion criteria and&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have no active GVHD and require no immunosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Are more than 4 months from transplant (6 months at infusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with CNS3 disease will be eligible if CNS disease is responsive to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. For those patients who require leukapheresis for T cell collection (i.e. no previously&#xD;
             collected product exists), adequate venous access for apheresis or eligible for&#xD;
             appropriate catheter placement, and no other contraindications for leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Voluntary informed consent is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or lactating women. The safety of this therapy on unborn children is not&#xD;
             known. Female study participants of reproductive potential must have a negative serum&#xD;
             or urine pregnancy test performed within 48 hours before infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Uncontrolled active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concurrent use of systemic steroids at the time of cell infusion or cell collection,&#xD;
             or a condition, in the treating physician's opinion, that is likely to require steroid&#xD;
             therapy during collection or after infusion. Steroids for disease treatment at times&#xD;
             other than cell collection or at the time of infusion are permitted. Use of&#xD;
             physiologic replacement hydrocortisone or inhaled steroids is permitted as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of grade 2-4 acute or extensive chronic GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Under treatment for GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. CNS3 disease that is progressive on therapy, or with CNS parenchymal lesions that&#xD;
             might increase the risk of CNS toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any uncontrolled active medical disorder that would preclude participation as&#xD;
             outlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
