  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the presence of lymph node metastases in&#xD;
      addition to free resection margins following surgical resection of the primary tumor is an&#xD;
      important prognostic factor, and may impact planning of surgery as well as of radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Until now, imaging modalities including PET/CT and MRI did not allow to exclude especially&#xD;
      small lymph node metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to standard whole-body PET/CT acquisition techniques, high-resolution (HR) head and&#xD;
      neck PET/CT acquisitions promise improved detection of lymph node metastases in head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This prospective study aims to determine the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of lymph node staging with HR FDG-PET/CT in HNSCC by correlating PET/CT with&#xD;
      histopathology after neck dissection. HR PET/CT may have a relevant impact on the therapeutic&#xD;
      concept, and the planning and dose prescription of radiotherapy.&#xD;

      In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the presence of lymph node metastases in&#xD;
      addition to free resection margins following surgical resection of the primary tumor is an&#xD;
      important prognostic factor, and may impact planning of surgery as well as of radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Neck dissection and histopathology are regarded as diagnostic standard procedures to define&#xD;
      the lymph node status in patients with HNSCC. Occult lymph node metastases after imaging have&#xD;
      been described in up to 46% of patients, e.g. in patients with cancer of the tongue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although neck dissection generally has a low rate of intra- and postoperative complications,&#xD;
      a small but statistically significant group of patients suffers from surgery-related side&#xD;
      effects such as lymphedema, chronic pain syndromes and injury of cranial nerves with&#xD;
      paralysis (shoulder lift and mouth angle). Therefore it would be desirable to spare&#xD;
      diagnostic neck dissection in patients without macroscopic lymph node metastasis. However,&#xD;
      the sensitivity and/or specificity of the non-invasive imaging techniques available up to&#xD;
      now, including positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), did&#xD;
      not allow to exclude lymph node metastases, which is especially true for small metastases.&#xD;
      Therefore, imaging is not able to replace the histological examination of the cervical lymph&#xD;
      nodes and have limited impact on the therapeutic concept, the surgical planning and the&#xD;
      planning and dose prescription of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisition techniques and image quality of PET (with the glucose analog&#xD;
      F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)) and the combined examination with computed tomography (PET/CT)&#xD;
      were considerably improved with last generation PET/CT machines. New generation PET/CT&#xD;
      machines provide significantly improved image quality and image resolution image, and&#xD;
      probably higher sensitivity to detect smaller lesions. However, in the face of an expected&#xD;
      increase of detected metabolically active cervical lymph nodes by high-resolution (HR)&#xD;
      PET/CT, a diagnostic problem in terms of a potentially increased number of false-positive&#xD;
      lymph nodes arises, e. g. due to an inflammatory lymphadenopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now there are no evidence-based criteria to classify small metabolically active lymph&#xD;
      nodes detected by HR PET/CT. Hence, a correlation of PET/CT findings and histopathology of&#xD;
      cervical lymph metastases and inflammatory lymph nodes in patients with HNSCC is required to&#xD;
      develop diagnostic criteria for HR PET/CT and to exploit the diagnostic potential of HR&#xD;
      PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern concepts of radiotherapy planning for neck lymph node metastases increasingly take&#xD;
      into consideration the metabolic and morphological information of PET/CT for target volume&#xD;
      definition. Detailed information on the diagnostic performance of HR PET / CT are of&#xD;
      importance for the dose prescription of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In&#xD;
      radiotherapy side effects depend significantly on the dose and the irradiation volume. Modern&#xD;
      radiation techniques, especially IMRT, allow for highly-conformal radiation therapy with&#xD;
      steep dose gradients to protect organs such as the salivary glands, and to reduce side&#xD;
      effects of radiotherapy. On the other hand modern radiotherapy concepts carry the risk to&#xD;
      fail due to non-inclusion of subclinical lymph node metastases in the target volume. HR&#xD;
      PET/CT may allow to minimize out-of-field recurrences caused by incorrect target volume&#xD;
      contouring or dose prescription. Evidence-based data on the diagnostic accuracy of HR PET/CT&#xD;
      with special regard to small lymph node metastases are needed to clarify the potential role&#xD;
      of HR PET/CT for radiation treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV of lymph node staging&#xD;
           with HR PET/CT in patients with HNSCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV of HR PET/CT for lymph&#xD;
           node metastases of different size in patients with HNSCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the detection rate of distant metastases by PET/CT in patients with HNSCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop diagnostic criteria for the multi-modal lymph node staging with HR PET/CT in&#xD;
           patients with HNSCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the potential impact of HR PET/CT on radiation treatment planning&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HNSCC are managed according to clinical recommendations of the&#xD;
      interdisciplinary tumor board. Elective patients receive selective, modified radical or&#xD;
      radical neck dissection of the relevant lymph node region according to clinical routine&#xD;
      standards at the Inselspital Bern. The neck dissection must be carried out within a maximum&#xD;
      of 6 weeks after the PET / CT examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the neck dissection the lymph nodes will be sent to the Institute of Pathology&#xD;
      separated by level and side by topographic markers (cranial / caudal, medial / lateral). The&#xD;
      histological examination of the removed lymph nodes serves as reference standard for the&#xD;
      analysis of PET/CT image data, and calculation of the diagnostic accuracy of HR PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical radiation treatment plans are generated based on conventional imaging, whole-body&#xD;
      PET/CT and HR PET/CT protocols to determine the impact of PET/CT.&#xD;
