  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low dose rate brachytherapy using iodine 125 is well established as a treatment for low and&#xD;
      intermediate risk prostate cancer. Currently there is uncertainty as to the safety of this&#xD;
      technique in patients who have had a previous transurethral resection of the prostate gland&#xD;
      (TURP) for obstruction of the urine flow through the prostatic urethra. Early experience when&#xD;
      the technique was being developed in the 1980s suggested that there was a higher incidence of&#xD;
      urinary incontinence after brachytherapy if there had been a previous TURP. It is however&#xD;
      clear that with increasing experience many centres offer this treatment to patients who have&#xD;
      had previous TURP, using various parameters to select patients including time from the TURP&#xD;
      and persence or absence of a significant cavity within the gland on MRI scanning. There has&#xD;
      been no systematic study of I125 brachytherapy after TURP in the current era which might&#xD;
      address and inform the practice for future patient. Hence this study is designed to formally&#xD;
      assess the safety of I125 brachytherapy after previous TURP.&#xD;
