  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In preterm infants fed human milk, milk needs to be fortified to meet nutrient&#xD;
      recommendations. Fortification can be 1) standard, 2) individualized (adjusted based on daily&#xD;
      human milk nutrient analysis and milk volume), or 3) optimized (adjusted based on growth rate&#xD;
      and serum analyses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first specific aim will determine whether individualized and optimized nutrition during&#xD;
      hospitalization results in improved growth in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in&#xD;
      extremely low gestational age (GA) neonates (ELGANs, &lt;29 weeks) and in small for GA (SGA,&#xD;
      birth weight &lt;10th percentile for GA) preterm infants compared with optimized nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second specific aim will determine whether individualized and optimized nutrition in the&#xD;
      NICU improves neurodevelopmental outcomes (acquisition of development milestones) and reduces&#xD;
      the risk of disproportionate growth (i.e., excess fat) in the NICU and findings suggestive of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome in the first 3 years of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary hypothesis: In preterm infants (GA &lt;29 weeks or GA &lt;35 weeks and SGA)&#xD;
           individualized and optimized nutrition will increase velocity of growth (weight gain&#xD;
           velocity by 2 g x kg-1 x day-1 and length velocity by 0.2 cm per week) from birth to 36&#xD;
           weeks of postmenstrual age (GA plus postnatal age) or discharge (whichever comes first)&#xD;
           in comparison with optimized nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary hypotheses: Individualized and optimized nutrition will improve&#xD;
           neurodevelopmental outcome and reduce the risk of disproportionate growth (excess fat)&#xD;
           in the NICU and findings suggestive of metabolic syndrome in the first 3 years of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT): After consent, 150 neonates will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention: Patients will be randomized to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control: optimized nutrition: Milk fortification will be based on current&#xD;
           recommendations and optimized by adjustment of nutrients once a week based on blood&#xD;
           levels of urea nitrogen and albumin and velocity of growth (weight and length).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention: Individualized and optimized nutrition: Milk fortification will be&#xD;
           optimized as in control neonates. In addition, nutrition will be individualized every&#xD;
           day. Milk fortification will be adjusted based on daily measurements of macronutrients&#xD;
           in human milk using near-infrared analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by computer provided by a statistician using random block&#xD;
      allocation and stratification by GA and size for age (AGA [appropriate for GA] 23-28 weeks,&#xD;
      SGA 23-28 weeks and SGA 29-34 weeks). Twins and multiples will be randomized to the same arm&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;

Individualized Nutrition: Intake of macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbohydrate) will be individualized every day by adding one or more macronutrients to human milk based on daily measurements using near-infrared analysis.&#xD;
In patients receiving less milk than 140 ml x kg-1 x day-1 fortification of human milk will be adjusted to reach at least the average concentrations of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in donor's milk (Wojcik. J Am Diet Assoc. 2009 Jan;109:137-40) and 20 cal/oz as provided by the Mother's Milk Bank of North Texas.&#xD;
In those receiving at least 140 ml x kg-1 x day-1 of milk at 24 cal/oz fortification will be adjusted to meet recent guidelines from the the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition (ESPGHAN) (Agostoni et al. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2010 Jan;50:85-91).&#xD;
Optimized nutrition: Milk fortification will be based on current recommendations and optimized by adjustment of nutrients once a week based on blood levels of urea nitrogen (corrected for serum creatinine level) and albumin and velocity of growth (weight and length).</description>
