      This is a phase 1/2 single arm study to determine the safety and efficacy of VLX1570 IV&#xD;
      infusion administered with low dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, open label study to determine the safety and efficacy of VLX1570&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) infusion administered with low dose dexamethasone on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16&#xD;
      of a 28-day cycle in patients with confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma with relapsed or&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory disease (RRMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 1 trial design follows an Initial Accelerated Titration design followed by a&#xD;
      traditional &quot;3+3&quot; cohort design to establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended&#xD;
      phase 2 dose (RPTD) for the phase 2 portion of the study. It is anticipated that patients&#xD;
      will receive 6 treatment cycles. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease&#xD;
      progression, patients have the option of continuing treatment beyond 6 cycles, if the&#xD;
      investigator determines that the patient may benefit further from it.&#xD;

             with standard treatment).&#xD;
