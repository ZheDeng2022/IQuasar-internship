  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized controlled pilot trial to investigate the feasibility of a&#xD;
      driving pressure limited mechanical ventilation strategy compared to a conventional strategy&#xD;
      in patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation has the potential to produce or worsen alveolar injury. Driving&#xD;
      pressure is the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP. Evidence from observational&#xD;
      studies suggests that elevated driving pressure is the main independent determinant of&#xD;
      ventilator-induced lung injury, however clinical trials are needed to establish whether&#xD;
      targeting low driving pressures can improve clinical outcomes in patients without acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, ART-3 pilot is a multicenter randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility of a&#xD;
      driving pressure limited mechanical ventilation strategy compared to a conventional strategy&#xD;
      in patients without ARDS. Patients considered to this trial are those in mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation for less than 72 hours without diagnosis of ARDS. We will exclude patients with&#xD;
      less than 18 years old; contraindication to hypercapnia such as intracranial hypertension or&#xD;
      recent acute coronary syndrome; patients in which a high probability of death within 24 hours&#xD;
      is anticipated and patients under exclusive palliative care. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to the driving pressure limited ventilation strategy or conventional strategy&#xD;
      (tidal volume of 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight). The primary outcome is driving pressure&#xD;
      between days 1 and 3.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will use volume controlled (or pressure support ventilation) and adjust tidal volume between 3 and 8 mL/Kg of predicted body weight in order to achieve a driving pressure of 13 cmH2O. The respiratory rate will be titrated to achieve a pH between 7.30 and 7.45 (maximum respiratory rate is 50 breathings per minute). Investigators will not limit plateau pressure in this arm.&#xD;
Once a daily the investigators will assess the target tidal volume that generates a driving pressure of 13cmH2O. The patient should be sedated and without spontaneous efforts during this assessment.</description>
