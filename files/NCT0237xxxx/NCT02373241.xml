  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Untreated hypertension and renal injury are risk factors for increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in sickle cell disease, yet early markers of progressive disease have not been&#xD;
      identified and therapies to prevent the development of adverse cardiovascular outcomes have&#xD;
      not been defined. Circadian blood pressure, as defined by 24 hour blood pressure monitoring,&#xD;
      is more accurate than clinic blood pressure in defining secondary hypertension and abnormal&#xD;
      nocturnal blood pressured dipping and nocturnal hypertension have been linked to progressive&#xD;
      renal disease in other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology/Aims: A randomized feasibility trial of losartan will be conducted among&#xD;
      adolescent HbSS and SB0 thalassemia patients (11-19 years) with abnormal nocturnal blood&#xD;
      pressure dipping. During this six month feasibility trial, two dosing strategies of losartan&#xD;
      (titrated to keep clinic BP &lt;95th percentile vs. &lt;75th percentile) will be analyzed for&#xD;
      safety and effect on restoring normal circadian blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective cohort study among HbSS and SB0 thalassemia patients (6-19 years) will also be&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the incidence of hypertension and role of monitoring potential&#xD;
      biomarkers of kidney injury and hypertension. Cohort participants will undergo annual&#xD;
      evaluations of hypertension(24 hour blood pressure monitoring for participants ≥ 11yrs,&#xD;
      clinic BP in all participants) and markers of kidney injury/hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results: At the completion of the feasibility trial, vital background information&#xD;
      will be obtained to design a definitive multicenter trial of hypertension in sickle cell&#xD;
      disease. At the completion of the cohort study, the incidence of pediatric hypertension will&#xD;
      be identified and the role for monitoring blood and urine biomarkers will be better&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As therapy for patients with renal failure is dismal, it is imperative that SCD patients at&#xD;
      risk are identified early and that therapeutic trials are conducted that prevent progression.&#xD;

      Feasibility Trial of Losartan to Correct Abnormal Circadian Blood Pressure. Cohort&#xD;
      participants (below) identified with in-clinic hypertension and abnormal nocturnal dipping on&#xD;
      24 hour ABPM will be asked to participate in a feasibility trial of losartan. Participants&#xD;
      will be offered a consultation with Pediatric Nephrology prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
      Participants that consent /assent will undergo repeat 24 hour ABPM to confirm abnormal&#xD;
      circadian blood pressure prior to receiving losartan. At baseline, participants will undergo&#xD;
      evaluation for biomarkers of kidney injury and hypertension. Participants will start on&#xD;
      losartan at 25mg of losartan and randomized to titrate clinic BP &lt;95th or 75th percentile&#xD;
      based on NHLBI BP tables. Participants will be followed monthly x 6 months and receive&#xD;
      standard of care labs. ABPM and blood/urine biomarkers of kidney injury, buccal swab for&#xD;
      circadian genes, and hypertension will be repeated at 3 and 6 months. Participants will&#xD;
      undergo monthly evaluation for adherence through pill counting and questionnaires. Safety of&#xD;
      dosing will be monitored by internal review and external review (DSMB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective Pediatric Cohort to Evaluate Hypertension and Kidney Injury. Patients with HbSS&#xD;
      or SB0 thalassemia, ages ≥ 6 years and have signed informed consent will undergo clinic BP,&#xD;
      annual ABPM and biomarkers to determine the incidence of HTN and potential role for&#xD;
      biomarkers as monitors for the development of hypertension or kidney injury/disease. Urine&#xD;
      will be collected annually and evaluated for current known biomarkers of kidney disease and&#xD;
      stored for future analysis of relevant biomarkers. Uric acid will be processed from collected&#xD;
      blood annually.&#xD;
