  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe childhood obesity is associated with both immediate and chronic health problems and a&#xD;
      severe impact on psychosocial development. Medical and behavioural interventions rarely&#xD;
      result in the significant, durable weight loss necessary to improve health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised clinical trial where 50 adolescents, 13-16 years of age, will be&#xD;
      randomised to either early bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) or intense&#xD;
      conservative treatment and possibly surgery as they have become 18 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multicentre randomised clinical trial where three tertiary referral hospitals recruit&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and their parents receive information about the study at their paediatric clinic and&#xD;
      at the trial web page (www.amos2.se). Standardised procedure, including signed informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of day of baseline examination patients are randomised to either of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bariatric surgery with regular follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimised conservative treatment starting with an 8-week Low Calorie Diet period&#xD;
           followed by tailored support and treatment by the multidisciplinary team with an&#xD;
           intensity of at least one visits a month over at least 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the conservative arm will be reassessed regarding interest of undergoing&#xD;
      bariatric surgery two years after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size A sample size of 50 (25+25) leaves a power of more than 95% to evaluate a&#xD;
      possible superiority of &gt;10% weight difference between the two groups, assuming a 15%&#xD;
      standard deviation in weight loss over follow-up at 2.5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This number also allows assessment for differences in cardiovascular risk factors with&#xD;
      sufficient power and acceptable power for demonstrating differences in quality of life and&#xD;
      cognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 Randomization The computerized random allocation is performed during the day of baseline&#xD;
      examination and patients were informed of their assignment. Forty-nine patients have been&#xD;
      included until May 2017, and the last patient will be operated on June 14th. Stratification&#xD;
      has been performed according to the recruitment centre&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8 Statistical Methods &amp; Additional Analyses Safety &amp; Efficacy Outcomes: Analyses will be by&#xD;
      intention to treat, including all randomised patients. Difference in treatment effect will be&#xD;
      evaluated with hazard ratio between the treatment groups, and the corresponding confidence&#xD;
      interval will be calculated. For secondary outcomes, the incidence of comorbidities during&#xD;
      follow-up will be evaluated using time-to-event models, and for continuous variables mixed&#xD;
      models will be used to evaluate differences between the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted by calculating the incremental&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; dividing the between-group difference in costs with the&#xD;
      between-group difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as well as life-years).&#xD;
      Probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be conducted and results presented in an ICER&#xD;
      scatterplot and cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Clinical Data Collection: Study point are 6 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, and 7 years&#xD;
      after the start of intervention. Weight, quality of life, and adverse events, as well as&#xD;
      clinical data regarding treatments for co-morbidities. Blood sampling for assessment of&#xD;
      nutritional deficiencies, glucose control, blood lipids and inflammation will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline and 1, 2 and 7 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive functions: Assessments will be performed at baseline and 1 and 2 years after start&#xD;
      of intervention.&#xD;
