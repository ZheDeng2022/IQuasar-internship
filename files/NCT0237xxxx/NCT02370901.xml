      This study evaluates the effectiveness of repositioning techniques and neck stretching&#xD;
      exercises in comparison to cranial orthotic devices (COD) in correcting plagiocephaly in&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial with the goal of recruiting 226&#xD;
      participants. The participants will be between the ages of 4-7 months and will be randomized&#xD;
      into two groups: Treatment group A, which will provide treatment using cranial orthotic&#xD;
      devices (CODs) ; and Treatment group B, which will provide treatment using repositional&#xD;
      techniques and neck stretching exercises. These participants will be offered enrollment if&#xD;
      they have deformational molding with CVA greater than 6 mm and/or CI&gt; 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asymmetric plagiocephaly is defined by cranial vault index (CVA). CVA is the difference&#xD;
      between two diagonal cranial diameters (CVA= Longer diagonal-shorter diagonal). Cranial&#xD;
      diameters are measured from orbitale superius suture to orbitale superius rear (see Appendix&#xD;
      1). Normal CVA is &lt;6mm, mild CVA is 6-10mm, moderate CVA is 11-15mm, and severe CVA is &gt;15mm.&#xD;
      Brachycephaly is defined by the cephalic index (CI). This measurement is the width/length of&#xD;
      cranium x100. Length of cranium is measured from glabella to opisthocranion and width is&#xD;
      measured from eurion to eurion. Normal CI is 75-90%, mild brachycephaly is 90.1-95%, moderate&#xD;
      brachycephaly is 95.1-100%, severe brachycephaly is &gt;100%. Currently, repositioning exercises&#xD;
      and helmeting therapy are both options given to the parents as there is no consensus on&#xD;
      preferred standard of care. Once the parents have made the decision, the study investigators&#xD;
      will monitor the patient and change therapy if there is no response to treatment or if the&#xD;
      parents decide they would like to change therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be conducted by using a system created by the USF Department of&#xD;
      Biostatistics. It involves a covariate adaptive randomization so that the patients will&#xD;
      continue to be randomized throughout the trial but still allowing for covariates. Covariates&#xD;
      for this study will be :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  type of deformity - Isolated plagiocephaly (CVA &gt;6; 75 &lt; CI &lt; 90), isolated&#xD;
           brachycephaly (CVA&lt;6; CI &gt; 90), and mixed brachy/ plagiocephaly (CVA &gt; 6; CI &gt; 90)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  severity of deformity - a CVA of 10 mm would be compared to another CVA of 10mm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once families consent for their child to be a participant, basic demographic information will&#xD;
      be collected. Study investigators will also collect data on developmental delay. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized by the physician to ensure appropriate grouping into each of the above&#xD;
      mentioned covariates. The participants'' families will subsequently be notified the same day&#xD;
      of the results of randomization into Treatment Group A or Treatment Group B. Both treatments&#xD;
      are currently equally used in plagiocephaly, so there is no harm to the patient in being&#xD;
      selected for one group versus another. The physician will re-evaluate the patients at 3&#xD;
      months, and if no progress is made , or if the parents are unhappy with the randomized form&#xD;
      of treatment, the parents will have the option of switching to another group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential adverse outcomes of the treatments themselves are listed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group A (Cranial Orthotic Devices): Skin irritation due to helmeting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group B: Pain caused by inappropriate technique in exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study consent forms will include these and any other potential adverse outcomes, with a&#xD;
      direct line to our office for notification. Benefits include correction of the plagiocephaly,&#xD;
      and will be explained to the parents as the goal of treatment. All adverse outcomes will be&#xD;
      reported to the IRB. Of note, these outcomes have yet to be witnessed by our staff despite&#xD;
      years of treating patients with these methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomized and selected, Treatment Group A will be fitted for CODs and will undergo&#xD;
      monthly adjustments by a licensed cranial orthotist at West Coast Brace and Limb. This is&#xD;
      standard of care for plagiocephaly. Monitoring of the patient's use of the helmet will be the&#xD;
      responsibility of the parents, with goal of treatment to be 23 hours per day. The orthotist&#xD;
      will have no knowledge of whether patients are enrolled in the study versus not, and will be&#xD;
      conducting the normal responsibilities for their job. Data that is collected will be the same&#xD;
      for all patients regardless of study enrollment. The principal study investigator, Dr.&#xD;
      Ricalde, will be the only person with knowledge and access to the data collection for study&#xD;
      patients during these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group B will be asked appropriate questionnaires by FCI staff and be encouraged to&#xD;
      perform at-home repositioning techniques and neck stretching exercises. If the patient has&#xD;
      any concerns they will be asked to come in for evaluation by a licensed physical therapist.&#xD;
      This is the standard of care for plagiocephaly. The physical therapist will have no knowledge&#xD;
      of whether patients are enrolled in the study versus not, and will be conducting the normal&#xD;
      responsibilities for their job. Data that is collected will be the same for all patients&#xD;
      regardless of study enrollment. Dr. Ricalde will be the only person with knowledge and access&#xD;
      to the data collection for study patients during these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical therapist and the orthotist will both be blinded to study participants, but true&#xD;
      blinding of the treatment is not possible as the treatments require some knowledge by the&#xD;
      parents. Initially, data will include a health questionnaire to screen for sex and&#xD;
      developmental delay , as well as having initial CVA and CI measurements via STAR Scanner&#xD;
      device, a standard device used by orthotists using laser light that has no harmful effects to&#xD;
      the patient. In addition to initial measurements, patients will have measurements taken&#xD;
      monthly (CVA and CI) by the cranial orthotist. All patients will receive photos, Star Scanner&#xD;
      measurements, and questionnaires A and C at 6, 12, 24 months to evaluate treatment&#xD;
      progression. Questionnaires will be administered to parents to assess satisfaction at 6, 12,&#xD;
      24 months. The option to switch treatment will be conducted at 3 months.&#xD;
