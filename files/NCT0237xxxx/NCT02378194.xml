    <textblock>
      Chronic renal failure is a syndrome that renal function is decreased, and the patient number&#xD;
      is increasing. In addition, patients on dialysis have also increased. Depending on the&#xD;
      chronic renal failure aggravated, the deterioration of life caused by the conduct of dialysis&#xD;
      patients is caused. In addition, a problem in dialysis treatment is ongoing economic burden&#xD;
      surface to increase the life of the patient and family. A solution to this problem is, or&#xD;
      stops the progression of chronic renal failure prior to dialysis, it is necessary to delay.&#xD;
      As a treatment for inhibiting the progression of chronic renal failure is present, along with&#xD;
      diet and blood pressure-lowering drugs or a drug therapy used by kremezin. However, the&#xD;
      effect is not enough, new drug development is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HD-003 is a novel compound, and found to inhibit the renal failure progression. It was found&#xD;
      during the search active substance that appear when the inflammation in animals. The&#xD;
      investigators confirmed that the substance is present in the urine of a person during the&#xD;
      study, and later established a link between kidney disease hypotheses. When performing the&#xD;
      test in animal model renal failure, chronic renal Through the non-clinical testing of the&#xD;
      HD-003(general toxicity studies, reproductive, developmental toxicity test, mutagenicity test&#xD;
      and antigen tests) showed that a very low toxicity. When going through the review of the&#xD;
      safety and pharmacokinetic Phase 1 clinical study, it was confirmed a very satisfactory&#xD;
      safety and tolerability. And pharmacokinetic results from the body's absorption in healthy&#xD;
      subjects had been done well, a linear correlation was observed. Finally, it was confirmed&#xD;
      that the most rapidly excreted into the urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase 2a clinical trials performed in patients with chronic renal failure in&#xD;
      3, 4 steps. The evaluation of changes in serum creatinine(sCr) in vivo indicator of renal&#xD;
      failure according to the progress. Evaluating the inhibitory effect of HD-003 renal failure&#xD;
      progression and dose setting, and to determine the safety.&#xD;
