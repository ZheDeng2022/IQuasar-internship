  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR™) is a novel non-hyperaemic index of the functional&#xD;
      significance of a coronary stenosis. Previous studies have shown variable levels of&#xD;
      correlation with the established hyperaemic index FFR. In addition it has been proposed that&#xD;
      iFR™ has superior diagnostic accuracy when compared to mean whole cardiac cycle Pd/Pa which&#xD;
      can also be used to predict FFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to undertake a prospective clinical study in consecutive patients already undergoing&#xD;
      FFR assessment in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory to compare the ability of iFR™ and&#xD;
      Pd/Pa (both measured using the proprietary Volcano system) to predict FFR. We will explore&#xD;
      the level of misclassification of flow limiting disease that results from use of iFR™ and&#xD;
      resting Pd/Pa employed using either binary cut-off algorithms or in a hybrid decision making&#xD;
      protocol. We plan to analyse 260 vessels over a 18 month period. Hyperaemia will be induced&#xD;
      by intravenous adenosine (140 ug/kg/min) administered wherever possible via an antecubital&#xD;
      vein. Intra-coronary nitrates will also be given in line with the standard care procedure for&#xD;
      FFR measurement. Final clinical decisions following coronary physiology will be based on&#xD;
      steady state FFR.&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparative study of resting Pd/Pa, instantaneous wave-free ratio and fractional flow&#xD;
      reserve in an unselected population referred for invasive angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR™) is a novel non-hyperaemic index for assessing the&#xD;
      functional significance of a coronary stenosis without coronary vasodilatation. In previous&#xD;
      studies it has been compared to the hyperaemic index FFR with variable results. As a guide to&#xD;
      determining the need for revascularisation it has been employed using a dichotomous cut-off&#xD;
      without FFR or within a hybrid strategy in which lesions with intermediate iFR™ values are&#xD;
      further interrogated using FFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparative diagnostic utility of iFR™ vs resting pressure (Pd/Pa) in reference to FFR is&#xD;
      uncertain. We plan to undertake a prospective clinical study in consecutive patients&#xD;
      undergoing clinically-indicated FFR assessment in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory with&#xD;
      30-80% diameter stenosis on quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). We will will use a&#xD;
      proprietary (Volcano) pressure wire system and iFR ™ algorithm in order to calculate iFR™ and&#xD;
      Pd/Pa in both resting and hyperemic conditions as well as FFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is 260 vessels and the enrolment period is 18 months. Hyperaemia will be&#xD;
      induced by intravenous adenosine (140 ug/kg/min) administered wherever possible via an&#xD;
      antecubital vein. Intra-coronary nitrates will also be given in line with the standard care&#xD;
      procedure for FFR measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective single centre cohort study all consecutive patients undergoing FFR are&#xD;
      eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Hypothesis: (1) In comparison to an FFR for all strategy, revascularisation decisions&#xD;
      made using binary cut-off values of iFR™ or resting Pd/Pa will result in similar levels of&#xD;
      disagreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Hypothesis: (2) In comparison to an FFR for all strategy, revascularisation decisions&#xD;
      using hybrid strategies incorporating iFR™ or resting Pd/Pa and FFR will result in similar&#xD;
      levels of disagreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Hypothesis (3): Compared to iFR™ measured under resting conditions, hyperaemic iFR™&#xD;
      has a stronger correlation with FFR. Should this be the case, then the diagnostic efficiency&#xD;
      of iFR™ can be interpreted as being improved with pharmacological vasodilatation. The null&#xD;
      hypothesis is that there is no difference in diagnostic efficiency between iFR™ and&#xD;
      hyperaemic iFR compared to FFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical decisions in the catheter laboratory will align with routine care and be&#xD;
      informed by all available clinical data and the FFR results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted independently in the National Health Service without industry&#xD;
      support or involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 260 vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Independent analysis of the completed dataset will be performed by Dr&#xD;
      John McClure a biostatistician and lecturer in the Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical&#xD;
      Sciences in Glasgow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We will measure resting indices Pd/Pa and iFR™. Following this we will then measure&#xD;
      hyperaemic readings including FFR and hyperaemic iFR™ (HiFR) sequentially using peripherally&#xD;
      administered adenosine. Upon completion of enrollment we will produce summary statistics&#xD;
      describing demographics and procedural data for the study cases. We will then calculate the&#xD;
      discriminatory power of iFR™ using both the pre-specified binary cut-off values of 0.90 for&#xD;
      iFR™ and 0.92 for resting Pd/Pa and the adenosine zones for iFR of 0.86-0.93 and resting&#xD;
      Pd/Pa of 0.87-0.94. We will also analyse the correlation of HiFR with FFR&#xD;
