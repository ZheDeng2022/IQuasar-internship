    <textblock>
      In this phase 1 pilot study, positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging will be used to&#xD;
      determine the biodistribution, metabolism and excretion of a novel radiotracer&#xD;
      [18F]Fluortriopride ([18F]FTP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      [18F]FTP is a novel radioactive tracer that has shown potential in labeling dopamine D3&#xD;
      receptors through PET/CT imaging. This is a phase 1 study design meant to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      biodistribution and brain uptake of [18F]FTP in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants will be ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. &quot;Healthy volunteer&quot; is defined as being in good general health in the opinion of an&#xD;
             investigator (controlled diabetes, controlled hypertension or other well controlled&#xD;
             chronic medical conditions may be allowed at the discretion of an investigator if they&#xD;
             do not believe they will increase patient risk or interfere with the collection of&#xD;
             imaging data, specific excluded conditions are described under exclusion criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide&#xD;
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior&#xD;
             to study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Females who are pregnant at the time of screening will not be eligible for this study,&#xD;
             urine or blood pregnancy test will be performed in women of child-bearing potential at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 35&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Sustained uncontrolled hypertension (Systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg&#xD;
             and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mm Hg) at screening intake session.&#xD;
             If either of the pressure values is above the stated limits on the initial assessment,&#xD;
             blood pressure may be re-tested twice after initial assessment at five minute&#xD;
             intervals (for a total of 3 blood pressure assessments). The pressure elevation is&#xD;
             considered sustained if either the systolic or diastolic pressure values are outside&#xD;
             the stated limits for all three assessments, and the subject will be excluded from&#xD;
             study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of epilepsy or seizure disorder as assessed by medical record review and/or&#xD;
             self-reported&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of head trauma, that in the opinion of an investigator may interfere with the&#xD;
             uptake of [18F]FTP as assessed by medical record review and/or self-reported&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or&#xD;
             psychotic disorder as assessed by medical record review and/or self-reported&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Use of dopaminergic CNS stimulants (prescription, over-the counter or recreational&#xD;
             drugs) within 30 days of screening intake visit , as assessed by review of health&#xD;
             history form and concomitant medication review at screening intake visit (from medical&#xD;
             record and/or self-reported) that are deemed by a physician investigator to have a&#xD;
             potential influence on the binding of [18F]FTP&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Positive urine drug screen at the screening intake visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Self-reported current alcohol consumption that exceeds greater than 25 drinks per week&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any current medical condition, illness, or disorder as assessed by medical record&#xD;
             review and/or self-reported that is considered by a physician investigator to be a&#xD;
             condition that could compromise participant safety or successful participation in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Unwilling or unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
