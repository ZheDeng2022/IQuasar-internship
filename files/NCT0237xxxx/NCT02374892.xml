      The CHAPTER III Study (Congenital Heart Adolescents Participating in Transition Evaluation&#xD;
      Research) is a cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of a nurse-led&#xD;
      transition intervention in combination with usual care, versus usual care alone, on preparing&#xD;
      adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD) to successfully transition from pediatric to&#xD;
      adult cardiology care. The Canadian Pediatric Society and American Academy of Pediatrics have&#xD;
      recommended that transition interventions begin in early adolescence. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct a nurse-led intervention that addresses the educational&#xD;
      needs of 13-14 year olds.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The numbers of youth and young adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) is rapidly&#xD;
      increasing, yet youth, parents, and health care providers (HCPs) are unprepared to manage the&#xD;
      health care transition from pediatric to adult cardiology care. Both youth and parents report&#xD;
      significant anxiety regarding the transition process. When transition is not managed well,&#xD;
      youth may not engage with adult HCPs,which may lead to late detection of new problems,excess&#xD;
      morbidity, and diminished quality of life.This speaks to the urgency of addressing clinical&#xD;
      and health services research gaps, which leave affected youth, families, HCPs, and policy&#xD;
      makers with insufficient evidence for transition program delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to determine the impact of a nurse-led transition intervention in&#xD;
      combination with usual care, compared to usual care alone, on self-management and&#xD;
      self-advocacy skills among 13-14 year olds with moderate or complex CHD using a validated&#xD;
      instrument. [Hypothesis: the transition intervention will result in superior self-management&#xD;
      and self-advocacy skills compared to usual care alone]. The secondary aim is to determine&#xD;
      knowledge of their CHD lesion [Hypothesis: the transition intervention will result in&#xD;
      superior knowledge of the CHD lesion compared to usual care alone].&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: 13-14 year olds with moderate or complex CHD (as previously defined)who&#xD;
      are followed at the Stollery Children's Hospital (Edmonton).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: (i) less than a Grade 6 level of reading and comprehension, based on&#xD;
      parent report; (ii) heart transplantation, as this results in distinct health challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized by clusters defined by week of attendance in the pediatric&#xD;
      cardiology clinic. Because week is the unit of randomization and not the study subject, this&#xD;
      is a cluster randomization design. We anticipate 1-2 subjects per week will be enrolled per&#xD;
      site, i.e. the cluster size will be â‰¤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention will be conducted by a cardiology nurse who is experienced working with&#xD;
      teens and will a one-on-one sessions approximately 60 minutes in length. Sessions will be&#xD;
      youth-oriented, interactive, and engaging. This session will be held in conjunction with a&#xD;
      scheduled pediatric cardiology clinic visit. This timing minimizes the study burden and is&#xD;
      consistent with Canadian Pediatric Society recommendations that transition interventions be&#xD;
      delivered in clinical settings. Individual sessions, in contrast to group sessions, allow the&#xD;
      intervention content to be patient-specific. Immediately prior to the session, the RN will&#xD;
      review the cardiology chart to familiarize them self with the cardiac history including&#xD;
      cardiac diagnoses, names and dates of cardiac surgical procedures and cardiac&#xD;
      catheterizations, and current cardiac medications and doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The one-on-one session will combine Education and an introduction of Self-Management. It will&#xD;
      involve an introduction to transition and its importance, a discussion of confidentiality to&#xD;
      promote trust with the RN, the creation of a MyHealth passport, review of diagram&#xD;
      illustrating the teen's cardiac anatomy, the introduction to websites of the Sick Kids&#xD;
      Good2Go program, and the youth-oriented YoungAndHealthy, the introduce youth-friendly written&#xD;
      materials about risk-taking behaviours, a review of videos of good and bad interactions with&#xD;
      a health care provider and encouragement to contact the RN at a study email address or by&#xD;
      text messaging with follow-up questions..&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential study participants will be approached in the Stollery Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Cardiology clinic. A trained project coordinator will approach subjects on both&#xD;
      &quot;intervention&quot; days and &quot;usual care&quot; days. The nature and purpose of the study will be&#xD;
      explained and informed consent sought from the teen's parent(s)/guardian(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The TRANSITION-Q score is a Canadian created, generic self-management skills scale for&#xD;
           use with adolescents diagnosed with a chronic health condition who are aged 12 to 18&#xD;
           years. The content of the scale was designed to include a range of skills that vary from&#xD;
           those that even young adolescents should be able to do (e.g. answer a doctor's or&#xD;
           nurse's questions) to skills that may require instruction or training (e.g. book an&#xD;
           appointment).consists of a knowledge scale and behavior index that reports on the youths&#xD;
           health and self-care related knowledge and behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Knowledge of the cardiac condition will be measured with the MyHeart Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Chart review: Descriptive data collected from the cardiology chart will be: date of&#xD;
           birth, CHD diagnosis, names and dates of cardiac surgical procedures and cardiac&#xD;
           catheterizations, current use of cardiac medications (Y/N), history of missed&#xD;
           appointments (Y/N), and cardiologist's name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth will complete the MyHeart Scale and the TRANSITION-Q Questionnaire in the clinic area&#xD;
      at enrollment for the &quot;usual care&quot; group, and prior to intervention for the &quot;intervention&quot;&#xD;
      group. Both groups will repeat the questionnaires 1 month and 6 months post enrollment.&#xD;
