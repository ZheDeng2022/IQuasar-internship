  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to develop at Nestlé Research Center a database of metabolic&#xD;
      profiles, body composition, food habits and physical activities on a large cohort of human&#xD;
      volunteers. Analysis of collected data will serve to measure the variability of the data and&#xD;
      to assess the potential of combining metabonomics with imaging techniques (iDXA) to monitor&#xD;
      the metabolic and physiologic effects of foods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out at the metabolic unit of the Nestlé Research Center (Lausanne).&#xD;
      A large cohort of subjects will be recruited among Nestlé employees. Body composition will be&#xD;
      determined by iDXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and basal metabolism will be measured&#xD;
      by metabonomic analysis of urine and plasma samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual food habits and physical activities will be assessed by questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical protocol plans also the measurement of energy expenditure (EE) by indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry on a subset of twenty subjects. These EE data will be used to validate iDXA&#xD;
      outcomes for resting energy expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers can participate a second time to this study in the case they would like to&#xD;
      control the evolution of their body composition and metabolism after a period of dietary&#xD;
      regime or physical training. In such a case, a minimum period of two months between the&#xD;
      visits is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two days of dietary restrictions, the volunteers will come in the morning at the&#xD;
      metabolic unit at fasting state, for urine and blood sampling. The metabolism of some foods&#xD;
      can bias the metabonomic analyses. Therefore, the consumption of alcoholic beverages, fish&#xD;
      meals, liquorice, grapefruit, power drinks and bars, spices, mineral supplements, soft&#xD;
      drinks, chocolate, coffee and tea limited to 2 cups per day, are not allowed during two days&#xD;
      preceding the visit. In addition, the intake of pain-killers or antiinflammatory drugs is&#xD;
      forbidden during the two days before the sampling of urine and blood because their metabolism&#xD;
      alters the metabolic profiles of blood and urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics alter gut microflora, for which the activity represents an important contributor&#xD;
      to the urinary metabolic profile. In order to preserve gut microflora-related metabolic&#xD;
      information, we recommend a minimum period of one month between the end of any antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy and the visit at the metabolic unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the visit day, subjects will come fasting at the metabolic unit, where they will have to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer some medical questions during an interview with the doctor in charge of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fill in two questionnaires on food habits and physical activities. A dietician of the&#xD;
           CHUV will visit you at NRC to ask you for some questions relative to your food habits.&#xD;
           This is to validate the new questionnaire you filled in&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give a sample of urine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undergo iDXA scan (2 consecutive measures will be run at each of the two visits, in&#xD;
           order to assess the intra-individual variability of the results) and measure of the&#xD;
           state of hydration by bioimpedance The analysis of plasma samples is recommended to&#xD;
           complete the metabonomic analysis. However, the blood sampling will be freely decided by&#xD;
           each participant. The protocol plans also to perform measurements of resting energy&#xD;
           expenditure by indirect calorimetry on a subset of twenty subjects.&#xD;
