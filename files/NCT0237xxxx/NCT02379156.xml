  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to maintain normal core body temperature (Tcore = 98.6°F) is impaired in persons&#xD;
      with a cervical spinal cord injury (tetraplegia). Despite the known deficits in the ability&#xD;
      of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) to maintain Tcore, and the effects of hypothermia to&#xD;
      impair mental function in able-bodied (AB) persons, there has been no work to date addressing&#xD;
      these issues in persons with tetraplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To determine if exposure of up to 2 hours to cool temperatures (64°F) causes&#xD;
      Tcore to decrease in persons with tetraplegia, and if that decrease is associated with a&#xD;
      decrease in cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypotheses: Based on our pilot data: (1) 66% of persons with tetraplegia and none of&#xD;
      the matched controls will demonstrate a decline of 1.8°F in Tcore; (2) 80% of persons with&#xD;
      tetraplegia and 30% of controls will have a decline of at least one T-score in Stroop&#xD;
      Interference scores (a measure of executive function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To determine the change in: (1) distal skin temperature, (2) metabolic rate,&#xD;
      and (3) thermal sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: Persons with tetraplegia will have less of a percent change in average&#xD;
      distal skin temperatures and metabolic rate, and report lower thermal sensitivity ratings&#xD;
      compared with AB controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Aim: To determine if a 10 mg dose of an approved blood pressure-raising medicine&#xD;
      (midodrine hydrochloride) will (1) reduce the decrease in Tcore and (2) prevent or delay the&#xD;
      decline in cognitive performance in the group with tetraplegia compared to the exact same&#xD;
      procedures performed on the day with no medicine (Visit 1) in that same group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Hypothesis: Through administering a one-time dose of midodrine, the medicine-induced&#xD;
      decreased blood flow to the skin will lessen the decline in Tcore and prevent or delay the&#xD;
      associated decline in cognitive performance compared to the changes in Tcore and cognitive&#xD;
      performance during cool temperature exposure without midodrine in the same group with&#xD;
      tetraplegia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the mechanisms contributing to thermoregulatory fragility in&#xD;
      persons with tetraplegia when exposed to cool ambient temperatures that are routinely&#xD;
      encountered during their activities of daily living (ADL). Subnormal body core temperatures&#xD;
      and vulnerability to hypothermia (Tcore&lt;95°F) have been reported in veterans with tetraplegia&#xD;
      upon exposure to relatively mild environmental temperatures. The impact that a drift in Tcore&#xD;
      will be expected to have on cognitive performance, specifically working memory and executive&#xD;
      function, will be demonstrated. These 2 areas of cognitive performance are vital for the&#xD;
      ability to optimally care for one's self, which persons with higher cord lesions must excel&#xD;
      at to ensure health and to attain the maximal degree of independence possible. The one-time&#xD;
      administration of an alpha agonist, midodrine hydrochloride, in an attempt to attenuate the&#xD;
      drift in Tcore and prevent or delay the expected decline in cognitive performance to exposure&#xD;
      to cool on cognitive function will be investigated as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation for Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study visits will be at least 1 day apart but no more than 2 weeks apart. Subjects will&#xD;
      be provided a light, standard meal which they will be asked to eat 2 hours prior to their&#xD;
      scheduled visit time. The meal will be either a plain bagel or 2 pieces of toast. For each&#xD;
      visit, subjects will be asked to empty their bladders before their arrival and again upon&#xD;
      arrival, if needed. Subjects will be asked to avoid caffeinated and alcoholic beverages and&#xD;
      heavy exertion for 24-hours before testing. Subjects will wear minimal clothing (gym shorts,&#xD;
      sports bra) during the study to maximize bare skin exposure to the cool temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Cold Ambient Challenge Instrumentation: During the subject's first visit, a thin&#xD;
      flexible rectal sensor will be placed 4 inches beyond the anal sphincter for Tcore&#xD;
      measurement, and skin thermal sensors will be taped at 15 sites above and below the level of&#xD;
      lesion for collection of skin temperature (Tsk). A mask will be placed over the subject's&#xD;
      nose and mouth for measurement of exhaled gases from which resting metabolic rate will be&#xD;
      calculated from analysis of expired gases (VO2) by a metabolic cart. Laser Doppler flowmetry&#xD;
      (LDF) will be used to measure changes in microvascular perfusion by taping a laser doppler&#xD;
      probe on the skin in the area of the ulnar styloid processes and medial malleoli bilaterally&#xD;
      to confirm vasoconstriction. A pulse oximeter will be placed on the left second digit to&#xD;
      obtain blood oxygen saturation and heart rate (HR). An automated blood pressure cuff will be&#xD;
      placed above the right elbow to measure brachial blood pressure (BP). An intravenous catheter&#xD;
      will be placed in the right antecubital or nearby vein and secured for sequential blood&#xD;
      collection for blood hormones (cortisol and norepinephrine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Collection: At the end of the 30-minute acclimation period (81°F), a 15-minute&#xD;
      baseline (BL) collection of the following measures will be performed: Tcore, Tsk, and VO2&#xD;
      will be measured continuously; BP, HR, blood oxygenation, and thermal sensitivity will be&#xD;
      measured at 5-minute intervals; 5 minutes of LDF will be measured at 10-minute intervals; a&#xD;
      venous blood draw will be collected once for norepinephrine and cortisol concentrations. At&#xD;
      the end of the BL period, a cognitive performance battery will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cool Ambient Challenge: Following the completion of the baseline period, subjects will be&#xD;
      wheeled into a 64°F thermal room for 120 minutes or until Tcore ≤ 95°F. Tcore, Tsk, and VO2&#xD;
      will be continuously monitored for safety throughout the study, while BP, HR, blood&#xD;
      oxygenation, and thermal sensitivity will be measured every 10 minutes. LDF will be measured&#xD;
      for 5 minutes every 25 minutes, and Venous blood will be collected every 60 minutes. The&#xD;
      cognitive performance battery will be administered when Tcore has declined 1.8°F or is ≤&#xD;
      95.9°F (in subjects with tetraplegia) or after 120 minutes of cold exposure (in both groups).&#xD;
      A decrease in Tcore to ≤ 95°F, or moderate subject discomfort, will result in termination of&#xD;
      the protocol. Subjects will be transferred to a warm room (81°F), covered with warming&#xD;
      blankets, and given warm fluids. If symptoms continue, Dr. William Bauman will assess the&#xD;
      subject and provide the appropriate care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Cold Ambient Challenge with Midodrine Visit 2 will be completed in the subjects with&#xD;
      tetraplegia who participated in Visit 1 and demonstrated an impaired ability to maintain&#xD;
      Tcore. All procedures will be conducted in the seated position and will be the same as in&#xD;
      Visit 1, with the exception of the oral administration of a 10 mg tablet of midodrine&#xD;
      hydrochloride following the completion of the baseline period. Forty minutes after midodrine&#xD;
      administration (in order for the medicine's effects to start), a second baseline collection&#xD;
      will be performed and subjects will then be placed inside the 64°F thermal room for up to 2&#xD;
      hours or until Tcore ≤ 95°F. Data collection will follow the same schedule and be conducted&#xD;
      in the same seated position as in Visit 1. During Visit 2, BP will be continuously monitored&#xD;
      after midodrine administration for safety purposes. If subjects' BP increases to 160/90 mmHg,&#xD;
      subjects will be seen by Dr. William Bauman, who may consider the administration of&#xD;
      labetalol, if necessary.&#xD;

    <description>Midodrine hydrochloride is an approved medication used to treat low blood pressure. We are using a standard dose of 10 mg (tablet) only one time to determine if the vascular-constricting effects of this drug will help keep warm blood closer to the body's core and improve the ability to maintain Tcore in a cool environment (off-label use). A physician will administer the drug once before the cool thermal challenge in subjects with tetraplegia only (Visit 2).</description>
