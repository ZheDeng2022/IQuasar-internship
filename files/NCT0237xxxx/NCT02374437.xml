      This is a single-site, randomized, partly double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Aramchol&#xD;
      in sixty six (66) healthy male volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each part of the study subjects will be enrolled in the study within 28 days before drug&#xD;
      administration(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of three parts and the subjects will be assigned to three Parts as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A - single escalating doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this part is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Aramchol tablets at single doses of either 200 mg or 400 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve (12) subjects will be randomized to receive , following an overnight 10 hours fast, a&#xD;
      single dose of either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration A: 1×200 mg Aramchol tablet (6 subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration B: 1×400 mg Aramchol tablet (6 subjects) Subjects will be admitted to the&#xD;
           Clinical Research Center (CRC) in the evening before study drug administration (Day 0)&#xD;
           and will remain in-house for 36 hours after dosing. Blood samples for Aramchol&#xD;
           concentrations will be drawn for 36 hours at designated time points as described below.&#xD;
           Additional ambulatory samples will be collected at 48, 72, 96 and 144 hours post-dose.&#xD;
           Subjects will be continuously monitored for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An End-of Study/Safety Follow-up visit will take place on the last PK sampling day, i.e. 144&#xD;
      hours post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - food effect:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this part is to evaluate the effect of high fat high calorie meal on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of Aramchol and to assess the safety and tolerability of a&#xD;
      single 600 mg dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part is designed as a randomized, two period crossover food-effect study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighteen (18) subjects will be randomized to receive one of two administration sequences (C-D&#xD;
      or D-C) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration C: 1×200 mg +1×400 mg Aramchol tablets under fasting conditions (fasting&#xD;
           for at least 10 hours before and 4 hours after dosing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration D: 1×200 mg +1×400 mg Aramchol tablets under fed conditions (fasting for&#xD;
           at least 10 hours before dosing, consumption of a high calorie high fat meal within 30&#xD;
           minutes prior to drug administration and no food for additional 4 hours after dosing) In&#xD;
           each period of this part, subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Research Center&#xD;
           (CRC) in the evening before study drug administration (Day 0) and will remain in-house&#xD;
           for 36 hours after dosing. Blood for Aramchol concentrations will be drawn for 36 hours&#xD;
           at designated time points as described below. Additional ambulatory samples will be&#xD;
           collected at 48, 72, 96 and 144 hours post-dose. Subjects will be continuously monitored&#xD;
           for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a wash-out period of at least 14 days between each dosing session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An End-of Study/Safety Follow-up visit will take place on the last PK sampling day of the&#xD;
      second dosing period, i.e. 144 hours after second dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK profile of subjects who received administration C (i.e. 600 mg Aramchol tablet under&#xD;
      fasting conditions) will be compared with that of subjects who received 200 and 400 mg&#xD;
      Aramchol tablet under fasting conditions in Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C - multiple doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this part is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Aramchol tablets at multiple administrations of 3 different doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part is designed as a randomized, double blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      multiple-dose study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty six (36) subjects will participate in this part and will be equally randomized to&#xD;
      receive either 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo tablets for ten consecutive days. Drug&#xD;
      administration will be preceded by a light breakfast consumed within 1 hour prior to dosing&#xD;
      (the composition of which is described in Appendix III). All drugs will be administered by&#xD;
      the study staff except Dose No. 6 which the subjects will take at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to maintain blinding, all subjects will receive two tablets on each dosing,&#xD;
      according to the following administrations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration E: 1×200 mg Aramchol tablet + 1×400 mg Placebo tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration F: 1×200 mg Placebo tablet + 1×400 mg Aramchol tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration G : 1×200 mg Aramchol tablet + 1×400 mg Aramchol tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration H: 1×200 mg Placebo tablet + 1×400 mg Placebo tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment assignment will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) in the evening before the&#xD;
      first study drug administration (Day 0) and will remain in-house for 24 and 36 hours after&#xD;
      first (Day 1) and last (Day 10) doses, respectively. PK blood samples will be drawn on Day 1&#xD;
      for 24 hours at designated time points as described below. Additionally, ambulatory pre-dose&#xD;
      (trough) samples will be drawn before dosing on Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. On Day 10 blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected for 36 hours at designated time points as described below and&#xD;
      during additional ambulatory visits at 48, 96, 120, 144, 168 and 192 hours post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be continuously monitored for safety. An End-of Study/Safety Follow-up visit&#xD;
      will take place on the last PK sampling day of the study, i.e. 144 hours (for Parts A and B)&#xD;
      and 192 hours (for Part C) after the last dose administration.&#xD;
