      This open-label, adaptive design study was designed to determine the efficacy of the study&#xD;
      product in the treatment of eczema which would be assessed by the reduction of the appearance&#xD;
      of skin lesions and symptoms associated such as itching, scaling and redness.&#xD;

      Eczema is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by itchy red rashes commonly found in&#xD;
      the elbows or behind the knees. Eczema lesions may appear as collection of fluid in the skin&#xD;
      (vesicles) or as gross thickening of the skin (lichenification) with redness. It is also&#xD;
      associated with crusting, scaling, cracking, and swelling of the skin. Usually, it does not&#xD;
      need medical treatment. However, a more severe form of eczema is referred to as atopic eczema&#xD;
      or atopic dermatitis which occurs in childhood or early adulthood. The overall prevalence of&#xD;
      this condition in Northern Europe is 15-20% of children aged 7-18 years. Atopic eczema&#xD;
      greatly affects the quality of life of the individuals and in fact accounts for the highest&#xD;
      scores when compared with other dermatological diseases. A child with eczema experiences itch&#xD;
      and sleep disturbances, ostracism by other children, the need for special clothing and&#xD;
      bedding, avoidance of physical activities such as swimming and the need for frequent&#xD;
      application of ointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eczema is commonly treated with antihistamine pills and creams or ointments. Antihistamines&#xD;
      and steroid creams control the itching and rash caused by severe eczema. It is also&#xD;
      recommended that the skin be well lubricated to prevent it from becoming dry. A systematic&#xD;
      review of randomized clinical trials on atopic eczema summarized the interventions for&#xD;
      treating the condition which include pharmacological drug type (topical steroids), similar&#xD;
      intervention type (dietary measures) or convenience (non-pharmacological treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shea butter, which contains stearic acid, linoleic acid, and catechins (antioxidants), is&#xD;
      processed from nut of the Vitellaria paradoxa tree. It is traditionally used as lotion for&#xD;
      the skin and hair as it is considered an emollient and skin conditioning agent. It has also&#xD;
      been of importance in soothing arthritic pains, reducing swelling, treating skin problems,&#xD;
      and as antiseptic for wounds. Shea butter is also found in topical formulations used for&#xD;
      inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Shea butter consists of&#xD;
      triterpene cinnamates and acetates and these were found to have anti-inflammatory activity&#xD;
      which can help in the reduction of edema associated with eczema. Human clinical studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated shea butter as skin aging treatment which regenerates skin and gives smoother,&#xD;
      clearer skin. Wrinkles from photoaging were also diminished. Another trial showed that shea&#xD;
      butter has cicatrizing action in 70% of cases of hand dermatitis, sun burns and scars. A&#xD;
      cream with shea butter was also demonstrated to promote good moisturization of the skin&#xD;
      compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macadamia nut oil is one of the most heart-friendly oils. It contains vitamin E, omega-3,&#xD;
      omega-6, oleic, linoleic, and palmitoleic acids. Macadamia oil decreases low density&#xD;
      lipoprotein levels and increases high density lipoprotein levels thus reducing risk of heart&#xD;
      diseases. There are various benefits of macadamia oil on skin. It provides moisturization and&#xD;
      anti-aging effects. Palmitoleic acid, which is commonly found in the skin, decreases as&#xD;
      people age. Macadamia oil helps replace the lost compound to maintain youthful skin.&#xD;
      Blemishes and scars are also removed with the help of macadamia oil. It has anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      activity and antioxidant effects thus reducing free radicals on the skin and providing&#xD;
      healing of skin conditions such as sunburns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label, adaptive design study was designed to determine the efficacy of the study&#xD;
      product in the treatment of eczema which would be assessed by the reduction of the appearance&#xD;
      of skin lesions and symptoms associated such as itching, scaling and redness.&#xD;
