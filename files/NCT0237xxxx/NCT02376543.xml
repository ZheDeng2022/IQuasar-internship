      Comparison Study between 19 gauge EUS FNA BNX Needle vs. 22 gauge EUS FNA BNX Needle in&#xD;
      Pancreatic Fiducial Placement To Treat Pancreatic Cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective multicenter study to compare the cost, time, complications, and migrations rate&#xD;
      of two commercially available FDA approved needles; 19 gauge endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) fine&#xD;
      needle aspiration (FNA) BNX needles to 22 gauge EUS FNA BNX needles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be fiducials placed in the pancreas according to facility policy and procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized prospective multicenter trial. A minimum of 14 patients and a maximum of&#xD;
      30 patients will be enrolled at up to ten participating sites. Enrollment is projected to be&#xD;
      complete within approximately one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult subjects with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer who will receive SBRT for pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer via Cyberknife or Tomotherapy will undergo EUS guided fiducial marker placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive fiducial marker placement with either a 19 gauge EUS,&#xD;
      FNA BNX needle or a 22 gauge EUS, FNA BNX needle. For all patients, standard hospital&#xD;
      protocol will be followed for EUS procedures and patient care management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will commence at the time of EUS guided fiducial marker placement and&#xD;
      conclude at the time of last SBRT to the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost effectiveness will be evaluated by providing an itemized statement, including&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, and endoscopist charges. Time of procedure will be evaluated at time point&#xD;
      of first lead needle loaded to time of last marker placed. Time measurement will begin when&#xD;
      Endoscopist inserts the echoendoscope into the patient. Thus the patient is under anesthesia,&#xD;
      in position, and staff is ready for the case. The time ends once last fiducial marker is&#xD;
      placed. Complications will be reported and may include but not limited to pain, bleeding,&#xD;
      peritonitis, and pancreatitis. Migration will be reported during the timeframe from&#xD;
      simulation to the last day of SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to receive SBRT from this EUS guided fiducial placement will be reported as&#xD;
      simply a yes or no. Sites will provide a de-identified itemized statement for EUS guided&#xD;
      fiducial placement procedure, prior to any discounted rate, including the endoscopist and&#xD;
      anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up evaluations and treatment for pancreatic cancer will be performed in accordance&#xD;
      with standard of care procedures and procedures deemed necessary by the attending physician.&#xD;
