      The aim of this study is to evaluate the survival rate and the cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      occlusal-ART restorations using three GIC brands (Fuji IX, GC Europe; Maxxion R, FGM; Vitro&#xD;
      Molar, DFL) in primary molars.&#xD;

      Sampling procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the research ethics committee of the School of Dentistry&#xD;
      (University of São Paulo, Brazil) and a written informed consent will be obtained from the&#xD;
      parents or legal guardians of the participating children. The sample size was calculated&#xD;
      based on the minimum difference of 10% in the success rate between the control and treatment&#xD;
      groups after 1 year of follow-up, with and α of 5% and power (strength) of 80% using paired&#xD;
      test. According to the sample size calculation 150 children aged from 5-8 years old attending&#xD;
      public schools from the city of Barueri in the state of São Paulo, Brazil will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be included in this study the following criteria must be followed: healthy, cooperative&#xD;
      children with at least one occlusal carious lesion in a primary molar extending to the dentin&#xD;
      with dimensions not greater than 2 mm occluso-cervical and with an intact edge list. Also, to&#xD;
      be included the tooth cannot present ulcer, abscess, fistula, or pathological mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One occlusal restoration per child will be included in this study. If the selected children&#xD;
      present more cavities, they will be referred to the health centre of the municipality of&#xD;
      Barueri or will be treated by the operators of this research during the training week. All&#xD;
      the occlusal and proximal-ART restorations will be performed by two operators on the school&#xD;
      premisses. The operators will be final year dental students who will be previously trained to&#xD;
      perform ART and to mix the GIC according to the manufacturers' protocol. Additionally, a&#xD;
      try-out week will be included to give the operators the opportunity to familiarise themselves&#xD;
      with the local conditions prior to the start of the operative phase of the study. The&#xD;
      operators will be assisted by a local dentist and a dentist assistant, who will be previously&#xD;
      trained to mix the GIC according to the manufacturers' protocol. The children will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned into three groups: Fuji IX, Maxxion R, and Vitro Molar and the GIC brand&#xD;
      used in each child will be assigned by a random list. The operators are blind for the GIC&#xD;
      brand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ART technique will be performed according to the ART guidelines proposed by Frencken&#xD;
      (2014). No local anaesthesia will be used during treatment. The plaque will be removed and an&#xD;
      enamel hatchet will be used to make access to underlying softened dentine. Infected carious&#xD;
      dentin will be removed with hand instruments. The use of hand instruments on the dentin&#xD;
      surface results in a smear layer and need to be removed by the use of dentine conditioner.&#xD;
      The liquid component of the hand-mixed powder-liquid GIC, containing the acid component, will&#xD;
      be used and saliva isolation will be done with cotton wool rolls. The cavities will be&#xD;
      restored with one of the three GIC brands: Fuji IX (GC Europe, Leuven, BE), Maxxion R (FGM,&#xD;
      Rio de Janeiro, BR) and Vitro Molar (DHL, Rio de Janeiro, BR). The GICs will be hand mixed&#xD;
      according to the manufacturers´ instructions (powder/liquid ratio 1:1) and will be inserted&#xD;
      into the cavity with a conventional application instrument. A thin layer of petroleum jelly&#xD;
      will be rubbed over the index finger and the restoration will be pressed for 20 seconds. The&#xD;
      material will include sealing pits and the fissure. After preparing for a balanced occlusion,&#xD;
      a new layer of petroleum jelly will be applied to the GIC restoration. The amount of GIC&#xD;
      used, element number, cavity dimension and dmft will be recorded. The duration of the&#xD;
      restorative procedure will be recorded with a stop watch. The participating children will be&#xD;
      instructed not to eat for one hour after the restoration is placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of cost-effectiveness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness will be measured in terms of the retention rate. This study will report only&#xD;
      the preliminary results after 1 month, but the other follow-ups will be done every 6 months&#xD;
      up to 3 years. The average cost per restoration will be estimated. Costs of equipment,&#xD;
      autoclave and hand instruments, disposables (hand gloves, face masks, cotton wool rolls),&#xD;
      articulating paper and petroleum jelly used for the restorations are equal for all the three&#xD;
      GIC groups and will be excluded. There will be no labour costs for the operators. The&#xD;
      material cost (powder-liquid GICs) will be estimated per restoration. After this, a analysis&#xD;
      for each material will be made to see the cost-effectivess between each material (all the&#xD;
      materials used during the restorations) and the retention rate of the restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retention rate of the restorations will be evaluated after 1 month according to the&#xD;
      modified version of Roeleveld et al. (2006) criteria. A restoration will be considered as&#xD;
      'failure' when there is a defect in the filling, when secondary caries are observed, when the&#xD;
      restoration is not present or when the pulp is inflamed. When the restoration is still&#xD;
      present or a slight defect is observed, it will be considered as 'success'. When the tooth is&#xD;
      unavailable for evaluation, it will be censored. All evaluations will be carried out by one&#xD;
      independent evaluator, who did not restore the cavities, trained and calibrated by a&#xD;
      benchmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost effectiveness will be evaluated. The total price of each GIC brand, used to insert&#xD;
      into the cavities will be compared to the retention rate of the restorations.&#xD;
