  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this double-blinded placebo-controlled pilot study is to determine whether a&#xD;
      single sub-anesthetic rapid IV bolus dose of ketamine administered to acutely depressed&#xD;
      patients with or without suicidality has a significant rapid antidepressant effect in the&#xD;
      acutely depressed population. The study will pursue as a primary outcome measure whether a&#xD;
      significant reduction in depressive symptoms, as assessed by the BSS and BHS, occurs shortly&#xD;
      after administration of ketamine at 40, 80, 120, and 240 minutes. A secondary outcome measure&#xD;
      will be assessed to determine whether this single infusion of ketamine has a sustained&#xD;
      reduction in depressive symptoms within 2-weeks post-infusion with a reduction in BDI score.&#xD;
      Suicidal ideation will also be assessed for determination of any reduction and sustained&#xD;
      reduction post infusion by assessment of the Beck Suicidal Ideation Scale (BSS), Beck&#xD;
      Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at similar intervals.&#xD;

      A determination for hospital admittance by a consulting psychiatrist will be made prior to&#xD;
      study participation. Only those persons being admitted to the psychiatric ward will be&#xD;
      eligible to enroll in this study. After consenting to participate in the trial and meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria for this study (to include a baseline BDI, BSS, and BHS), voluntarily&#xD;
      presenting acutely depressed patients, with or without suicidal ideation, will be randomized&#xD;
      into two groups and administered standard of care treatment with intravenous ketamine&#xD;
      (0.2mg/kg over 1-2 minutes) or standard of care treatment with intravenous normal saline&#xD;
      (equal volume to ketamine dose). All prepared study solutions will be mixed and administered&#xD;
      by ED staff and/or nursing staff as per the existing NMCSD ED protocols. All subjects will be&#xD;
      blinded to the treatment given, either an IV bolus dose of ketamine at 0.2-mg/kg over 1-2&#xD;
      minutes or a placebo solution composed of an equal IV bolus dose (by overall volume) of 0.9&#xD;
      normal saline solution will be administered. Thereafter, all patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      clinically with a BSS, BHS, and BDI at 40, 80, 120, and 240 minutes. All study participants&#xD;
      will be monitored medically in the ED for at least the full 240-minute protocol and once&#xD;
      declared medically clear, in accordance with standard of care practices by the ED providers,&#xD;
      will be transferred to the inpatient psychiatric ward for further monitoring for at least&#xD;
      24-hours prior to discharge from the hospital. All enrolled patients will be administered&#xD;
      another BSS, BHS, and BDI prior to discharge from the hospital. The length of hospital stay&#xD;
      will also be recorded for further analysis, but will not be considered a secondary outcome&#xD;
      measure for this study. Psychiatric determination for discharge from the hospital will be&#xD;
      based on clinical assessment, presentation history, and hospital course and is not considered&#xD;
      an outcome measure for this study. All patients included in this study will be re-assessed&#xD;
      within 2 weeks with another BSS, BHS, and BDI for determination of sustainability of effects.&#xD;
      Appropriate follow-up care with a psychiatrist will be afforded to all study participants&#xD;
      after discharge from the hospital. Additionally, should any severe adverse side effects&#xD;
      develop; the treatment administered to enrolled patients may be un-blinded by a third-party&#xD;
      shift medical monitor (i.e. the Charge Nurse) on request from the emergency room provider.&#xD;
      Additionally, given the potential psychotropic effects of ketamine and to assure that&#xD;
      patients are sufficiently monitored and appropriately medically cleared, all participants in&#xD;
      the study will be required to remain under clinical observation in the emergency room prior&#xD;
      to transfer to the psychiatric ward for, at least, the full 4-hour treatment cycle or longer&#xD;
      as clinically indicated. All participants in this study will only be allowed to enroll in&#xD;
      this study and undergo this protocol's treatment once.&#xD;
