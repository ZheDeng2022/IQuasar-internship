  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The motivation for this study comes from a desire to improve the mortality of patients with&#xD;
      sepsis. Oxygen is cheap, readily available and is included in current United Kingdom&#xD;
      Emergency Department guidelines, but it may also be harmful to patients with sepsis - it is&#xD;
      important to know if this is the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot study to also assess the feasibility of delivering a larger adequately&#xD;
      powered study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no consensus on the use of oxygen therapy in sepsis resuscitation.&#xD;
      Uncertainty exists as to whether increasing oxygen above physiological levels (hyperoxia) or&#xD;
      maintaining physiological oxygen concentration (normoxia) confers the most benefit to&#xD;
      patients. By indicating whether hyperoxia is beneficial or not, the study hopes to further&#xD;
      increase the effectiveness of sepsis resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with sepsis there are convincing, coherent pathophysiological and evidence-based&#xD;
      justifications which support both normoxia and hyperoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why normoxia may benefit patients with sepsis: Enhanced oxidative and nitrosative stress&#xD;
      resulting from increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen&#xD;
      species (RNS) occurs during sepsis and is assumed to have major importance during the&#xD;
      development of shock-related hypotension, impairment of microcirculatory perfusion,&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction, and tissue injury. It is well established that increasing the&#xD;
      inhaled fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) leads to an increase in ROS production. The&#xD;
      negative effects of hyperoxia in humans have been well demonstrated in a number of&#xD;
      pathological conditions including stroke, myocardial infarction and some lung diseases. The&#xD;
      pathological processes behind each of these conditions is very different from that of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a small observational study (88 patients) in patients with sepsis, of the hyperoxic&#xD;
      patients, 8% died in hospital versus 6% with normoxia. Further prospective controlled trials&#xD;
      are required. The deleterious effects of hyperoxia have also been demonstrated in a rat&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why hyperoxia may benefit patients with sepsis: Underlying cellular hypoxia, which may be&#xD;
      difficult to detect, has been suggested as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sepsis&#xD;
      - this may be reversed or attenuated by high flow oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperoxia may reverse arterial hypotension and exert anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic&#xD;
      properties. The beneficial effects of hyperoxia have been demonstrated in rat and pig models&#xD;
      through increased survival and reduced inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study in rats showed the most benefit on survival from oxygen administration when oxygen&#xD;
      was administered in the first 4 hours of the trial, with no additional benefit beyond this&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further study (also in rats) demonstrated that 6 hours of oxygen per 24 hours for the first&#xD;
      48 hours following introduction of sepsis had the most beneficial anti-inflammatory effects.&#xD;

    <description>Oxygen will not be administered if a patient's oxygen saturations (as measured using a pulse oximeter) are less than 94%. If a patient's oxygen saturations are less than 94%, oxygen will be 'titrated' using a 'venturi' type oxygen delivery device to achieve target saturations of 94%. Following initial dynamic titration (to identify correct oxygen delivery level) the oxygen delivery device will be re-evaluated hourly during the patient's stay in the emergency department.</description>
