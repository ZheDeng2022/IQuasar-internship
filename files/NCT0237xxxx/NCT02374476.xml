      This non-randomized study will examine the safety and efficacy of irrigated bipolar&#xD;
      radiofrequency (RF) ablation in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients for&#xD;
      whom standard VT unipolar RF ablation has been unsuccessful. VT is a serious abnormality of&#xD;
      the heart's electrical system. Ablation is a procedure that cauterizes heart tissue using&#xD;
      catheters (long tubes that can be moved within or along the outside of the heart).&#xD;
      Cauterizing the heart tissue is accomplished by using heat to damage the abnormal heart&#xD;
      tissue that is not working well so that it can stop affecting the rest of the heart. Usually,&#xD;
      heat is delivered using a unipolar catheter, in which energy travels from the catheter tip to&#xD;
      a grounding pad. This research study seeks to find out if a bipolar ablation catheter, in&#xD;
      which the energy travels between two catheter tips on either side of the heart muscle, can be&#xD;
      used to eliminate the arrhythmia when the unipolar ablation is unsuccessful. The hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the increased current density and improved rates of transmural lesion creation seen&#xD;
      with bipolar RF ablation will lead to successful arrhythmia termination with minimal or no&#xD;
      increased risk of complication.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVE This study will examine the role of irrigated bipolar radiofrequency (RF)&#xD;
      ablation for the treatment of intramural ventricular tachycardia in patients who have failed&#xD;
      standard unipolar RF ablation. The hypothesis is that the increased current density and&#xD;
      improved rates of transmural lesion creation seen with bipolar RF ablation will lead to&#xD;
      successful arrhythmia termination with minimal or no increased risk of complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION, RATIONALE Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is the most commonly employed method for&#xD;
      the catheter treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Myocardial scar serves as the most frequent&#xD;
      substrate for the genesis of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmia. Such scar frequently&#xD;
      contains surviving myocyte bundles interspersed with fibrotic tissue, which leads to slow&#xD;
      conduction. Areas of denser fibrosis cause conduction block. When appropriately arranged,&#xD;
      conduction through or around these scars leads to the creation of a &quot;reentry&quot; circuit through&#xD;
      which an arrhythmia is generated and maintained. Each reentry circuit contains within it an&#xD;
      area called the isthmus, a portion of the circuit located in a position intimately related to&#xD;
      the scar border zone. Electrical activation travels slowly through the isthmus before&#xD;
      breaking out into normal myocardium. Ablation at the site of an isthmus will terminate a&#xD;
      reentrant tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of techniques, including electroanatomic mapping and activation, entrainment, and&#xD;
      substrate mapping, are employed during electrophysiologic (EP) study to identify areas of&#xD;
      myocardial scar and potential isthmus sites. Points or lines of ablation using RF energy are&#xD;
      then created in an attempt to interrupt the reentry circuit. Typically, unipolar RF energy is&#xD;
      applied via a catheter tip electrode to the endocardial or epicardial surface of the heart&#xD;
      and grounded via an electrode pad placed on the patient's skin. RF energy in this setting is&#xD;
      dispersed through the entirety of the tissue between catheter tip and grounding pad. The&#xD;
      standard 7-French, 4-mm tip catheters are highly successful at ablating circuits located&#xD;
      within a few millimeters of the catheter tip. A focal, 1mm area of resistive heating occurs&#xD;
      within the myocardium immediately in contact with the catheter tip; myocardial cell death&#xD;
      occurs several millimeters more deeply through passive, conductive heating, which spreads&#xD;
      outward from the contact point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the standard catheter is effective at the ablation of superficial arrhythmias, it has&#xD;
      proven more problematic when used for deep myocardial sites or for creating transmural&#xD;
      lesions. A number of alternatives have been developed in an attempt to access these sites.&#xD;
      8-mm or 10-mm catheter tips are able to create larger zones of resistive heating, delivering&#xD;
      direct RF energy to a larger area of myocardium. A larger interface between catheter tip and&#xD;
      blood improves cooling and allows for the delivery of more power without a rise in impedence.&#xD;
      The clinical use of these larger catheters can, however, be limited by rapid temperature&#xD;
      rises at the catheter-tissue interface, resulting in thrombus formation, char, and &quot;steam&#xD;
      pop&quot; rupture of the endocardial surface. The use of irrigated ablation catheters have&#xD;
      improved upon the ability to deliver RF energy without a sustained rise in impedance. Both&#xD;
      open irrigated- and closed-loop irrigated catheters circulate saline along the catheter&#xD;
      tip-myocardial interface, allowing for continued delivery of RF current without thrombus&#xD;
      formation at the endocardial surface. Intramyocardial temperature rises accordingly without a&#xD;
      concomitant endocardial temperature surge, creating larger and deeper myocardial ablation&#xD;
      zones. Catheters featuring a retractable needle tipped electrode with intramyocardial saline&#xD;
      infusion have also shown promise as a means of accessing deep myocardial circuits in&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia ablation, but are not currently available in the US. Transcoronary&#xD;
      ethanol ablation has also been employed with moderate success in patients with arrhythmias&#xD;
      resistant to endocardial catheter ablation. This technology, however, grants only limited&#xD;
      control over the size of the resulting infarct and is restricted by the need for perfusion of&#xD;
      the scar zone by an accessible coronary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there remain occasions in which an arrhythmia cannot be eliminated by standard&#xD;
      unipolar ablation technique. This is seen most frequently due to deep intramural ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia, sometimes encountered following myocardial infarction. Both standard and&#xD;
      alternative ablation strategies are frequently either unavailable or inadequate for&#xD;
      termination of these arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several centers have employed irrigated bipolar ablation (BA) to target arrhythmias&#xD;
      not amenable to unipolar ablation. During BA, two catheters are connected to either pole of&#xD;
      an RF generator, allowing either catheter to function as the &quot;active&quot; catheter and the other&#xD;
      the &quot;return&quot; catheter. Rather than being dispersed between the catheter tip and a distant&#xD;
      grounding pad, BA concentrates energy between two catheter tips positioned on opposing sides&#xD;
      of a target scar. BA may thus improve lesion transmurality through synergistic, simultaneous&#xD;
      heating and increased current density leading to concentrated thermal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial experience in the use of BA technology in mammalian hearts demonstrated that it could&#xD;
      successfully be applied to create discrete areas of myocardial necrosis with minimal risk of&#xD;
      complication. When compared to unipolar ablation, several studies suggested that BA could&#xD;
      create larger areas of necrosis and transmural lesions with only rare episodes of&#xD;
      perforation. Subsequent experience in human hearts was predominantly surgical: a large number&#xD;
      of observational studies and reviews demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of BA in&#xD;
      patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation and Cox-Maze surgery as either isolated&#xD;
      procedures or as adjuncts to valve replacement or coronary artery bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its broad use during surgical ablation, the application of BA during catheter-based&#xD;
      therapies is limited. Recently, our group demonstrated the utility of BA in both an in vitro&#xD;
      model and in a series of patients with arrhythmia resistant to unipolar ablation. When&#xD;
      compared to unipolar RF ablation, BA was found to be more likely to achieve transmural&#xD;
      lesions in a porcine heart model (33% vs 82%, respectively, p = 0.001) and could do so in&#xD;
      tissue up to 25 mm thickness. Clinically, all septal atrial flutters, 5 of 6 septal VTs, and&#xD;
      2 of 4 free-wall VTs were successfully acutely terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will further examine the role of BA in patients with ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia resistant to standard ablation techniques.&#xD;
