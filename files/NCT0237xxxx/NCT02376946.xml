      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled, clinical trial that&#xD;
      evaluates the efficacy of using PEMF in the postoperative period in decreasing swelling and&#xD;
      pain after extraction of impacted third molars. The study group will be comprised of subjects&#xD;
      that will receive PEMF Actiband treatment for postoperative management of pain and edema. The&#xD;
      control group will be comprised of the subjects that will receive a placebo patch as&#xD;
      treatment for postoperative management of pain and edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty (30) subjects will be randomly assigned to each group. Enrollment will continue until&#xD;
      60 qualified subjects have been recruited. Eligibility criteria will be based on the&#xD;
      standards for conducting oral surgery procedures on third molar extractions, in addition to&#xD;
      safety considerations and contraindications for the Actiband and other agents to be used.&#xD;
      Moreover, the selected subjects will have the same surgical difficulty and surgical trauma&#xD;
      anticipated standardized by classification system of impacted third molars. All inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be thoroughly explained in the relevant section of this proposal.&#xD;
      Postoperative edema and pain will be evaluated using 3dMD and Visual Analog Scale,&#xD;
      respectively. Different measurements will be obtained immediately before the surgery and in&#xD;
      standard periodic intervals as described in the Materials and Methods section of the&#xD;
      proposal. Any difference in postoperative edema, pain, and site responsible for request of&#xD;
      rescue pain medication will be compared and analyzed between the two groups.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled, clinical trial that&#xD;
      evaluates the efficacy of using PEMF in the postoperative period in decreasing swelling and&#xD;
      pain after extraction of partial or full/complete boney impacted third molars. The study&#xD;
      group will be comprised of subjects that will receive PEMF ActiPatchTM treatment for&#xD;
      postoperative management of pain and edema. The control group will be comprised of the&#xD;
      subjects that will receive a placebo patch as treatment for postoperative management of pain&#xD;
      and edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty (30) subjects will be randomly assigned to each group. Enrollment will continue until&#xD;
      sixty (60) qualified subjects have been recruited. Eligibility criteria will be based on the&#xD;
      standards for conducting oral surgery procedures on third molar extractions, in addition to&#xD;
      safety considerations and contraindications for the ActiPatch(TM) and other agents to be&#xD;
      used. Moreover, the selected subjects will have the same surgical difficulty and surgical&#xD;
      trauma anticipated standardized by classification system of impacted third molars. This&#xD;
      classification system is utilized in the TUSDM (Tufts University School of Dental Medicine)&#xD;
      oral surgery clinic. All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be thoroughly explained in the&#xD;
      relevant section of this proposal. Postoperative edema and pain will be evaluated using&#xD;
      3dMD(TM) and Visual Analog Scale, respectively. Different measurements will be obtained&#xD;
      immediately before the surgery and in standard periodic intervals as described in the&#xD;
      Materials and Methods section of the proposal. Any difference in postoperative edema, pain,&#xD;
      and site responsible for request of rescue pain medication will be compared and analyzed&#xD;
      between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 200 subjects will be enrolled in the study to account for screen failures. Up to forty&#xD;
      (40) subjects will be randomly assigned to each group. Recruitment will continue until up to&#xD;
      eighty (80) subjects have qualified for study participation. This will allow for up to 25%&#xD;
      dropout to end with 60 subjects completing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome, postoperative facial swelling at 72 hours (as measured by the 3dMD(TM)),&#xD;
      will be compared between the two groups using independent sample t-test if the data are&#xD;
      normally distributed, or the Mann Whitney U test if non-parametric methods need to be&#xD;
      utilized. This approach will also be utilized for comparing pain (as measured by VAS). The&#xD;
      percentage of subjects who will use rescue pain medication due to experience of postoperative&#xD;
      pain on the group treated with PEMF ActiPatch(TM) will be compared with the percentage of&#xD;
      subjects who will use rescue pain medication due to experience of postoperative pain for the&#xD;
      group received placebo, using a Chi-square test. In addition, the volume measurements and the&#xD;
      VAS scores will be analyzed using a repeated measures analysis, adjusting for subject age,&#xD;
      gender and pain perception. Furthermore, a correlation between placebo group and the use of&#xD;
      rescue pain medication will be determined and the association will be dictated by calculating&#xD;
      the odds ratio. The statistical significance of this association will be examined using the&#xD;
      Chi-square test. All p-values less than 0.025 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS, Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial 3dMD(TM) scan will be obtained for baseline evaluation at the extraction visit. A&#xD;
      second 3dMD(TM) scan will be obtained for evaluation and determination of facial swelling at&#xD;
      the 72 hour follow up visit. A third scan will be obtained at the 10 day follow up visit to&#xD;
      evaluate the degree of resolution of swelling. The scan will result in a computer-generated&#xD;
      image, on which the investigator will outline the area of clinical interest and calculate the&#xD;
      volume using integration. The process of surface scanning and volume measurement will use the&#xD;
      3dMD(TM) Vultus softwareÂ® (3dMD(TM), Atlanta, Georgia, United States).The Vultus software&#xD;
      allows for pre and post-surgery superimposition of images as well as quantitative evaluation&#xD;
      of surface and volume changes. The PI has had on site training at the Georgia 3dMD facility&#xD;
      and had additional training when the camera array was installed. The technique of obtaining&#xD;
      the image is straight forward and there is a set of instructions at the installation site for&#xD;
      immediate review as necessary. The PI and a representative from 3dMD company will give&#xD;
      training to the co-investigators who will be using the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of facial swelling between the two groups at the two time points (72 hour follow&#xD;
      up and 10 day follow up) will be compared using the data collected from 3dMD(TM).&#xD;
      Furthermore, the change in volume between the two scans taken at the 72 hour follow up visit&#xD;
      and the 10 day follow up within each group will also be compared. The volumetric difference&#xD;
      between the two groups will be analyzed for any statistical significance.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects of either sex and of any race between the ages of 18 and 30 years. 30 Years&#xD;
             old is the upper age limit because wisdom teeth extraction is normally done between&#xD;
             the ages of 18 and 30, since after the age of 30 additional complications can arise&#xD;
             during surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects for whom a decision has been made to extract 2 to 4 third molars. At least&#xD;
             two must be classified as full or partially bony impacted (as defined below) of any&#xD;
             angulation under local anesthesia alone, local anesthesia and sedation or local&#xD;
             anesthesia and general anesthesia all in an outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Full/complete bony: The entire tooth is below the level of the alveolar bone. The&#xD;
                  tooth is completely encased in bone so that when the gingiva is cut and reflected&#xD;
                  back, the tooth is not seen. Bone removal (large amounts) together with root&#xD;
                  sectioning will be needed to remove the tooth.33&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Partial bony: A portion of the height of the contour of the tooth is below the&#xD;
                  level of the alveolar bone. The superficial portion of the tooth is covered only&#xD;
                  by soft tissue but the height of the tooth's contour is below the level of the&#xD;
                  surrounding alveolar bone.33&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must be physically able to tolerate conventional surgical procedures (ASA&#xD;
             I/II)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must agree to follow the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who are known to be pregnant or think they may be pregnant. (A urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test will be performed on female subjects at Day 0 - Visit 1. Subjects&#xD;
             testing positive will be excluded from study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with a cardiac pacemaker, cardioverter defibrillator, neurostimulator or any&#xD;
             active medical or metallic implant (including dental implant).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with skeletal immaturity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with self-reported current or history of substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who are currently receiving any anti-inflammatory or pain medication&#xD;
             chronically or they suffer from a chronic pain condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with an allergy to vicodin (or its constituents, acetaminophen and&#xD;
             hydrocodone).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who are diagnosed with fibromyalgia.&#xD;
