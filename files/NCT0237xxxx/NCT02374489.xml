      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the objective response rate in patients with ROS1 or ALK over-expressed&#xD;
      locally advanced, or metastatic intrahepatic or hilar cholangiocarcinoma receiving LDK378&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:The progression-free survival ,The disease control rate ,The overall&#xD;
      survival ,The toxicity profiles , The correlation between clinical outcomes and the potential&#xD;
      predictive biomarker for tumor response&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sample size: LDK378 will be considered as an active agent and deserved for further&#xD;
      development. Considering 10% dropout rate, total 34 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: LDK378 in suitable patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect tumor tissue for immunohistochemistry staining to confirm the status of ROS1 or ALK&#xD;
      expression. If the patient fits all criteria, LDK378 750 mg ( p.o.) daily, with 3 week as a&#xD;
      treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Evaluation of tumor response according to RECIST 1.1 version&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation will be done at baseline and every 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation will be performed with CT or MRI and the response is defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete response - the disappearance of all target lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Partial response - at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of&#xD;
                target lesions compared to the baseline sum longest diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Progressive disease - at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of&#xD;
                target lesions compared to the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the&#xD;
                treatment started or the appearance of one, or more new lesions, or reappearance of&#xD;
                any lesion that had disappeared, or clear worsening of any assessable disease, or&#xD;
                appearance of any new lesion or site.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stable disease - neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor&#xD;
                sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, compared to the smallest&#xD;
                sum longest diameter since the treatment started&#xD;

             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill for a&#xD;
        minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

        order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
