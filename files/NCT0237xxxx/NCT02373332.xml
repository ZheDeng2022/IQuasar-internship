    <textblock>
      This study investigates the potential protective effects of altering fatty acid in the&#xD;
      platelet as a method for prevention of platelet activation and thrombosis in type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. Fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) and their oxidized lipids will be evaluated for&#xD;
      protection from agonist-mediated platelet activation in platelets from type 2 diabetics and&#xD;
      healthy controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      12-lipoxygenase and essential fatty acids such as omega-3 and omega-6 have been shown to play&#xD;
      important roles in regulating platelet activation, but the underlying mechanisms have not&#xD;
      been fully elucidated as well as their true protection from thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12-lipoxygenase inhibition prevents platelet activation in part by inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase&#xD;
      oxidation of free fatty acids in the platelet. These oxidized fatty acids are known to play&#xD;
      both a pro- and anti-thrombotic effect on platelets depending on the fatty acid. oxidation of&#xD;
      arachidonic acid by 12-lipoxygenase results in a pro-thrombotic bioactive lipid whereas&#xD;
      oxidation of the omega-6 fatty acid DGLA found in plant oil results in formation of a potent&#xD;
      anti-thrombotic bioactive lipid. Determining the extent of protection from this and other&#xD;
      bioactive lipids produced through 12-lipoxygenase will allow for a better understanding of&#xD;
      which fatty acid supplementation may best protect from thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Essential fatty acids such as omega-3 (DHA/EPA) and omega-6 (DGLA) appear to be protective.&#xD;
      However the underlying mechanism for this potential protection is not well understood.&#xD;
      Identifying the mechanism by which these supplements protect from platelet activation may&#xD;
      identify new approaches to preventing thrombotic events in this high risk population.&#xD;
