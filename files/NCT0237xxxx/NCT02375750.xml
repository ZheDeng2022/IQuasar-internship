      The primary objective of the study is to proof the successful use of Geistlich Bio-Oss® and&#xD;
      Geistlich Bio-Gide® (already registered medical devices) in bony peri-implant defects due to&#xD;
      peri-implantitis disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patient who will considered eligible at the screening visit will undergo surgical treatment&#xD;
      procedure within 2 weeks. At the day of the surgery the patients will be randomized into the&#xD;
      2 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be then prescribed postoperative antibiotics (Azitromax 500 mg day one and&#xD;
      250 mg day 2-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative pain will be controlled with Ibuprofen (400mg x 3) for two days to all&#xD;
      subjects. Subjects will rinse twice daily with Chlorhexidine mouth rinse and use modified&#xD;
      oral hygiene procedures during the first 5 weeks of healing. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      professional prophylaxis as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed on appropriate oral hygiene throughout the study and will be&#xD;
      given appropriate oral hygiene instructions. Instructions on post-operative care will be&#xD;
      repeated at each visit. In particular the following points have to be covered during the&#xD;
      first month after surgery: Chlorhexidine rinses, avoidance of brushing, usage of interdental&#xD;
      cleaning devices, avoidance of chewing on or trauma to the treated area. In addition subjects&#xD;
      will be instructed not to smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day during the entire study&#xD;
      period and not to consume alcohol during antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sutures will be removed after 14 days. Photos will be taken during the whole study to&#xD;
      document the healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further follow up visits will be scheduled 6 weeks and 3,6,9,12 months post-surgery.&#xD;
