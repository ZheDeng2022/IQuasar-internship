  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether a test for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific cell-mediated&#xD;
      immunity can be used to determine whether patients who complete a course of therapy for CMV&#xD;
      viremia need secondary antiviral prophylaxis. Subjects that have negative CMV CMI will&#xD;
      receive antiviral prophylaxis for 2 months and those with positive CMV CMI will have their&#xD;
      prophylaxis stopped.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most important infection in transplant patients and it is a&#xD;
      common cause of illness in patients who have undergone a transplant. Serious infections due&#xD;
      to CMV can affect many parts of the body including the lungs, the gut, and the liver; when&#xD;
      CMV infection becomes serious enough to cause symptoms, it is called CMV disease. Some&#xD;
      patients require treatment while others will clear the virus on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QuantiFERON-CMV (QFT-CMV) is a blood test that measures CMV-specific cell-mediated immunity.&#xD;
      This test was able to predict that patients with low cell-mediated immunity are at greater&#xD;
      risk for developing CMV disease. In this study, QFT-CMV will be used to make a decision&#xD;
      regarding CMV treatment. The QFT-CMV test will be performed at the first detection of CMV, at&#xD;
      end of antiviral therapy and one month post-therapy. The end-of-therapy results will be&#xD;
      available to clinicians and study investigators within one week of collection. Based on the&#xD;
      result, a decision will be made to continue with prolonged antiviral therapy. Patients that&#xD;
      show weak cell-mediated immunity against CMV will be given secondary antiviral prophylaxis,&#xD;
      while patients with good cell-mediated immunity will have their therapy stopped. Patients&#xD;
      will continue to be monitored three months after the last QFT-CMV test for recurrent CMV&#xD;
      viremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also attempt to evaluate the predictive value of the QuantiFERON-Monitor&#xD;
      (QFT-Monitor) assay. QFT-Monitor is a recently developed non-pathogen specific immune assay:&#xD;
      it is based on immune activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that stimulation of both the innate and adaptive immunity may predict global&#xD;
      immune function and also be predictive of CMV reactivation. The investigators plan to perform&#xD;
      the QFT-Monitor assay in parallel to the QFT-CMV test to determine the test characteristics&#xD;
      and cut-off values in predicting global immune function. This test will be collected and&#xD;
      tested in batches. Therefore, the results will not influence clinical decisions.&#xD;
