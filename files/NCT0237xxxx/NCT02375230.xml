      Establishing breathing after birth is vital for survival and long-term health of premature&#xD;
      babies. 10% of all preterm babies fail to breathe after birth and require help with&#xD;
      breathing. When infants need help with breathing the clinical team will place a small mask on&#xD;
      the babies face to give some breaths to help the baby breath (what the investigators call&#xD;
      mask ventilation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure is done million times a day around the world and several times a day here at&#xD;
      the Royal Alexandra Hospital. Providing these breaths via mask ventilation is the most&#xD;
      difficult step in helping a baby breath at birth. If this is provided wrongly then baby does&#xD;
      not receive enough oxygen, which could damage the brain and even cause death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To keep the skill level of every staff member up-to-date every staff member is required to&#xD;
      re-train this rescue breaths via mask ventilation once every two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe this is not enough and that daily trainings are necessary to keep&#xD;
      your skills up-to-date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to compare to different teaching techniques using daily trainings to&#xD;
      see if either improves the skills of the resuscitator providing mask ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 7 month (baseline observations (2 months), intervention period (3&#xD;
      months), After trial period (2 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use our routinely used equipment to record neonatal resuscitation and&#xD;
      the investigators also routinely make video recordings to evaluate performance during&#xD;
      resuscitation.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing breathing and oxygenation after birth is vital for survival and long-term health&#xD;
      of premature infants. 10% of all preterm infants fail to breathe after birth and require&#xD;
      respiratory support. An international consensus statement recommends that infants with&#xD;
      inadequate breathing or bradycardia after birth be given positive pressure ventilation (PPV)&#xD;
      via a facemask with a T-piece device. Mannequin and DR studies have shown that PPV is&#xD;
      difficult and mask leak and airway obstruction are common problems during PPV. Several&#xD;
      factors such as poor facemask application resulting in leak or airway obstruction,&#xD;
      spontaneous movements of the baby, movements by or distraction of the resuscitator, changing&#xD;
      the wet towels or putting a hat can reduce the effectiveness of PPV. We recently reported&#xD;
      both that significant airway obstruction and mask leaks occur in about half of the very&#xD;
      preterm infants who received PPV in the DR. In particular, large mask leak was observed in&#xD;
      twice as many recordings as airway obstruction and only in about a third of recordings&#xD;
      neither obstruction nor facemask leak occurred. In addition, mask leak was more likely to&#xD;
      occur at the start of PPV, while airway obstruction more often occurred later on. Assessment&#xD;
      of the infant may distract the resuscitators focus from mask position and mask holding&#xD;
      techniques during the initial phase of PPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR SOPA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) emphasizes on the ventilation corrective steps to ensure&#xD;
      effective mask ventilation before moving to the next steps of resuscitation. Technique for&#xD;
      improving PPV by mask is performed by a series of corrective steps, identified by the acronym&#xD;
      &quot;MR SOPA&quot;, to recall ventilation corrective steps. The steps should be followed with this&#xD;
      order: &quot;M Mask adjustment, R Reposition airway, S Suction mouth and nose, O Open mouth, P&#xD;
      Pressure increase, A Airway alternative&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses to be tested&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that improved mask ventilation techniques using daily MRSOPA-Drills (MR SOPA&#xD;
      group) compared to standard NRP teaching (control group) will reduce mask leak in preterm&#xD;
      infants &lt;33 weeks gestation who requiring breathing support at birth. We aim to determine if&#xD;
      daily MR SOPA Drills compared to standard NRP teaching improves mask ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Infants &lt;33 weeks gestation requiring respiratory support at birth will be&#xD;
      included if member of the Resuscitation-Stabilization-Triage team (RST-team) enrolled in&#xD;
      study attend deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Members of the RST-team, which usually consists of a neonatal nurse (n=50),&#xD;
      neonatal respiratory therapist (n=30), neonatal nurse practitioner (n=16) or neonatal fellow&#xD;
      (n=6), and a neonatal consultant (n=15). Deliveries are usually attended by a minimum of&#xD;
      three RST-Team members: a neonatal nurse, neonatal respiratory therapist and neonatal nurse&#xD;
      practitioner or neonatal fellow. Participants of each professional group will be randomized&#xD;
      after informed consent and members of each professional group will be stratified to both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, should state that babies health information will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of interventions and timeline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions for both groups (&quot;MR SOPA group&quot; and &quot;control group&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (2 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a period of two months all participants will be recorded during several real-life&#xD;
      resuscitations using our unique recording system (including respiratory function monitoring&#xD;
      and video recordings) to establish a baseline of mask PPV performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention period&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;MR SOPA group&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care provider randomized to the &quot;MR SOPA&quot; group will receive MR SOPA training provided&#xD;
      by a qualified educator on every shift. This training will be five minutes long and will&#xD;
      consist of each MR SOPA step. These corrective steps will be demonstrated and practiced on a&#xD;
      low-fidelity neonatal mannequin in the DR of the Royal Alexandra Hospital. The mannequin will&#xD;
      be placed on our DR resuscitation unit to simulate real-life scenarios. The alternative&#xD;
      airway practice will be performed on an intubation mannequin in the DR also placed on the DR&#xD;
      resuscitation unit. Each participant will receive five minutes of training at the start of&#xD;
      each shift.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educator will teach mask adjustment, and airway reposition. If either of these first&#xD;
      steps is unsuccessful the participant will learn about mouth and nose suction, open mouth and&#xD;
      increase of airway pressure. All participants will also learn and practice alternative&#xD;
      airways placement including intubation and laryngeal mask airway placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Control group&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care provider randomized to the control group will receive a copy of the NRP text&#xD;
      pages discussing MR SOPA at every shift for self-study. They will be encouraged by the&#xD;
      educator to study these pages for five minutes at every shift. The educator will be there to&#xD;
      answer questions if they arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After trial period (2 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruiting and training the study participants in the intervention period the real life&#xD;
      resuscitations will be recorded similarly as in the pre-trial period over the next two&#xD;
      months, using our unique recording system. This period will be compared to the baselines&#xD;
      measures in the pre-trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resuscitation&#xD;
&#xD;
      All resuscitative measures will be decided by the RST-team, in accordance with the 2010&#xD;
      guidelines for neonatal resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment for recording resuscitations&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use our routinely used equipment to record neonatal resuscitation including a&#xD;
      user-friendly respiratory function monitor will measure respiratory parameters including&#xD;
      tidal volume, airway pressures, gas flow, minute ventilation, and exhaled CO2. Percutaneous&#xD;
      oxygen saturation will be assessed using pulse oximetery and systemic and regional&#xD;
      hemodynamic function will be assessed using heart rate, and blood pressure. A high-definition&#xD;
      digital video of these resuscitations will be made using a webcam.&#xD;
