      1. Problem Outline, Theoretical Framework and Project Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
           The problem: Cervical Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cervical cancer is a serious public health problem. Worldwide, it is the third leading&#xD;
           cause of death of women. An estimated 270,000 women die every year due to cervical&#xD;
           cancer, and more than 85% of these deaths take place in developing countries (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chile´s national cervical cancer program was created in 1987. Since then, and with the&#xD;
           systematic implementation of cervical cancer screening through Papanicolau (Pap) smears,&#xD;
           cervical cancer mortality rates have dropped significantly (2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In spite of all efforts, cervical cancer continues to cause the mortality of more than&#xD;
           500 women each year in Chile. Across the nation, only 59 percent of the population is&#xD;
           up-to-date with their Pap, a figure that has not changed significantly in the last 10&#xD;
           years (2). In the Metropolitan Region, this percentage is as low as 56 percent. The&#xD;
           distribution of cervical cancer, like that of other cancers, follows a pattern of&#xD;
           inequality in that women of lowest socioeconomic status are those most affected (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Closing the Gap: Mobile Health (mHealth)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mobile technologies have had an exponential increase in the last few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In 2014, the penetration of mobile phones will reach 90% in developing countries&#xD;
           compared to 121% in developed countries. (5, 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
           This same trend can also be seen in access to mobile broadband technologies, which will&#xD;
           have an estimated penetration of 32% by the end of 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The number of internet users worldwide follows this same trend as well. By the end of&#xD;
           2014, there will be more than 3 billion users, with more than 2/3 of these in developing&#xD;
           countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to a survey by the Deputy Minister of Telecommunications in Chile (7), access&#xD;
           to a mobile or fixed internet connection was 39.4% by the end of 2009. This increased to&#xD;
           over 60% by 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This coverage is distributed unequally according to socioeconomic class, with more than&#xD;
           81% of penetration in richer homes and less than 30% in poorer strata (21.4% and 9.8%&#xD;
           respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
           On the other hand, mobile telephones reached more than 90% of homes in 2009, of both&#xD;
           rural and urban survey respondents interviewed by the Deputy Minister of&#xD;
           Telecommunications. While inequalities remain in this area as well, they are much less&#xD;
           profound than with other technologies: the mobile telephone can be found widely&#xD;
           distributed in all socioeconomic levels, and varies between 97% in richer strata and&#xD;
           82.8% in poor SES (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
           By the end of 2013, the percentage of mobile telephone subscribers per 100 inhabitants&#xD;
           was almost 40% for mobile phones with a contract and more than 94% for phones with&#xD;
           prepaid plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Solution: Using mobile health technology (mHealth)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mobile health (mHealth) has been defined by the WHO (World Health Organization) as&#xD;
           &quot;medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as mobile phones,&#xD;
           patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other wireless&#xD;
           devices&quot; (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given the explosion of the use of these technologies in the world and particularly in&#xD;
           developing countries, the potential for mobile health in health issues is huge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The overall interest in mobile health is widespread (11). According to the WHO´s report&#xD;
           on mHealth in 2011 (9), mobile health strategies exist in at least 75% of the countries&#xD;
           that belong to the WHO in each region. 100% of the countries in the Southeast Asian&#xD;
           region reported some mobile health initiative at different stages of development, and&#xD;
           the Americas region reported that more than 90% of its countries had some form of mobile&#xD;
           health initiative (Chile was not included in these statistics).&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the World Bank, high-income countries reported more initiatives than&#xD;
           low-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Some examples of mobile health initiatives in Latin America are the following: Mexico&#xD;
           reported a mobile health program called MedicalHome in which a million mobile telephone&#xD;
           subscribers have access to health professional support by telephone for $5 per month,&#xD;
           which is charged directly to the cell phone account. Columbia reported a program for&#xD;
           treatment adherence reminders using voice messages and Peru reported a RCT (Randomized&#xD;
           Controlled Trial) that was done to assess treatment adherence using text messaging in&#xD;
           patients with HIV/AIDS (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
           One of the most relevant problems regarding the use of these technologies is that there&#xD;
           isn´t sufficient evidence of its effectiveness in prevention (12). Because of this, it&#xD;
           is imperative to invest in rigorous and systematic evaluations of these interventions so&#xD;
           that they can be applied at the population level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While some evidence exists that shows that mobile health is an effective strategy for&#xD;
           treatment adherence for prenatal care and those with HIV and TB (13,14,15), the&#xD;
           potential use of mobile health technologies in cancer prevention has not been fully&#xD;
           explored. Given the widespread existence of mobile telephones in Chile, investigators&#xD;
           intend with this study to deliver a simple, replicable, and scalable intervention to&#xD;
           improve the rates of morbidity and mortality due to cervical cancer that afflict Chile´s&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Do mobile technologies have a preventive benefit in women with greater risk of getting&#xD;
      cervical cancer as compared to usual care? 2. In women with greater risk of getting cervical&#xD;
      cancer, what are the barriers and facilitators to implementing this kind of technological&#xD;
      intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Research Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Null Hypothesis: The proposed intervention does not increase Pap adherence rates in the&#xD;
           studied health centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Alternative Hypothesis: The proposed intervention increases Pap adherence rates in the&#xD;
           studied health centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Null Hypothesis: An intervention using mobile technology cannot be feasibly implemented&#xD;
           in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative Hypothesis: It is possible to implement an intervention using mobile technology&#xD;
      in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Study Objectives General Objective: Evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of a&#xD;
      mobile health intervention to increase cervical cancer screening adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effect that a text message intervention has on Pap adherence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the implementation and usability of a cellphone mobile health intervention in&#xD;
           three health centers of the Southeast Metropolitan Health District of Santiago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Methodology Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantitative phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Target Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Target population will be women between 25 and 64 years of age who use cell phones&#xD;
                and do not have an up-to-date Pap test (no Pap in the last three years). They must&#xD;
                also be registered at one of the following health clinics: CESFAM (Centro de Salud&#xD;
                Familiar) El Roble or CESFAM Juan Pablo II.&#xD;
&#xD;
                A randomized controlled trial will be carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
                text message intervention in improving Pap adherence. Socio-demographic variables&#xD;
                associated with its effectiveness will also be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Selection methodology: Using the database of medical records in each clinic, women&#xD;
                will be identified that meet the inclusion criteria. They will be invited to&#xD;
                participate in the study, and if they choose to accept, informed consent will be&#xD;
                obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Before randomization, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire&#xD;
                with simple demographic questions and questions regarding their beliefs and&#xD;
                attitudes about cellphone use and cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be randomized into either the intervention group or the control group&#xD;
           using a randomization software that keeps the randomization sequence hidden. The control&#xD;
           group will receive their usual care in each health center, which consists of different&#xD;
           interventions depending on the health center they attend. Examples of usual care include&#xD;
           periodic midwife visits, education by health personnel and cervical cancer health&#xD;
           campaigns.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c) Intervention: Women randomized to the intervention group will receive text and voice&#xD;
           messages (designed with input from previous qualitative phase) sent to their cellphones&#xD;
           that remind them to get a Pap smear, send them information about cervical cancer, and&#xD;
           inform them of health clinic location and hours where they could get a Pap smear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Qualitative phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of a mHealth intervention could fail for many reasons. Some of the&#xD;
      previously described barriers for this and other types of mobile interventions are:&#xD;
      restrictions in the number of characters in the text message, illiteracy, poor signal&#xD;
      coverage and quality, and confidentiality and pertinence in families where cellphones are&#xD;
      shared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there may be many other factors that hinder or facilitate its effectiveness: lack of&#xD;
      funds to keep credit on a cellphone throughout the entire month, losing the phone, little use&#xD;
      of text messaging in the elderly, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will carry out focus groups with women who receive care at the participating&#xD;
      centers in order to define barriers and facilitators to a text message intervention that will&#xD;
      promote Pap adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus Groups Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women between 25 and 64 years old that meet the inclusion criteria for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midwives at the health care centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will carry out nine (9) focus groups in total. Women will let us know about&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to the use of this technology and midwives will help investigators&#xD;
      to characterize the usual care that women receive and better inform text message content as&#xD;
      well as barriers to their use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every community member that attends a focus group will receive an incentive of 5,000 Chilean&#xD;
      pesos (8 USD) for their time and information. Each health professional that attends a focus&#xD;
      group will receive 10,000 Chilean pesos (16 USD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Encoding The focus groups will be led by individuals expert in qualitative methods and&#xD;
      assisted by the Principal Investigator and a student assistant who will serve as a&#xD;
      note-taker. The focus groups will be recorded for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The audio of the focus groups will be transcribed and coded using the software Atlas.ti&#xD;
      version 6.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Information will be analyzed using a qualitative content analysis process* by two or&#xD;
      more investigators who will extract relevant themes regarding usage patterns, barriers, and&#xD;
      facilitators to this type of intervention. Investigators will use the conceptual framework&#xD;
      called PRECEDE-PROCEED in order to carry out the analysis*. Investigators will use it to&#xD;
      identify predisposing factors that reinforce and enable the use of mobile technologies to&#xD;
      improve Pap adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected information will contribute to the design of the intervention, and from there&#xD;
      the quantitative phase of the study will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d) Sample size Previous studies have shown that without an intervention, around 30% of women&#xD;
      who are not up-to-date with their Pap test will get a Pap within the following 6-12 months.&#xD;
      Looking at literature regarding similar interventions for other pathologies, investigators&#xD;
      anticipate seeing an absolute increase of 15% in adherence rate. With this difference in&#xD;
      proportions, and alpha errors of 5% and beta errors of 20%, the estimated sample size is 176&#xD;
      per arm. Considering a loss of 10%, investigators will recruit an estimated 200 patients per&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e) Statistical Analysis Investigators will use descriptive statistics to characterize&#xD;
      demographic variables of the included patients in the same manner as charactering the&#xD;
      indicators of implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcome (proportion of women with an up-to-date Pap), investigators will use&#xD;
      a chi-squared test to test differences in proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the multivariate analysis, investigators will use logistic regression and Poisson&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the categorical variables, investigators will use a chi-squared test.&#xD;
