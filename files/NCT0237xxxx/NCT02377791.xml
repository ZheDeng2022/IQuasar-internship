  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus is a drug used commonly in kidney transplant patients to prevent graft rejection.&#xD;
      Tacrolimus acts in a very narrow range in the blood for its optimum activity. If the levels&#xD;
      are too high, there is a risk of kidney injury, whereas, if the levels are too low there is a&#xD;
      higher risk of rejection and graft loss. Genetic differences in the gene coding for the&#xD;
      enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP3A5), which is responsible for breaking down active tacrolimus can&#xD;
      contribute to variations in blood levels of tacrolimus among different individuals taking the&#xD;
      same dose of the drug. Certain genetic types lead to low concentrations, whereas certain&#xD;
      genetic types can lead to high levels. The proportion of individuals with different types of&#xD;
      genetic variations differ among different ethnic populations. Limited data are available in&#xD;
      Thai subjects or on the risk have having certain types of genetic variations on the risk of&#xD;
      rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare the effects of different types of CYP3A5 gene variations on&#xD;
      Tacrolimus drug levels and risk of acute rejection in Thais.&#xD;

      Rationale important theory or hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tacrolimus, a potent calcineurin inhibitor, is commonly used in kidney transplant patients&#xD;
      worldwide. Tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic index. Overdosing increases the risk of&#xD;
      dose-related adverse drug reactions and infections, whereas underdosing increases the risk of&#xD;
      rejection and graft loss. In addition, achieving therapeutic tacrolimus levels is complicated&#xD;
      by high intra- and inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability of the drug. Though, the&#xD;
      source of pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus is not fully understood. It is known that&#xD;
      the inter-individual variation in metabolism of tacrolimus is at least partly due to&#xD;
      differences in expression of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 enzyme, one of the key proteins&#xD;
      involved in tacrolimus systematic clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutations due to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the gene encoding CYP 3A5 have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to affect their expression. Among CYP3A5 alleles, CYP3A5*1 has been found to be&#xD;
      the main allele associated with CYP 3A5 expression, whereas the mutant allele CYP3A5*3&#xD;
      prevents expression of the enzyme. Several studies have shown that this mutation affects the&#xD;
      dosing of tacrolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of CYP3A5 SNP varies among different ethnic populations . In a small study in&#xD;
      Thais, the frequency of , CYP3A5*1/*1 genotyping was identified in 20.6% of patients,&#xD;
      CYP3A5*1/*3 in 35.3% and CYP3A5*3/*3 in 44.1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study on the impacts of the CYP 3A5&#xD;
      genetic polymorphisms on tacrolimus blood concentration and acute rejection rate during the&#xD;
      very early stage post-transplantation in Thai kidney transplant recipients. Evaluation of&#xD;
      CYP3A5 polymorphisms may be helpful in determining an appropriate starting dose, timely&#xD;
      achieving target levels, and improving outcomes of tacrolimus-based therapy in this group of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we are to determine the impacts of CYP 3A5 genetic polymorphisms on tacrolimus&#xD;
      trough blood concentration during the first post-operative week and acute rejection rate at&#xD;
      3-month post-transplantation comparing between CYP3A5 expressers (CYP3A5*1 homozygotes or&#xD;
      heterozygotes) and CYP3A5 non-expressers (CYP3A5*3 homozygotes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective analytical study will be performed at Ramathibodi hospital, Bangkok,&#xD;
      Thailand. Thai recipients who underwent kidney transplantation between January 2011 and&#xD;
      December 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and clinical data will be gathered from the medical files and records. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected for determination of genotypes of CYP3A5, other metabolic enzymes&#xD;
      and transport proteins with respect to their corresponding effects on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      tacrolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval for this study will be obtained from the ethics committee of Ramathibodi hospital,&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine, Mahidol University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the study of Sang-Il Min, et al , the effect of CYP3A5*1 allele with early acute&#xD;
      rejection and graft function in patients with kidney transplants who received tacrolimus.&#xD;
      CYP3A5 expressers (n=29) had the mean trough concentration to dose ratio of 127.09 ± 69.40&#xD;
      ng/mL/mg/kg. While CYP3A5 non-expressers (n=33) had the mean trough concentration to dose&#xD;
      ratio of 220.99 ± 108.95 ng/mL/mg/kg on day 10 after kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is estimated using the formula: n/group=2(Zα + Zβ)2σ2/(µ1-µ2)2 Given dose&#xD;
      adjusted Co of Tac among expressor µ1= 127.09±69.40 and the different at least 25% would have&#xD;
      clinical significant so the absolute different was 30. Calculated sample size was at least 85&#xD;
      patients per group so the total subjects would be at least 170 patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in genotype will be assessed using SPSS version 17.0 software for chi square or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U tests.&#xD;
