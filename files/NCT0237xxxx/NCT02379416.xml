    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers want to find better ways to treat cancer. One drug that treats cancer is&#xD;
      paclitaxel. Sometimes proteins block that drug from working. Researchers want to see if&#xD;
      another drug, nilotinib, helps paclitaxel work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety of nilotinib plus paclitaxel and find out what doses of the drugs can be&#xD;
      given safely to people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults at least 18 years old with advanced cancer that has progressed after receiving&#xD;
      standard treatment, or for which no effective therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with tests they usually get in their cancer care: medical&#xD;
           history, physical exam, blood and urine tests, heart test, and scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take the two study drugs in 28-day cycles. They will keep a medicine&#xD;
           diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nilotinib will be taken by mouth twice every day except day 1 of the first cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel will be given by IV once a week for the first 3 weeks of a cycle. This will&#xD;
           usually be done at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most participants will have a weekly study visit every week for cycle 1, then the first&#xD;
           3 weeks of other cycles. They will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests multiple times for cycle 1, then the first 3 weeks of other cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans every 8 weeks. These may be CT or MRI scans, in a machine that takes pictures. Or&#xD;
           they may be ultrasounds, where a wand is pressed on the skin with gel on it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Around 30 days after stopping the study drugs, participants will be called to discuss&#xD;
           any side effects.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The BCR-Abl kinase inhibitor nilotinib demonstrated greater than additive activity in&#xD;
      combination with the anti-tubulin agent paclitaxel in preclinical xenograft models,&#xD;
      justifying the clinical evaluation of this combination for its antitumor activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nilotinib&#xD;
           plus paclitaxel in patients with refractory solid tumors, both in adult subjects &gt;=18&#xD;
           years of age and in pediatric/adolescent subjects 12-17 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel when administered in combination with&#xD;
           nilotinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of the combination on biomarkers of apoptosis,&#xD;
           DNA damage response, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants must have histologically confirmed solid tumor that has progressed on&#xD;
           standard therapy known to prolong survival or for which no standard treatment options&#xD;
           exist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study&#xD;
           (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open-label Phase I trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During dose escalation, the starting dose of nilotinib will be administered at 300 mg&#xD;
           orally BID from cycle 1 day 2 and paclitaxel will be administered IV at 60 mg/m2 at dose&#xD;
           level 1 on Days 1, 8, and 15 in 28-day cycles. For cycle 2 on, nilotinib will be&#xD;
           administered from day 1. Dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design, with dose limiting&#xD;
           toxicities defined during cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 33 adult patients will be accrued to a PD expansion phase at the MTD to further&#xD;
           assess pharmacodynamic endpoints in tumor and CTCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As of Amendment O (May 2020), patients ages 12-17 will be accrued to a separate&#xD;
           pediatric expansion cohort to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
           pharmacodynamics of this combination for pediatric patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Nilotinib and paclitaxel have both been assigned to pregnancy category D by the FDA.&#xD;
             For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation and for at least 3 months after&#xD;

             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 3 months after completion of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have completed radiation therapy, or major surgery greater than or equal&#xD;
             to 3 weeks, or biologic therapy or chemotherapy greater than or equal to 5 half-lives&#xD;
             or 3 weeks, whichever is shorter (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C) prior to&#xD;

             administration of a study drug in a Phase 0 or equivalent study and be greater than or&#xD;
             equal to1 week from palliative radiation therapy. Patients must have recovered to&#xD;
             eligibility levels from prior toxicity or adverse events. Treatment with&#xD;
             bisphosphonates is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the PD-expansion cohort, patients must be willing to give biopsies for research&#xD;
             and have tumors amenable for the acceptable biopsy procedures- or in lieu of baseline&#xD;
             biopsies, patient must have and be willing to submit at registration archival tumor&#xD;
             biopsy tissue from a previous research study or medical care. Criteria for the&#xD;
             submission of archival tissue are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tissue must have been collected within 3 months prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not have received any intervening therapy for their cancer since the&#xD;
             collection of the tumor sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor tissue must meet the minimum requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTcF interval of less than 450 msec at study entry; congenital long QT syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensory/motor neuropathy less than or equal to Grade 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial. Patients with treated brain metastases, whose brain metastatic&#xD;
             disease has remained stable for less than or equal to 4 weeks without requiring&#xD;
             steroid and anti-seizure medication are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic respiratory failure/congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nilotinib and paclitaxel have been&#xD;
             assigned to pregnancy category D by the FDA. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             the study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             drug and women should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 3&#xD;
             months following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             possible PK interactions with study drugs.&#xD;
