      A recent study with the DPP-IV inhibitor Linagliptin showed an improvement in the urinary&#xD;
      albumin creatinine ratio in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Gutzwiller et. Al. have shown&#xD;
      that GLP-1 increases renal Na secretion and inhibits renal H secretion, further indicating&#xD;
      some direct renal effects of GLP-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it seems likely that treatment with the DPP-IV inhibitor Linagliptin evolves&#xD;
      several beneficial effects on microvascular and endothelial function beyond glucose control&#xD;
      which most probably have an impact on the progression of renal and retinal microvascular&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to investigate the effect of Linagliptin in comparison to&#xD;
      placebo on the UACR in patients with high blood pressure and an increased albumin excretion.&#xD;
      Numerous, equivalent endothelial, renal, and retinal parameters serve as objectives of the&#xD;
      study. All study parameters will be handled in an exploratory sense for the generation of&#xD;
      models to further discuss the role of DPP-IV inhibition on renal and retinal physiology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal tissue damage and an increase in the albumin excretion rate is a strong predictor for&#xD;
      the development and progression of endothelial dysfunction and the development of&#xD;
      microvascular and/or macrovascular complications. Increased blood pressure as well as&#xD;
      increased glucose levels were found to impair renal- and retinal function, and a close&#xD;
      association in the incidence and progression rate of retinopathy and nephropathy could be&#xD;
      observed. Endothelial dysfunction and alterations in microvascular blood flow are early&#xD;
      pathogenetic features in the development of renal and retinal tissue damage as found in&#xD;
      patients with arterial hypertension and / or diabetes mellitus. A couple of studies have&#xD;
      shown that urinary albumin excretion is associated with morphological and functional&#xD;
      alterations in retinal microvascular blood flow. In patients with arterial hypertension blood&#xD;
      pressure lowering treatment were shown to decrease the albumin excretion rate and to improve&#xD;
      endothelial function of the retinal vasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently DPP-IV Inhibitors have been introduced in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      Beside the metabolic effects of this drug class, several pleiotropic effects beyond metabolic&#xD;
      control were documented in numerous studies, and are the topic of ongoing clinical research.&#xD;
      Treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors was found to improve myocardial and endothelial function, to&#xD;
      improve blood lipids, to lower blood pressure and to improve markers of renal function. GLP-1&#xD;
      receptors in vessels, kidney and the heart might account for those glucose independent&#xD;
      effects of GLP-1. However, it is also conceivable that DPP-IV inhibition might exert vascular&#xD;
      effects independent from GLP-1. In vitro studies demonstrated that DPP-IV is expressed in&#xD;
      endothelial cells, and the inhibition of DPP-IV reduced the microvascular tone through direct&#xD;
      mediation of the nitric oxide system. Therefore, it seems conceivable that the glucose&#xD;
      independent effects of DPP-IV inhibition might be mediated through GLP-1 receptor signaling&#xD;
      and /or direct inhibition of the enzyme DPP-IV in vascular, renal, or retinal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study with the DPP-IV inhibitor Linagliptin showed an improvement in the urinary&#xD;
      albumin creatinine ratio in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Gutzwiller et. Al. have shown&#xD;
      that GLP-1 increases renal Na secretion and inhibits renal H secretion, further indicating&#xD;
      some direct renal effects of GLP-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it seems likely that treatment with the DPP-IV inhibitor Linagliptin evolves&#xD;
      several beneficial effects on microvascular and endothelial function beyond glucose control&#xD;
      which most probably have an impact on the progression of renal and retinal microvascular&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
