  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary concern in complex renal cysts (CRC) with malignant potential is the accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis and characterization. Patients with CRC have to undergo frequent imaging&#xD;
      surveillance (every 6-12 Mo), in which the progression suggests a neoplastic process. The&#xD;
      gold standard for establishing diagnosis and necessity for surgical intervention (i.e.&#xD;
      partial nephrectomy) is conventional computer tomography (CT) imaging. Its main drawback is&#xD;
      the radiation dose to the body and intravenous contrast media administration, which has a&#xD;
      risk of nephrotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with special functional sequences (fMRI) and&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) allow measuring tissue blood flow and perfusion&#xD;
      characteristics without ionizing radiation or nephrotoxic contrast media. To compare the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of CEUS/functional MRI versus the gold&#xD;
      standard CT, 60 patients with CRC will be evaluated using all these 3 modalities. The main&#xD;
      hypothesis is that fMRI and CEUS have equal accuracy with CT regarding diagnosis and&#xD;
      classification of CRC lesions.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal cysts occur in a variety of diseases but also in normal kidneys (i.e. simple cysts).&#xD;
      Diagnostic imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis of renal cysts and lesions. Most&#xD;
      patients are diagnosed after undergoing imaging (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging [MRI], ultrasound [US]) for an unrelated reason and their increasing incidental&#xD;
      finding during the last decade parallels the growing use of imaging procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple renal cysts are commonly observed in normal kidneys and are of limited clinical&#xD;
      relevance. The primary clinical concern is the accurate evaluation of complex renal cysts&#xD;
      (CRC) that have a malignant potential. Based upon the initial radiographic evaluation,&#xD;
      further studies may be required, and some complex lesions may require surgical excision for&#xD;
      exact diagnosis, based on growth during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard for the diagnosis of CRC is conventional CT imaging. Its main drawback is&#xD;
      the radiation dose to the body and intravenous contrast media administration, which has a&#xD;
      risk of nephrotoxicity. In order to accurate classify and manage these lesions, the Bosniak&#xD;
      renal cyst classification system was created. Based upon morphologic and enhancement&#xD;
      characteristics of the CT scan, cystic renal masses are placed in one of five categories (I,&#xD;
      II, IIF, III, IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although not yet validated for reader agreement or generalizability, the Bosniak renal cyst&#xD;
      classification system has been widely accepted by urologists and radiologists as the best way&#xD;
      to assess and follow these CRC lesions. While the Bosniak classification is based on CT&#xD;
      findings, the same approach is applicable as a useful predefined framework for the evaluation&#xD;
      of CRC with other radiographic modalities i.e. with MRI and conventional or contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound. The ability to differentiate between those that are benign versus malignant&#xD;
      (surgical versus nonsurgical masses) still represents a major challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has gained immense popularity over the last decades as it&#xD;
      allows generation of very high-resolution images, including 3D reconstructions, without&#xD;
      ionizing radiation. Functional MRI can be performed with or without injection of contrast,&#xD;
      thus avoiding the risk of nephrogenic systemic sclerosis in patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD). Diffusion weighted imaging (DW-MRI), blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI&#xD;
      and arterial spin labeling (ASL) sequences are functional sequences which can be performed&#xD;
      without injection of contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent development and availability of a contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) using&#xD;
      microbubbles has further improved sensitivity and diagnostic confidence with respect to&#xD;
      conventional and colour-Doppler US. They allow vascular bed opacification and have opened the&#xD;
      way to detecting the microcirculation. CEUS was able to detect changes in human renal&#xD;
      cortical microcirculation. Thus it seems to be a feasible technique to evaluate (i.e.&#xD;
      perfusion pattern of the cyst wall or perfusion of the septa) CRC using the Bosniak&#xD;
      classification system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally, the method for the evaluation of CRC should be safe, non-invasive, and accurate.&#xD;
      Abdominal CT scanning delivers significant ionizing radiation, which may be a consideration&#xD;
      for younger patients (age &lt;35 years), utilizes contrast media with a considerable&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity and risk of an allergic reaction. No prospective study comparing CT with CEUS&#xD;
      or functional MRI for the evaluation of CRC has been conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of CEUS/fMRI and compare it with abdominal CT the current gold standard&#xD;
      diagnostic modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, single center, observational setting. Patients with CRC who fulfill the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be further evaluated after written informed consent. Kidney function&#xD;
      and the CRC progression will be followed according to the current medical standards. If a&#xD;
      significant change in cystic lesions is observed, further evaluation and surgical&#xD;
      intervention, if indicated, will be initiated by the primary physician in charge. Testing&#xD;
      will be performed upon study entry and after 12 months according to the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood-sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fMRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  renal CEUS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chart review Two study physicians independently will review the CEUS and functional MRI&#xD;
           images of the patients. The reviewers will be aware of study design but will be blinded&#xD;
           to the clinical information of the CT findings. The scoring system for image&#xD;
           interpretation will be based on the Bosniak cyst classification.&#xD;
