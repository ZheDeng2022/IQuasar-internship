      Dr. Parker (the &quot;Investigator&quot;) and Semmes Murphey Foundation (&quot;Foundation&quot;) are conducting a&#xD;
      study of outcomes and safety associated with degenerative discs at Semmes-Murphey Clinic,&#xD;
      P.C. (&quot;Semmes-Murphey&quot;). This study will look at a product that is derived from human tissue,&#xD;
      that will be injected into the affected disc. With this study, the investigators hope to find&#xD;
      a safe and effective way to treat degenerative disc disease.&#xD;

      Dr. Parker (the &quot;Investigator&quot;) and Semmes Murphey Foundation (&quot;Foundation&quot;) are conducting a&#xD;
      study of outcomes and safety associated with degenerative discs at Semmes-Murphey Clinic,&#xD;
      P.C. (&quot;Semmes-Murphey&quot;). This study will look at a product that is derived from human tissue,&#xD;
      that will be injected into the affected disc. With this study, we hope to find a safe and&#xD;
      effective way to treat degenerative disc disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare injectable placental tissue extract called BioDGenesis (&quot;Active&#xD;
      Product&quot;) to injectable Normal Saline (&quot;Placebo&quot;). The Active Product is supplied by BioD,&#xD;
      LLC (&quot;BioD&quot;). You have a 50 percent chance of receiving the Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for 52 weeks. After all patients have been enrolled in the study and have&#xD;
      completed 26 weeks, the Investigator will conduct a safety and efficacy analysis. If the&#xD;
      investigator determines that the Active Product is more effective than Placebo in treating&#xD;
      degenerative disc disease and there are no safety concerns with the Active Product, patients&#xD;
      who received Placebo will have the option of receiving the Active Product through week 52.&#xD;
