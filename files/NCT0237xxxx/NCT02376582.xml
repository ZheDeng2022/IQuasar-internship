  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed phase I trial is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of DNA-HIV-PT123 and AIDSVAX®B/E combination regimen. Though both DNA-HIV-PT123&#xD;
      and AIDSVAX®B/E and the combination of the two vaccines have been evaluated in humans and&#xD;
      have shown to be safe and well tolerated, this is the first time the combination regimen is&#xD;
      being evaluated in HIV-1 uninfected African populations with and without S. mansoni. The&#xD;
      secondary objective of the trial is to evaluate the effect of S. mansoni infection on the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the combination of DNA-HIV-PT123 and AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine regimen.&#xD;
      Successful vaccination against most viruses requires efficient Th1 response. There is&#xD;
      evidence that helminth infections skew the host immune system of human and animals to&#xD;
      T-helper type 2 (Th2) and induce immunosuppression. Therefore, there is a potential that&#xD;
      helminth infected populations may not generate the desired immune responses to vaccines&#xD;
      designed to drive Th1-type and cytotoxic T-cell responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the influence of helminth infections on the development of protective antibody&#xD;
      responses remains unclear. Limited data in animal models suggests that worm infections&#xD;
      reduced efficacy of vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed vaccine trial will generate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data of a&#xD;
      vaccination regimen with simultaneous administration of a candidate HIV DNA vaccine&#xD;
      (DNA-HIV-PT123) and a gp120 protein vaccine (AIDSVAX®B/E). This will be the first HIV vaccine&#xD;
      trial to prospectively evaluate the impact of the S. mansoni infection on safety and immune&#xD;
      responses to HIV vaccines.&#xD;
