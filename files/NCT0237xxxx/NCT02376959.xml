      Background: The use of alternative therapies in medicine has been increasing worldwide. Among&#xD;
      these therapies are energy therapies such as Reiki , Johrei, and Spiritist &quot;passe.&quot;&#xD;
      Experimental studies have confirmed the action of the energy therapies in animal models or in&#xD;
      cell cultures. These therapies appear to have positive effects, particularly in the reduction&#xD;
      of anxiety and pain. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the &quot;passe&quot; energy therapy&#xD;
      in reducing anxiety in subjects presenting anxiety symptoms after 8 weeks of study. Methods:&#xD;
      The recruited volunteers will be randomized into two groups: the Control Group (application&#xD;
      of 8 &quot;passe&quot; simulation sessions by people without spiritualist training at the same time and&#xD;
      in the same environment as the treatment group) and the Treatment Group (application of 8&#xD;
      sessions of &quot;passe&quot; by spiritists with over 2 years of experience in controlled environments&#xD;
      for the same period as the control group). The sample will consist of 60 patients selected by&#xD;
      interviews with the expectation of a 20% reduction of anxiety in the control group and 60% in&#xD;
      the treatment group with alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.8. Results: Using the STAI scale for&#xD;
      evaluation, the reduction in anxiety is expected to be significantly higher in the treatment&#xD;
      group than in the control group. The investigators expect approximately 20-30% reduction of&#xD;
      the anxiety in the control group by the placebo effect. Other objectives to be assessed are&#xD;
      quality of life, spirituality, and depression by specific standardized scales (WHOQOL-BREF,&#xD;
      DUREL, and BECK).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The use of complementary medicine has increased significantly worldwide and up to 40% of&#xD;
      American patients use some form of complementary therapy[1,2 ]. Among these are the energy&#xD;
      therapies such as Reiki[3], Johrei, and Spiritist &quot;passe&quot;[4]. These therapies are based on&#xD;
      the modification of the energy fields that surround and penetrate the human body, and are&#xD;
      supposedly involved in the health and disease process. Application of these therapies&#xD;
      involves touch or laying hands on these energy fields, the existence of which has not yet&#xD;
      been proven. Experimental studies have shown the action of energy therapies in animal models&#xD;
      or in cell cultures[5,6,4]. Johrei proved to be effective in improving sleep in mice&#xD;
      subjected to sleep interruption[5] and in reducing tumor cell growth in vitro[6]. An&#xD;
      experimental study was recently published showing the effect of Spiritist &quot;passe&quot; on the&#xD;
      growth of bacterial colonies of Escherichia coli. When &quot;passe&quot; was applied with the intention&#xD;
      of reducing the growth of colonies there was a statistically significant reduction compared&#xD;
      to the control group, subjected to laying of the hands without application of &quot;passe&quot; [4].&#xD;
      This study is recognized as the first experimental evidence of &quot;passe&quot; which is widespread in&#xD;
      spiritism. Spiritism is a very common religion and philosophy in Brazil and the use of&#xD;
      Spiritist &quot;passe&quot; is a form of treatment under this religion that is highly established in&#xD;
      the treatment of psychiatric disorders[7,8]. Therapies used in spiritualism include Spiritist&#xD;
      &quot;passe,&quot; spiritist education, disobsession, and fluidic water. Studies investigating the&#xD;
      scientific basis of these therapies are beginning to feature in the literature[8,9,10]. For&#xD;
      energy therapies with clinical purposes, a few meta-analysis studies have evaluated distance&#xD;
      healing and some touch therapies without reaching conclusive results, indicating a high&#xD;
      heterogeneity between studies and presenting the need for more primary studies in the&#xD;
      field[11,12]. Among the energy therapies, Reiki is the most widely studied; however, in&#xD;
      recent meta-analysis, due to the large variability of the studies, different endpoints&#xD;
      (anxiety, pain, depression) and methodological flaws, its efficacy has not yet been&#xD;
      confirmed[13]. However, a more recent systematic review shows the efficacy of Reiki in&#xD;
      reducing anxiety and pain[14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, despite the heterogeneity of the studies, energy therapies appear to have positive&#xD;
      effects, particularly on the reduction of anxiety and pain. Spiritist &quot;passe&quot; is an important&#xD;
      therapy in Brazil that is similar to other energy therapies such as Reiki and Johrei, and its&#xD;
      efficacy has been experimentally confirmed[4]. Therefore, studies on clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      this important form of complementary therapy are necessary. Unlike Reiki[14] and Johrei[15],&#xD;
      there are no clinical studies on Spiritist &quot;passe&quot; despite its similar basis as an energy&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. STUDY HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that the Spiritist &quot;passe&quot; energy therapy will result in the&#xD;
      reduction of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and improved quality of life in subjects with&#xD;
      anxiety. The primary objective is to evaluate the Spiritist &quot;passe&quot; therapy in reducing&#xD;
      anxiety in subjects with symptoms of anxiety after 8 weeks of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the Spiritist &quot;passe&quot; therapy in&#xD;
           reducing anxiety after 8 weeks of study in subjects with symptoms of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the impact of &quot;passe&quot; in reducing depressive symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the impact of &quot;passe&quot; on improving of quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the impact of &quot;passe&quot; on brain wave patterns detected with the&#xD;
                electroencephalogram (EEG) III. PATIENTS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty patients with anxiety, who have not been treated by psychologists or doctors previously&#xD;
      and do not use specific medication, will be evaluated. Patients will be recruited through the&#xD;
      Botucatu Faculty of Medicine Press Service that will advertise phone numbers in newspapers&#xD;
      and magazines and on the radio. Patients will be selected by the researchers according to the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Outline: This is a randomized controlled prospective single-center study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of Spiritist &quot;passe&quot; in reducing anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted at a single location in the Clinical Hospital of the Botucatu&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine - UNESP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients who agree to participate and sign the informed consent form will be&#xD;
      included in the study. The following four standardized questionnaires will then be&#xD;
      administered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DUREL questionnaire for assessment of spirituality&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Beck Depression Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. WHOQOL-BREF quality of life questionnaire The questionnaires will be administered by an&#xD;
           examiner who will read out the questions and write down the answers. The anxiety&#xD;
           questionnaire (STAI) will always be administered first followed by the other&#xD;
           questionnaires in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the questionnaires have been administered, patients will be randomly categorized into&#xD;
      two groups, control and treatment (application of Spiritist &quot;passe&quot;), weekly according to the&#xD;
      description of the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Period: The study will begin after approval by the Research Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      Botucatu Faculty of Medicine. Thereafter, patients selected through interviews will be&#xD;
      considered eligible if they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria (described below in&#xD;
      section 1.5). Eligible patients will be followed over an 8-week period with weekly&#xD;
      applications of the treatment (Spiritist &quot;passe&quot;) or the placebo (simulation of Spiritist&#xD;
      &quot;passe&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standardized questionnaires will be administered three times (start, 4 weeks, and 8&#xD;
      weeks). Three assessments by electroencephalogram (start, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks) will also be&#xD;
      made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4. Sample: The sample will consist of 60 patients selected by interview following the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on the doctoral work of Ricardo Monezzi, the&#xD;
      application of Reiki in elderly volunteers with stress resulted in a 20% reduction of anxiety&#xD;
      level in the placebo group and 60% in the treatment group. Considering the reduction of&#xD;
      anxiety in the control and treatment groups with an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.8,&#xD;
      respectively, a sample of 46 patients is planned. Assuming a 25% loss in follow-up, a sample&#xD;
      of 60 patients is finalized.&#xD;
