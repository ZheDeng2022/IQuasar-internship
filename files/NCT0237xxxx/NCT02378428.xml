    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study for patients with MIBG avid tumors. The study is to determine the&#xD;
      response rate to &lt;131&gt;I-MIBG in patients with de novo, relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma&#xD;
      or other MIBG avid malignant tumors 42 days post MIBG therapy. It will also be evaluating the&#xD;
      tolerability and safety of the study agent by evaluating the hematopoietic and&#xD;
      non-hematopoietic toxicity of &lt;131&gt;I-MIBG therapy. Tumor response will be evaluated by&#xD;
      comparing the patient's disease pre-treatment against the patient's day +42 post &lt;131&gt;I-MIBG&#xD;
      treatment. The evaluations may include the following: &lt;131&gt;I-MIBG scan, CT or MRI, urine&#xD;
      catecholamine, bone marrow analyses and any other tests considered standard of care for&#xD;
      cancer evaluation. To be eligible for participation, patients must have tumors that are MIBG&#xD;
      avid. Patients must also have a stem cell source for autologous rescue in the event of&#xD;
      protracted therapy associated cytopenias. Peripheral stem cell collections are preferred as&#xD;
      the hematopoietic cell source. Bone marrow harvests for a hematopoietic cell source is an&#xD;
      alternative. This study will provide data for future clinical trials utilizing &lt;131&gt;I-MIBG&#xD;
      therapies. A room on H12 has been prepared with lead lined walls, and many radiation safety&#xD;
      components to accomodate this treatment. &lt;131&gt;I metaiodobenzlguanidine (&lt;131&gt;I-MIBG) is a&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical that concentrates within adrenomedullary tissue. The agent was initially&#xD;
      used for tumor imaging due to its capability to locate pheochromocytomas, neuroblastomas and&#xD;
      other neuroendocrine tumors. &lt;131&gt;I-MIBG was subsequently used as an therapeutic agent for&#xD;
      these tumor types. Phase I and II therapeutic trials targeting neuroblastoma have reported&#xD;
      response rates of 10-50%. Toxicities observed have been mainly hematopoietic, with ~50% of&#xD;
      patients receiving 15mCi/kg requiring stem cell reinfusion. Observed non-hematopoietic&#xD;
      toxicities have been mild. Most recently, trials have been conducted combining the study&#xD;
      agent with myeloablative chemotherapy and stem cell reinfusion have been performed with&#xD;
      initial response rates of ~50%.&#xD;
