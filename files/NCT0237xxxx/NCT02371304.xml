  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current therapy for early colorectal cancer is radical Total Mesorectal Excision (TME).&#xD;
      Colorectal surgical resections are accompanied with high morbidity of up to 33% and 90 days&#xD;
      mortality of up to 9% in the fragile elderly patients as is seen in the results of the Dutch&#xD;
      Surgical Colorectal Audit (DSCA) of 2013. Additionally, rectal cancer surgery is associated&#xD;
      with substantial loss of health related quality of life due to defecation disorders,&#xD;
      incontinence, sexual dysfunction and stoma related morbidity. These disadvantages are&#xD;
      acceptable when radical surgery is the only option for cure. Advances in technology enabled&#xD;
      the development of local excision of early rectal cancer with precise endoluminal&#xD;
      microsurgery or local endoscopic excision resulting in a significant decrease in short- and&#xD;
      long term morbidity. However current evidence is of inadequate quality to conclude on the&#xD;
      oncologic safety of local treatment for early rectal cancer. Imaging can predict outcome and&#xD;
      tailors treatment in more advanced cancer but fails in early cancer. Pathological assessment&#xD;
      of the excised tumor tissue provides the optimal information on tumor stage, tumor&#xD;
      characteristics and tumor differentiation, thereby it enables to predict the risk of&#xD;
      recurrence after local treatment alone. For early rectal cancers, with a low risk on&#xD;
      recurrence based on favourable tumor characteristics local excision is seen as safe and these&#xD;
      patients do not require an additional treatment. However, for patients with early rectal&#xD;
      cancer with a higher risk on recurrence based on tumor characteristics there is no consensus&#xD;
      on the additional treatment after local excision. According to the National guideline these&#xD;
      patients receive a TME procedure. However, for this subgroup of patients local treatment&#xD;
      followed by chemoradiotherapy might also be oncological safe. Current evidence is of&#xD;
      inadequate quality to be conclusive. For this subgroup of patients with early rectal cancer&#xD;
      with high risk tumorcharacteristics the TESAR trial is designed, in which patiens will be&#xD;
      randomised after local endoluminal excision between an additional TME-procedure (standard)&#xD;
      and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Primary endpoint of the study will be local recurrence at 3&#xD;
      three year follow-up.&#xD;
