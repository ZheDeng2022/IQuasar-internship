  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a glioblastoma (GBM) have a poor prognosis with a median survival of 14.6&#xD;
      months after maximal treatment with a resection and chemoradiation. Since the pivotal trial&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of temozolomide (TMZ), overall survival has not increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of GBM xenografts in vivo with chloroquine (CQ), an antimalarial agent, has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce the hypoxic fraction and sensitizes tumors to radiation. Epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (EGFR) amplification or mutation is regularly observed GBM and is thought to&#xD;
      be a major contributor to radioresistance. The most common EGFR mutation in GBM (EGFRvIII) is&#xD;
      present in 50-60% of patients whose tumor shows amplification of EGFR. EGFR provides cells&#xD;
      with a survival advantage through autophagy when exposed to stresses such as hypoxia and&#xD;
      nutrient starvation. This effect is even more pronounced in EGFRvIII overexpressing tumors.&#xD;
      Previously, the potential effect CQ has been demonstrated in a small randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial in GBM treated with radiotherapy and carmustine, which showed a trend towards increased&#xD;
      overall survival. However, as the intracellular effects of chloroquine are dose-dependent the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose for CQ in combination with concurrent radiotherapy with daily&#xD;
      temozolomide needs to be established.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial has been designed as an open label, single center combination phase I trial. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for chloroquine (CQ) in&#xD;
      combination with concurrent radiotherapy with daily temozolomide in patients with a newly&#xD;
      diagnosed GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy according to standard protocol&#xD;
      for newly diagnosed GBM. This consists of 33 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy to the tumor and&#xD;
      surrounding margin in combination with TMZ 75 mg/m² per os daily (po qd) and six adjuvant&#xD;
      cycles of TMZ 150 - 200 mg/m² po qd. Treatment will be combined with daily intake of&#xD;
      escalating doses of chloroquine. Chloroquine will start with week before the start of&#xD;
      radiotherapy and end on the last day of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of subject entry and escalation to the next dose level will depend upon assessment&#xD;
      of the safety profile of patients entered at the previous dose level. Toxicity will be&#xD;
      evaluated according to the NCI common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE),&#xD;
      Version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 + 3 cohort method is used. A minimum of three patients will be entered at each dose&#xD;
      level. All three will be followed during the concomitant radiotherapy and a 4 week&#xD;
      observation period before escalation to the next dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The start dose is 200mg chloroquine daily. Before opening the next higher dose level all&#xD;
      toxic effects at the preceding dose level will be reviewed and expansion or escalation will&#xD;
      be undertaken as appropriate&#xD;
