      The primary purpose of this experimental study was to determine the acute effect following&#xD;
      one treatment and the short-term effect after a two-week program of Egoscue corrective&#xD;
      exercises on chronic knee and hip pain.&#xD;

      Participants for this study were recruited from the university community via email&#xD;
      announcements and flyers. Participants were adults with chronic knee and/or hip pain. Chronic&#xD;
      pain was defined as pain on most days of the week for at least 12 weeks. Individuals were&#xD;
      excluded from the study if they (a) had undergone a knee or hip surgery or had sustained a&#xD;
      knee or hip injury in the past 12 months, (b) were currently receiving any form of pain&#xD;
      treatment such as physiotherapy, chiropractic, intraarticular injections, or prescription&#xD;
      pain medications, (c) exhibited a severe lack of mobility, (d) reported an initial pain level&#xD;
      &lt; 3 cm on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scale, (e) were pregnant, or (f) were unable to&#xD;
      understand English. Individuals were not excluded from participation if they were taking&#xD;
      non-prescription drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, although they were&#xD;
      required to refrain from taking any pain medication during the 12 hours preceding the first,&#xD;
      and subsequent assessments. A power analysis using a power level of 80% and alpha set at 0.05&#xD;
      indicated a sample size of 40 participants (20 in the control group and 20 in the exercise&#xD;
      group). A large effect size (0.80) was assumed because this has been reported in the&#xD;
      literature26 for differences in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index&#xD;
      (WOMAC) scores following an at-home exercise program. Forty-two eligible participants were&#xD;
      originally recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants completed a pre-participation questionnaire that included questions about&#xD;
      age, gender, injuries, pain medication use, and previous or planned total hip and/or knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty. Participants completed two versions of the VAS for knee and/or hip pain: one&#xD;
      for pain at rest and one for pain during movement. If participants had pain in multiple&#xD;
      joints, they were told to record their overall level of pain. Participants were told to&#xD;
      indicate their &quot;usual pain&quot; over the past seven days. Participants needed to have a VAS pain&#xD;
      score of at least 3 cm (either at rest or during movement) in order to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Participants also completed the WOMAC at the time of the visit. Participants' body&#xD;
      mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and height to the nearest 0.5 cm using a digital&#xD;
      scale and a stadiometer, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Egoscue Method protocol was followed and a postural alignment specialist trained in postural&#xD;
      evaluation conducted an assessment. To reduce possible inter-rater error, the same researcher&#xD;
      conducted all postural evaluations. An individualized exercise program (E-cise menu) was&#xD;
      generated using the ePeteTM software (version 4.4.3) based on the noted postural deviations.&#xD;
      To ensure that all participants were prescribed the same volume of exercise, the E-cise menus&#xD;
      were adjusted by adding or removing exercises so the time required to complete the exercises&#xD;
      was approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the exercise group were led through their complete E-cise menu by the&#xD;
      researcher to ensure competency on the exercises. Participants in the control group did not&#xD;
      perform any exercises for 45 minutes. Following the first exercise session or 45 minutes of&#xD;
      rest, participants completed the VAS again for their current knee and/or hip pain at rest and&#xD;
      with movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were given logs (one for each day of the week), which they were to fill out&#xD;
      every evening before retiring to bed. These logs contained questions about their compliance&#xD;
      to the E-cise menu (for those in the exercise group), pain medication use, and a VAS for pain&#xD;
      at rest and during movement. Participants in the control group were instructed to maintain&#xD;
      their current lifestyle for the two week duration of the study and a return visit was&#xD;
      scheduled one week later. Participants in the exercise group were scheduled for a return&#xD;
      visit the following day so that E-cises could be observed for competency and any adjustments&#xD;
      could be made to the E-cise menu if participants were experiencing pain during an E-cise.&#xD;
      Participants in the exercise group were instructed to complete their E-cise menu at home on&#xD;
      at least five days of the week, but preferably every day, for the next two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were assessed and evaluated on all variables previously mentioned at the end&#xD;
      of week number 1 and again at the end of the study after week number 2. Participants in the&#xD;
      control group were given a personalized E-cise menu, along with instructions, at this time.&#xD;
