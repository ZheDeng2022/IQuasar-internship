  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1: RA patients will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in five repeated examinations occurring in one day to compare between and within&#xD;
      specialties, ensuring reasonable equivalency of examination findings. Phase 2: RA patients&#xD;
      living &gt; 100 km from Saskatoon will be randomized to the intervention or control group, with&#xD;
      both groups having three follow-up appointments in 3-month intervals. The intervention group&#xD;
      will be evaluated by a physiotherapist supported by a rheumatologist through&#xD;
      videoconferencing, while the control group will continue to travel to Saskatoon for follow-up&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

      Part A: Validation Study This study involves inter-professional care with rural-based&#xD;
      physical therapists and urban-based rheumatologists, it will be a valuable first step to&#xD;
      validate comparability of the physical examination. We shall compare physical examination&#xD;
      accuracy between and within examiner disciplines. Examiners will include the three&#xD;
      rheumatologist study investigators and three participating physical therapists with&#xD;
      additional training in inflammatory rheumatic diseases and experienced in musculoskeletal&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: All examiners will undergo a standardized review of examination techniques and&#xD;
      documentation prior to participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison groups will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rheumatologist A. to Rheumatologist B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physiotherapist A. to Physiotherapist B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rheumatologist A/B to Physiotherapist C/teleconferenced Rheumatologist C. We will use&#xD;
           web-based videoconferencing software. This desktop-based solution is currently being&#xD;
           piloted by Telehealth Saskatchewan and is used extensively in Ontario. This technology&#xD;
           satisfies Health Information Protection Act (HIPA) as well as the Saskatchewan privacy&#xD;
           and security concerns. An examining room with telehealth/videoconference equipment will&#xD;
           be available for patient distance examination for comparison group C as listed above.&#xD;
           The rheumatologist will be in a physically separate room with viewing equipment in a&#xD;
           mock distance evaluation. The proposed study will be conducted in cooperation with the&#xD;
           Canadian Centre for Health and Safety in Agriculture (CCHSA) within the â‰ˆ1350 m2&#xD;
           National Agricultural-Industrial Hygiene Laboratory. Clinical visits will be conducted&#xD;
           at the CCHSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Randomized Controlled Rheumatoid Arthritis Care Delivery Model Trial Randomization:&#xD;
      Participating patients will be randomly allocated to two arms, either to be followed by&#xD;
      telehealth/videoconferencing in or near their home community or to continue traveling to&#xD;
      their Saskatoon rheumatology clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: One study arm will be followed in traditional rheumatology clinic (in-person&#xD;
      examining rheumatologist). The second study arm will be followed by&#xD;
      telehealth/videoconferencing. Patients in the telehealth/videoconferencing arm will be&#xD;
      examined by a rural-based physical therapist who will report exam findings during telehealth&#xD;
      review with the urban-based rheumatologist. Follow-up visits will be every three months in&#xD;
      both arms. All patients will complete standardized history/data-collection forms. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed in their respective study arms for nine months, and then will be evaluated&#xD;
      in-person in rheumatology clinic for final face-to-face disease activity evaluation.&#xD;
