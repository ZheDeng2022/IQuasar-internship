    <textblock>
      This study will be a two-part with an open-label, single oral dose, two-way crossover study&#xD;
      design. Part A and Part B of the study are independent and may be conducted in parallel. The&#xD;
      Part A of the study will assess the effect of an oral dose of GSK1278863 on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of a CYP2C8 (pioglitazone) and OATP1B1 (rosuvastatin) probe substrate in&#xD;
      order to determine the potential for clinically-significant drug interactions with CYP2C8 and&#xD;
      OATP1B1 substrates. The Part B of the study will assess the effect of a weak CYP2C8 inhibitor&#xD;
      (trimethoprim) on the pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863 and its six predominant metabolites.&#xD;
      Part A will be conducted in approximately 30 healthy subjects, having a randomized study&#xD;
      design. There will be approximate 7-day washout period between each dosing period. Part B&#xD;
      will be conducted in approximately 20 healthy subjects, having single sequence study design.&#xD;
      Follow up will be conducted within 7 to 10 days after the last dose in both Part A and B. The&#xD;
      total duration of a subject's involvement in the part A of the study will be approximately 8&#xD;
      weeks (Screening to Follow-up) and in part B will be approximately 7 weeks (Screening to&#xD;
      Follow-up).&#xD;
