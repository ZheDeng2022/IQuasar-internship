      Reliable methods of evaluating liver fibrosis using noninvasive techniques in the pediatric&#xD;
      population are limited and inconclusive. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard; however, it&#xD;
      requires sedation in pediatric patients, has a risk of hemorrhage, and provides unreliable&#xD;
      results secondary to sampling error. Sonoelastography is a new method of evaluating liver&#xD;
      disease that eliminates these pitfalls. There are 3 types of quantitative sonoelastography&#xD;
      currently in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transient elastography is a non-imaging based technique used in adults to measure liver&#xD;
      fibrosis in which a mechanical vibrator creates a low-frequency wave causing shear stress in&#xD;
      the liver at a fixed depth. This technique does not work in small livers and, therefore, is&#xD;
      not appropriate for pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging (ARFI) and Shear Wave Imaging (SWE) use real-time&#xD;
      ultrasonography and administer focused high-intensity, short-duration pulses to produce shear&#xD;
      waves in the liver tissue. ARFI calculates the degree of tissue displacement and creates an&#xD;
      elastogram or measurement of the stiffness of the sampled liver tissue without corresponding&#xD;
      images. It is limited since only a small sample or region of interest (ROI) can be obtained,&#xD;
      and it is unable to provide a corresponding elasticity map of the tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SWE is the newest elastography technique. It measures tiny displacements of tissue in a&#xD;
      larger ROI with corresponding ultrasound images which provides a side by side image of the&#xD;
      liver and color-coded elasticity map of the sampled tissue. Advantages include a larger ROI&#xD;
      and simultaneous viewing of the selected region of interest which provides better anatomic&#xD;
      detail with a corresponding color map of the tissue elasticity which may result in more&#xD;
      accurate scoring of the stage of fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a few studies of ARFI in the pediatric population. Studies using SWE for evaluation&#xD;
      of liver fibrosis are also few, and, all but one in adults. However, these studies have shown&#xD;
      it to be an accurate method for liver fibrosis staging. Use of SWE in assessing liver&#xD;
      fibrosis in pediatric patients may represent an accurate noninvasive alternative to liver&#xD;
      biopsy in evaluating liver fibrosis as well as avoid the use of sedation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of pediatric liver disease continues to be a major focus of research both in&#xD;
      well-characterized liver diseases and in liver fibrosis secondary to obesity. The degree of&#xD;
      fibrosis is generally well-accepted as both a measurement of disease severity and a&#xD;
      prognostic indicator. Unfortunately, the current gold standard to assess fibrosis remains a&#xD;
      liver biopsy, which, in addition to anesthesia risks and sampling errors, can result in&#xD;
      profound hemorrhage, infections, and even mortality. Standard and reliable noninvasive&#xD;
      biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis in the pediatric population are greatly needed.&#xD;
      Sonoelastography has emerged as a method of evaluating liver disease. Three methods of&#xD;
      quantitative sonoelastography are currently in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transient elastography is an M-mode based sonographic technique in which a mechanical&#xD;
      vibrator creates a low-frequency wave causing shear stress in the tissue at a fixed depth in&#xD;
      the target tissue. It has gained widespread use in evaluation of liver fibrosis in the adult&#xD;
      population (Fibroscan); however, its use has great limitations in the pediatric population as&#xD;
      it does not use real-time ultrasonography (B mode) and has a fixed depth in which the&#xD;
      measurement is taken. The lack of real-time imaging makes it impossible to accurately select&#xD;
      an area for appropriate sampling, and the fixed depth is not appropriate for very young&#xD;
      children with smaller livers. Also, the shock wave that is administered has not been tailored&#xD;
      for use in young children. Furthermore, this technique is very unreliable in patients that&#xD;
      are obese or who have ascites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other methods of sonoelastography include Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging (ARFI) and&#xD;
      Shear Wave Elastography (SWE). The latter is also known as supersonic shear wave imaging.&#xD;
      Both of these techniques use real-time ultrasonography and administer focused high-intensity,&#xD;
      short-duration (acoustic radiation) pulses to produce shear waves in the target tissue.&#xD;
      Neither technique is limited by the presence of ascites as the shear waves propagate through&#xD;
      the fluid. ARFI uses a single pushing beam to generate the shear waves, and the propagation&#xD;
      of those shear waves are monitored using conventional pulse-echo ultrasound at various&#xD;
      off-axis lateral locations. The speed of the shear wave in the tissue is determined by&#xD;
      collecting the displacement through time. This principle of elastography is based on the&#xD;
      Young modulus using the formula: E=3ρѴ2 (E elasticity's modulus, Ѵ speed, ρ density of the&#xD;
      tissue). The degree of tissue displacement is then used to create an elastogram. Limitations&#xD;
      of ARFI include a small selected region of interest (ROI) (10 mm x 5 mm), it is a&#xD;
      1-dimensional technique, and it is unable to provide a corresponding elasticity map of the&#xD;
      tissue. The latter also prevents retrospective evaluations of the tissue elasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SWE is the newest elastography technique. It works by generating a localized radiation force&#xD;
      that travels faster down the acoustic axis than the shear wave speed producing tiny, almost&#xD;
      simultaneous, displacements in the tissues at all positions along the acoustic axis. The&#xD;
      generated shear wave is shaped like a cone or fan, known as the Mach cone. An ultrafast&#xD;
      sonography is then performed which provides a side-by-side greyscale image and color-coded&#xD;
      elasticity map of the tissue in the ROI. The ROI is displayed in real time B-mode imaging&#xD;
      and, thus, represents a 2-dimensional technique. Advantages include a larger, fan-shaped ROI&#xD;
      (up to 50mm x 50mm), and the acquisition of a quantitative map of liver tissue stiffness with&#xD;
      corresponding greyscale ultrasound image. As a result, simultaneous viewing of the selected&#xD;
      region of interest provides better anatomic detail with a corresponding color map of the&#xD;
      tissue elasticity which may result in more accurate scoring of the stage of fibrosis. The&#xD;
      presence of a color map also allows for retrospective analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a few studies have begun to use ARFI to analyze liver fibrosis in the pediatric&#xD;
      population. Studies using SWE for evaluation of liver fibrosis are also limited and all but&#xD;
      one have been performed in adults; however, early studies have shown it to be an accurate&#xD;
      method for liver fibrosis staging. Tutar, et al safely performed a study using SWE in&#xD;
      pediatric patients in Turkey. No dedicated pediatric studies have been performed in the&#xD;
      United States, as the technology was just recently approved for use in adults by the FDA. The&#xD;
      use of this device in pediatrics represents an off-label use. That being said, SWE has safety&#xD;
      considerations that are similar to Doppler mode which is a standard ultrasound technology&#xD;
      performed in pediatric patients of all ages. While it has a higher thermal index than routine&#xD;
      B-mode ultrasound, it is measured to be within the safety limits set by the American&#xD;
      Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM).&#xD;
