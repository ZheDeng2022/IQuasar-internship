  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the SAVI SCOUT® Surgical Guidance&#xD;
      System (SAVI SCOUT). The SAVI SCOUT is a medical device, used to provide real-time guidance&#xD;
      during localized excisional biopsy or lumpectomy procedures, by helping the surgeon locate&#xD;
      and remove the desired tissue (i.e., the lesion and surrounding normal tissue). The SAVI&#xD;
      SCOUT has been 510K cleared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAVI SCOUT is intended to assist surgeons in the location and retrieval of a non-palpable&#xD;
      abnormality as localized by radiographic or ultrasound methods. In this study, the ability of&#xD;
      the SAVI SCOUT to guide surgeons to find a lesion will be evaluated instead of the standard&#xD;
      technique of wire localization.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using radiography or ultrasound guidance, the SAVI SCOUT reflector will be placed&#xD;
      percutaneously up to 7 days prior to the scheduled excisional procedure. During surgical&#xD;
      excision, the SAVI SCOUT system will be used to locate the reflector, which will be removed&#xD;
      along with the surrounding breast tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final data analysis will be completed within 1 month after the last patient is treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final assessment of the surgical results will be completed by the surgeon during a routine&#xD;
      follow-up visit within 1 month following the surgical excision or lumpectomy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective: to show that the SAVI SCOUT technique can be used to safely and effectively&#xD;
      locate a non-palpable breast lesion during a localized excisional biopsy or lumpectomy&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 10 sites and 150 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
