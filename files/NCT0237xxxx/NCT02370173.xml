  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is nearly ubiquitous among individuals suffering from PTSD and is a major&#xD;
      problem among service members returning from combat deployments. The proposed study aims to&#xD;
      test a novel, inexpensive, and easy to use approach to improving sleep among service members&#xD;
      with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures will include not only PTSD symptom improvement but also include&#xD;
      neuroimaging of brain structure, function, connectivity, and neurochemistry changes. The&#xD;
      proposal is firmly grounded in the emerging scientific literature regarding sleep, light&#xD;
      exposure, brain function, anxiety, and resilience. Prior evidence suggests that bright light&#xD;
      therapy is effective for improving mood and fatigue, and our pilot data further suggest that&#xD;
      this treatment may be effective for improving daytime sleepiness and brain functioning in&#xD;
      brain injured individuals. Thus, this intervention, in our own research and in the work of&#xD;
      others, has been shown to affect critical sleep regulatory systems. Improving sleep may be a&#xD;
      vital component of recovery in these service members. Our approach would directly address&#xD;
      this issue. Our preliminary data have shown that this approach is extremely well tolerated&#xD;
      and is effective for improving sleep, mood, cognitive performance, and brain function among&#xD;
      individuals with brain injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the potential impact of this study is high because of the capability of&#xD;
      transitioning the research to direct clinical application almost immediately. If the bright&#xD;
      light treatment is demonstrated as effective, this approach would be readily available for&#xD;
      nearly immediate large-scale implementation, as the devices have been widely used for years&#xD;
      in other contexts, are already safety tested, and commercially available from several&#xD;
      manufacturers for a very low cost. Thus, the impact of this research on treating PTSD would&#xD;
      be high and immediate.&#xD;
