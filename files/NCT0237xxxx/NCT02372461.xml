    <textblock>
      The relative benefits and risks of antibiotic therapy in WHO defined fast breathing pneumonia&#xD;
      in pre-school children in resource limited settings are controversial both at an individual&#xD;
      and public health level. Most infections are viral or self-limiting and non-selective drug&#xD;
      treatment has contributed to the global epidemic of antibiotic resistance. There is no high&#xD;
      quality trial evidence in managing children with fast breathing in community settings and the&#xD;
      WHO itself has called for evidence on which to update guidance. The investigators proposed&#xD;
      non inferiority trial comparing standard antibiotic treatment with placebo in poor urban slum&#xD;
      settings in South Asia to address this deficit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is a major cause of illness and death in children in low-income countries. With a&#xD;
      view to decreasing death from pneumonia, the World Health Organization and UNICEF developed&#xD;
      the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) algorithm which simplifies management&#xD;
      of common childhood illnesses such as pneumonia and diarrhea into different levels of&#xD;
      severity for determining the most appropriate case management by primary healthcare&#xD;
      providers. Many pneumonia cases are categorized as non-severe pneumonia (defined as fast&#xD;
      breathing above the specified age cut-off for respiratory rates). As there is incomplete&#xD;
      information regarding the cause of this type of &quot;pneumonia&quot; from primary care settings,&#xD;
      treatment guidelines by WHO are dictated by culture information from hospital pneumonia cases&#xD;
      which are different in severity and cause. Current WHO guidelines advocate the use of oral&#xD;
      antibiotics for fast breathing pneumonia. However, it is postulated that most fast breathing&#xD;
      pneumonia not requiring hospitalization is of viral etiology, thus does not require&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment. The cost of antibiotic treatment for all children with pneumonia is&#xD;
      high; an estimated US$ 200 million in South Asia &amp; sub Saharan Africa alone. Since more than&#xD;
      60% of pneumonia is classified as non-severe (fast breathing), this puts a strain on already&#xD;
      under-sourced programmes in low-income countries. Giving antibiotics where they confer no&#xD;
      benefit also puts the child at risk of side effects and increases the risk of antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance in the community. This uncertainty forms the basis of the proposed study.&#xD;
      Investigators propose to show in a clinical trial that the outcome of children diagnosed with&#xD;
      WHO defined fast breathing pneumonia is similar regardless of whether they receive&#xD;
      antibiotics or not. This study will be conducted in five primary health care centers located&#xD;
      in low income communities of Karachi, Pakistan, with extensive trial experience. Children&#xD;
      identified to have fast breathing without any danger signs will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either three days of the WHO recommended oral antibiotic (amoxicillin 250mg/5ml using WHO&#xD;
      weight bands) or matching placebo (a drug that will taste and look like the amoxicillin but&#xD;
      will not have an active ingredient) by a study physician working at the primary health&#xD;
      center. The assignment of the antibiotic amoxicillin or placebo to a child will be done using&#xD;
      a computer generated randomization list in a manner that at the end of the trial, there are&#xD;
      equal numbers of children in both arms of the trial. Based on the statistical calculations&#xD;
      for sample size, investigators need to assign 1214 children to receive amoxicillin and the&#xD;
      same number of children to receive placebo. All children will receive the antibiotic or&#xD;
      placebo under supervision of the primary health care physician in the morning. Evening doses&#xD;
      will be delivered by locally hired Community Health Workers (CHWs) visiting the children at&#xD;
      their home. All children will be assessed again on day 3 by a study physician to see if the&#xD;
      child's presenting sign of high respiratory rate has resolved or not. All children with&#xD;
      persistently high respiratory rate and/or development of a new clinical sign indicating&#xD;
      illness progression will be labeled a treatment failure. There will invariably be some&#xD;
      children with treatment failure in both the treatment arms; investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      there will be equal number of treatment failures in both the groups i.e. around 5%.&#xD;
