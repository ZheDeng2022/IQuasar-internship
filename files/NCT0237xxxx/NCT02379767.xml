  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating the effect of electroconvulsive therapy in treatment-resistant&#xD;
      depressed patients on the major serotonin degrading enzyme in the human brain using&#xD;
      neuroimaging methods, the monoamine oxidase A. Electroconvulsive therapy is an effective&#xD;
      treatment option in severe cases of depression. However, the mechanisms underlying its effect&#xD;
      remain uncertain, though variations within the serotonergic neurotransmitter system seem to&#xD;
      be crucially involved.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In treatment-resistant depression, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been shown to&#xD;
      effectively reduce depressive symptoms; however, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms&#xD;
      remain to be fully understood. Recent neuroimaging findings underline the involvement of the&#xD;
      serotonergic system in the mechanism of action of ECT, but studies in this context mainly&#xD;
      focused on serotonin receptor and the serotonin transporter. Here, the aim of the study is to&#xD;
      assess the effects ECT on monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), the main serotonin degrading enzyme&#xD;
      which is known to be involved in antidepressant action, in humans using positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) and the radiotracer [11C]harmine. Moreover, as the antidepressant effects of&#xD;
      electroconvulsive stimulations were shown to be partly mediated via changes in&#xD;
      neuroplasticity, a secondary aim of the present study is to assess structural alterations&#xD;
      caused by ECT using magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the literature, the investigators expect higher baseline MAO-A distribution volumes&#xD;
      (DVs) in depressed patients than compared to healthy subjects.Moreover, the investigators&#xD;
      expect overall MAO-A distribution volume (DVs) changes in the brain of depressed patients&#xD;
      following ECT according to the individual treatment-response. Similarly, the investigators&#xD;
      assume that depressed patients will exhibit structural changes of grey matter volume&#xD;
      following ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation is designed as a longitudinal mono-centre study over a duration of 36&#xD;
      months. 18 subjects with therapy-resistant, severe unipolar depression, aged between 18-60&#xD;
      years and 18 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects will be included in the study. Patients&#xD;
      will be recruited at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of&#xD;
      Vienna, and will be offered inpatient care. Psychotropic medication (except for drugs&#xD;
      directly binding MAO-A, e.g. moclobemid) of the patients is allowed if steady state has been&#xD;
      reached &gt; 10 days prior to inclusion. Healthy subject will be recruited using announcements&#xD;
      of poster boards at the General Hospital of Vienna. Each patient will be measured three times&#xD;
      using a GE Advance PET scanner and the radioligand [11C]harmine. The first and second&#xD;
      measurements determine baseline changes in the MAO-A DVs while the third scan is used to&#xD;
      quantify changes induced by ECT. Healthy subjects will be measured with PET only once.&#xD;
      Similarly, patients will undergo three structural (T1-weighted) MRI sessions temporally&#xD;
      coordinated to the PET scans. Healthy subjects will be measured with MRI only once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be treated in 6 to 14 ECT sessions within a time interval of 2 to 5 weeks.&#xD;
      A brief pulse ECT machine (Thymatron System IVTM) will be used three times per week to&#xD;
      administer treatments either unilaterally over the right hemisphere or, if required,&#xD;
      bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MAO-A DVs will be determined using a region of interest and a whole brain voxel-wise&#xD;
      approach. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will compare the change in the&#xD;
      MAO-A DVs before and after ECT (PET2-PET3) with the change between the baseline PET scans&#xD;
      (PET1-PET2). Secondly, MAO-A DVs from PET1 will be compared to the scans of healthy subjects&#xD;
      (cross-sectional part). Additionally, the correlation between treatment effects reflected in&#xD;
      HAM-D score and changes in MAO-A DVs will be computed. Similar statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      done with sMRI data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would be the first to demonstrate an effect of ECT on MAO-A DVs in humans in vivo.&#xD;
      Given the involvement of the MAO-A in the pathophysiology of mood disorders, the present&#xD;
      study would be an important step towards a better understanding of antidepressant treatment&#xD;
      and treatment response. By comparing treatment effects and the underlying biological&#xD;
      mechanism, the study might help to identify biomarkers that distinguish patients who are&#xD;
      likely to benefit from ECT from patients who will rather be non-responders. Finally, by&#xD;
      investigating the role of the MAO-A DVs in ECT, its highly discussed relevance for&#xD;
      antidepressant action will be further elucidated and might prepare the ground for new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies. Additionally, this study might contribute in substantiating potential&#xD;
      effects of ECT on brain structure.&#xD;
