      Open-label, dose escalation, monotherapy, basket trial with biomarker specific MTD expansion&#xD;
      cohort/Phase II part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dose finding part to determine the MTD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biomarker specific MTD expansion cohort/Phase II part to assess clinical anti-tumour&#xD;
           activity in included tumour types&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Phase I/II open label, dose escalation trial to determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of afatinib monotherapy in children aged ≥1 year to &lt;18 years with recurrent/refractory neuroectodermal tumours, rhabdomyosarcoma and/or other solid tumours with known ErbB pathway deregulation regardless of tumour histology.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Only subjects that met all the study inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were to be entered in the study. All subjects were free to withdraw from the clinical trial at any time for any reason given. Close monitoring of all subjects was adhered to throughout the trial conduct. Rescue medication was allowed for all patients as required.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Afatinib, dose level 0. (Once daily at 80% of the recommended adult dose per m2 body surface area [BSA] using allometric scaling):&#xD;
Oral solid single-unit film-coated tablets for pediatric patients who are able to swallow them. Oral liquid formulation for patients who cannot swallow the film-coated tablets, or for doses which cannot be achieved by the film-coated tablets, or for pediatric patients who did not accept the film-coated tablets.&#xD;
Therapy with afatinib continued as long as the individual patient benefited from the therapy, did not develop secondary malignancy, and did not meet one of the criteria requiring withdrawal from treatment.&#xD;
Afatinib in film-coated tablet form can be given in tablets of 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg. The dose in film-coated tablets is related to the free base equivalent to afatinib. The dose of afatinib as capsule and solvent for oral solution is given as a 200 mg capsule to be dissolved in aqueous solvent (2 capsules per 100 milliliter solvent) i.e. 4 milligram per milliliter.</description>

        <description>Progression free survival for the MTD expansion cohorts was reported. Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the duration from the date of first treatment until the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient did not have an event, PFS was censored at the date of last adequate tumour assessment.</description>
        <time_frame>From the first treatment until date of first progression or death, up to 336 days.</time_frame>
        <population>Treated set (TS): This patient set included all patients enrolled in the trial who were documented to have taken at least one dose of study medication.</population>

Therapy with afatinib continued as long as the individual patient benefited from the therapy, did not develop secondary malignancy, and did not meet one of the criteria requiring withdrawal from treatment.&#xD;
Afatinib in film-coated tablet form can be given in tablets of 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg. The dose in film-coated tablets is related to the free base equivalent to afatinib. The dose of afatinib as capsule and solvent for oral solution is given as a 200 mg capsule to be dissolved in aqueous solvent (2 capsules per 100 milliliter solvent) i.e. 4 milligram per milliliter.</description>
