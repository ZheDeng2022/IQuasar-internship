  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research focuses on disorders of motivation, responsible for a disability that patients&#xD;
      experience daily. It is a disorder that affects behavior, especially social. Mechanisms,&#xD;
      which result in these disorders, are poorly understood. This ignorance is responsible for the&#xD;
      lack of effective therapy. The investigators realize this work in order to better understand&#xD;
      the motivational deficits. The objective of the study is to characterize the cognitive&#xD;
      mechanisms of motivational deficits in schizophrenia and depression. To answer the question&#xD;
      posed in the research, it is planned to include 35 people with schizophrenia, 35 people with&#xD;
      depression and 70 heathy volunteers in the Hospital of Sainte-Anne .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator goal is to develop a neuropsychological battery to characterize the&#xD;
      different aspects of motivation: energizing action, ability to use the clues to assign value,&#xD;
      ability to anticipate a reward delayed in time, and finally learning by trial / error based&#xD;
      rewards. In addition, the investigators systematically compare the effect of rewards and&#xD;
      punishments (losses) in these spots. Such a systematic approach should better understand the&#xD;
      nature of disrupted in schizophrenia process. It should also highlight the differential&#xD;
      effects of treatment, including the effects of conventional antipsychotics versus atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotics, but also the benefits of cognitive remediation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the depression:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The motivational deficit is at the heart of the depressive symptomatology. Our objective is&#xD;
      to characterize the motivational processes altered in the depression thanks to the same&#xD;
      neuropsychological battery. Furthermore, this clinical dimension could influence the answer&#xD;
      to the antidepressant treatment. A better characterization of the motivational deficit would&#xD;
      allow to adapt at best the pharmacological treatments used in the depression, in particular&#xD;
      by targeting the dopaminergic way, involved in the control of the motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 35 patients and 35 control subjects in both populations. The&#xD;
      investigators will make them pass a battery of motivational tests described above on three&#xD;
      half-days:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Force task: This task tests the energization process, that is to say the ability to&#xD;
      activate an action in proportion to what is involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It consists of two sessions of 60 trials, which are offset through six levels of monetary&#xD;
      issue (1, 20, 50 cents, 1, 5, 20 euros), and lasts about 30 minutes. On each trial, patients&#xD;
      must tighten the grip dynamometer in order to earn a reward proportional to both the level of&#xD;
      monetary issue and the peak forces occurs, or avoid a financial loss of a magnitude equal.&#xD;
      The award of this task will be made in subliminal conditions and in supraliminal, and in&#xD;
      condition of mental effort with the use of a stroop test instead of the dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Preference task: This task tests the integrity of the &quot;brain recovery system.&quot; It includes&#xD;
      three subtests quotes 24 awards, 24 penalties and 24 efforts, and three subtests of binary&#xD;
      choices with 48 trials each, and lasts about 30 minutes. Patients should note how various&#xD;
      awards seem pleasant, how various punishments seem unpleasant, or how various efforts seem&#xD;
      harsh. Registration vegetative markers (heart rate) compares the implied valuations for&#xD;
      explicit assessments (notes), and thus to estimate the accuracy of introspection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Discount and effort task: These tasks are used to estimate the parameters of time counting&#xD;
      efforts and punishments. In the task of counting time effort, patients must choose between&#xD;
      making a small reward associated with a low time or earn a greater reward associated with a&#xD;
      significant delay. In the task of temporal punishments count, patients must choose between&#xD;
      experience low punishment in a short time, or suffer a greater punishment in a larger delay.&#xD;
      These tasks can capture a form of apathy characterized by an exaggeration of fatigue or pain&#xD;
      early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Learning task: It can test the overall learning abilities and specific sensitivities&#xD;
      learning by positive and negative reinforcement. It consists of two sessions, each with 60&#xD;
      binary choices (24 associated with rewards, punishments associated with 24, 12 associated&#xD;
      with neutral events), for a period of about 20 minutes. The second session will be provided&#xD;
      in counterfactual condition.&#xD;
