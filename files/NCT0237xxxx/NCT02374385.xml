  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ebola virus has infected and killed people, mostly in Africa. In 2014, the Ebola virus has&#xD;
      affected several thousand people. There is no approved effective way to treat or prevent&#xD;
      Ebola. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the anti-Ebola vaccine VSV ZEBOV (BPSC1001) to see if it is safe. Also, to see how&#xD;
      it affects people's immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy men and women ages 18-65. They must not have a chronic medical condition that&#xD;
      requires medicine. They must not be a healthcare worker, an animal care worker, or a&#xD;
      childcare worker, and they must not have a household contact that has a compromised immune&#xD;
      system, is pregnant, or is under the age of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomly assigned to get the vaccine or the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visit 1 (vaccination), vital signs will be taken and blood will be drawn. The vaccine&#xD;
           or placebo will be injected into the upper arm muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return to the clinic 11 times over the next 6 months. Participants&#xD;
           will have blood drawn at every study visit. Their mouth will be swabbed and urine tested&#xD;
           at least four times after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 14 days after vaccination, participants will write down their temperature, any&#xD;
           symptoms, and any redness at the injection site. They will bring the booklet to each&#xD;
           study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All visits take place at the Canadian Center for Vaccinology, Dalhousie University/IWK Health&#xD;
      Centre, Halifax, NS.&#xD;
