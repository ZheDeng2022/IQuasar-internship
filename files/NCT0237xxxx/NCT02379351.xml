    <textblock>
      Non-stress tests (NSTs) are used to monitor the health of babies during pregnancy. These&#xD;
      tests are currently conducted in clinics and hospitals. This requires travel to a clinic or&#xD;
      hospital, sometimes multiple times per week, in order to receive these tests. Technology has&#xD;
      been developed that now allows for NSTs to be done in other locations, including home or&#xD;
      work. The Airstrip® Sense4Baby™ NST device has been FDA-approved for use by obstetricians in&#xD;
      clinical and hospital settings. The investigators are evaluating the use of the Airstrip®&#xD;
      Sense4Baby™ NST device in out-of-hospital settings. The investigators would like to know if&#xD;
      this type of monitoring is feasible and acceptable to patients and physicians.&#xD;

      Phase I of this study enrolls pregnant women with physician-ordered twice-weekly NSTs&#xD;
      scheduled in the OB Diagnostic Center at the University of Utah Hospital. Participants&#xD;
      receive an in-clinic NST with the Airstrip® Sense4Baby™ device, are taught how to use the&#xD;
      device, and asked to demonstrate their ability to use the device. Once the participant&#xD;
      successfully demonstrates use of the monitor the device is given to the participant to use at&#xD;
      the scheduled time each week. Patients receive educational materials, including a&#xD;
      visuals-enhanced, short quick start guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For her remote NST monitoring, the patient will receive a virtual NST appointment. At the&#xD;
      time of the scheduled appointment, the patient will apply the monitor and the NST will be&#xD;
      read by the mid-level provider staffing the testing center after a thirty-minute strip has&#xD;
      been recorded and transmitted to the database. The NST will also be interpreted by the&#xD;
      maternal-fetal medicine physician, according to the established workflow. The patient will be&#xD;
      notified of the result by a telephone call from the mid-level provider and appropriate&#xD;
      follow-up arranged according to the NST management algorithm developed for this study. If the&#xD;
      patient has trouble with using the device at home, the patient will be able to talk with the&#xD;
      mid-level provider via telephone to troubleshoot issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will also continue to receive an NST in clinic weekly. These NST schedules will&#xD;
      be repeated on a weekly basis until delivery or until the provider discontinues the NST&#xD;
      order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted after delivery to assess overall satisfaction with the NST at home&#xD;
      versus in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II of this study will enroll the same patient population (pregnant women with&#xD;
      physician-ordered twice-weekly NSTs scheduled). Participants in Phase II may receive NSTs up&#xD;
      to twice weekly at home. During regularly scheduled obstetric visits (every 1 to 2 weeks&#xD;
      depending on gestational age and circumstances), NSTs will be performed on site. However, we&#xD;
      will remove the requirement for once weekly on-site testing at the University of Utah&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The requirement to be within a 60-mile radius of University Hospital will be removed for&#xD;
      Phase II participants. Instead, the requirement will be to be within a 60-mile radius of a&#xD;
      hospital with an obstetric unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted after delivery to assess overall satisfaction with the NST at home&#xD;
      versus in clinic.&#xD;
