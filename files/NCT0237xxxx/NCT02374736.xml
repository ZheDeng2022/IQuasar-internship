  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective of this pilot study is to determine whether the progression of&#xD;
      chronic antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) could be minimized by the post-transplant&#xD;
      administration of high dose of Intravenous Immunoglobulins (IVIg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We test the hypothesis that repetitive IVIg administration reduces or stabilize the&#xD;
      progressive loss of transplant function and the evolution to chronic ABMR in stable kidney&#xD;
      transplant patients with HLA-DSA developed post-transplantion (de novo HLA-DSA) and&#xD;
      concomitant humoral graft injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of IVIg associated to conventional&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment in 15 stable transplant recipients with post-transplant de novo&#xD;
      HLA-DSA and histological humoral lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 2 periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment period,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up period. The treatment will start the day of inclusion (M0): Privigen will be&#xD;
           given as 2 g/kg for 2 days/month for 6 months (maximum dose: 80 g/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation at the end of treatment will take place on month 6 (M6). Evaluation at the end of&#xD;
      follow up will take place on month 12 (M12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be collected on day of inclusion (M0), before each infusion of&#xD;
      Privigen, at M6 and M12 for biological analysis (serum creatinine, glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate, proteinuria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected on day of inclusion (M0), at M6 and M12 for immunoassay&#xD;
      (HLA-DSA mean fluorescence intensity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample will be collected on day of inclusion (M0) to provide a DNA bank. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected on day of inclusion (M0), before each infusion of Privigen and at M6 for&#xD;
      IgG dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected on day of inclusion (M0), before each infusion of Privigen,&#xD;
      at M6 and M12 to provide a serum bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected on day of inclusion (M0), before each infusion of Privigen,&#xD;
      at M6 and M12 for haematology, blood chemistry and Coombs test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological characteristics (kidney biopsies) will be performed on M0 and M6. The M6 biopsy&#xD;
      is specifically requested by the protocol and differs from the usual practice, where it is&#xD;
      usually performed at M12 post transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infectious and clinical events (deceased patients, graft loss, acute biopsy-proven rejection&#xD;
      episode and infectious diseases) will be recorded during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histology of for-cause biopsies will be performed according to center practice. We recommend&#xD;
      a graft biopsy for patients with acute allograft dysfunction (20% increase of creatinine)&#xD;
      without current evident causes of graft dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum study duration for a subject, between inclusion and follow-up visits, will be 12&#xD;
      months and the estimated length of time needed to complete the entire study (from enrolment&#xD;
      of the first subject to completion of the last subject) 18 months.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects will be treated for 6 months. The treatment will start the day of inclusion (M0).&#xD;
Privigen will be given as 2 g/kg for 2 days/month. The maximum daily dose authorized will be 80g.&#xD;
The infusion rates are the recommended rates for Privigen in other indications and are in line with the market authorization for Privigen:&#xD;
Infusions should start at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/min (0.005 mL/kg/min; 0.3 mL/kg/h; 30 mg/kg/h). If well tolerated within 30 min, the rate can be increased in a first step to 1.0 mg/kg/min (0.01 mL/kg/min; 0.6 mL/kg/h; 60 mg/kg/h) for another 30 min.&#xD;
If well tolerated, a stepwise increase to a maximum of 8 mg/kg/min (0.08 mL/kg/min; 4.8 mL/kg/h; 480 mg/kg/h) is allowed at the discretion of the investigator.</description>
