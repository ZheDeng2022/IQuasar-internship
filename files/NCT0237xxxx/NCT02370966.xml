      Summary About 10-15 % of the adult population in Sweden suffers from periodontitis, which is&#xD;
      an inflammatory response to certain oral bacteria. The first stage of periodontitis is termed&#xD;
      gingivitis, which is clinically defined by swollen tissue, redness and bleeding in the&#xD;
      gingiva. If the inflammatory process could be attenuated, this would greatly reduce the risk&#xD;
      of developing periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet is of importance for the development and prevention of chronic diseases. Berries contain&#xD;
      compounds that can act as anti-inflammatory agents and this bioactivity may reduce the risk&#xD;
      of disease. A recent meta-analysis of publications in this area revealed a dearth of&#xD;
      experimental and clinical data on the impact of berry intake on inflammatory conditions.&#xD;
      Studies which detail berry intake/dosage and period of dosage to exert an effect is&#xD;
      particularly lacking, in terms of the positive effects of berries on anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions. The purpose of this project is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate the impact of daily intake of freeze-dried berries on the clinical degree of&#xD;
           chronic inflammation by studying changes in the degree of gingivitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the presence of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers locally in gingival tissue,&#xD;
           saliva and through analysis of serum samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze dose response relationship for different berry powders by investigating&#xD;
           clinical and biomedical effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Many diseases have a significant inflammatory pathogenesis which can be difficult&#xD;
      to control. In traditional medicine symptoms and inflammatory processes are treated with&#xD;
      pharmaceuticals. Many pharmaceuticals show side-effects that have economic and environmental&#xD;
      consequences both for the individual and the environment. It has for centuries been known&#xD;
      that plants have anti-inflammatory and healing effects. An early example of how plants came&#xD;
      in use for medical treatment is the work of Carl von Linné and his practice as a botanist and&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In modern times complimentary alternative medicine has claimed that intake of fruit and&#xD;
      berries in different compositions has anti-inflammatory effects. Some of these claims have&#xD;
      been difficult to evaluate since studies to highlight anti-inflammatory benefit have often&#xD;
      not been well conducted. There is a conspicuous lack of data on clinically effective doses of&#xD;
      plant extracts. The Swedish National Food Agency contends that the daily intake of&#xD;
      vegetables, fruits and berries should be 500 grams for adults, although few people in Sweden&#xD;
      reach these recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fruits and berries are not considered pharmaceuticals but are often termed 'nutraceuticals'.&#xD;
      Despite a lack of scientific grounds for the medicinal use of fruits and berries, there are&#xD;
      today a very large range of health products based on fruits and berries. It is, therefore, of&#xD;
      importance to scientifically investigate which fruits and berries that have demonstrable&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects that is to specifically study biomarkers and clinical conditions&#xD;
      with adult individuals. It is also vital to develop a palatable form of administration of the&#xD;
      berries that would facilitate regular intake of a naturally based product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using biomedicine as a starting point we aim to study anti-inflammatory effects in clinical,&#xD;
      randomized, case control, studies. Our primary objective is to treat adult individuals with&#xD;
      gingivitis. In general, gingivitis makes up a common chronic condition with adults and it&#xD;
      occurs in more than half the population. From a clinical perspective there are well&#xD;
      established methods to investigate inflammation in the mouth. The presence of inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers in the mouth can be conveniently and efficiently measured. Through standard&#xD;
      methods for blood sampling one can study the same inflammatory biomarkers and thus analyze&#xD;
      which general effects the intake of a test product may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method A daily intake of 500 g is difficult to achieve. Freeze-dried berry powder is a&#xD;
      distribution form that would enable regular intake of a naturally based product. We intend to&#xD;
      investigate dose-response relationship of different berries, such as bilberries, black&#xD;
      currant, lingonberries, rose hip, and sea buckthorn. The selection of berries will be based&#xD;
      on accessibility, assumed acceptance and variation of nutrients and commercial conditions.&#xD;
      Our earlier studies on bilberries will be used as a reference. All berry powders that will be&#xD;
      used in the study will be analyzed for sugar content of micronutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will analyze clinical effects of the degree of gingivitis and changes of known biomarkers&#xD;
      of inflammation in serum, saliva and gingival fluid. We will start with a low dose and double&#xD;
      the dose each week. We have made the assumption that the content dry substance in berries is&#xD;
      about 10 %, i.e. 50 g freeze-dried berries would correspond to 500 g fresh berries. We will&#xD;
      start with 6.25 g berry powder and double the dosage each week until we reach a maximum&#xD;
      dosage of 50 g according to the Swedish National Food Agencies recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigations will include a routine dental examination assessing for probing&#xD;
      depths at teeth, the extent of gingival bleeding, and presence of plaque accumulation on&#xD;
      teeth. Serum, saliva, and gingival fluid samples will be collected to assess for bacteria and&#xD;
      cytokine levels. The dental nurse that will conduct the clinical investigation will have no&#xD;
      information whether participating individuals have been assigned a berry powder or placebo.&#xD;
      Placebo will consist of potato starch. The clinical and biomedical parameters will be studied&#xD;
      weekly as seven days is the time required to assure clinical effects and assumed to be&#xD;
      sufficient to reach steady-state levels on markers of inflammation. The aim is to identify&#xD;
      dose-response relationship and to rank the effects of the different berries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination of biomarkers is based on Luminex Technology. The Luminex system enables&#xD;
      analysis of a combination of markers of inflammation in small samples volumes. Our experience&#xD;
      from the pilot study has showed that in order to obtain statistical power for VEGF and MIP-1α&#xD;
      16 individuals are required. We plan to include 20 individuals in each series to compensate&#xD;
      if some individuals don't complete the study. Inclusion criteria is registration of lingual&#xD;
      bleeding on the first and second molar in the lower jaw.&#xD;
