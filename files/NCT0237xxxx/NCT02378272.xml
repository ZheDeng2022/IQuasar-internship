    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to explore if a complementary addition of a care manager for&#xD;
      depression treatment in the primary care setting has positive effects concerning reduction of&#xD;
      the patients' depressive symptoms as well as improvement of daily function and quality of&#xD;
      life in a short- and long-term perspective compared with the traditional Swedish primary care&#xD;
      organization. The aim is also to evaluate the care manager function in a health economic&#xD;
      perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to develop and evaluate an evidence-based care manager program for&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate depression and to compare the evidence-based care manager&#xD;
      program to treatment as usual (TAU) in terms of their short- and long-term effects on symptom&#xD;
      remission, treatment adherence, care satisfaction, and self-efficacy as well as to perform a&#xD;
      cost - effectiveness analysis of the care manager program, i.e. to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      the program on patients' health in relation to the running costs of the program.&#xD;

      Methods The research questions will be tested in a randomised controlled trial with follow&#xD;
      ups 3 and 6 months in the primary care setting in cooperation between universities of&#xD;
      Gothenburg, Karolinska Institute and primary care centres (PCC) of regions/county councils of&#xD;
      Västra Götaland, and Dalarna.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A cluster randomized controlled trial of two groups (intervention and control).&#xD;
      Randomization will be at the level of the primary care centers (PCCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population of study Patients aged 18 and up that visit one of 20 different urban and rural&#xD;
      PCCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization All PCCs in the participating regions without employed onsite mental health&#xD;
      professionals are invited to participate in the study. Around twenty practices will be&#xD;
      matched into 10 blocks by depression treatment practices, thereafter 1 practice from each&#xD;
      block will be randomly assigned to receive the care manager intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention At the intervention practices, a district nurse will apply around 15-25% of&#xD;
      working time as care coordinator for management of care for the patients with depression.&#xD;
      Before patient recruitment begins, physicians and the nurse/district nurse (care manager)&#xD;
      will participate in sessions for training in providing clinical services (patient information&#xD;
      and education on patient's preferred treatment, assessment of patient's depressive symptoms&#xD;
      and regular telephone contacts, follow up visits etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of patients and Data collection Patients aged 18 and up that visit primary health&#xD;
      care centres and are diagnosed by the General Practitioner (GP) with light/medium depression&#xD;
      disorder according to PRIME-MD (4). The patients will be monitored up to 6 months after&#xD;
      inclusion in the study by an individual interview (first visit, 3 and 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parameters will be assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months; prescription of&#xD;
      antidepressants, number of days of labour lost, socio-demographic and economic variables,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, physical activity, and ethnicity. BDI-II, EuroQoL-5D, Work Ability&#xD;
      Instrument (WAI) Karasek Job strain Model , medication, other treatment (psychological,&#xD;
      counselling, or other).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For somatic health reasons, also blood pressure and p-glucose will be monitored, and blood&#xD;
      samples for bio-bank storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome criteria Change in: depression symptoms (BDI-II), work ability index (WAI), Job&#xD;
      strain (Karasek), EQ-5D, QALYs from baseline to 3 and 6 months. Amount of sick listing (days,&#xD;
      %), days of labour lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Analysis of covariance, controlling for baseline value, will be used to&#xD;
      estimate the overall treatment effectiveness (difference in score) at final follow-up.&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis by gender as well as age adjustments will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation The primary variable is the level of depression (as measured by the BDI-II)&#xD;
      and analyzed in an ANCOVA model with repeated measures. In order to detect an effect of 3&#xD;
      units in the difference between the two groups, with a power of 80% and a significance level&#xD;
      of 10% (two-sided) about 200 patients is needed in each group (9). The underlying assumption&#xD;
      is a standard deviation in the group of 10 units, a within-subject correlation of 0.4, and a&#xD;
      within-cluster-correlation of 0.1, i.e. a design effect of 1.9 to correct for having a&#xD;
      cluster analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analysis A cost- effectiveness analysis (CEA) with quality-adjusted life&#xD;
      years (QALY) as measure of effect will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The region Västra Götaland has proclaimed interest in the study, and financially supports the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
