  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the Continued Access study is to gather confirmatory evidence on the safety&#xD;
      of the SonRtip lead and performance of the automatic atrioventricular (AV) delay and&#xD;
      interventricular (VV) delay optimization algorithm used in the PARADYM RF SONR Cardiac&#xD;
      Resynchronization Therapy with Defibrillation (CRT-D) device (Model 9770) in a patient&#xD;
      population that is reflective of current heart failure treatment practice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the introduction of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on a large scale, it has&#xD;
      been observed that approximately 30% of recipient patients are non-responsive to therapy.&#xD;
      This non-responsiveness can be decreased by optimizing the device programming, particularly&#xD;
      the stimulation rate, paced and sensed atrioventricular (AV) delay, and the interventricular&#xD;
      (VV) delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CRT patients need a 100% rate of ventricular capture, but beyond this the achievement of&#xD;
      therapy effectiveness requires the identification of the optimal pacing configuration, which&#xD;
      varies among patients. The optimization of CRT systems, usually based on ultrasound imaging&#xD;
      is time-consuming and the number of patients in need of multiple optimization procedures due&#xD;
      to ventricular remodeling is growing rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanical effects of a more coordinated contraction result in a shortening of the&#xD;
      isovolumetric contraction phase and the pre-ejection time, and an increase in LV dP/dt&#xD;
      (change in left ventricular pressure over time. The concept of measuring contractility with&#xD;
      an implantable accelerometer was first clinically validated through a multicenter study on a&#xD;
      rate responsive pacing system (BEST - Living from SORIN Biomedica) in 1996. This study&#xD;
      positively demonstrates that measurement of Peak Endocardial Acceleration signal (called PEA&#xD;
      or SonR) is feasible and reliable in the long-term, both for the purpose of rate response and&#xD;
      as a hemodynamic monitor of cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recent clinical studies have demonstrated that optimal VV and AV Delays determined using&#xD;
      algorithms based on SonR signal analysis (SonR method) are correlated with the highest&#xD;
      hemodynamic improvement and lead to significant clinical benefit for the patients, thus&#xD;
      reducing the rate of non-responsiveness to CRT therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, frequent and automatic AV and VV delay optimization in patients with CRT-D devices&#xD;
      could benefit both patients, through increasing the percent of CRT responders, and&#xD;
      clinicians, through simplifying CRT optimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion phase of the &quot;Clinical Trial of the SonRtip Lead and Automatic AV-VV&#xD;
      Optimization Algorithm in the PARADYM RF SonR CRT-D&quot; (RESPOND CRT Study, code ITSY06) has&#xD;
      been completed. A total of 1039 patients have been enrolled in 125 centers in Europe,&#xD;
      Australia and USA, from 13 January 2012 to 14 October 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety has been monitored continuously throughout the RESPOND-CRT trial by the Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB charter is to provide recommendations to the Sponsor to&#xD;
      suspend or stop the study if there is clear evidence of harm or harmful side-effects related&#xD;
      to the use of the device or study procedures. To date, there have been no safety concerns&#xD;
      raised by the RESPOND-CRT study data and the DSMB has recommended continuation of the&#xD;
      clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, safety is supported by the European marketing history. As the SonR System is CE&#xD;
      marked, RESPONDCRT is being conducted as a post-market study in Europe. Therefore in addition&#xD;
      to the 1000+ patients enrolled in the RESPOND-CRT IDE, an additional 3000+ patients have&#xD;
      received the SonR system outside the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a supplement to the RESPOND CRT IDE Study a Continued Access Study (CAS) is being&#xD;
      conducted according to the potential public health need and preliminary evidence that the&#xD;
      device is likely to be effective with no significant safety concerns for the proposed&#xD;
      indication.&#xD;
