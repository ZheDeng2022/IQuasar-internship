  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRE) for the treatment of anxiety disorders has received&#xD;
      considerable attention. During VRE, a person encounters a feared stimulus in a&#xD;
      computer-generated environment, often through the use of a head mounted display and motion&#xD;
      tracker that allows for multisensory input and natural movement. Several advantages of VRE&#xD;
      have been noted - both clinical, such as treatment acceptability, and methodological, such as&#xD;
      the ability to conduct exposure in a tightly controlled environment. Empirical support for&#xD;
      VRE varies across anxiety disorders. Specifically, randomized controlled trials support the&#xD;
      efficacy of VRE with fear of flying and acrophobia and show that it is equally effective as&#xD;
      in vivo exposure. These phobias lend themselves well to VRE; the feared stimulus is&#xD;
      circumscribed and contains powerful physical cues that can be produced within a virtual&#xD;
      environment. There is less controlled research on the use of VRE for other anxiety disorders.&#xD;
      The current study examines VRE for social anxiety disorder, which is characterized by fear of&#xD;
      negative evaluation, and thus may be more difficult to evoke and treat using a virtual&#xD;
      environment. Further, no research to date has compared VRE and the gold standard treatment&#xD;
      for social anxiety disorder - cognitive behavioral therapy in a group format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to compare VRE and Exposure Group Therapy to wait list in&#xD;
      a sample of adults meeting criteria for social anxiety disorder with a primary fear of public&#xD;
      speaking. It is hypothesized that, relative to wait list, those receiving treatment will&#xD;
      improve on standardized measures of public speaking fears and fears of negative evaluation,&#xD;
      as well as a behavioral avoidance task. Participants also are expected to maintain treatment&#xD;
      gains at 3 and 12-month follow-up. Comparisons between the two active treatments also will be&#xD;
      made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent, study candidates completed a phone interview to screen for obvious&#xD;
      exclusion criteria (e.g., current treatment for social anxiety disorder) and then an&#xD;
      in-person, pretreatment assessment consisting of the Structured Clinical Interview for the&#xD;
      DSM-IV (SCID), speech task, and the battery of self-report measures. Eligible participants&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to virtual reality exposure therapy, exposure group therapy, or wait&#xD;
      list by simple randomization using a computerized random number generator. Concealment&#xD;
      procedures were used to prevent foreknowledge of treatment assignment from influencing&#xD;
      enrollment. Each potential participant had a participant number, which was only known by the&#xD;
      study coordinator. The first author kept a hard copy of a list linking participant number to&#xD;
      condition assignment in a locked file drawer. Once a participant was enrolled, the study&#xD;
      coordinator asked for the treatment condition for a particular participant number. The first&#xD;
      author had no knowledge of which participant was linked with a participant number, and the&#xD;
      study coordinator had no knowledge of which participant number was linked with treatment&#xD;
      condition. Participants assigned to wait list were re-randomized to virtual reality exposure&#xD;
      therapy or exposure group therapy following the waiting period (Figure 1). Participants&#xD;
      completed all assessment and treatment sessions at a psychology clinic within at an urban&#xD;
      research university that is accessible by public transportation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants completed assessments at pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up. Self-report&#xD;
      outcome measures were completed at each assessment point. Participants were asked to complete&#xD;
      the behavioral avoidance task at pretreatment and posttreatment. The anxiety, mood, and&#xD;
      substance use modules of the SCID were administered at pretreatment, and the anxiety module&#xD;
      was administered at the 3-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments were conducted by doctoral students who were blind to the type of treatment&#xD;
      to be received. All pretreatment and follow-up diagnostic assessments were videotaped, and a&#xD;
      randomly selected subset (N=10) were reviewed by a licensed psychologist to calculate the&#xD;
      inter-rater reliability of pretreatment assessment (100% agreement for primary diagnosis,&#xD;
      with one disagreement on severity). Compensation was provided to participants who completed&#xD;
      the self-report battery of measures administered at posttreatment, 3- and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to administering therapy, study therapists attended two day training workshops for each&#xD;
      treatment, led by the developers of the respective treatments. Each study therapist also&#xD;
      received weekly supervision by the first author. There were 5 study therapists: 2 licensed&#xD;
      clinical psychologists with experience in manualized treatment, and 3 doctoral students with&#xD;
      no experience with manualized treatments. All therapists administered both treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatments were administered according to a manualized protocol for 8 sessions. The VRE&#xD;
      and EGT treatment groups were designed to be as similar as possible, with the exception of&#xD;
      the modality for the delivery of exposure. Both treatments began with a treatment rationale&#xD;
      and psychoeducation about social anxiety disorder. During sessions 2- 8, both treatments&#xD;
      addressed specific aspects of social anxiety disorder identified in psychopathology&#xD;
      literature, including self-focused attention, perceptions of self and others, perceptions of&#xD;
      emotional control, rumination, realistic goal setting for social situations through the use&#xD;
      of such techniques as cognitive preparation, and challenging of cost and probability biases.&#xD;
      Session 8 also included relapse prevention. Homework was assigned for both treatments,&#xD;
      including a daily mirror task, daily record of social situations, and identification of&#xD;
      cognitive biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual Reality Exposure (VRE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual environments included a virtual conference room (~5 audience members), a virtual&#xD;
      classroom (~35 audience members), and a virtual auditorium (100+ audience members).&#xD;
      Therapists could manipulate audience reactions in a number of ways including making them&#xD;
      appear interested, bored, supportive, hostile, distracted (i.e., cell phone ringing). Virtual&#xD;
      audience members could also pose questions, either standardized (e.g., &quot;I don't understand,&#xD;
      could you explain again&quot;) or tailored to the client using therapist voice-over. Virtual&#xD;
      environments were manipulated according to the participants fear hierarchy. Participants were&#xD;
      exposed to each item on their hierarchy until their fear decreased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure Group Therapy (EGT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGT was co-led by a licensed clinical psychologist and an advanced doctoral student. Groups&#xD;
      consisted of up to five participants. During exposure, participants gave a videotaped speech&#xD;
      in front of the group. Group members were also asked to provide each other with positive&#xD;
      feedback when the videotaped speeches were reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every effort was made to equate time in exposure across treatment group. Participants&#xD;
      receiving VRE completed 4 trials of exposure. Because of the risk of simulator sickness&#xD;
      (e.g., headaches, nausea), exposure trials lasted no longer than 30 minutes, for a total of&#xD;
      up to 120 minutes. Participants receiving EGT received 6 trials of exposure. The amount of&#xD;
      time spent on each group member varied according to the number of participants in the group.&#xD;
      On average, for a group with 4 participants, participants completed 6 trials of exposure for&#xD;
      20 minutes for a total of 120 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wait List&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 weeks, wait list participants completed the self-report battery. Wait list&#xD;
      participants were re-randomized to either virtual reality exposure or exposure group therapy&#xD;
      following the waiting period and received the same 8-week treatment protocol described above.&#xD;
