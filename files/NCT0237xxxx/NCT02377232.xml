  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several screening methods exist to screen patients for CRC ranging from invasive (i.e.,&#xD;
      colonoscopy) to less invasive (i.e., testing the stool for blood). Although choice between&#xD;
      screening methods is recommended, patients are not currently offered an unbiased choice and&#xD;
      physicians generally recommend only colonoscopy. In this project, the investigators will&#xD;
      answer the following questions: 1) Is it feasible to incorporate a DA in the AHP protocol?;&#xD;
      2) Is it feasible to incorporate mailing patients a stool blood test?; 3) Does the DA change&#xD;
      CRC screening decision quality, using proxy measures such as knowledge and intent; and 4)&#xD;
      Does the DA change the proportion of participants that complete a CRC screening test? To&#xD;
      answer these questions the investigators will compare survey responses and CRC test type&#xD;
      completed between two AHP CRC surveillance patients groups - those that received usual care&#xD;
      versus those that received the DA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the University of Colorado Hospital primary care clinics, only 59% of eligible patients&#xD;
      are up to date with current colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. This is below the national&#xD;
      average of 65% and well below the healthy people 2020 goal of 70.5%. Several screening&#xD;
      methods exist to screen patients for CRC ranging from invasive (i.e., colonoscopy) to less&#xD;
      invasive (i.e., testing the stool for blood). Although choice between screening methods is&#xD;
      recommended, patients are not currently offered an unbiased choice and physicians generally&#xD;
      recommend only colonoscopy. Further, the investigators know from research that choice&#xD;
      increases screening rates. Unfortunately, many people do not follow through when only&#xD;
      colonoscopy is offered. However, participants in one study were nearly twice as likely to be&#xD;
      screened if they were offered a choice between colonoscopy and fecal occult blood testing&#xD;
      rather than being offered colonoscopy alone. Thus, in this project, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility of incorporating a patient decision aid (DA) for patients in CRC&#xD;
      screening surveillance with the Ambulatory Health Promotion (AHP) using a pre/post design.&#xD;
      The investigators will answer the following questions: 1) Is it feasible to incorporate a DA&#xD;
      in the AHP protocol?; 2) Is it feasible to incorporate mailing patients a stool blood test?;&#xD;
      3) Does the DA change CRC screening decision quality, using proxy measures such as knowledge&#xD;
      and intent; and 4) Does the DA change the proportion of participants that complete a CRC&#xD;
      screening test? To answer these questions the investigators will compare survey responses and&#xD;
      CRC test type completed between two AHP CRC surveillance patients groups - those that&#xD;
      received usual care versus those that received the DA.&#xD;
