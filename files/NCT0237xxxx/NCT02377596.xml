    <textblock>
      Our long term objective is to enhance the pediatrician's management of children with feeding&#xD;
      difficulties in a primary care office-based pediatric practice setting. A prerequisite is to&#xD;
      rapidly reach an accurate diagnosis so that appropriate therapy can be applied. To improve&#xD;
      the efficiency and accuracy of the diagnostic interview the investigators have designed a&#xD;
      Feeding Difficulty Diagnostic Tool (FDDT) consisting of a set of questions that fit beneath a&#xD;
      'diagnostic cover' and prompts for basic information. Depending on the answers rendered on&#xD;
      the questionnaire particular diagnoses noted on the cover are flagged for consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study our specific objectives are 1) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      using the FDDT in the pediatrician's office and 2) to obtain preliminary data on the&#xD;
      reliability of using the instrument in the diagnosis and management of children with feeding&#xD;
      difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility and acceptability are often interrelated and will be assessed in a broad&#xD;
           sense by questionnaires that ascertain, for example, the amount of time needed by&#xD;
           parents and staff to fill in and use the FDDT questionnaire, the ease and difficulties&#xD;
           encountered in filling out the FDDT questionnaire and the understanding of the&#xD;
           questionnaire by the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reliability relates to the usefulness of the FDDT questionnaire for the pediatrician in&#xD;
           obtaining and organizing the information obtained from the history and physical&#xD;
           including anthropometric data to reach a correct diagnosis, the latter being judged in&#xD;
           this study against the diagnosis reached independently by trained experts in pediatric&#xD;
           feeding difficulties using a modification of their standard diagnostic interview. The&#xD;
           frequency of presentation of the various diagnostic sub-categories and the extent of the&#xD;
           discrepancy between the conclusions suggested by the FDDT, the pediatrician, and the&#xD;
           feeding disorder experts is unknown. Therefore' this pilot study is needed to help&#xD;
           determine the sample size necessary to power a more definitive study of the diagnostic&#xD;
           tool's accuracy, if necessary. The investigators anticipate that at least three of the&#xD;
           categories (children with excessive selectivity, children with demonstrably poor&#xD;
           appetite who are vigorous and free of organic disease, and those misperceived to have&#xD;
           feeding limitations) will be well represented in this preliminary study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys conducted throughout the world repeatedly demonstrate that approximately 50% of&#xD;
      mothers consider at least one of their children to have a feeding difficulty, meaning that&#xD;
      they resist taking an appropriate amount of food. This implicates between 20% and 30% of all&#xD;
      children. The milder cases are frequently considered &quot;picky eaters&quot; and although well&#xD;
      nourished they are at significant risk for coercive feeding. This in turn has been associated&#xD;
      with cognitive limitations and behavioral problems. Sub-groups do exhibit poor growth, and&#xD;
      some have sub-optimal nutrient consumption relative to body size,while others have underlying&#xD;
      or co-morbid organic disease. To help identify the relevant intervention for these children,&#xD;
      whether it is reassurance for the parents, counseling to resolve behavioral problems (of both&#xD;
      the child and the feeder), nutritional intervention and/or medical treatment, it is necessary&#xD;
      to identify the separate conditions that contribute to the feeding difficulty and its&#xD;
      complications so that appropriate treatment can then be tailored to the cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The task of categorizing children with feeding problems is frequently daunting for the&#xD;
      pediatrician due to time constraints and lack of training in this field. In developed&#xD;
      countries, physicians may refer a child with severe feeding difficulties to a specialist;&#xD;
      however, in many parts of the world, these resources are limited or absent. Additionally,&#xD;
      health care professionals have a narrow perspective based on their specialized training,&#xD;
      whether that is general medical care, specialized care, nutrition, or oral motor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the limitations detailed above, a questionnaire was developed based on the work&#xD;
      of the principal investigator, Dr. Kerzner and the co-investigator, Dr. Chatoor. This&#xD;
      questionnaire is filled out by the parents and their responses prompt the physician to&#xD;
      consider relevant diagnostic possibilities for the particular child's feeding difficulty.&#xD;
      Once a diagnosis or set of diagnoses is established by utilization of the questionnaire,&#xD;
      specific and appropriate therapy can then be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic categories that are captured by this tool are based on typical symptoms&#xD;
      demonstrated by children with feeding difficulties and their basis has been published by the&#xD;
      principal investigator (copy attached).1 Children over one year of age are divided into three&#xD;
      groups based on their dominant symptoms: those with poor appetite; those with excessive&#xD;
      selectivity; and those with fear of feeding. Children with a poor appetite are further&#xD;
      categorized into four sub groups: those who have underlying organic or medical problems;&#xD;
      those who are very active and playful but whose poor feeding leads to conflict with the&#xD;
      mother; those who fail to-thrive based on poor economic circumstances or neglect; and,&#xD;
      finally, those who are eating appropriate amounts of food but are misperceived by their&#xD;
      caregivers to have a poor appetite. Each feeding difficulty category has different and unique&#xD;
      approaches necessary for its resolution and it is possible for a child to fit into more than&#xD;
      one diagnostic category&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the diagnostic nomenclature in the literature has been confusing and in a state of flux&#xD;
      there are no data on the relative prevalence of various diagnoses, much less on the&#xD;
      diagnostic categories used in the current classification. Consequently, we have minimal&#xD;
      guidance for decisions relating to sample size; thus, the need for a pilot study. We believe&#xD;
      that this study will allow us an insight into the frequency and variance in diagnosis of at&#xD;
      least three of the major categories: children who are vigorous but with poor appetite, those&#xD;
      who are highly selective, and those who are in fact misperceived to have a feeding problem.&#xD;
      We also have no information on the feasibility and acceptance of the FDDT questionnaire and&#xD;
      we believe the pilot study will facilitate our gaining the pediatrician's and office staff's&#xD;
      perspective so that in future designs of the instrument we can overcome any practical&#xD;
      limitations that become evident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, observational pilot study will be conducted in a single private pediatric&#xD;
      office. The pediatricians have incorporated the FDDT questionnaire as a part of the routine&#xD;
      evaluation of children coming for &quot;well baby visits&quot;. To complete the study we will recruit&#xD;
      at least 40 of the children perceived by their parents or guardian to have feeding&#xD;
      difficulties. To be sure this number is obtained we will aim to recruit 50 subjects. This&#xD;
      study will be approximately one year in duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected on study subjects as illustrated in the flow sheet on&#xD;
      page 6 of this research protocol cover sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Historical data reported by the parent or guardian on the FDDT questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diagnosis suggested on the Cover sheet of the FDDT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pediatrician's details of the patient's physical examination, anthropometrics and&#xD;
           calculations (weight and length or height percentiles and mid parental height). A prompt&#xD;
           for these data is available in the FDDT. The patient's name will blacked out and a study&#xD;
           subject number will be inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data on the acceptance of the FDDT will be obtained from the office staff, the&#xD;
           pediatricians, and the patients' parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diagnosis reached by the first feeding specialist (CPNP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diagnosis reached by the second feeding specialist (Psychiatrist)&#xD;
