    <textblock>
      This is a prospective trial to investigate optimal timing of care for vaginal pessaries. A&#xD;
      vaginal pessary is a silicone device that is placed in the vagina to support the pelvic&#xD;
      organs of a woman who has pelvic organ prolapse. Some women are willing and able to remove&#xD;
      their own pessary on a regular basis. In women who are either unwilling or unable to remove&#xD;
      their own pessary, complete pessary care is provided in the urogynecology office. Complete&#xD;
      pessary care involves regular removal and cleaning of the pessary with a vaginal examination.&#xD;
      In our practice, the investigators typically remove vaginal pessaries and examine the vagina&#xD;
      every 3 months in patients for whom the investigators provide complete pessary care. Interval&#xD;
      of pessary removal varies widely between practitioners. In the literature, removal intervals&#xD;
      vary from weekly to yearly. In this study, the investigators will randomize participants to&#xD;
      pessary care with removal every 12 weeks or every 24 weeks.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded trial of office-based pessary care. The&#xD;
      primary outcome of this study is vaginal epithelial abnormalities, including granulation&#xD;
      tissue and ulceration. Secondary outcomes include participant satisfaction, degree of bother&#xD;
      due to vaginal discharge, number of unscheduled visits and progression of pelvic organ&#xD;
      prolapse quantification score (POPQS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (visit 1; see &quot;Visit Schedule&quot;, below), women who have consented to participate&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1 to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. routine group: pessary care with removal and cleaning every 12 ± 2 weeks, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. extended group: pessary care with removal and cleaning every 24 ± 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed using a randomization scheme available through Excel. Each&#xD;
      consecutive/sequential participant will be assigned to whichever group corresponds to that&#xD;
      sequential study entry number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, the pessary will be removed and cleaned and a vaginal examination will be&#xD;
      performed at every visit regardless of complaints. The only difference will be frequency of&#xD;
      visits. All pelvic examinations will be performed by the same individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted for approximately one year, with additional time for analysis and&#xD;
      preparation of abstract(s) and manuscript(s). Subjects' participation will consist of five&#xD;
      visits in the routine group, three visits in the extended group. Consent to study&#xD;
      participation will be obtained at the first visit. Visit schedule is shown below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit Schedule Routine Group Visit #1, initial visit (week 0), procedures: Consent to&#xD;
      participate, Collect Demographics, Pelvic examination /pessary removal Consent to participate&#xD;
      Visit #2, interim visit (week 12 ± 2), procedures: Interview, Pelvic examination /pessary&#xD;
      removal Visit #3, interim visit (week 24 ± 2), procedures: Interview, Pelvic examination&#xD;
      /pessary removal Visit #4, interim visit (week 36 ± 2), procedures: Interview, Pelvic&#xD;
      examination /pessary removal Visit #5, final visit (week 48 ± 2), procedures: Interview,&#xD;
      Pelvic examination /pessary removal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended Group Visit #1, initial visit (week 0), procedures: Consent to participate, Collect&#xD;
      Demographics, Pelvic examination /pessary removal Consent to participate Visit #2, interim&#xD;
      visit (week 24 ± 2), procedures: Interview, Pelvic examination /pessary removal Visit #3,&#xD;
      final visit (week 48 ± 2), procedures: Interview, Pelvic examination /pessary removal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are approaching the upper bound of their visit window will be reminded of&#xD;
      the need for a visit. Those who still present outside of the window for the interim visit&#xD;
      will be scheduled their next appointment as it would have been scheduled if they had&#xD;
      presented for the visit at the correct time. Any such cases will be noted in the analysis and&#xD;
      a protocol deviation form will be completed and sent to IRB. Any participant who misses three&#xD;
      visits within the scheduled window will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent to study participation will occur at visit #1, a vaginal examination will be&#xD;
      performed to document a pelvic organ prolapse quantification score8 (POPQS) and to exclude&#xD;
      the presence of vaginal epithelial abnormalities (granulation tissue, erosion), or fistula&#xD;
      and to note the presence of vaginal adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data will be collected at the initial visit: age, body mass index (BMI), smoking&#xD;
      status, history of diabetes mellitus, history of surgery for incontinence or pelvic organ&#xD;
      prolapse, history of hysterectomy, indication for pessary use, pessary size and type,&#xD;
      duration of pessary use of the current pessary and in total if the participant has used other&#xD;
      pessaries in the past, whether the participant has an intimate partner, use of aspirin (ASA)&#xD;
      and dose, use of anticoagulation therapy, parity, bother from vaginal discharge, presence of&#xD;
      vaginal bleeding, and history of vaginal epithelial abnormalities. The investigators also&#xD;
      will document if the participant is using hormone replacement (HRT). If the participant is&#xD;
      using HRT, the investigators will document medication, dose, route and frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 48 ± 2 weeks. At interim visits, data will be assessed for&#xD;
      updates:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Has the participant started new medications (ASA, anticoagulation, HRT)? Is the subject&#xD;
      bothered by vaginal discharge? Is vaginal bleeding present?&#xD;
&#xD;
      At interim visits, when a pessary is removed, a vaginal examination will be performed to&#xD;
      evaluate for the presence of vaginal epithelial abnormalities and vaginal adhesions. When&#xD;
      abnormalities are noted, they will be described in appearance, location, number, and size.&#xD;
      Additionally, abnormalities will be staged using the following system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage Description&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Epithelial erythemya without epithelial breaks or presence of granulation tissue ≤1cm in&#xD;
           size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Epithelial break or erosion ≤ 0.5 cm in diameter or presence of granulation tissue &gt;1cm&#xD;
           in size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Epithelial break or erosion 1-2cm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Epithelial break or erosion &gt; 2 cm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is more than one epithelial abnormality noted, each will each be assigned a stage.&#xD;
      The highest stage abnormality will determine the overall stage of the epithelial abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is a change in pessary type or size, this will be documented. If the pessary is&#xD;
      changed to a type other than ring or gellhorn, the participant will continue in the study as&#xD;
      scheduled. If a pessary is removed and left out of the vagina, this will be documented. At&#xD;
      the final visit, all participants will undergo a pelvic examination with pessary removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on forms designed according to study group (routine/extended) and&#xD;
      visit number. In the case that a participant has a pessary complaint and requires evaluation&#xD;
      in the office outside of the scheduled visits according to their group allocation, an&#xD;
      unscheduled visit form will be used to collect data at this visit. At an unscheduled visit,&#xD;
      the same data will be collected as is collected at a scheduled follow-up visit. Additionally,&#xD;
      the participant's complaint/visit reason will be described.&#xD;
