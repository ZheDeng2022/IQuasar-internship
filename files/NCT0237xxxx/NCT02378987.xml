      The aims of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to investigate the difference in motor speech functions among children with cerebral&#xD;
           palsy (CP) of different motor severities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate the longitudinal in motor speech functions at 6 months follow-up phase&#xD;
           among children with CP of different motor severities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the correlation between motor severity, personal factors, family factors, language&#xD;
           ability and motor speech in children with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to identify the variables that can predict motor speech functions in children with CP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mental impairment, language and speech disorders are the common associated problems in&#xD;
      children with CP. Previous studies focus on language and motor speech dysfunctions in&#xD;
      children with CP at school-age child, adolescents and adults. Few literatures identify the&#xD;
      determinants for predicted the motor speech performance in these children. It is important&#xD;
      issue to follow-up the language and motor speech functions in children with CP. These data&#xD;
      will provide clinicians for outcome prediction and goal setting.The aims of this study: (1)&#xD;
      to investigate the difference in motor speech functions among children with CP of different&#xD;
      motor severities, and(2) to investigate the longitudinal in motor speech functions at 6&#xD;
      months follow-up phase among children with CP of different motor severities, and(3) the&#xD;
      correlation between motor severity, personal factors, family factors, language ability and&#xD;
      motor speech in children with CP, and(4) to identify the variables that can predict motor&#xD;
      speech functions in children with CP.&#xD;
