      The aim of the study is to evaluate the predictors of success of oral dissolution therapy in&#xD;
      radiolucent renal stones in a large series of patients from a tertiary referral center in&#xD;
      order to define the optimum case scenarios where oral dissolution therapy could be&#xD;
      implemented.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with renal stones, seen through the outpatient clinic in the urology department or&#xD;
      post primary intervention for renal stones, will be assessed to see if the patient satisfies&#xD;
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients who are meeting these criteria will be asked&#xD;
      to participate in this prospective study. If they agree, they will be asked to sign an&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline patients' assessment will include;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full history taking including&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Previous stone history regarding presentation and management&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Previous trial oral dissolution therapy for renal stones and their compliance to&#xD;
                the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Previous GIT surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of chronic medical or metabolic illness e.g; DM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination including&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory investigations including;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine analysis (urine PH)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  24 hours urine testing for uric acid and citrate&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine culture&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Random blood sugar (RBS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum uric acid&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum calcium, phosphorus and magnesium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial radiological evaluation will include&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Renal ultrasonography (US)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Plain X-rays to exclude the presence of calcification in the targeted stone.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Non Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) on the abdomen and pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MAG3 diuretic renogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      (All NCCT studies will be performed with multislice helical CT scanners, NCCT images will be&#xD;
      obtained from above the kidneys through the bladder base. For each renal stone, its location&#xD;
      will be recorded, its size will be measured using the largest dimension from length (L),&#xD;
      width (W) and height (H) on axial and coronal reformat images. Its mean density will be&#xD;
      recorded by measurement using region of interest just smaller than the stone. Associated&#xD;
      hydronephrosis proximal to the stone will be also evaluated (Nakada et al 2000).)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will receive the allocated instructions and medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' follow up (The aim at follow up is to monitor the urinary PH with adjustment of the&#xD;
      dose of potassium citrate and also to assess the compliance of the patients regarding the&#xD;
      dietary recommendations and the medications)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - the most important parameter will be assessed is the urinary PH every two weeks. The&#xD;
           target urinary PH should be kept between6.5 to 7.0, the dose of potassium citrate should&#xD;
           be adjusted to achieve this value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' compliance to medications intake and the instruction of fluid intake and&#xD;
           dietary modification.&#xD;

    <measure>The primary endpoint of this study will be change in stone surface area after 3 months of the determined protocol</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of medical treatment which is specified to be 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The stone surface area will be measured using the formula; Surface area = length X width X 0.25 X (22/7) Comparison of the stone surface area in relation to the initial surface area will be done.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of the predictors of response (more than 50% reduction in the surface area of the stone) to medical treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of medical treatment which is specified to be 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The percent reduction of stone surface area will be calculated using the formula:&#xD;
Surface area = length X width X 0.25 X (22/7)&#xD;
Categorization of the patients into three groups will be done:&#xD;
Patients who achieved 50% or more reduction in the stone surface area will be considered responsive and would be counseled for another 3 months therapy.&#xD;
Patients with partial response, less than 50% reduction in stone surface area will be counseled for auxiliary procedure based on stone criteria e.g. ESWL.&#xD;
Patients with no response/ serious renal infections or serious treatment adverse effects will be considered for other interventional treatment modalities.&#xD;
In the responders groups, factors predicting the success of treatment will be determined</description>
