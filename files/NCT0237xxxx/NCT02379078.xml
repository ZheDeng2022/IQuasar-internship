    <textblock>
      Diabetes care is complicated for people with diabetes as well as for health care providers:&#xD;
      they have to watch their diet, exercise, take medications, checking blood sugars and blood&#xD;
      pressure, get tests and see multiple doctors. On top of that, many with diabetes have other&#xD;
      health problems, such as high blood pressure or arthritis, that make care even more&#xD;
      complicated. Guidelines for improving the care of people with diabetes try to help by&#xD;
      summarizing the best practices for care, but because diabetes care is so complicated, it is&#xD;
      hard for them to be put into practice. One solution to this is a tool that can help people&#xD;
      with diabetes set health care goals that are important to them, and participate actively in&#xD;
      decisions about their own health care, together with health care providers. This tool would&#xD;
      have an information booklet for patients with facts that can help them make a decision, a&#xD;
      worksheet to help spell out what their goals are and how they want to get there, and a&#xD;
      cheat-sheet for health care providers that gives them tips on how to do this. The purpose of&#xD;
      this project is to find out if a tool like this would be helpful, how to make it more helpful&#xD;
      and usable, and what the best way would be to make sure that people use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interprofessional (IP) shared decision-making (SDM) and goal-setting tool kit, including a&#xD;
      1-page provider enabler, a point-of-care worksheet and a patient workbook, can be implemented&#xD;
      successfully in clinical practice and will reduce decisional conflict and diabetes distress&#xD;
      and improve chronic care delivery and quality of life in patients with type 1 or type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and 2 other comorbid chronic diseases. The investigators hypothesize that patients&#xD;
      in the intervention arm of the study will have reduced decisional conflict and diabetes&#xD;
      distress, and improved decision-making satisfaction, chronic care delivery and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is prevalent and results in major morbidity. Care of the patient with diabetes is&#xD;
      complex and often occurs in the context of other chronic illness; this multimorbidity&#xD;
      negatively impacts morbidity and mortality. The Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) Clinical&#xD;
      Practice Guidelines (CPG) are a rigorously developed knowledge tool that comprehensively&#xD;
      address all aspects of diabetes care, conforming to AGREE II standards for guideline&#xD;
      development. However, guideline adherence in the patient with multimorbidity is challenging&#xD;
      both for the provider and the patient, who are overwhelmed by numerous, often conflicting&#xD;
      recommendations. An individualized approach to the multimorbid diabetic patient using shared&#xD;
      decision-making (SDM) and goal setting may overcome challenges to guideline adherence;&#xD;
      however these strategies have not been taken up extensively in clinical practice. Barriers to&#xD;
      uptake can be overcome by incorporating SDM into the context of interprofessional care: in&#xD;
      diabetes care, role expansion, active participation by more than one discipline and adding&#xD;
      additional team members have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes. While SDM and&#xD;
      decision aids have typically focused on one issue, the precedent and potential exists for&#xD;
      their use in the translation of the CDA CPG into practice through the prioritization of&#xD;
      complex guideline recommendations. Given the growing prevalence of diabetes and&#xD;
      multimorbidity in Canada, effectively bridging the knowledge to practice gap in this area has&#xD;
      the potential to significantly improve patient-important outcomes, health care delivery and&#xD;
      system sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To enhance the implementation of a complex guidelines document (CDA 2013 CPG) by&#xD;
           assisting in prioritizing care for patients with diabetes and multiple other&#xD;
           comorbidities through the use of a diabetes-focused SDM intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To systematically develop, test and pilot a SDM and goal-setting intervention following&#xD;
           the United Kingdom Medical Research Council and Knowledge to Action Frameworks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To build a team consisting of members of the research community, patients, health care&#xD;
           providers, CDA, and Local Health Integration Networks of the Ministry of Health and&#xD;
           Long-Term Care, in order to increase the relevance of research conducted and enable&#xD;
           dissemination of these research results into practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis An interprofessional SDM and goal-setting tool kit, including a 1-page provider&#xD;
      enabler, a point-of-care worksheet and a patient workbook, can be implemented successfully in&#xD;
      clinical practice and will reduce decisional conflict and diabetes distress and improve&#xD;
      chronic care delivery and quality of life in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and 2&#xD;
      other comorbid chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan Development, testing and refinement: An evidence-based multi-component SDM&#xD;
      intervention will be developed, framed by the Interprofessional SDM Model and based on user&#xD;
      input from individual interviews regarding feasibility, acceptability and mediators of use.&#xD;
      Usability testing will be done using cognitive task analysis to assess paths users take to&#xD;
      accomplish tasks, errors made, when and where they encountered confusion or frustration,&#xD;
      degree of satisfaction and quality of decision support. Based on feedback received, the tool&#xD;
      will be refined through several iterative cycles of feedback and redesign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot trial: The tool kit will be piloted in a two-step parallel clustered randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) whose primary purpose is to assess intervention fidelity and to test&#xD;
      the feasibility of conducting a larger RCT. The first step will be a provider-directed phase;&#xD;
      the second step (which will occur 6 months later) will be a provider- and patient-directed&#xD;
      phase. A secondary purpose of this study is to estimate the impact of the decision aid on&#xD;
      decisional conflict; secondary outcomes include diabetes distress, chronic illness care and&#xD;
      quality of life, assessed by patient-completed questionnaires of validated scales at&#xD;
      baseline, 6 and 12 months. Analysis will be done by intention to treat. Multilevel&#xD;
      hierarchical regression models will be used to account for the clustered nature of the data.&#xD;

    <measure>Decisional Conflict in Patients With Diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome is measured at 0, 6 and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional conflict was chosen to allow us to assess the impact of our decision aid on the quality of the decision-making process, an important first measure of the effectiveness of a decision aid and the shared decision making process. This outcome is assessed by the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), a well-validated, patient-completed measure. DCS consists of 16 items, with 5 subscales (informed, values clarity, support, uncertainty, and effective decision) and an overall summary score. IT is scored on a 5-item Likert scale ranging from '0- strongly agree' to '4- strongly disagree'. It's minimum total score is 0 and it's maximum total score is 100. The higher the score, the worse the outcome. The lower the score, the better the outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient With Diabetes' Assessment of Their Chronic Illness Care</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome is measured at 0, 6 and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome was selected because it is a direct measure of knowledge use by patients that will allow us to better understand mediating variables of knowledge use such as patient activation, goal-setting, problem-solving, and decision support.&#xD;
This outcome is assessed by the Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions (PACIC), a well-validated patient-completed questionnaire. PACIC includes 20 items, scored on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from '1 - None of the time' to '5 - Always'. PACIC consists of 5 sub-scales (patient activation, delivery system design, goal setting, problem solving, and follow-up/coordination) and an overall summary score. The minimum total score is 0 and the maximum total score is 50. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Distress in Patients With Diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome is measured at 0, 6 and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome was selected because it is a direct measure of knowledge use by patients that will allow us to better understand mediating variables of knowledge use such as patient activation, goal-setting, problem-solving, and decision support.&#xD;
This outcome is assessed by the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS), a well-validated, patient-completed questionnaire. The DDS is a 17-item scale with 4 subscales (emotional burden, regimen distress, interpersonal distress and physician distress) with an overall summary score. It is scored on a 6-point Likert scale, ranging from '1 - no problem' to '6 - serious problem'. It's minimum total score is 0 and it's maximum total score is 6. The higher the score, the worse the outcome. The lower the score, the better the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life in Patients With Diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome is measured at 0, 6 and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was selected to inform future sample size calculations, as more holistic and patient-centred measure of knowledge use that uniquely acknowledges patient prioritization of health care goals.&#xD;
This outcome is assessed by the Short Form 12 (SF-12), a well-validated, patient-completed questionnaire. The SF-12 consists of 12 items (minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 100; the higher the score, the better the quality of life.)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intention to Engage in Shared Decision-making in Health Care Providers</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome is measured at 0, 6 and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is assessed by the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Reaction Questionnaire, a theory-based instrument to assess the impact of continuing professional development on clinical behavioral intentions. This outcome was selected to assess provider's intention to engage in shared decision-making, as a potential facilitator or barrier to shared decision-making. The CPD Reaction Questionnaire consists of 12 items with 5 subscales (intention, social influence, beliefs about capabilities, moral norm, and beliefs about consequences) and is scored on a 7-point Likert scale. It's minimum score is 1 and it's maximum score is 7. The higher the score, the better the outcome.</description>

        <title>Decisional Conflict in Patients With Diabetes</title>
        <description>Decisional conflict was chosen to allow us to assess the impact of our decision aid on the quality of the decision-making process, an important first measure of the effectiveness of a decision aid and the shared decision making process. This outcome is assessed by the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), a well-validated, patient-completed measure. DCS consists of 16 items, with 5 subscales (informed, values clarity, support, uncertainty, and effective decision) and an overall summary score. IT is scored on a 5-item Likert scale ranging from '0- strongly agree' to '4- strongly disagree'. It's minimum total score is 0 and it's maximum total score is 100. The higher the score, the worse the outcome. The lower the score, the better the outcome.</description>

        <description>This outcome was selected because it is a direct measure of knowledge use by patients that will allow us to better understand mediating variables of knowledge use such as patient activation, goal-setting, problem-solving, and decision support.&#xD;
This outcome is assessed by the Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions (PACIC), a well-validated patient-completed questionnaire. PACIC includes 20 items, scored on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from '1 - None of the time' to '5 - Always'. PACIC consists of 5 sub-scales (patient activation, delivery system design, goal setting, problem solving, and follow-up/coordination) and an overall summary score. The minimum total score is 0 and the maximum total score is 50. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

        <description>This outcome is assessed by the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Reaction Questionnaire, a theory-based instrument to assess the impact of continuing professional development on clinical behavioral intentions. This outcome was selected to assess provider's intention to engage in shared decision-making, as a potential facilitator or barrier to shared decision-making. The CPD Reaction Questionnaire consists of 12 items with 5 subscales (intention, social influence, beliefs about capabilities, moral norm, and beliefs about consequences) and is scored on a 7-point Likert scale. It's minimum score is 1 and it's maximum score is 7. The higher the score, the better the outcome.</description>

          <description>This outcome is assessed by the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Reaction Questionnaire, a theory-based instrument to assess the impact of continuing professional development on clinical behavioral intentions. This outcome was selected to assess provider's intention to engage in shared decision-making, as a potential facilitator or barrier to shared decision-making. The CPD Reaction Questionnaire consists of 12 items with 5 subscales (intention, social influence, beliefs about capabilities, moral norm, and beliefs about consequences) and is scored on a 7-point Likert scale. It's minimum score is 1 and it's maximum score is 7. The higher the score, the better the outcome.</description>
