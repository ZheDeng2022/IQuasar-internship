  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The loss of muscle mass with aging is associated with a dysregulation of muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis (MPS) that is generally characterized by a suppressed MPS response to protein&#xD;
      ingestion. This 'anabolic resistance' to protein feeding can be overcome with the ingestion&#xD;
      of larger protein servings (~0.4g/kg/meal, equivalent to ~ 30 - 40g/meal); however, older&#xD;
      adults would likely find it challenging to consume such quantities of protein on a per meal&#xD;
      basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amino acid leucine has a unique role as a key 'activator' of MPS. Some research shows&#xD;
      that increasing the leucine content of a suboptimal dose of a protein supplement can enhance&#xD;
      the MPS response in older adults. However it is currently unknown whether the co-ingestion of&#xD;
      leucine with normal, mixed meals can increase MPS. Furthermore, it has been suggested that&#xD;
      leucine supplementation may only benefit older adults consuming suboptimal daily protein&#xD;
      intakes. Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to examine the impact of leucine&#xD;
      co-ingestion with mixed macronutrient meals on the myofibrillar protein synthetic response in&#xD;
      older men consuming daily protein intakes at or below the current recommendations. A further&#xD;
      objective is to determine whether the myofibrillar protein synthetic response to a session of&#xD;
      resistance exercise is enhanced by leucine supplementation with meals. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that, in both the exercised and non-exercised condition, leucine co-ingestion at&#xD;
      meals will enhance integrative myofibrillar protein synthesis in older adults consuming lower&#xD;
      daily protein intakes, but will not augment MPS in those consuming higher daily protein. The&#xD;
      investigators further hypothesize that the influence of leucine supplementation on MPS will&#xD;
      be greater in the exercise condition than the non-exercise condition.&#xD;

      At baseline, participants will be asked to wear a pedometer and to complete a physical&#xD;
      activity and a weighed food record for 3 days. Resting energy expenditure (indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry), body weight and body composition (DEXA) will be assessed in the fasted state. A&#xD;
      strength test will be conducted to determine 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) and the maximum load&#xD;
      that each participant can lift for 15 - 24 repetitions using a seated leg extension machine.&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomized to one of two groups matched for age, activity level and&#xD;
      BMI: higher (1.2 g/kg/d) or lower daily protein (0.8 g/kg/d). Participants will then commence&#xD;
      a 9 day controlled diet (day -3 to 6) designed to meet energy requirements for weight&#xD;
      maintenance and to provide a daily protein intake according to each participant's group&#xD;
      allocation (i.e. 0.8 or 1.2 g/kg/d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be provided with flavored, supplemental beverages (Infinit Nutrition,&#xD;
      Windsor, Ontario) and will be instructed to consume one beverage half way through each meal&#xD;
      from day 0 - 5. Individual servings of the supplement will be packaged into a ziplocked pouch&#xD;
      by Infinit Nutrition in power form. Participants will be required to add water to the power&#xD;
      at home. During day 0 - 2 (unsupplemented period) the beverage will be a placebo&#xD;
      (maltodextrin and sucrose), and during day 3 - 5 (leucine supplementation period) the&#xD;
      beverage will contain crystalline leucine (5 g) with sucrose for flavour. The beverages will&#xD;
      be provided in a single-blind manner, energy-matched and will be similar in odour, color, and&#xD;
      taste. Participants will also be blinded to their group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aminoacidemia, insulinemia and glycaemia will be determined in response to breakfast, lunch&#xD;
      and dinner ingestion during the unsupplemented (day 2) and leucine supplemented (day 5)&#xD;
      periods. During each of these blood sampling trials blood samples will be obtained&#xD;
      immediately before and 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 min following the ingestion of each meal&#xD;
      (total of 25 x 4ml blood samples per participant per trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrative MPS will be measured in the exercised and non-exercised leg over the&#xD;
      unsupplemented (day 0 - 3) period and leucine supplemented (day 3 - 6) period using orally&#xD;
      ingested deuterated water (D20) and muscle biopsies obtained from the vastus lateralis on&#xD;
      days 0, 3 and 6. Participants will report to the laboratory in the fasted state on day 0 and,&#xD;
      following a muscle biopsy from the vastus lateralis and saliva sample, participants will&#xD;
      consume a single 100 ml oral bolus of D20 at approximately 0900. Immediately following the&#xD;
      D20 bolus participants will perform a bout of unilateral leg extension exercise (3 sets to&#xD;
      volitional failure at the maximum load they can lift for 15-24 repetitions (~40-50% 1-RM)).&#xD;
      On day 3 participants will perform an identical resistance exercise session with the&#xD;
      exception that repetitions will be clamped at the number achieved on day 0. Following both&#xD;
      exercise sessions participants will consume their individualized breakfast (with the placebo&#xD;
      beverage on day 0 and with the leucine beverage on day 3) in the laboratory before returning&#xD;
      home. Bilateral muscle biopsies will be obtained prior to the exercise on day 3 (end of&#xD;
      unsupplemented period) and on day 6 (end of leucine supplemented period). Total body water&#xD;
      deuterium enrichment can be used as a surrogate for plasma alanine labelling and will be&#xD;
      determined from saliva swabs collected by the participant every morning at 0900. Participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to not eat or drink anything for 30 min before saliva sampling and samples&#xD;
      will be stored in the participant's freezer before their next visit to the laboratory.&#xD;
