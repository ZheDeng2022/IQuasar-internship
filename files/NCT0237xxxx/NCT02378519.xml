      Purpose The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of a the multimodal treatment with a&#xD;
      web-based self-help program with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) coaching and individual&#xD;
      tailored physiotherapy on workability, health behavior and pain symptoms for persons with&#xD;
      persistent pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design In this study, we will apply a Single Subject Experimental Design (SSED) with a six&#xD;
      week baseline phase, a 16 week intervention phase and a six week follow-up phase after twelve&#xD;
      month. Outcome measurements will be performed regularly during all phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Approximately 12 participants, fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons, with persistent or recurrent pain from the neck-shoulder or back, with a duration&#xD;
      for at least three months, aged 18-63 years, scoring ≥ 90 on Linton´s questionnaire,&#xD;
      indicating risk for continuous sick leave and development of persistent pain, who are&#xD;
      disposable for labor market at least 25% are eligible for the study. The participants have to&#xD;
      be fluent in the Swedish language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with dementia and/or restricted cognitive functioning. Persons with depression&#xD;
      and/or anxiety. The latter will be screened with the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale&#xD;
      questionnaire. Terminally ill patients, comorbidity which might prevent treatment&#xD;
      participation and ongoing causal treatment, identified drug abuse, retirement pension and&#xD;
      ongoing pregnancy, patients lacking internet attached computers in their home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The Ethical application has been from the Regional Ethical Review&#xD;
      Board in Umeå.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure The study will be conducted in collaboration with a local physiotherapy unit in&#xD;
      primary health care. We will actively recruit participants by advertising in local media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through advertisements in local media. Each person answering&#xD;
      the advert will get in contact with one of the researchers, who will give initial information&#xD;
      of the study and then make an appointment for screening and assessment of whether the person&#xD;
      is equivalent to the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria. Written information and&#xD;
      written consent will be obtained for each participant included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The participants included in the study are randomized to one of two groups. The&#xD;
      study begins with one group starting a baseline phase of 8 weeks where they are introduced&#xD;
      into the web-based self-help program while the other group has a baseline phase of 6 weeks&#xD;
      without any intervention. During the baseline phase, each participant answers a questionnaire&#xD;
      with the outcome variables once /week. This is provided by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of a web-based self-help program with cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      coaching in combination with individually tailored physiotherapy according to the person's&#xD;
      needs for 16 weeks. All participants will receive an interactive web-based self-help pain&#xD;
      program with coaching using CBT-principles individual coaching will be provided.One of the&#xD;
      researchers will introduce each participant in the web-program. . A trained CBT-coach will be&#xD;
      responsible for the coaching process during the intervention. The physiotherapy treatment is&#xD;
      delivered at the physiotherapy unit, individualized for each patient, multimodal where&#xD;
      treatment frequency and duration depends on the patient's needs. Initially in the&#xD;
      intervention, each patient meets with the physiotherapist and the CBT-coach to synchronize&#xD;
      the rehabilitation process according to the patient's needs and goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The web-based program The web-based program is based on CBT-principles, initially established&#xD;
      by Livanda then further developed by Norrbotten County Council and Luleå University of&#xD;
      Technology for a ongoing REHSAM II-project. The web-program consists of eight modules&#xD;
      comprising; pain mechanism, activity balance and health, physical activity and ergonomics,&#xD;
      emotions/ thoughts and behavior, stress and self-esteem, sleep, communication and conflicts,&#xD;
      problem solving and planning future. The web-program includes informative texts, interactive&#xD;
      media with questions for reflection and exercises to perform. As an example will each patient&#xD;
      make their own activity plan and also reflect on priorities in life. The program also&#xD;
      consists of instructional videos on for example ergonomics and relaxation exercises. The&#xD;
      patient has the opportunities to play an active role in the web-program, as well as in the&#xD;
      interaction with the CBT-coach. The aim of the program is to increase the patient's knowledge&#xD;
      and understanding, supplying tools for coping in life-situation to increase health and&#xD;
      work-ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coaching process Within the program each participant formulates goals according to&#xD;
      his/her individual pain rehabilitation needs in contact with the coach. The stepwise coaching&#xD;
      process aims to fulfill each patient's individually formulated goals. The CBT-coach has a&#xD;
      supportive role to guide the patient through the program and the rehabilitation using&#xD;
      CBT-principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables Primary outcome variables measured once a week during all the phases of the&#xD;
      single subject experimental phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-perceived workability. This will be assessed by using the self-rated questionnaire Work&#xD;
      Ability Index. By complementing outcome variables as Days of sick leave/activity compensation&#xD;
      with Work Ability Index we will minimize the risk of a type II-error due to local labor&#xD;
      market conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain intensity. Average pain intensity during last 7 days in the musculoskeletal system will&#xD;
      be measured by a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-efficacy in relation to pain will be measured by Arthritis Self-efficacy scale (ASES:S);&#xD;
      perceived capacity in relation to pain and perceived capacity in relation to other symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the association of pain-related fear and self-reported occupational disability,&#xD;
      kinesiophobia in relation to pain will be measured by the Swedish version of Tampa Scale of&#xD;
      Kinesiophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health related quality of life. The Swedish version of RAND-36 will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) will be used to identify and measure&#xD;
      activities rated important for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses The design implies the study of a clinical progress in a controlled experimental&#xD;
      manipulation by very frequent measurements of several outcome variables in a small sample of&#xD;
      participants during a pre-intervention phase, an intervention phase and during an&#xD;
      intervention withdrawal phase. 6 months after the intervention phase. The participants&#xD;
      thereby act as their own controls and are seen as single systems in the analyses. The&#xD;
      analyses focus on changes in levels, trends and variability in the outcome variables that can&#xD;
      be attributed to the introduction of the intervention. Line graphs are used to describe the&#xD;
      progress of the variables during the study phases for each of the participants, and visual&#xD;
      analyses are enhanced by calculation of celeration lines and variability bands. The design&#xD;
      cannot produce direct statistical inference, but it has the power to describe a clinical&#xD;
      progress in detail in several individuals. Similarities between individuals will imply a&#xD;
      certain transferability of results. The merits of this design as an additional tool to&#xD;
      traditional group designs in the development of evidence based practice are described in a&#xD;
      recent review.The design also allows for complementary analyses regarding for instance&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative data on the implementation of the intervention, experiences of&#xD;
      the intervention from participants and therapists, costs, etc. This, together with analyses&#xD;
      of outcome variables, can provide valuable knowledge regarding implementation in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the SSED design data will be analyzed on an individual level. For each participant,&#xD;
      line graphs will display how outcome variables change along the measurement occasions&#xD;
      throughout baseline and intervention phases. Analyses will be made as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A visual analysis of whether changes in level and changes in slope of the outcome&#xD;
           variable could be attributed to the introduction of the intervention. These analyses are&#xD;
           complemented by the following calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Calculation of +/-2SD bands for mean value of baseline phase. This is used in order to&#xD;
           determine whether changes in level during (the later part of) the intervention phase&#xD;
           could be seen as statistically significant when considering the variation during the&#xD;
           baseline phase. This can be made either by determining if the mean value of the (later&#xD;
           part of) the intervention phase is not within the +/- 2SD band, or by checking that at&#xD;
           least 3 individual measurements in the intervention phase are outside the band.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Calculation of celeration lines. This is made to complement the analysis of change in&#xD;
           trend (slope) of the outcome values throughout the phases. For each of the baseline and&#xD;
           intervention phases, celeration lines are drawn between the median values for the first&#xD;
           and second half of each phase and extended throughout the phase. The slopes of the lines&#xD;
           are compared as to whether they differ substantially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complementary data Complementary data that will be collected within the project are activity&#xD;
      logs from the web-based program (both participants and coach); number of coaching sessions&#xD;
      and number of physiotherapy sessions. In addition, qualitative data from interviews with&#xD;
      participants, coach and physiotherapists regarding e.g. experiences of process and results of&#xD;
      the intervention will be collected.&#xD;
