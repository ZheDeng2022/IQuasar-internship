      A new prophylactic posaconazole dosing regimen of 120mg/m² tid is evaluated pharmacologically&#xD;
      in children 13 years and younger, suffering from a hematologic malignancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal infections (IFI), especially candidiasis and aspergillosis, are a serious&#xD;
      threat to immunocompromised pediatric patients. Because diagnosis of IFI in pediatric&#xD;
      patients is difficult, due to the lack of specific clinical and radiological signs and the&#xD;
      low sensitivity of blood cultures, antifungal prophylaxis would largely optimize management&#xD;
      of IFI in this setting. However, antifungal prophylaxis remains a matter of debate, as no&#xD;
      clear consensus has yet been reached about the optimal drug. Very limited pediatric data are&#xD;
      available, and current guidelines are mainly based on extrapolation of adult data.&#xD;
      Fluconazole remains the drug of choice in many centers, despite its non-mould active&#xD;
      spectrum. Itraconazole, liposomal amphotericin B and nebulized lipid-formulations of&#xD;
      amphotericin B are often used off-label, although neither their pharmacokinetics (PK), nor&#xD;
      their efficacy and safety have been documented in a proper way. Voriconazole is registered&#xD;
      for children older than 2 years of age, mainly in the treatment setting. Moreover, its&#xD;
      extremely variable PK profile, uncertainty about adequate exposure and risk for&#xD;
      hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity do not favor the use of voriconazole in this setting.&#xD;
      Finally, micafungin only has low recommendation in the prophylactic setting, due to the&#xD;
      possible risk of liver tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posaconazole would be the ideal antifungal drug to be used prophylactically in children for&#xD;
      many reasons. It has a broad spectrum of activity, including emerging moulds like Aspergillus&#xD;
      spp. and Zygomycetes. It has shown to be superior over fluconazole and itraconazole in&#xD;
      preventing IFI in adults and it has a favorable safety profile, with nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      being the most frequently encountered adverse events. However, lack of pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      data in children younger than 13 years of age, results in only a marginal recommendation in&#xD;
      current guidelines [8]. Little information is available about the correct dosing regimen of&#xD;
      the available oral suspension in young pediatric patients, and similar to what is observed in&#xD;
      adults, often very low posaconazole plasma concentrations (PPCs) are being measured.&#xD;
      Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended to reach adequate PPCs above&#xD;
      0.5mg/L or 0.7 mg/L followed by increasing the dose as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the pharmacokinetics of a newly introduced dosing regimen for posaconazole&#xD;
      oral suspension is investigated, based on body surface area (BSA), used prophylactically in&#xD;
      immunocompromised children under the age of 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric patients, admitted to the hospital to receive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation are treated prophylactically with posaconazole 120mg/m² tid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At steady state (after at least 7 days of posaconazole treatment), 9 plasma samples are&#xD;
      collected in these patients to calculate the area under the curve and other relevant PK&#xD;
      parameters as maximum and minimal plasma concentrations, volume of distribution, halflife and&#xD;
      clearance rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, these results will be compared to adult data in literature to evaluate whether&#xD;
      120mg/m² tid an adequate dosing regimen in children.&#xD;

    <description>Patients receiving posaconazole prophylactically are closely monitored for the presence of an invasive fungal infection.
