    <textblock>
      Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) is a liver disease that predominantly affects females, can&#xD;
      present for the first time at any age and which develops over many years. It is caused by the&#xD;
      immune system attacking the body's own tissues. People with PBC frequently experience&#xD;
      profound fatigue or tiredness which they liken to their &quot;batteries running down&quot; and although&#xD;
      people still want to undertake normal activities they often lack the energy to be able to do&#xD;
      them. This reduces quality of life, makes it difficult for people to work and can end up with&#xD;
      them becoming isolated in the community. At present the investigators have no treatment for&#xD;
      fatigue in PBC. Finding a treatment for fatigue in PBC is one of the highest research&#xD;
      priorities identified by patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to undertake a clinical trial to examine the effects of a treatment&#xD;
      (&quot;Rituximab&quot;) on severe fatigue in PBC to help us understand whether this will be a&#xD;
      potentially useful treatment. The information that this will give us about how energy&#xD;
      generation changes in patients with PBC with and without the treatment will also help us to&#xD;
      develop new treatments for fatigue in other diseases. The study has the potential to improve&#xD;
      the quality of life of many patients with PBC, for whom there is currently no hope of&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a randomised controlled study of Rituximab therapy in PBC&#xD;
      compared to placebo (1:1 ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in a specialised clinical research environment at Clinical&#xD;
      Research Facility Royal Victoria Infirmary. The investigators have, for many years, worked&#xD;
      closely with PBC patient groups to focus on the problems that are important to our patients.&#xD;
      This study is fully supported by Liver North, a liver disease charity and patient support&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place over one year and will involve between 9 and 20 visits although a&#xD;
      number of these will be telephone visits. Blood tests and quality of life questionnaires will&#xD;
      be performed at the start of the study and after three, six, nine and twelve months. At&#xD;
      baseline and 12 weeks follow up physical activity will be monitored using monitors, and an&#xD;
      exercise test and MRI scan will be performed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) is a liver disease that predominantly affects females, can&#xD;
      present for the first time at any age, and which develops over many years. It is caused by&#xD;
      the immune system attacking the body's own tissues. People with PBC frequently experience&#xD;
      profound fatigue or tiredness which they liken to their &quot;batteries running down&quot;, and&#xD;
      although people still want to undertake normal activities they simply lack the energy to be&#xD;
      able to do them. This reduces quality of life, makes it difficult for people to work, and can&#xD;
      end up with them becoming isolated in the community. At present we have no treatment for&#xD;
      fatigue in PBC. Finding a treatment for fatigue in PBC is one of the highest research&#xD;
      priorities identified by patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have shown that PBC patients with fatigue have an abnormality in the way they generate&#xD;
      energy within their muscles. This appears to be associated with the presence of an antibody&#xD;
      in the blood which is directed against an important protein which normal cells in the body&#xD;
      use to generate energy. In recent years new drug treatments have been developed which allow&#xD;
      us to safely suppress the part of the immune system which produces antibodies of the type&#xD;
      that seem to cause energy production problems in PBC. As yet, however, the extent to which&#xD;
      these medicines can improve fatigue through removal of antibodies in PBC has not been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to undertake a clinical trial to examine the effects of this&#xD;
      treatment (&quot;Rituximab&quot;) on severe fatigue in PBC to help us understand whether this will be a&#xD;
      potentially useful treatment. This will give us information about how energy generation&#xD;
      changes in patients with PBC and will also help us to develop new treatments for fatigue in&#xD;
      other diseases. The study has the potential to improve the quality of life of many patients&#xD;
      with PBC, for whom there is currently no licensed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform a randomised controlled trial of Rituximab therapy in PBC compared to placebo&#xD;
      with the primary end point of fatigue severity. The study will be performed in a specialised&#xD;
      PBC clinical centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the B-cell-directed immunotherapeutic agent Rituximab will improve&#xD;
      fatigue in PBC (an important and disabling symptom) through its effect on B-cells producing&#xD;
      antibodies which inhibit the function of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) an important energy&#xD;
      generating enzyme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom which frequently impacts significantly on&#xD;
      quality of life and ability to function in patients with PBC. There are currently no&#xD;
      effective treatments for fatigue in PBC and new approaches are urgently required to address&#xD;
      this unmet need. Rituximab, a B-cell depleting agent, holds specific promise (with evidence&#xD;
      from a small-scale proof-of-concept pilot trial) as a therapy for fatigue in PBC, given the&#xD;
      strong evidence linking the antibody response to PDH in the pathogenesis of fatigue in this&#xD;
      disease. We also believe, given the robust diagnostic criteria and the availability of&#xD;
      validated clinical tools, that PBC is an important and useful human model in which to study&#xD;
      the pathogenesis and treatment of fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no treatments for fatigue in PBC and we are not aware of any other&#xD;
      treatments under evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study performed in Canada exploring the use of Rituximab in PBC (in 13 patients) has&#xD;
      provided proof-of-concept, showing that the agent is safe and well-tolerated in patients, and&#xD;
      is associated with a clinically significant reduction in fatigue. Fatigue severity was&#xD;
      assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) (potential range 9-63 points) with a fall&#xD;
      being seen from pre-treatment (median FSS=36, range 11-59) to post-treatment (median=29,&#xD;
      range 12-55). Taking into account the floor value for the FSS, this represents a median fall&#xD;
      in fatigue severity over 6 months of 26%. This compares with our own case-control study of&#xD;
      fatigue in PBC which suggests that fatigue severity in age and sex matched normal controls is&#xD;
      30% lower than in PBC patients1 suggesting the potential for Rituximab therapy to return PBC&#xD;
      patients to close to normal with regards to their perceived fatigue. However, this pilot&#xD;
      study did not attempt to explore the mechanism of the effect, and since it did not use severe&#xD;
      fatigue as an inclusion criteria, the extent of possible improvement for such patients is&#xD;
      unclear; moreover, the study was not optimised for the study of fatigue (fatigue was a&#xD;
      secondary outcome and only some of the patients who participated had fatigue potentially&#xD;
      under-estimating the clinical effect). Patients showed a sustained reduction in anti-PDH&#xD;
      antibody levels of all isotypes, supporting the concept that Rituximab has a beneficial&#xD;
      effect on fatigue through depletion of PDH-reactive antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of severe fatigue in PBC and the current lack of treatments, the strong&#xD;
      theoretical basis for the approach, and the supportive pilot trial proof-of-concept data all,&#xD;
      we believe, justify a formal clinical trial of Rituximab targeting fatigue in PBC. Data from&#xD;
      animal models of PBC implicating activated B-cells in promoting autoreactivity, from human in&#xD;
      vitro studies showing increased TLR-mediated B-cell activation in PBC, from human genetic&#xD;
      studies showing disease associations with loci implicated in regulation of the B-cell pool&#xD;
      size and the pilot trial data showing improvement in liver biochemistry in PBC patients&#xD;
      treated with Rituximab all point to the potential for an additional, more generic benefit for&#xD;
      this treatment in terms of underlying liver inflammation further justifying a substantive&#xD;
      clinical trial in PBC.&#xD;
