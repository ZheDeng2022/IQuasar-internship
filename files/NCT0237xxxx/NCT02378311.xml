    <textblock>
      Cycling injuries are the 3rd most common mechanism of injury in 7-13 year olds[1]. Bicycle&#xD;
      injuries have remained one of the commonest causes of paediatric abdominal trauma for over 60&#xD;
      years[2,3]. 15% of child cyclist injuries involve impact with a handlebar; two-thirds of&#xD;
      those are abdominal injuries[4]. Handlebar impact is now the commonest mechanism of major&#xD;
      paediatric abdominal injury[3]. Serious handlebar injuries often occur after apparently minor&#xD;
      falls; they are not unique to riders performing stunts[5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      One small study found that the metal handlebar ends were often exposed on bikes of children&#xD;
      sustaining severe abdominal injuries[6]. Most European safety standards do not test grip&#xD;
      durability[7-10]. Day-to-day use can damage rubber grips, exposing the underlying metal&#xD;
      handlebar tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study aims to test the research methods that will be used in a subsequent&#xD;
      nationwide multicentre study. The main study will investigate the association between&#xD;
      injuries and handlebar grip condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children attending study hospitals with any bicycle or kick scooter injury will be invited to&#xD;
      participate. Parents of injured children will be invited to complete questionnaires regarding&#xD;
      circumstances surrounding the injury and condition of the handlebar ends on the bike or&#xD;
      scooter involved. Clinical information regarding the injury will also be collected. The&#xD;
      handlebar end condition will be compared between children sustaining a handlebar end injury&#xD;
      [Cases] and riders whose injury did not involve the handlebar [Controls].&#xD;
&#xD;
      If exposed handlebar ends are more prevalent amongst riders with handlebar end injuries,&#xD;
      injury prevention strategies can focus on methods to prevent damage occurring to grips&#xD;
      through day-to-day use. If no such association is found, prevention strategies can be focused&#xD;
      elsewhere, such as on design of effective protective clothing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection for this feasibility study will occur between March 2015 and September 2015.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injuries are the most common cause of death of children aged 1-14 years in the European&#xD;
      Union[11]. In the United States cyclist injuries are the 3rd most common mechanism of injury&#xD;
      in 7-13 year olds, after motor vehicle collisions (MVC) and falls[1]. Bicycle injuries have&#xD;
      remained one of the most common causes of paediatric abdominal trauma for over 60 years[2,3].&#xD;
      The vast majority (95-98%) of child cyclists admitted due to abdominal trauma are over 5&#xD;
      years old[2,3]. As with most mechanisms of injury, boys are injured more frequently than&#xD;
      girls. Around three quarters of injured child cyclists are boys[12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent UK study, handlebar end impact was the mechanism that most frequently resulted in&#xD;
      major intra-abdominal trauma in children. Impact with a handlebar end was implicated in 29%&#xD;
      of cases. This was ahead of falls (20%), pedestrians (8%) and MVC occupants (8%)[3]. A study&#xD;
      conducted in Australia found 15% of child cyclist injuries involved impact with a handlebar,&#xD;
      and 10% of all child cyclist injuries were abdominal handlebar injuries[4]. A study in&#xD;
      Philadelphia found that 8% of all paediatric bicycle-related trauma admissions involved&#xD;
      handlebars impacting the abdomen resulting in an injury with an Abbreviated Injury Scale&#xD;
      (AIS) score of 2 or greater[13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of handlebar injury case series reported in the literature relate to children's&#xD;
      abdominal injuries. The peak incidence occurs between 6 and 14 years of age[4]. However,&#xD;
      adults can also sustain serious handlebar related injuries[14-16] and 36% of all handlebar&#xD;
      injured patients sustain only extra-abdominal injuries[4]. It is not just pedal cyclists who&#xD;
      are at risk of these injuries. Incidents also involve non-motorized kick scooters, moto-cross&#xD;
      bikes, motorbikes and quad bikes[3,4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crash investigations have found that serious handlebar injuries often occur after apparently&#xD;
      minor incidents; they are not unique to riders performing stunts or those riding BMX&#xD;
      bikes[5,6]. There is a typical sequence of events common to many of these handlebar&#xD;
      injuries[5]. The child loses control of the bike and begins to fall. The front wheel rotates&#xD;
      through 90 degrees so that it is perpendicular to the child's body. The child continues to&#xD;
      fall forwards, landing on the upturned handlebar end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children's bikes and scooters often have damaged rubber grips with exposed metal handlebar&#xD;
      ends. This occurs through day-to-day use. Each time the child drops their bike or scooter on&#xD;
      its side, the handlebar end contacts the ground. When it does so, the metal tube inside the&#xD;
      rubber grip cuts into that rubber. With time, a circle is cut from the rubber end, exposing&#xD;
      the metal pipe within.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handlebar end injuries can occur both when the handlebar ends are exposed and when they are&#xD;
      intact. Two studies from the 1990s have looked at the condition of the handlebar end&#xD;
      implicated in such injuries[5,6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acton et al published a series of 21 patients who reported handlebar impact as the cause of&#xD;
      their injuries. Re-interview found that metal handlebar ends were exposed on bikes of all 10&#xD;
      children who sustained a major abdominal injury, whilst exposed handlebar ends were present&#xD;
      on only one bike of 8 respondents with minor abdominal injuries[6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Winston et al included detailed analysis on 4 riders who sustained serious abdominal injuries&#xD;
      due to landing on a handlebar end. They found that these serious injuries occurred in 3&#xD;
      riders despite the presence of protective rubber covering on the handlebar ends. The rider&#xD;
      who impacted an exposed metal handlebar end, however, had a particularly serious injury. He&#xD;
      was a 6-year-old boy who sustained a life threatening liver laceration[5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying if there is an association between the condition of handlebar grips and the&#xD;
      likelihood of sustaining an injury is the ultimate aim of the main GRIP study. This&#xD;
      feasibility study aims to test the intended methodology prior to rolling out a nationwide&#xD;
      multicentre study. The feasibility study will allow power calculations to be performed for&#xD;
      the nationwide study. The primary outcome of the nationwide study will address whether&#xD;
      children falling onto exposed metal handlebar ends are at a greater risk of sustaining an&#xD;
      injury than those who fall onto handlebars with intact rubber grips. A sub-study will explore&#xD;
      whether there is any relationship between injury severity and grip condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our clinical experience tells us that serious handlebar injuries do occur even when handlebar&#xD;
      grips are intact. The investigators also know through anecdotes that some riders fall onto&#xD;
      their handlebar ends and never attend hospital because no injury or only a minor injury is&#xD;
      sustained. The cases presenting to tertiary paediatric units represent the 'tip of the&#xD;
      iceberg'. A study to accurately identify the number of children who fall onto a handlebar but&#xD;
      do not present to hospital is unlikely to be feasible. This is why the investigators have&#xD;
      designed a case-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the nationwide multicentre GRIP study rejects the null hypothesis, then the investigators&#xD;
      can focus on passive injury prevention strategies relating to handlebar ends. There are two&#xD;
      aspects that could easily be addressed by safety standards. Grip durability and grip end&#xD;
      minimum diameter. Improved durability should reduce the number of bikes or scooters in&#xD;
      circulation with exposed metal handlebar ends. Larger diameter ends distribute any end-on&#xD;
      impact over a larger surface area and hence reduce the pressure exerted on the point of&#xD;
      contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently only one of the many applicable European safety standards includes a drop test of&#xD;
      handlebar grip durability[9]. This standard for BMX bikes was introduced in 2012. However,&#xD;
      the drop test has not been included in the more recently published standard for Bicycles for&#xD;
      Young Children[10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum grip diameter requirement has been included in the standard for Bicycles for Young&#xD;
      Children. It specifies that handlebars shall be fitted with handlebar grips, and that such&#xD;
      grips shall be of resilient material and shall have an enlarged and covered end not less than&#xD;
      40mm in diameter[10]. That standard applies only to bikes suitable for children up to around&#xD;
      5 years of age. There is no such minimum handlebar end diameter requirement applied to&#xD;
      bicycles ridden by children over 5 years of age, or to kick scooters. These standards simply&#xD;
      require the handlebar to be fitted with handgrips or end plugs[7-9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, however, the nationwide multicentre GRIP study accepts the null hypothesis, the&#xD;
      investigators can focus handlebar-related injury prevention on more complex mechanical&#xD;
      solutions such as steering limiters or compressible handlebar ends, and on design of&#xD;
      effective protective clothing. Some of the secondary outcomes the investigators propose&#xD;
      addressing will be useful if it is found that exposed handlebar ends are not a risk factor&#xD;
      for this injury mechanism.&#xD;
