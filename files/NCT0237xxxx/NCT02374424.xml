      Aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy of new anti-CD20 antibody (GA101) in association&#xD;
      with DHAP as induction therapy before high dose chemotherapy BEAM with ASCT in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory DLBCL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, phase II trial in young patients (18-65&#xD;
      years) affected by relapsed/refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) at&#xD;
      diagnosis,eligible to high-dose therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to assess whether the addition of GA101 to DHAP is more promising than&#xD;
      standard R-DHAP, as induction therapy before high dose chemotherapy BEAM with ASCT with&#xD;
      respect to response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed primarily to evaluate the efficacy of GA101-DHAP in patients with DLBCL&#xD;
      who have relapsed or are refractory to one chemotherapy regimen and secondarily to assess&#xD;
      safety and capability to mobilize peripheral stem cells The study is designed with two stages&#xD;
      and with stopping rules after the first stage. In particular, at the end of the first stage,&#xD;
      the study will be stopped if the efficacy is too low or if the toxicity, measured during the&#xD;
      drug administration period, is too high with respect to pre-defined thresholds. .&#xD;
