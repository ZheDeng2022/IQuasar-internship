    <textblock>
      Constructs made from cross-linked Human Recombinant Collagen type III are being used instead&#xD;
      of human donor corneas in 6 patients at Deep anterior lamellar cornea grafting. Six patients&#xD;
      serve as controls and are receiving human donor corneas using the same surgical technique.&#xD;
      The twelve patients will be recruited from the local waiting list for patients to be&#xD;
      undergoing corneal grafting. If the patients meet the inclusion criteria and agree to&#xD;
      participate following oral and written consent, they will be randomized to either group. The&#xD;
      patients will be followed for 12 months and documented with OCT, In Vivo Confocal Microscopy,&#xD;
      slit lamp photography a o. The study is planned as a safety study with initial efficacy&#xD;
      documentation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      12 patients will be recruited from the waitinglist for corneal transplantation.The will all&#xD;
      be of the age of 18 years or older and capable of making their own decisions. Their medical&#xD;
      history and present medication is reveiwed and they undergo a thorough ophthalmological&#xD;
      examination in order to find out if they meet the inclusion criteria and create baseline&#xD;
      values for the study. Their general health or medication should not affect the cornea or&#xD;
      ocular surface. The Eye should be healthy with the exception of the disease indication for&#xD;
      corneal grafting. The corneal endothelium should be healthy. Any opacification in the eye to&#xD;
      be grafted should not reach the Descemets membrane. Visual acuity in the fellow eye should be&#xD;
      good. If these criteria are met the patient recieve oral and written information of the&#xD;
      study. If they agree to participate they will be randomized to either recieve biosynthetic&#xD;
      corneas ( 6 patients) or they will recieve a donated cornea ( 6 patients) . They will be&#xD;
      scheduled for surgery within 2 weeks from the examination irrespective if they participate in&#xD;
      the study or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery will be anterior deep lamellar using the femtosecond laser to do the patient cut.&#xD;
      The laser cut wil be done in topical anaaestesi. The remaining surgery with either be&#xD;
      performed in local oor general anaestesia according to the patients wish. The diameter of the&#xD;
      cut will be 7 mm in diameter. The graft material will be punched to a diameter of 7.25 mm.&#xD;
      The thickness of the material will be 500 µm . An amniotic membrane will be placed on the top&#xD;
      of the biosynthetic material and sutured with single stiches together with the graft.A&#xD;
      bandage lens will be placed . The donated corneas will be sutured with singled about 8&#xD;
      stiches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biosynthetic corneas will recieve topical antibiotics and dexametasone for 8 weeks when&#xD;
      the sutures, remnants of the amniotic membrane and the bandage lens is removed. The donated&#xD;
      corneas will recieve topical dexametasone for 5 months and the sutures will be removed after&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The check-up Schedule will be at 1 day,1,2 weeks,1,,2 months and extra when needed.The&#xD;
      protocol in these check-ups will be descriptive and the exyes will be documented with slit&#xD;
      lamp photography. Epitelialisation will be monitored with fluorescein staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 3,6,9 and12 months will be extensive and the same in both groups. UCVA and BSCVA will&#xD;
      be measured and also BCLCVA at 12 months. Corrneal topography,thickness sensitivity,tear&#xD;
      production Visante OCT and slit- lamp photography will be performed. Tear samples will be&#xD;
      taken also form earlier check-ups for proteomic analysis. In vivo confocal microscopy will be&#xD;
      performed. The different examination with few exceptions can all be presented in results that&#xD;
      can be quantified and statistically analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRFs and the adverse report forms will be filled out both on computer forms and on paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety outcome criteria are: Good engraftment, maintained integrity of the graft,&#xD;
      epithelialisation, transparency,no induced inflammation,no induced vasculatisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preliminary efficacy criteria are: UCVA,BSCVA and BCLCVA&#xD;
