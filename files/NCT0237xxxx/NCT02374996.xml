  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin is a hormone produced by the body to regulate blood sugar. Insulin resistance is a&#xD;
      state when the body is not using insulin correctly, and more insulin is needed to maintain&#xD;
      normal blood sugar. Insulin resistance is common in bipolar patients and even more common in&#xD;
      bipolar patients treated with antipsychotics. Insulin resistance from antipsychotics can lead&#xD;
      to type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease and is known to lead to&#xD;
      worse psychiatric outcomes (less mood stability) and lower life expectancies in bipolar&#xD;
      disorder. Abnormal regulation of the folate cycle is known to play a role in&#xD;
      antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and the main endpoint to the folate cycle is the&#xD;
      production of methyl donors for DNA methylation. DNA methylation is critical as it regulates&#xD;
      how genes are expressed. Thus, changes in DNA methylation may play a role in the disease&#xD;
      process of antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance. The purpose of this study is to examine&#xD;
      the differences in the DNA methylation of candidate tissues known to have a role in the&#xD;
      development of insulin resistance. The three groups of bipolar patients to be studied are 1)&#xD;
      antipsychotic treated patients with impaired glucose tolerance, 2) antipsychotic treated&#xD;
      patients with normal glucose tolerance and 3) lithium treated patients with normal glucose&#xD;
      tolerance. Group 1 will be compared to groups 2 and 3 in order to assess how DNA methylation&#xD;
      in the skeletal muscle and fat tissue changes due to medication effects (group 2 vs. 3) and&#xD;
      medication side effects (group 1 vs. 2). Secondary analyses include the analysis of how fats&#xD;
      are processed in skeletal muscle and fat tissue in relation to antipsychotic-induced insulin&#xD;
      resistance and the correlation of DNA methylation across different tissues. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance is to due changes in the way DNA is&#xD;
      expressed (through epigenetic changes) which causes further changes in the way fats are&#xD;
      processed in the body eventually leading to insulin resistance. This work is based on&#xD;
      preliminary findings however further work is needed to identify the true mechanisms behind&#xD;
      antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and in particular, the main tissue in which this&#xD;
      mechanism occurs.&#xD;

      This study will be composed of 2 visits. The first visit will be used as a screening visit&#xD;
      for inclusion of the three groups of patients for the second visit where the outcomes will be&#xD;
      collected (e.g., tissue samples for DNA methylation and lipidomic analysis).&#xD;
