  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects have a type of cancer that has been associated with an infection with a virus called&#xD;
      human papilloma virus (HPV). The cancer has come back, has not gone away after standard&#xD;
      treatment or the subject cannot receive standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a research study using special immune system cells called HPVST cells, a new&#xD;
      experimental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators want to find out if they can use this type of treatment in patients with&#xD;
      HPV-cancers. They have discovered a way to grow large number of HPV-specific T cells from the&#xD;
      blood of patients with HPV-cancers. They want to see if these special white blood cells,&#xD;
      called HPVST cells, that will have been trained to kill HPV infected cells can survive in the&#xD;
      blood and affect the tumor. They will also see if they can make the T cells more active&#xD;
      against the HPV-cancers by engineering them to be resistant to the TGF-beta chemical that&#xD;
      these HPV-cancers produce. They will grow these HPVST cells from the patient's blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of HPVSTs that is safe, to see how long&#xD;
      they last in the body, to learn what the side effects are and to see if the HPVSTs will help&#xD;
      people with HPV associated cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the treatment with HPVST cells alone proves safe (Group A), additional group of patients&#xD;
      (Group B) will receive Nivolumab in addition to HPVST cells in a lymphodepleted environment.&#xD;
      Nivolumab is an antibody therapy that helps T cells control the tumor and it is FDA approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of certain types of cancers, including Hodgkin's lymphoma. Lymphodepletion&#xD;
      will decrease the level of circulating T cells prior to infusion of HPVST cells, thereby&#xD;
      giving them room to expand. The purpose of this part of the study is to find out if TGF-beta&#xD;
      resistant HPVST cells in combination with Nivolumab are safe, how long they last in the body&#xD;
      and if they are more effective than HPVST cells alone in controlling the tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HPV is found in the cancer cells of more than half the patients with certain types of cancer,&#xD;
      suggesting that it may play a role in causing the cancer. The virus makes proteins in the&#xD;
      tumor cells that should allow the diseased cells to be recognized and killed by a part of the&#xD;
      body's own immune system called T cells. Unfortunately, tumors are able to avoid being killed&#xD;
      by making molecules that turn off these T cells. So, the cancer cells infected by HPV are&#xD;
      able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously studied cancers caused by a different virus, called&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). These EBV-cancers are like HPV-cancers, since they turn off the T&#xD;
      cells that would otherwise destroy them, and so can keep growing. They investigators have&#xD;
      found, however, that if they removed the T cells from the blood of patients with EBV-cancers&#xD;
      and grew them outside the body, they could increase the number and the activity of T cells&#xD;
      directed against the tumors. When these T cells were given back to the patients, the T cells&#xD;
      eliminated the cancers in over half the recipients. Investigators also found that they could&#xD;
      engineer the T cells to be even more active against the EBV-cancer cells by making them&#xD;
      resist an inhibitory chemical called TGF-beta, which is produced by these cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will collect up to 390 mL of blood. Then they will use this blood to grow T&#xD;
      cells. First they will grow them in a special type of cell called a dendritic cell, which&#xD;
      stimulates the T cells. These dendritic cells will then be loaded with bits of proteins from&#xD;
      the HPV virus called E6 and E7. These dendritic cells will be used to stimulate T cells. This&#xD;
      stimulation trains the T cells to kill cells with the HPV proteins E6 and E7 on their&#xD;
      surface. Next, the investigators will grow these HPV-specific T cells by more stimulation&#xD;
      with dendritic cells and HPV proteins, and, when needed, a special type of cell called K562.&#xD;
      These K562 cells were treated with radiation so they cannot grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make these T cells resistant to the TGF-beta released by the tumor, investigators will put&#xD;
      a new gene in them in the laboratory called a mutant TGF-beta receptor. In cells with this&#xD;
      new gene, TGF-beta released by the tumor cells will not be able to bind to the mutant&#xD;
      TGF-beta receptor on the T cell. Investigators hope this will improve the chances that after&#xD;
      the T cells are injected they will be able to keep working and kill the tumor cells. This&#xD;
      gene is added to the cells using a mouse retrovirus that has been changed to stop it from&#xD;
      causing infections. Retroviruses enter the cell's DNA (genetic material) to make permanent&#xD;
      changes to the cell. After making these cells, they will be frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For treatment, the cells will be thawed and injected in a vein over 1 to 10 minutes.&#xD;
      Initially, one dose of T cells will be given (which is considered day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, after the 1st infusion, there is a reduction in the size of the subject's cancer (or no&#xD;
      increase) on CT or MRI scans as assessed by a radiologist, the subject can receive additional&#xD;
      doses if it would be to his/her benefit, if s/he would like to receive more doses, and if&#xD;
      there is enough product remaining to give any additional injections (at the same or a lower&#xD;
      dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If treatment with HPVST cells alone proves safe, additional group of patients (Group B) will&#xD;
      receive HPVST cells with nivolumab in lymphodepleted environment. One dose of the drug&#xD;
      nivolumab is given one day before the HPVST cells are infused and then every 2 weeks for a&#xD;
      total of four doses of nivolumab. Lymphodepletion will be given daily starting day -4 prior&#xD;
      to administration of HPVSTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose escalation study. The dose the patient will get will depend on how many&#xD;
      participants get the agent beforehand and how they react.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will follow the patient during and after the injections at predetermined time&#xD;
      points which may require blood draws and other examinations.&#xD;
