        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent or persistent leiomyosarcoma of the uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this&#xD;
             protocol as defined by RECIST version 1.1 (Section 8.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority GOG protocol, if one exists. In&#xD;
             general, this would refer to any active GOG Phase III protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  GOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception&#xD;
             of uncomplicated UTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one&#xD;
             week prior to registration. Hormonal therapy will not count as a prior regimen (either&#xD;
             cytotoxic or non-cytotoxic).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including chemotherapy and&#xD;
             immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration.&#xD;

          -  Any prior radiation therapy must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the patient underwent any major surgery (for&#xD;
             example, hysterectomy, resection of a metastatic nodule); placement of a central&#xD;
             venous catheter is considered minor, not major and thus time from a minor procedure&#xD;
             until treatment on study may be shorter than 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had at least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for management of&#xD;
             leiomyosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had one additional chemotherapeutic regimen for management of&#xD;
             leiomyosarcoma, for a total of two prior lines of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have NOT received any non-cytotoxic (biologic or targeted) agents as&#xD;
             part of their primary treatment or for management of recurrent or persistent disease.&#xD;
             (Patients who were previously treated on GOG 0250, a randomized trial of&#xD;
             gemcitabine-docetaxel plus bevacizumab or placebo, are eligible, provided that the&#xD;
             patient is known to have been treated on the placebo-containing arm and did not&#xD;
             receive prior bevacizumab)&#xD;
&#xD;

             transfusion within 7 days of screening assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL (133 umol/L) or, if &gt;1.5 mg/dl, then&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Hepatic function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN (subjects with Gilbert's syndrome and&#xD;
                  elevations of indirect bilirubin only are eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than or&#xD;
                  equal to 2.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects who have BOTH bilirubin greater than ULN and AST/ALT greater than ULN&#xD;
                  are not eligible. (Specifically, if bilirubin is greater than 1 x ULN but less&#xD;
                  than or equal to 1.5 x ULN, THEN the AST and ALT must be less than or equal to&#xD;
                  ULN for patient to be eligible. If AST and /or ALT are greater than 1 x ULN but&#xD;
                  less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN, THEN the bilirubin must be less than or equal to&#xD;
                  ULN for patient to be eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urine Protein/ Creatinine Ratio (UPCR) must be less than 1 (or urinary protein less&#xD;
             than 1 g/24 hours). -Blood coagulation parameters: PT such that international&#xD;
             normalized ratio (INR) is less than or equal to 1.2 x ULN (Patients on anticoagulant&#xD;
             therapy are eligible if their INR is stable, and in-range INR, usually between 2 and&#xD;
             3) and a PTT less than or equal to 1.2 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting&#xD;

             Torsades de Pointes should be discontinued or replaced with drugs that do not carry&#xD;
             these risks, if possible. Patients who must take medication with a risk of possible&#xD;
             risk of Torsades de Pointes should be watched carefully for symptoms of QTc&#xD;
             prolongation, such as syncope. See Appendix III for a list of concomitant medications&#xD;
             associated with QTc and Torsades de Pointes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with personal or family history of congenital long QTc syndrome are NOT eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are prohibited. Grapefruit juice is&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known endobronchial lesions and/or lesions infiltrating major pulmonary&#xD;
             vessels that increase the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. (Note, the presence of tumor&#xD;

             lesion in the main or lobar bronchi are excluded; lesion extensively infiltrating the&#xD;
             main or lobar bronchi are excluded)&#xD;
