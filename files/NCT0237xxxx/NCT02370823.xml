      The primary objective of this study is to determine the levels of proteins and/or cellular&#xD;
      components of the synovial fluid that are indicative of microenvironment phenotypes of the&#xD;
      osteoarthritic knee compared to unilateral unaffected joints pre-injection to 6 weeks&#xD;
      post-Regenexx速 SD treatment.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the levels of proteins and/or cellular&#xD;
      components of the synovial fluid that are indicative of microenvironment phenotypes of the&#xD;
      osteoarthritic knee compared to unilateral unaffected joints pre-injection to 6 weeks&#xD;
      post-Regenexx SD treatment (day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is an evaluation of possible direct and/or indirect associations between&#xD;
      the measured levels of proteins and/or cellular components of the synovial fluid in the&#xD;
      osteoarthritic knee joint with the administration of the Regenexx SD treatment. The secondary&#xD;
      objective will include MRI evidence of cartilage repair; incidence of post-operative&#xD;
      complications, adverse events, re-injections, and surgical intervention; change in pain score&#xD;
      and use of pain medications.&#xD;

    <description>20 subjects with unilateral knee osteoarthritis. Collection of synovial fluid from both knees will serve as the experimental condition, i.e. the osteoarthritic knee, and the matched control, i.e. the knee not demonstrating signs of osteoarthritis. Alterations in the concentration of the synovial fluid proteins and cellular components will be evaluated up to 6 weeks post-Regenexx速 SD - Same Day Bone Marrow Concentrate Injection treatment.</description>
