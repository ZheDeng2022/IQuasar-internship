      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urothelial cancer is cancer of the bladder, ureter, and urethra. Researchers want to better&#xD;
      understand what changes in a person s cells and genes cause this cancer to form. This may&#xD;
      help them find new ways to treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To perform DNA sequencing to help researchers learn the differences between normal tissue&#xD;
      and tumor tissue. Also, to learn how molecular changes - including gene changes - might help&#xD;
      predict the course of disease and how people respond to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults age 18 and older who have or are suspected of having urothelial cancer or an&#xD;
      inherited disorder that raises their risk of getting bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam. Their medical records and tissue&#xD;
           samples will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will give tissue blocks of their original tumor. The blocks will&#xD;
           be put in a tissue bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants medical records may be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have blood and urine tests. They may have imaging scans. They may give&#xD;
           urine, blood, and saliva samples. These samples may be used in future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants need surgery for their cancer, researchers will keep some of the tissue&#xD;
           (both tumor and normal tissue). The tissue may be used in future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will go back to the Clinical Center in 6 months. They may give saliva,&#xD;
           urine, and blood samples. After 6 months, they will be seen by their local doctor for&#xD;
           standard post-surgical visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be called every 6 months to give health updates.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urothelial carcinoma, present as lower or upper urinary tract disease, is the most&#xD;
           expensive malignancy to treat from diagnosis to death, and no major advances in drug&#xD;
           therapy have taken place in the last two decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding the molecular mechanisms and genomic alterations that cause urothelial&#xD;
           carcinoma will provide the foundation for the development of novel targeted therapeutic&#xD;
           agents for this disease. Since 1982 investigators in the Urologic Oncology Branch have&#xD;
           been studying the genetic basis of urologic cancers. The identification of the genes for&#xD;
           cancer of the kidney has led to the approval by the FDA of a number of new agents for&#xD;
           patients with advanced disease. Similarly, it is our goal to study the cancer biology&#xD;
           (genomic, molecular, and cellular biology) of urothelial carcinoma in order to develop&#xD;
           novel treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of patient tumor samples allows us to study molecular and biologic pathways&#xD;
           and develop novel targeted therapies. Correlation of these samples with clinical&#xD;
           outcomes in patients allows us to predict and understand clinical outcomes and possibly&#xD;
           develop predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of blood, urine and saliva from healthy volunteers will allow us to&#xD;
           distinguish normal and inflammatory conditions from malignant diseases. Furthermore, the&#xD;
           specimens will provide appropriate controls for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective (Primary):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood, urine, and benign and malignant tissue from patients with known or&#xD;
           suspected urothelial cancer for the purpose of elucidating the molecular mechanisms of&#xD;
           carcinogenesis in urothelial cancer and ultimately, identifying novel therapeutic&#xD;
           targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood, urine and saliva from healthy volunteers for the purpose of establishing&#xD;
           controls for comparison with urothelial cancer specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults with biopsy-proven or suspected urothelial cancer who require diagnostic or&#xD;
           therapeutic intervention as part of their diagnosis, standard of care treatment, or&#xD;
           followup/surveillance for their neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers from whom blood, saliva and urine samples are easily obtainable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Care of the patient with urothelial carcinoma will be provided as per medically&#xD;
           indicated standards and in the process, normal and malignant urothelial cancer tissues&#xD;
           may be obtained at the time of clinically indicated diagnostic and/or therapeutic&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and saliva samples for research may be obtained from patients and healthy&#xD;
           volunteers at baseline. Additionally, blood and urine may be collected from patients at&#xD;
           follow-up intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No investigational or experimental therapy will be given as part of this protocol.&#xD;
