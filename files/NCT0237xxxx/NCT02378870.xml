  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIb study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center study&#xD;
      evaluating efficacy and tolerability of Osteodex of patients with metastatic castration&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Osteodex is a poly-bisphosphonate containing three known&#xD;
      substances; dextran, alendronate and guanidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the relative change of response markers to bone&#xD;
      metabolism (B-ALP and S-P1NP) The following objectives will also be evaluated: overall&#xD;
      survival, PSA response, other response markers related to bone metabolism (S-CTX and&#xD;
      osteocalcin), safety, tolerability, pain and quality of life.&#xD;

      Males, diagnosed with CRPC, who fulfil the inclusion criteria and does not have any exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, will be asked to participate in the study. The subject will be informed orally and&#xD;
      in writing about the study procedures and give written informed consent, prior to study&#xD;
      start. At the screening visit the following examinations are performed: Physical examination,&#xD;
      medical history and concomitant medication. Heart rate, blood pressure, weight, height, body&#xD;
      temperature and respiratory rate are measured. Blood samples are drawn and urine sample is&#xD;
      collected. ECG is recorded. Bone scan and PET-CT are also performed. At the next visit,&#xD;
      baseline, the subject is examined physically and heart rate, blood pressure, weight, body&#xD;
      temperature and respiratory rate are measured, ECG is recorded, blood samples drawn and urine&#xD;
      sample collected. FACT-P and EQ-5D-5L questionnaire are filled out by the subject. Adverse&#xD;
      events and concomitant medication is documented and the first dose of the investigational&#xD;
      product is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject is surveyed for 3 hours at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study for the individual subject will be approximately 30 weeks from&#xD;
      screening to the follow-up visit 2 weeks after the last dose. Each subject will receive at&#xD;
      least 7 doses and maximum 13 doses of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be designated and will be responsible to&#xD;
      monitor/review all study related safety data. After review of safety data the DMC will&#xD;
      provide recommendation as to whether the dose escalation can proceed as planned according to&#xD;
      the protocol.&#xD;
