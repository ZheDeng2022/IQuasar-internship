      This phase I/II trial will assess the safety and efficacy of intravesical instillation of&#xD;
      VPM1002BC in patients with recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer after TURB&#xD;
      (transurethral resection of the bladder) and standard BCG therapy. In phase I part of the&#xD;
      trial, a 3+3 dose de-escalation design will be applied to determine the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D). In phase II part of the trial, a maximum of 39 patients will be treated at RP2D&#xD;
      to further assess the preliminary efficacy of VPM1002BC.The efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      VPM1002BC will be compared to results previously reported for BCG in a similar population.&#xD;
      The quality of life will be also investigated as a secondary endpoint. Additional immunology&#xD;
      assessments are foreseen as exploratory analyses to investigate the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      VPM1002BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II of the trial has been opened on 27.07.2016.&#xD;

      Therapy background&#xD;
&#xD;
      For intermediate/high risk NMIBC clinical guidelines recommend as standard therapy complete&#xD;
      transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (s) (TURB), followed by immunotherapy with six&#xD;
      weekly intravesical instillations of approx. 5x10E8 CFUs of Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG)&#xD;
      and maintenance BCG therapy for at least one year. In addition to the prevention of&#xD;
      recurrences and progression of NMIBC, the use of BCG as a means of initiating anti-tumor&#xD;
      immunity has been shown to prolong overall survival as compared to TURB alone. BCG has also&#xD;
      been shown superior to intravesical chemotherapy in combination with BCG maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worldwide, more than 200,000 patients are treated with BCG annually, 30-50% of which are&#xD;
      likely to recur. While NMIBC incidence has increased over the past decades, death rates&#xD;
      remain low due to the efficacy of intravesical BCG therapy. Failure to BCG therapy occurs in&#xD;
      40-50% of patients in terms of disease recurrence or progression. Due to the high risk of&#xD;
      disease progression and to the lack of predictive markers for the risk of progression,&#xD;
      radical cystectomy is the preferred option for patients failing to respond to a first course&#xD;
      of standard BCG therapy, according to current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a second course of BCG is appropriate for non high-grade and even for some&#xD;
      high-grade recurrent tumors. Based on retrospective studies, a second induction course may&#xD;
      achieve a 30% to 50% response rate in patients with an initial complete response and in&#xD;
      patients with persistent carcinoma in situ (CIS) after a first course of BCG induction&#xD;
      therapy. Only a few data are available from prospective studies regarding the outcome of a&#xD;
      second BCG therapy cycle after BCG failure. Di Lorenzo et al (2010) reported on 40 patients&#xD;
      receiving BCG reinduction: 87.5% of patients failed to respond to BCG re-induction at one&#xD;
      year; one patient died of systemic disease, 37.5% of the patients had to undergo cystectomy&#xD;
      and 40% underwent radiation therapy plus systemic chemotherapy after 1 year. Of note, these&#xD;
      were initially patients unwilling or unfit to undergo cystectomy. In this trial, BCG&#xD;
      reinduction was prospectively compared to intravesical chemotherapy with gemcitabine. The&#xD;
      results indicated a small benefit for gemcitabine in terms of recurrence-free survival but no&#xD;
      difference in terms of progression-free survival. The poor outcome in these patients failing&#xD;
      to respond to BCG therapy reflects the unmet medical need for improved bladder sparing&#xD;
      treatments after BCG or other intravesical treatment failure. We need better treatment&#xD;
      options for patients failing to respond to BCG therapy as these patients are at high risk of&#xD;
      cancer progression. Ultimately, improved treatment of these high-risk patients will increase&#xD;
      bladder preservation rates and as a consequence, improve quality of life and decrease health&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for performing the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the proven efficacy of BCG treatment in patients with NMIBC, recurrence-free and&#xD;
      progression-free survival are still poor. Oddens and coworkers (2013) reported ~35-45% of&#xD;
      patients recurred by 5 years and ~10-13% of patients progressed. Recurrence and progression&#xD;
      to muscle invasive disease lead to additional surgical and radio-oncological interventions&#xD;
      including transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), cystectomy, and chemo-radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Improvement in recurrence-free and progression-free survival rates in NMIBC, therefore, would&#xD;
      lead to less surgery, better quality of life (QoL), and probably better overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those patients failing to a first course of standard BCG therapy, current guidelines&#xD;
      recommend radical cystectomy. Alternative options for patients include re-treatment with BCG&#xD;
      or intravesical chemotherapy (including multimodal therapy). The earlier the BCG failure, the&#xD;
      more probable is the failure of a second BCG cycle. Only few data are available regarding&#xD;
      outcome of a second cycle of BCG after BCG failure. Rosevear (2011) reported a 66% complete&#xD;
      response after BCG +IFN-α therapy after 6 months of therapy and Di Lorenzo (2010) reported an&#xD;
      even worse 6-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) of ~62% (3% at 24 months). As such, better&#xD;
      treatment options are not only needed for first line therapy but also for patients with&#xD;
      recurrence after a first course of standard BCG therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VPM1002BC is a live genetically modified Mycobacterium bovis BCG that was originally&#xD;
      developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VPM1002BC has an innovative mode of action with a unique potential of inducing tumor specific&#xD;
      immune responses. VPM1002BC should be at least as potent as the currently used BCG strains in&#xD;
      evoking immune responses. Moreover, based on preclinical data, a favourable adverse events&#xD;
      profile is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the pivotal and final goal of this trial is the testing of VPM1002BC as a safe,&#xD;
      well tolerated and efficacious treatment for NMIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VPM1002BC will be tested for safety, efficacy, tolerability and immunogenicity in a phase&#xD;
      I/II clinical trial, respectively, in patients with tumor recurrence after standard BCG&#xD;
      according to EAU guidelines who are unwilling or unfit to undergo cystectomy. Thus, the&#xD;
      reasons to choose this study population are based on the fact that this population has the&#xD;
      highest need for innovative treatment and further to establish VPM1002BC as a safe and&#xD;
      effective immunotherapy against NMIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase I/II design was chosen in order to be able to assess safety and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      and tolerability of VPM1002BC. As the patient population qualifying for the trial is rare and&#xD;
      the conventional BCG re-treatment has shown poor and very poor results (see above) we decided&#xD;
      to use a single arm design and to compare efficacy and tolerability to reported results.&#xD;
      Based on these conditions, the calculated sample size of 39-45 patients has resulted in a&#xD;
      reasonable number of patients in terms of recruitment feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge VPM1002BC will be the first in man trial with recombinant&#xD;
      intravesical bacteria and the first-in-man intra-bladder application of VPM1002BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      VPM1002BC will be administered once per week as intravesical instillations as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - 6 instillations at weekly intervals. First instillation has to be done within 14 days after&#xD;
      registration and corresponds to day 1 of the trial treatment schedule (= treatment start).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 instillations at weekly intervals starting at week 13 from day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 instillations at weekly intervals starting at week 25 from day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 instillations at weekly intervals starting at week 49 from day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments before trial therapy consist of radiological assessments, transurethral&#xD;
      biopsy of the prostatic urethra in men (in case of suspected or previous CIS) followed by&#xD;
      staged TUR of the prostate (in case of positive transurethral biopsy of the prostatic urethra&#xD;
      ), PPD testing, TURB for histological confirmation of NMIBC (urothelial carcinoma) including&#xD;
      second TURB for confirmation of tumor-free state except for pure CIS of the bladder, physical&#xD;
      examination, ultrasound of bladder, blood testing for safety parameters, HIV, pregnancy test&#xD;
      for women with child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase I, induction therapy, for every weekly instillation: blood assessments for safety&#xD;
      parameters (before the instillation and on day after the instillation), urine assessments&#xD;
      (Nitrite, urine culture), urine cytology by bladder wash before instillation 1, vital signs&#xD;
      (before the instillation and on day after the instillation). In addition, for instillations 1&#xD;
      and 6: assessment of excretion of VPM1002BC in blood, urine and sputum. In phase II,&#xD;
      induction therapy, for instillations 1, 3 and 6 (before the instillation): blood assessments&#xD;
      for safety parameters, urine assessments (Nitrite, urine culture). In addition, for&#xD;
      instillation 1: physical examination including vital signs and weight, urine cytology by&#xD;
      bladder wash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During maintenance therapy (in phase I and II), for instillations 1 and 3 (before the&#xD;
      instillation): blood assessments for safety parameters, urine assessments (Nitrite, urine&#xD;
      culture). In addition, for each first instillation: physical examination and temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At weeks 12, 24, 36, 48: cystoscopy, urine cytology by bladder wash, physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following investigations have to be performed at the end of treatment (week 60): PPD&#xD;
      testing, physical examination including vital signs and weight, blood assessments for safety&#xD;
      parameters, urine assessments (Nitrite, urine cytology by bladder wash, urine culture),&#xD;
      cystoscopy/cytology, abdominopelvic contrast enhanced CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be recorded continuously throughout the trial treatment.&#xD;
      Treatment-related adverse events will be followed-up until resolution or stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life will be assessed at baseline, before start of maintenance and at the end of&#xD;
      trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up phase: survival status, recurrence and progression will be reported&#xD;
      every 3 months in the first 2 years and thereafter every 6 months until 5 years.&#xD;
