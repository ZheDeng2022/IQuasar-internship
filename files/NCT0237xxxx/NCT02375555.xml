  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a combination of four drugs -- lenalidomide, bortezomib,&#xD;
      dexamethasone and elotuzumab -- as therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial testing the safety and effectiveness of an&#xD;
      investigational drug (in this case elotuzumab) in combination with lenalidomide, bortezomib&#xD;
      and dexamethasone to learn more about the side effects of this regimen and whether it is&#xD;
      effective in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug elotuzumab and the combination of this agent with&#xD;
      lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone are being studied. It also means that the the&#xD;
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved elotuzumab for the treatment of&#xD;
      cancer. The drugs, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone are approved by the FDA.&#xD;
      Participants in this trial will have the option to undergo autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (ASCT) following initial therapy with elotuzumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib,&#xD;
      and dexamethasone. ASCT is a standard of care in the treatment of multiple myeloma. All&#xD;
      participants, including those who undergo ASCT and those who choose not to, will receive what&#xD;
      is referred to as &quot;maintenance therapy&quot; - or continuous treatment - after the initial cycles&#xD;
      of treatment with elotuzumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone. The specific&#xD;
      maintenance regimen will be determined by risk category.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive therapy with the combination of lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone and elotuzumab (E-RVD). Induction cycles (1 to 8) are 21-day cycles.&#xD;
Elotuzumab will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion&#xD;
Bortezomib as a subcutaneous injection&#xD;
Lenalidomide single daily oral dose&#xD;
Dexamethasone as oral tablets and IV infusion&#xD;
Stem cell mobilization will be performed for all subjects at the end of Cycle 4.&#xD;
Subjects may elect to stop E-RVD Cycle 4 and proceed to autologous SCT. Subjects who do not proceed to SCT may receive 8 cycles of induction therapy.&#xD;
- The maintenance schedule (28 days) will start after 8 cycles of induction regimen for subjects not proceeding with SCT, or after recovery from SCT for subjects proceeding with it.&#xD;
Maintenance therapy with E-RVD will be administered to all patients, with the specific maintenance regimen determined by risk category.</description>
