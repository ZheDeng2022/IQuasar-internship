  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to evaluate the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8, and&#xD;
      -9, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase and interleukin-1beta levels in gingival&#xD;
      crevicular fluid during the early and late stages of healing for gingival recession sites&#xD;
      treated by coronally advanced flap plus platelet rich fibrin (PRF) compared to CAF plus&#xD;
      connective tissue graft. As PRF consists of several growth factors, it may enhance the&#xD;
      healing potential of soft tissues, the investigators hypothesized that using PRF in the&#xD;
      treatment of gingival recessions might regulate inflammation and promote wound healing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PRF by assessing gingival crevicular&#xD;
      fluid (GCF) levels of MMP-8, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) and&#xD;
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) during the early and late stages of healing following coronally&#xD;
      advanced flap (CAF) plus PRF or CAF plus connective tissue graft (CTG) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome variables were biochemical parameters, such as: GCF MMP-8, -9, TIMP-1 and&#xD;
      IL-1β levels. The secondary outcome variables were change in gingival recession expressed as&#xD;
      recession reduction in millimeters at follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size has been estimated in 24 subjects per treatment groups. Random allocation of the&#xD;
      treatment sites to test (CAF+ PRF) and control (CAF + SCTG) groups will be performed using a&#xD;
      computerized selection of random numbers for allocation of the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical parameters: GCF samples were obtained from each recession defect in each subject&#xD;
      immediately prior to treatment of recessions and at 10 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal parameters including probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and&#xD;
      gingival recession parameters including recession depth (RD), recession width (RW), and&#xD;
      keratinized tissue width (KTW),were assessed by a calibrated examiner. At baseline and at 6&#xD;
      months, PD, RD, RW and KTW were evaluated by clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of subjects: 6 months.&#xD;
