  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study grounds on the possible role of hemispheric lateralization in Eating&#xD;
      disorders (ED): specifically, hyperactivity of the right frontal regions in Anorexia Nervosa&#xD;
      (AN), and hypoactivity of the right frontal regions in Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and food&#xD;
      craving behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that active excitatory tDCS over left prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (PFC) (Anode left/cathode right) may aid in altering/resetting inter-hemispheric&#xD;
      balance in AN patients, re-establish control over eating behaviors. On the contrary, active&#xD;
      excitatory tDCS over right PFC (Anode right/cathode left) may aid in altering/resetting&#xD;
      inter-hemispheric balance in BED patients and people with frequent food cravings, decreasing&#xD;
      cravings/appetite binge eating behaviors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is randomized stratified, double blind, add-on, placebo-controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of children and adolescents with AN will be selected and randomly assigned to two&#xD;
      different conditions: treatment &quot;as usual&quot; plus experimental treatment (active tDCS);&#xD;
      treatment &quot;as usual&quot; plus placebo treatment (sham tDCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, a group of children and adolescents with Over-weight/Obesity (OW/OB) and BED will&#xD;
      be selected and assigned with randomized stratified sampling to the following conditions:&#xD;
      treatment &quot;as usual&quot; plus experimental treatment (active tDCS); treatment &quot;as usual&quot; plus&#xD;
      placebo treatment (sham tDCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators will work to understand whether a brain-based treatment,&#xD;
      with the use of tDCS, can improve the outcome of patients with eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test whether tDCS treatment produces improvements in under-eating and&#xD;
      over-eating diseases, such us AN and OW/OB with BED and food craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overarching goal is to provide a scientific foundation for devising new rehabilitation&#xD;
      strategies in ED.&#xD;
