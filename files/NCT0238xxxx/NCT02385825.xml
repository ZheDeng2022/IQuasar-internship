      This study seeks to determine the safety and immunogenicity of a series of 3 primary&#xD;
      vaccinations and a booster vaccination of Recombinant ricin toxin A-chain 1-33/44-198 (rRTA&#xD;
      1-33/44-198) vaccine (RVEc) at 10, 50, or 75 μg IM. This study is evaluating if RVEc will&#xD;
      display an acceptable safety profile as determined by adverse event (AE) data and if RVEc&#xD;
      will elicit anti-ricin antibody titers and ricin toxin-neutralizing antibodies in vaccine&#xD;
      recipients.&#xD;

             than 50 years old at time of first study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must weigh at least 110 pounds at time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be in good health as judged from medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, hematology, clinical chemistries,&#xD;
             urinalysis, hepatitis serology, and human immunodeficiency virus antibody test and&#xD;
             must be medically cleared for participation by an investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test on screening and&#xD;
             the morning of each vaccination prior to receipt of the vaccine and must agree to use&#xD;
             a highly effective method of birth control from screening through 3 months following&#xD;
             last study vaccination. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one&#xD;
             with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Acceptable birth control methods that&#xD;
             meet this criterion include hormonal implants and injectables, combined oral&#xD;
             contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), female sterilization (tubal ligation),&#xD;
             sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants must also agree not to breastfeed from screening through 3 months&#xD;
             following last study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participants must be willing to return for all follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participants must agree to report any adverse events (AE) that may or may not be&#xD;
             associated with administration of the investigational product through duration of&#xD;
             study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participants must agree to abstain from excessive exercise (more than the usual&#xD;
             routine) and excessive alcohol consumption (exceeds 2 drinks for males or exceeds 1&#xD;
             drink for females daily or binge drinking) for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute or chronic medical conditions or immunodeficiency from a medical condition or&#xD;
             medical treatment, medications, or dietary supplements that, in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, would impair the subject's ability to respond to vaccination. Use of&#xD;
             corticosteroids, other than inhaled or topical corticosteroids or eye drops, will not&#xD;
             be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe hypersensitivity to any vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other current/residual&#xD;
             diseases of the lungs.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current smoker, to include use of electronic cigarettes..&#xD;

          -  Any known allergies to sodium succinate, Polysorbate 20 (a detergent), Alhydrogel, or&#xD;
             kanamycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any vaccine or investigational product within 30 days before or after&#xD;
             vaccination with RVEc (the only exception is the inactivated influenza vaccine that&#xD;
             can be received at least 30 days after RVEc Dose 3 or 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of RVEc is contraindicated based on shoulder injury related to vaccine&#xD;
             administration (SIRVA) checklist/screening, as determined by principle investigator.&#xD;
             (For this Phase 1 study, we will not administer product to subjects with bilateral&#xD;
             shoulder injuries.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatine phosphokinase levels that are consistently elevated more than 2 × normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous vaccination with RVEc or any other ricin vaccine candidate by any route.&#xD;
