      The overarching goal of this research program is to improve the quality of end-of-life care&#xD;
      provided to Veterans dying in VA Medical Centers (VAMCs), by transferring the best practices&#xD;
      of home hospice and palliative care for the last days and hours of life into the inpatient&#xD;
      setting. This trial will examine two methods of delivering a Comfort Care Education&#xD;
      Intervention utilizing the established infrastructure of VA Palliative Care Consult Teams&#xD;
      (PCCT): a Basic Implementation Approach using a teleconference to review educational&#xD;
      materials and activate PCCTs to educate other providers, and an Enhanced Implementation&#xD;
      Approach utilizing in-person, train-the-&quot;champion&quot; workshops to prepare PCCT members to be&#xD;
      leaders and trainers at their home sites. Findings will provide a robust evaluation of the&#xD;
      implementation process, and will be used to refine the Comfort Care Education Intervention&#xD;
      and implementation strategies in preparation for nationwide dissemination of best practices&#xD;
      for end-of-life care within the VA Healthcare System.&#xD;

      Anticipated Impacts on Veterans' Healthcare: The overarching goal of this research program is&#xD;
      to improve the quality of end-of-life care provided to Veterans dying in VA Medical Centers&#xD;
      (VAMCs), by transferring the best practices of home hospice and palliative care for the last&#xD;
      days and hours of life into the inpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Background: Often, patients who are near the end of life are not recognized as&#xD;
      actively dying. As a result, their suffering may not be appreciated or managed properly, and&#xD;
      may even be exacerbated by usual medical care when aggressive, futile, or iatrogenically&#xD;
      harmful treatments are continued. During this time, supportive and comfort care treatment&#xD;
      plans can be implemented to reduce suffering and improve the quality of care provided to&#xD;
      these patients. The investigative team has developed and evaluated an education-based&#xD;
      intervention to teach providers how to identify patients who are actively dying and to&#xD;
      implement care plans appropriate for the last days or hours of life. To facilitate use of&#xD;
      these interventions, an electronic Comfort Care Order Set (CCOS) was designed and integrated&#xD;
      into the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) to support and guide the selection of&#xD;
      comfort care treatments. The effectiveness of the Comfort Care Education Intervention has&#xD;
      been demonstrated in 7 VAMCs and it is ready for implementation on a broader scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Objectives: This trial will extend this line of research by examining two methods of&#xD;
      delivering this Comfort Care Education Intervention utilizing the established infrastructure&#xD;
      of Palliative Care Consult Teams (PCCT): a Basic Implementation Approach using a&#xD;
      teleconference to review educational materials and activate PCCTs to educate other providers,&#xD;
      and an Enhanced Implementation Approach utilizing in-person, train-the-&quot;champion&quot; workshops&#xD;
      to prepare PCCT members to be leaders and trainers at their home sites. The aims of this&#xD;
      study are 1) to compare the effectiveness of the two approaches for changing provider&#xD;
      behavior, as reflected in documented processes of end-of-life care, 2) to formatively&#xD;
      evaluate PCCT members' experiences with and perceptions of the two approaches, and 3) to&#xD;
      quantitatively evaluate PCCT members' perceptions of the training received and its impact on&#xD;
      attitudes, skills, and perceived efficacy to care for patients and teach other providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Methods: PCCTs at 47 VA Medical Centers will be recruited to participate in the trial&#xD;
      and randomized to receive the Comfort Care Education Intervention using the Basic or the&#xD;
      Enhanced Implementation Approach. Data on processes of end-of-life care will be abstracted&#xD;
      from the CPRS medical records of Veterans who die before and after the interventions,&#xD;
      including presence of an active opioid order at time of death (primary endpoint), other&#xD;
      medication orders and administration, do-not-resuscitate orders, palliative care consult&#xD;
      orders, location of death, presence of nasogastric tubes/intravenous lines, restraints, and&#xD;
      pastoral care. Semi-structured telephone interviews will be conducted with all participating&#xD;
      PCCT members to explore their perceptions of training, the process of teaching other&#xD;
      providers at each site, barriers and facilitators they encountered, how prepared they felt to&#xD;
      overcome these barriers, and specific needs and preferences regarding the implementation&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings will provide a robust evaluation of the implementation process, and will be used to&#xD;
      refine the Comfort Care Education Intervention and implementation strategies in preparation&#xD;
      for nationwide dissemination of best practices for end-of-life care within the VA Healthcare&#xD;
      System.&#xD;
