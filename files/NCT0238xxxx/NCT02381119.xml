  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses the challenge of increasing compliance with dietary recommendations and&#xD;
      guidelines among diabetes type 2 patients by introducing professional dietary advice based on&#xD;
      individual requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the effect of the Personalized Dietary Advice&#xD;
      Services (PDAS) after a three month intervention on established markers of nutritional and&#xD;
      health status in diabetes type 2 patients (HbA1c, glucose, insulin). Besides, the effect of&#xD;
      the PDAS on perceived health status of diabetes type 2 patients will be assessed.&#xD;

      This study will be a randomized control trial studying the effect of personalized dietary&#xD;
      advice services on established markers of nutrition and health status of diabetes type 2&#xD;
      patients. This dietary advice will be based on individual genetic, blood and food intake&#xD;
      profiles, which will be measured at the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietitian will provide this personalized dietary advice, during the regular patient&#xD;
      visits. In the control group, the dietitian will give the regular dietary advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start with a run-in period of two weeks, during which baseline measures will&#xD;
      be done. After the run-in period, the three-month study will start with a first dietary&#xD;
      consult during which the dietitian will use the personalized dietary advice services for&#xD;
      providing dietary advice in the experimental group.&#xD;
