      It is the purpose of this proposal to apply tFUS to the ventral posterior lateral (VPL)&#xD;
      nucleus of the thalamus in humans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current non-invasive neuromodulatory approaches like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&#xD;
      and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have proven efficacious for inducing&#xD;
      transient plastic changes in the human cortex. However, these technologies have poor spatial&#xD;
      resolution, suffer from a depth focality tradeoff and experience significant attenuation at&#xD;
      depth. Thus, they cannot effectively target neural tissue below the surface of the cortex.&#xD;
      Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a new and very promising non-surgical low-energy&#xD;
      technique for inducing transient plasticity with high spatial resolution, adjustable focus&#xD;
      and low tissue attenuation. tFUS has been used safely and effectively for neural stimulation&#xD;
      in mouse, rabbit and monkey and my research has shown tFUS to also be a safe and effective&#xD;
      method of transient cortical stimulation in humans. Having demonstrated its efficacy in&#xD;
      humans for cortical stimulation, the next step is to take advantage of tFUS' high spatial&#xD;
      resolution and deep focal lengths to stimulate sub-cortical neural structures. Currently, the&#xD;
      only way to stimulate sub-cortical structures involves expensive and risky surgery. It is the&#xD;
      purpose of this proposal to test tFUS for sub-cortical stimulation. The ability to&#xD;
      individually stimulate small neural structures deep to the cortex without invasive surgery&#xD;
      would have broad application in basic neuroscience for the investigation of brain structure&#xD;
      and function as well as for the potential diagnosis and therapy of many neurological and&#xD;
      psychiatric diseases.&#xD;
