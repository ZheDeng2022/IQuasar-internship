      TRIAL SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) are now enrolling patients in a phase 2&#xD;
      clinical trial to determine whether the yeast-brachyury vaccine GI-6301 improves the&#xD;
      effectiveness of radiation for patients with localized chordoma. Chordoma patients with&#xD;
      inoperable or residual tumor who do not have metastases and are planning to be treated with&#xD;
      definitive (&gt;70Gy) radiation are eligible to participate. Patients will initially be&#xD;
      randomized to receive radiation plus the vaccine or radiation plus a blinded placebo. Those&#xD;
      randomized to receive radiation plus placebo will have the option to receive vaccine if their&#xD;
      tumor grows while on the study. The study will compare the outcomes of patients treated with&#xD;
      radiation with and without the vaccine to determine whether the vaccine can increase the&#xD;
      chances of shrinking the tumor and/or preventing further tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHY THIS TRIAL IS BEING DONE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary treatment options for chordoma currently consist of surgery and high dose&#xD;
      radiation. Radiation has been shown to improve patient outcomes following surgery. Radiation&#xD;
      is also sometimes used instead of surgery when surgery would carry unacceptable risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chance of tumor growth after radiation is significantly higher for patients who have&#xD;
      residual tumor than for those whose tumor is completely removed. Unfortunately for patients&#xD;
      with a tumor that cannot be completely removed, there tends to be a short time until the&#xD;
      tumor grows back and eventually causes death. For this reason, our team at the NCI seeks to&#xD;
      identify a therapy that can reduce the risk of recurrence and improve survival after&#xD;
      radiation for patients who have residual tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach we are pursuing is treating patients with a therapeutic vaccine that is intended&#xD;
      to stimulate the immune system to fight cancer cells that express the brachyury protein.&#xD;
      Brachyury is present at very high levels in nearly all chordomas but is not present in the&#xD;
      vast majority of normal tissues, making it a promising target for immune therapy. Research in&#xD;
      other cancers suggests that radiation in combination with immune therapy can provide powerful&#xD;
      antitumor effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently completed a phase 1 clinical trial of a therapeutic vaccine targeting&#xD;
      brachyury called GI-6301 in which 11 chordoma patients participated. Through that phase I&#xD;
      trial, we learned that this vaccine can be given safely without serious adverse reactions. In&#xD;
      that study, the vaccine was also capable of inducing immune responses against brachyury and&#xD;
      one patient had his tumor shrink more than 30% while on study. Some other patients (7 of 10&#xD;
      evaluable) also had stable disease for more than 5 months while on study. However, these&#xD;
      clinical findings are not definitive and further clinical testing is required to determine&#xD;
      the benefit of this vaccine in chordoma. To that end, we have designed a larger phase 2&#xD;
      clinical trial intended to determine if this vaccine, when given in combination with&#xD;
      radiation, improves outcomes for patients with chordoma compared to those who only have&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO CAN PARTICIPATE&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have designed this trial for patients who have residual tumor remaining after surgery, who&#xD;
      are unable to have surgery, or who have a local recurrence following previous treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible for enrollment on this study, patients must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a confirmed diagnosis of chordoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have only localized tumor (no metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be able to receive at least 70 Gy of radiation to their localized tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be willing to travel to Bethesda, MD for treatment and follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOW THE TRIAL WILL WORK&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is taking place at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda,&#xD;
      MD. The NCI will pay for transportation costs (including airfare) and a portion of lodging&#xD;
      costs for patients after enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of participating in the trial is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients travel to NIH to receive injections of the vaccine (or placebo) every other&#xD;
           week for three doses prior to starting radiation (approximately 4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients then complete their radiation treatment with their home radiation oncologist&#xD;
           (typically over a 1-2 month timespan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following completion of radiation treatment plan, patients travel back to NIH to resume&#xD;
           vaccine (or placebo) injections every 2 weeks until 6 total doses have been given (3&#xD;
           doses after radiation, another 4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At that point, doses spread out to every 4 weeks for 4 doses, and then 1 dose every 3&#xD;
           months until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between all doses of vaccine, patients may return home and travel back for the next&#xD;
           visit. There is no requirement to stay locally in Bethesda at any point in the study&#xD;
           outside of clinic visits and dosing days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat imaging studies will be performed about 3 months after completion of radiatio...&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chordoma is a rare disease, affecting about 3,000 people in the United States, with&#xD;
           about 300 new cases diagnosed per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brachyury is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, characterized by a&#xD;
           highly conserved DNA-binding domain designated as T-domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brachyury is expressed universally in chordoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GI-6301 (Yeast-brachyury vaccine) has demonstrated immunogenicity with a tolerable and&#xD;
           acceptable safety profile in a phase 1 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brachyury specific T cells can lyse human cancer cells expressing brachyury in an MHC&#xD;
           restricted manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There have been indications of clinical benefit in patients with chordoma enrolled on&#xD;
           the phase I trial of GI-6301.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) 1 Partial Response&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) 1 Mixed Response in Chordoma patients who received Radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) 6 of 9 patients with progressive disease at enrollment had Stable Disease at Day 85&#xD;
      restaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      -In vitro, chordoma cell lines are killed significantly better by brachyury-specific T cells&#xD;
      after radiation exposure using either proton beam or gamma radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine if there is a difference in overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete&#xD;
      response (CR) or partial response (PR) by RECIST 1.1 after up to 24 months among patients&#xD;
      with Chordoma who are treated with radiation plus placebo vs. radiation plus vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients at least 18 years old with locally advanced (unresectable, non-metastatic)&#xD;
           chordoma who are eligible for definitive radiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No history of autoimmune disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled phase 2 clinical trial of radiation plus&#xD;
           placebo vs. radiation plus yeast-brachyury vaccine in patients with chordoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to the two arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants assigned to the placebo arm will be allowed to cross-over at time of&#xD;
           confirmed disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be evaluated for objective response, progression free survival and&#xD;
           overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 55 participants will be accrued to the study&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must meet the following criteria for participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis: Patients must have histologically confirmed chordoma by the Laboratory of&#xD;
             Pathology, NCI, which is localized (no evidence of metastatic disease), unresectable&#xD;
             and they must have planned radiation therapy, to at least one targeted lesion with&#xD;
             evidence of growth prior to enrollment. The tentative radiation plan at enrollment&#xD;
             must be in compliance with the required radiation doses. This can be given in standard&#xD;
             or hypofractionated dosing with any technique deemed most appropriate by the treating&#xD;
             radiation oncologist if other requirements are not met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have disease that is measurable by RECIST version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Fresh or archived tumor specimen must be available for correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2 at study entry&#xD;
             (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 70)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of GI-6301 (Yeast Brachyury vaccine) in patients &lt;18&#xD;
             years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future&#xD;
             pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prior Therapy: Patients must have fully recovered from prior surgery before&#xD;
             enrollment. Prior radiation therapy is allowed provided the radiation field can safely&#xD;
             irridated in the opinion of the treating radiation oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 X upper limit of normal OR creatinine&#xD;
                  clearance on a 24-h urine collection of greater than or equal to 60 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT and AST less than or equal to 3 X the upper limits of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X upper limit of normal OR in patients&#xD;
                  with Gilbert s syndrome, a total bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hematological eligibility parameters (within16 days of starting therapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
             Granulocyte count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
             Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Men and women of child-bearing potential must agree to use effective birth control or&#xD;
             abstinence during and for a period of 4 months after the last vaccination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must not have a history of yeast allergy. If patient has a questionable&#xD;
             history of allergy to yeast, a yeast skin test can be performed. Patients would be&#xD;
             eligible if skin test is negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any of the following will not be eligible for participation in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients should have no evidence of immune dysfunction as listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity due to the potential for decreased&#xD;
             immune response to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune diseases requiring treatment or a history of autoimmune disease that&#xD;
             might be stimulated by vaccine treatment. This requirement is due to the potential&#xD;
             risks of exacerbating autoimmunity. However, patients with vitiligo, diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, and Hashimoto thyroiditis on appropriate replacement therapy may be&#xD;
             enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy or untoward reaction to yeast-based products (any hypersensitivity&#xD;
             to yeast-based products will be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women, due to the unknown effects of the Yeast-brachyury&#xD;
             vaccine on the fetus or infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious intercurrent medical illness which would interfere with the ability of the&#xD;
             patient to carry out the treatment program, including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or active&#xD;
             diverticulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic hepatitis infection, including B and C, because potential immune impairment&#xD;
             caused by these disorders may diminish the effectiveness of this immunologic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may impair the&#xD;
             patient s tolerance of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would&#xD;
             prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be on systemic steroids within 4 weeks of enrolling on study with the&#xD;
             exception of physiologic replacement doses (for instance in the case of adrenal&#xD;
             insufficiency) or steroid premedication for baseline MRI and/or CT in the case of&#xD;
             subjects with known contrast dye allergies.&#xD;
