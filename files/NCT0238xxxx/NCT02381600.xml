  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Ageing is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and depression.&#xD;
      Vitamin D plays an important role in many of the symptoms and conditions related to advanced&#xD;
      age, including impaired balance, falls and osteoporosis. Vitamin D also has a physiological&#xD;
      effect on the function of the central nervous system, and studies have suggested a&#xD;
      relationship between this vitamin and changes in affect and cognitive function in the&#xD;
      elderly. The investigators propose a pilot study to examine the relationship between&#xD;
      below-normal levels of Vitamin D to affective symptoms and specific cognitive functions in&#xD;
      the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 30 subjects of both genders older than 65 years with levels of 25-OH&#xD;
      Vitamin D lower than 30 ng/ml on routine laboratory screening will be referred by the&#xD;
      treating family physicianfor screening. Subjects will be required to provide written informed&#xD;
      consent for inclusion in the study. Exclusion criteria will include any active or unstable&#xD;
      medical condition as determined by the treating physician, known neurocognitive disorder,&#xD;
      known affective disorder, the use of any class of antidepressant drugs, the use of&#xD;
      supplements containing vitamin D in any dose, significant visual or hearing impairment not&#xD;
      corrected by spectacles or hearing aids, and a level of literacy that limits cognitive&#xD;
      ability. All subjects will undergo cognitive screening by use of the MoCA test, computerized&#xD;
      cognitive assessment using the the Neurotrax (®Mindstreams) computerised cognitive assessment&#xD;
      battery, and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. All subjects will undergo repeat testing&#xD;
      for level of 25-OH Vitamin D, and where below-normal levels are confirmed patients will&#xD;
      receive a supplemental monthly oral dose of 60000 units Vitamin D administered by a nurse for&#xD;
      a period of 3 months. At 3 months subjects will undergo repeat testing for level of 25-OH&#xD;
      Vitamin D, and repeat computerized cognitive assessment using the Neurotrax Mindstreams&#xD;
      battery and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).&#xD;
