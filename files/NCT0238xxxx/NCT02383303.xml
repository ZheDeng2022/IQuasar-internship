    <textblock>
      The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families&#xD;
      (ACF) is conducting an experimental evaluation of the Assets for Independence (AFI) Program.&#xD;
      This evaluation-the first experimental evaluation of Individual Development Account (IDA)&#xD;
      projects operating under the Assets for Independence Act-will contribute importantly to&#xD;
      understanding the effects of IDA projects and IDA project features on participants. IDA&#xD;
      programs provide matching funds to participants when the savings are withdrawn to spend on&#xD;
      qualified asset purchases, most commonly homeownership, business-related expenses, or&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will build on the prior quasi-experimental AFI evaluation, as well as studies of&#xD;
      other non-AFI funded Individual Development Account (IDA) projects. While some evaluations&#xD;
      suggest that IDAs help low-income families save, rigorous experimental research is limited.&#xD;
      No experimental evaluation of AFI-funded programs has been conducted to date. Of the quasi-&#xD;
      or non-experimental studies, few have focused on AFI-funded IDAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation is being conducted in two sites, with the random assignment of 299&#xD;
      AFI-eligible cases in one site and 509 cases in the other, for a total of 808 cases. Each&#xD;
      site randomly assigned sample members to one of two groups: a control group and a treatment&#xD;
      group receiving conventional AFI services. The primary research questions the study seeks to&#xD;
      answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the impacts of AFI program participation on the outcomes it is designed to&#xD;
           address (e.g., savings and asset purchases)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the impacts of AFI program participation on other outcome domains that the&#xD;
           program might influence (e.g., material hardship, alternative financial product use,&#xD;
           economic well-being)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How do the impacts of AFI program participation vary over time and by participant&#xD;
           characteristics?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses a two-armed (treatment vs. control) experimental design. This design allows&#xD;
      the first two questions above to be addressed using a rigorous randomized approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the impact study, the evaluation includes an implementation study to describe&#xD;
      and document how the AFI program is designed, implemented and operated in the participating&#xD;
      grantee sites during the time of the study. This information will be used to provide context&#xD;
      for interpreting the findings of the impact study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Assets for Independence (AFI) evaluation is being conducted in two sites. Both sites are&#xD;
      located in major metropolitan areas of the southwestern U.S., serving client populations that&#xD;
      are 60-75 percent Hispanic. Both have some similar program features: maximum savings periods&#xD;
      of 24 months and matchable savings amounts of up to $1,000. Important for estimating design&#xD;
      feature differences, there are also key differences in program parameters: required hours of&#xD;
      financial education and IDA match rates. The sites enrolled their samples within a 19-month&#xD;
      period from January 2013 through July 2014. Sample members in each site were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to two equal-sized groups: a treatment group (those able to enter the site's IDA&#xD;
      program) and a control group (those not able to enter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact study is the primary quantitative component of the research. The data collection&#xD;
      and analysis will provide estimates of the effect of IDA participation on short- and&#xD;
      long-term client outcomes, as measured through 12-month, 36-month, and 60-month follow-up&#xD;
      periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant outcomes will be measured at the time of random assignment and 12, 36, and 60&#xD;
      months after random assignment. Measures that pertain to short-term program effects include&#xD;
      amount of savings and material hardship avoidance. These are the effects most likely to&#xD;
      emerge within the first year. Additional measures include employment status, earnings,&#xD;
      means-tested public benefit receipt, and net worth. In the long-term, effects on&#xD;
      homeownership, business ownership, and secondary education attainment are likely to emerge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An unexplored area of short-term effects of IDAs is the use of unmatched savings to meet&#xD;
      emergency needs. In the early stages of AFI participation, households may establish a savings&#xD;
      habit but may need to draw on their savings for unexpected expenditures or to offset an&#xD;
      unanticipated drop in income. The hypothesized effect of such unmatched withdrawals of IDA&#xD;
      deposits is an avoidance of material hardship in food and health. This effect will be&#xD;
      estimated using a small set of household-level survey questions, including some items drawn&#xD;
      from the adult well-being topical module of the Survey of Income and Program Participation&#xD;
      (SIPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RTI International has developed a web-based sample enrollment tool for IDA project staff at&#xD;
      each site to use in administering informed consent, a baseline questionnaire, and random&#xD;
      assignment for each study-eligible applicant. The study's 30-minute baseline questionnaire&#xD;
      gathered information in the following survey modules: demographics, use of financial&#xD;
      services, current residence, employment, household income and expenses, financial experience&#xD;
      and assets, debts, material hardship, social engagement and outlook, and locating information&#xD;
      (for purposes of re-contacting the respondent for follow-up surveys). Site-provided&#xD;
      administrative data will provide additional baseline covariates and (for treatment cases)&#xD;
      descriptive information on IDA openings, deposits, withdrawals (matched and unmatched), and&#xD;
      balances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that person-level measures are specific to the &quot;primary household member&quot;: the first&#xD;
      individual from his/her household to apply for the IDA program during the study enrollment&#xD;
      period. This person is the respondent for the baseline questionnaire and follow-up surveys.&#xD;
      If other (secondary) members of the same household subsequently apply to enter the site's IDA&#xD;
      program, they are not separately subject to random assignment (and do not add to the sample&#xD;
      count) but are regarded as having been assigned to the same sample group ( treatment or&#xD;
      control) as the primary member. Household-level outcomes are measured for the household to&#xD;
      which the primary member belongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up surveys obtain outcome and other contextual measures. The surveys take 30&#xD;
      minutes and are conducted via telephone, web, or an in-person interviewer. The respondent is&#xD;
      the primary sample member, the same individual who applied to enter the AFI project and who&#xD;
      completed the informed consent form and baseline questionnaire. The surveys obtain data on&#xD;
      outcome measures, within the same topical headings as shown earlier for the baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimation of program impacts will use conventional multivariate regression techniques as&#xD;
      appropriate to the statistical properties of the dependent variable (continuous, dichotomous,&#xD;
      or multinomial). For each outcome measure, the key parameter to be estimated is the&#xD;
      coefficient on the randomly assigned (treatment versus control) status of the case. This&#xD;
      coefficient indicates the regression-adjusted treatment-control difference in the measured&#xD;
      outcome. All estimating equations will include covariates measured through the baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire. The program effect estimated is the intent-to-treat (ITT) effect, comparing&#xD;
      the outcomes between control group cases and all treatment group cases, regardless of whether&#xD;
      the treatment case opens an IDA account. Stated otherwise, this procedure yields an estimate&#xD;
      of the effect of the offer of IDA participation, as not all treatment group members will open&#xD;
      IDAs. We will also estimate the treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) effect (i.e., the impact of&#xD;
      the program on those who complete it).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addressing the first research question--the impact of AFI participation on the outcomes it&#xD;
      is designed to address (e.g., savings and asset purchases)-we will estimate the program&#xD;
      effect separately by site as well as from the pooled sample combining data from both sites.&#xD;
      The pooled sample data will provide the study's most precise single estimate of the program&#xD;
      effect, fully utilizing all available sample observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second research question-regarding the effect on other outcome domains that the program&#xD;
      might influence (e.g., material hardship, alternative financial product use, economic&#xD;
      well-being)-will also be addressed by estimating effects on the pooled sample and separately&#xD;
      by site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under research question 3 we will test for differential program impacts by participant&#xD;
      subgroups. The subgroups of interest will be identified from the baseline data. We anticipate&#xD;
      these subgroups will reflect such differences as age, initial income level, initial&#xD;
      indebtedness, initial education level, or initial homeownership status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLEMENTATION STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation study will describe and document how the AFI project is designed,&#xD;
      implemented, and operated in the participating grantee sites. This information will provide&#xD;
      the context for understanding findings from the impact analysis. The main data collection&#xD;
      approach involved site visits to the AFI grantees that included interviews with key&#xD;
      administrators, staff, and stakeholders; observations of grantee services; and reviews of&#xD;
      relevant documents and data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The site visits to the selected AFI grantees were two days each and occurred during 2014.&#xD;
      While on site, we conducted semi-structured in-person interviews with individuals in&#xD;
      differing roles to obtain a range of perspectives on the AFI project, including IDA grantee&#xD;
      staff, financial education providers, and representatives of partner organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews examine issues related to the design and implementation of the AFI project,&#xD;
      challenges projects face and their strategies for overcoming them, and other factors that may&#xD;
      not be captured in the quantitative analysis but that may affect project outcomes. Questions&#xD;
      about design and implementation draw from information gathered during site selection, site&#xD;
      training, initial random assignments, and monitoring calls, and cover whether, how, and why&#xD;
      project changes have occurred. Through site selection and the on-site interviews with staff,&#xD;
      we obtained information on organizational stability and capacity, level of IDA project&#xD;
      complexity, number of staff and amount of staff involvement, and participant recruitment.&#xD;
      Specific questions included: What outreach activities did you conduct to inform individuals&#xD;
      of your IDA project? What forms of program support are provided to IDA accountholders? How&#xD;
      often are AFI project staff in touch with participants after they open an account? What&#xD;
      non-IDA program services were available to members of the comparison group through your&#xD;
      organization? Do you feel that that there are any important effects (positive or negative) of&#xD;
      your AFI project on participants beyond the measured outcomes we are tracking through the&#xD;
      evaluation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to asking respondents about the challenges they face, interviews with IDA project&#xD;
      administrators and staff probe further on challenges such as helping participants attain&#xD;
      realistic savings goals, navigating the requirements of diverse funding sources and&#xD;
      requirements, raising nonfederal funds, and coping with limited funds for administrative&#xD;
      costs. The interviews also explore external factors or special circumstances that may affect&#xD;
      project outcomes. This information will be vital both for interpreting the impact analysis&#xD;
      findings and for the generalizability of the findings to other sites. It will be&#xD;
      fundamentally important to understand why a program has resulted in its estimated effects on&#xD;
      participants and whether such effects could be replicated elsewhere. Finally, the interviews&#xD;
      give respondents an opportunity to identify intangible outcomes, whether positive or&#xD;
      negative, that they feel are significant but that may not be captured in the formal impact&#xD;
      analysis, and help identify participant stories to share.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the site visits, we observed financial education classes and other project-participant&#xD;
      interactions to capture what is actually happening during project service delivery.&#xD;
      Observations were guided by predetermined topics that map to the specific study issues, and&#xD;
      observers were as unobtrusive as possible. The observations will provide insights into how&#xD;
      particular project aspects may influence participant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation study also will include a document review to understand how the AFI&#xD;
      project administrative structure and project design may influence project outcomes. Written&#xD;
      documentation of the number and roles of staff and volunteers involved in the IDA project and&#xD;
      in the organization itself, project rules, and overall project goals and objectives will set&#xD;
      the context for identifying variables that could affect participant outcomes. Project&#xD;
      communication materials provided to project participants, such as recruitment flyers,&#xD;
      orientation materials, and program welcome letters, will be collected to understand project&#xD;
      messaging. In addition, we are obtaining data that the projects are collecting, such as data&#xD;
      on service take-up.&#xD;
