  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and its associated conditions have reached epidemic proportions. Estimates are that&#xD;
      about one third of the adults in the United States have obesity. At this moment there are&#xD;
      many therapeutic approaches for the treatment of obesity. But, efficacy of most treatment&#xD;
      options are limited and so far surgical intervention has been proven to be the only strategy&#xD;
      to overcome severe obesity. However, bariatric surgery has limitations and risks, which might&#xD;
      be minimized by non-incisional endoscopic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BaroSense developed a new device, called the Articulating Circular Endoscopic (ACETM)&#xD;
      Stapler, which can be used in the treatment of obesity. It is a trans-oral procedure, which&#xD;
      intends to reduce the ability of the stomach to expand by creating plications in the region&#xD;
      of the fundus and greater curvature. In contrast with other bariatric surgery it is&#xD;
      endoscopically performed, reversible and if it fails most future surgical options are still&#xD;
      open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study ('Open, prospective study to evaluate the safety and preliminary effectiveness&#xD;
      of the BaroSense ACE™ Stapler for the treatment of obesity', multicenter study (MUMC+, AMC&#xD;
      and St. Antonius), accepted by MEC AMC) seeks to determine the safety and efficacy of this&#xD;
      plicating system for patients with severe obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sub-study the investogators want to unravel the exact mechanism and provide more&#xD;
      information about the efficacy of the BaroSense ACE™ Stapler. Therefore the authors will&#xD;
      measure changes in various parameters that are known to affect weight loss and metabolism,&#xD;
      before and after gastric plication (by using the BaroSense ACE™ Stapler) in overweight&#xD;
      subjects (these parameters will only be measured in patients at MUMC+). These parameters are&#xD;
      post-prandial satiety, food-reward and related brain signalling, gastric emptying, behaviour&#xD;
      towards food, food intake, satiety hormone release, microbiota composition and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the present study will be to assess the effect of the BaroSense ACE™ stapler on&#xD;
      postprandial satiety, food-reward and related brain signalling, gastric emptying, behaviour&#xD;
      towards food, food intake, hormone release, microbiota composition and inflammatory markers.&#xD;
