  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hallux valgus can be defined as a progressive subluxation of the first metatarsophalangeal&#xD;
      joint and lateral deviation of the hallux. This common foot condition is associated with&#xD;
      altered gait patterns. Specifically reduced forward propulsion, leading to gait instability.&#xD;
      Research has shown that foot problems and pain play a major role towards the contribution of&#xD;
      falls in the adult population. There are currently two main interventions for the treatment&#xD;
      of hallux valgus: surgery and orthotic prescription. There has not been a lot of research&#xD;
      performed evaluating the effects of custom orthotic prescription on hallux valgus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will investigate adults with moderate hallux valgus and the effects of&#xD;
      orthotic intervention on the efficacy of forward propulsion during walking. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that implementation of an orthotic will lead to decreased foot pain, an increase&#xD;
      in step length, an increase in the forward moment about the ankle and hallux, and a more&#xD;
      medial center of pressure tracking through the great toe instead of the lesser metatarsals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of 10 adults. The participant will go through three rounds of testing&#xD;
      in the lab. The first session will consist of initial baseline testing in which each&#xD;
      participant will be evaluated for severity of Hallux Valgus and range of motion of the first&#xD;
      metatarsophalangeal joint. A foot casting will then be performed by a pedorthist and the&#xD;
      participant will be set up with markers, so as to record motion while they perform 15 walking&#xD;
      trials across a 10m runway with a force plate embedded in the middle whilst wearing standard&#xD;
      footwear (no orthotic). The second lab session will consist of the standard footwear (no&#xD;
      orthotic) walking as well as the addition of standard footwear with custom orthotic walking.&#xD;
      The third session, after having worn the orthotic for two weeks, will repeat both conditions&#xD;
      measured in the second lab session. Data about the center of pressure trajectories, step&#xD;
      length, foot pain, and the moments about the ankle and first metatarsophalangeal joints will&#xD;
      be collected and calculated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants will enter the lab three times. On their first session, the level of&#xD;
      severity of hallux valgus of the participant will be identified. The participant will sit in&#xD;
      a chair, with their bare feet resting on the ground. A picture of their foot will be taken in&#xD;
      the transverse plane. Another picture will then be taken of the foot when the individual is&#xD;
      in a standing position. The participant will not experience any pain or discomfort during&#xD;
      this test as only 2 pictures will be taken of the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will then have range of motion testing performed on their first&#xD;
      metatarsophalangeal joint. This will be performed by the researcher passively dorsiflexing&#xD;
      the first metatarsophalangeal joint and measuring the angle created with a goniometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will also have an orthotic foot casting performed by a pedorthist. This foot&#xD;
      casting will be performed to create a mould of the foot that will be used by a pedorthist to&#xD;
      construct the orthotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participant put on the standard footwear (no orthotic) they will be set up with&#xD;
      optotrak markers with three on the first ray, three on the midfoot, three on the heel, and&#xD;
      three on the medial distal tibia. Then the participant will walk across a 10m walkway with a&#xD;
      force plate embedded half way along the walkway at a constant velocity for a total of 15&#xD;
      trials. The participant will rate their pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS) immediately&#xD;
      following the completion of the 15 walking trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second session, the participant will once again be set up with optotrak marker and&#xD;
      will perform 15 walking trials with the standard footwear (no orthotics) and rate their pain&#xD;
      level on the VAS. The custom orthotic will be placed in the standard footwear. Then the&#xD;
      participant will perform 15 walking trials and rate their pain on the VAS. The participant&#xD;
      will then be instructed to wear the orthotic for seven hours a day, seven days a week for two&#xD;
      weeks. During this two week period, the principal investigator will call the participant&#xD;
      once, after about 1 week, to ask about how the orthotic wear is going. In specific, how often&#xD;
      they have been wearing it and for how long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks later, the participant will return for their final testing session. This session&#xD;
      will consist of a repetition of the 15 walking trials and vas ratings with both the standard&#xD;
      footwear (no orthotic) and the standard footwear with the custom orthotic. The participant&#xD;
      will then be debriefed and offered the opportunity to opt to have a summary of the results&#xD;
      when the study is completed sent to them. They will be allowed to keep the custom orthotic.&#xD;
