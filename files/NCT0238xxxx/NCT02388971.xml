  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of MLN1202 on arterial inflammation in&#xD;
      participants with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) who are receiving&#xD;
      standard-of-care (SOC) therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called MLN1202. MLN1202 is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study will look at&#xD;
      changes in arterial inflammation in people who take MLN1202 in addition to standard-of-care&#xD;
      (SOC) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 108 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain&#xD;
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent&#xD;
      medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MLN1202 Dose A intravenously (IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (dummy inactive solution) - this is a solution that looks like the study drug&#xD;
           but has no active ingredient&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive IV administration of MLN1202 or placebo on Day 1, Day 29, and&#xD;
      Day 57 of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is 19 weeks. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic, and&#xD;
      will be contacted by telephone approximately 35 days after last dose of study drug for a&#xD;
      follow-up assessment.&#xD;
