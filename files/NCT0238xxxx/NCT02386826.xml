  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of two agents, INC280 and&#xD;
      bevacizumab, is safe and effective when administered to patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme&#xD;
      (GBM) who have progressed after receiving prior therapy or who have unresectable GBM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains an incurable malignancy with a&#xD;
      short expected survival. c-MET signalling promotes invasive growth and has been described in&#xD;
      various cancers. INC280 is a highly potent and selective c-MET inhibitor which also&#xD;
      penetrates the blood-brain barrier. In this open-label, multicenter Phase 1b study,&#xD;
      investigators determined the optimal dose of the INC280/bevacizumab combination to administer&#xD;
      to patients. Enrollment has now expanded in order to treat 3 cohorts of GBM patients: those&#xD;
      who progressed after ≥ first-line standard therapy, those who progressed after ≥ second-line&#xD;
      therapy with INC280/bevacizumab, and those with unresectable GBM.&#xD;
