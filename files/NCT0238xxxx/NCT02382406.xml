    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study for previously untreated subjects with advanced NSCLC. The study&#xD;
      will take place in two phases. First, a cohort of twelve participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      phase I part and will be treated with carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel and pembrolizumab. A cohort&#xD;
      of twelve subjects will be evaluated for safety and tolerability after 2 cycles of therapy.&#xD;
      All subjects who receive either nab-paclitaxel or pembrolizumab will be evaluable. If 33% of&#xD;
      subjects or less have unacceptable toxicity in the first cohort or any subsequent cohort (if&#xD;
      necessary), the study will proceed to the Phase II part. If more than 33% have unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, 12 additional subjects will be enrolled in a second cohort, if necessary. If&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity is seen in more than 33% in Cohort 2, the study will end due to&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity of this drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II part of the study is a single arm study. All subjects will be treated with&#xD;
      carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab in 21-day cycles for up to 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandatory pre-treatment tumor biopsies will be obtained prior to initiating treatment for all&#xD;
      subjects (only if adequate archived samples are unavailable). Mandatory tumor biopsies will&#xD;
      be obtained in the Phase II part of the study after 4 cycles of study treatment or at the&#xD;
      time of progression, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects without progression of disease after Cycle 4, pembrolizumab will continue every&#xD;
      3 weeks for up to 2 years or until unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

             subjects must be willing to consent to providing a pre-treatment biopsy for PD-L1&#xD;
             testing. Regardless of PD-L1 testing status, archival tissue will be requested for&#xD;
