      TB038 is a clinical study to assess the non-specific effects of BCG vaccination and gain a&#xD;
      better understanding of how the body's immune system reacts to BCG and in turn potentially&#xD;
      prevents infection from other bacteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since 1927, it has been observed that BCG-vaccinated neonates have lower all-cause mortality&#xD;
      rates. This heterologous or non-specific effect within the first 6-12 months of life has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in randomised and observational studies in low income countries with high&#xD;
      childhood mortality rates. The most consistent effect is reduced neonatal mortality due to&#xD;
      fewer cases of neonatal sepsis, respiratory infection and fever. The main limitation of these&#xD;
      studies is the risk of confounding inherent in their cross sectional and observational&#xD;
      designs. It is essential that we determine the cogency of this effect, as potential BCG&#xD;
      replacement vaccines must be non-inferior to BCG in this regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a plausible rationale that BCG, a replicating mycobacterium, is capable of inducing&#xD;
      non-specific innate immunity, which could induce protection against disease and death from&#xD;
      non-mycobacterial infections early in life. For example, intravesical BCG is an effective&#xD;
      treatment for bladder cancer, an effect presumed to be non-specific and innate. However, our&#xD;
      understanding of the immunological mechanisms involved is incomplete. Data is needed from&#xD;
      robust experiments to quantify any causal relationship between infant survival and BCG&#xD;
      vaccination. Demonstrating an effect of recent BCG vaccination on the growth of common&#xD;
      bacterial pathogens involved in neonatal sepsis, using whole blood in an in-vitro human&#xD;
      model, would provide evidence to support a randomised controlled trial in infants in TB high&#xD;
      burden countries and would impact on public health vaccination scheduling. In addition it&#xD;
      would provide us with an in-vitro model by which to assess future BCG replacement vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy BCG naïve adults in the UK have been selected for this study because of their low&#xD;
      baseline level of anti-mycobacterial immunity and therefore reduced ability to suppress BCG&#xD;
      growth. Whilst the target population for the heterologous effects of BCG vaccination is&#xD;
      infants, the blood volume required in order to optimise the GIA would not be possible to&#xD;
      collect from infants. Therefore by undertaking this work in healthy BCG naïve UK adults we&#xD;
      can obtain the blood volumes required for this exploratory work in a population of&#xD;
      individuals with a similar background mycobacterial exposure to infants in TB high burden,&#xD;
      low income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers in this study will receive BCG vaccination at the standard dose of 2-8x10^5 cfu.&#xD;
      BCG SSI containing Mycobacterium bovis strain Danish 1331 is preferred as it is licensed in&#xD;
      the UK for vaccination. However BCG SSI can frequently go into short supply globally with&#xD;
      impact on UK supply. In the event of this occurring, BCG vaccine supplied by the Sii (Serum&#xD;
      institute of India) will be used instead which contains Mycobacterium bovis BCG strain Moscow&#xD;
      361 I and is on the WHO list of prequalified vaccines. The same strain will be used for all&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
