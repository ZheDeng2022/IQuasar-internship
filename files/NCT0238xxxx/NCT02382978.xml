      This study will test whether or not nurses can provide well child care in a&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary primary health care team without physicians also seeing the children at&#xD;
      pre-scheduled well child care visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will deploy a mixed-methods convergent parallel design19, using quantitative&#xD;
      methods as well as qualitative data gathering and analyses. To test the acceptability and&#xD;
      satisfaction of the care received, interviews with patients and health care team members will&#xD;
      investigate attitudes and experiences of patients and care providers. To explore the&#xD;
      effectiveness and efficiency of nurse-led WCC, interviews and chart audits will assess the&#xD;
      quality of care provided, and costs in terms of time and team resources involved. These two&#xD;
      methods will occur simultaneously and the results will be integrated and reported together to&#xD;
      give an overall view of the feasibility of nurse-provided WCC within the Bruyere/Primrose&#xD;
      FHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: There will be 2 cohorts of participants. The first cohort will consist of the health&#xD;
      care professionals involved, namely the family physicians and nurses from the&#xD;
      Bruyere/Primrose FHT who agree to participate and whose patients will be invited to join the&#xD;
      research study. The second cohort of participants will consist of parents of well children&#xD;
      who will be asked to have a nurse provide WCC during the pilot project. The eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most responsible provider agrees to appropriateness for inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  born at term and from uncomplicated pregnancy and birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  normal physical growth and development to date&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no parental post-partum depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aged between 6 weeks and 4 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  due for WCC visits in the study period Recruitment: The appointment schedules and panels&#xD;
           of participating FHT physicians will be reviewed to identify eligible children due or&#xD;
           scheduled for a visit. The potential participants will be contacted by phone 1-4 weeks&#xD;
           prior to their visit, by the research assistant, and have the project explained to them&#xD;
           with an invitation to participate or continue with their usual care. If a parent agrees,&#xD;
           verbal informed consent over the phone will be obtained. Consenting patients will be&#xD;
           offered the nurse intervention on arrival for their scheduled appointment, with the&#xD;
           option of seeing their family physician afterwards. They will sign an informed consent&#xD;
           form prior to the visit, which will also ask for interest in participating in follow-up&#xD;
           interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: A proposed work-flow model for nurse-led WCC will be developed, informed by&#xD;
      both the literature review and competency-mapping exercise as well as with discussions with&#xD;
      the participating FHT physicians and nurses to ensure feasibility and buy-in. It is very&#xD;
      likely that the nurses will use the Rourke Baby Record, a standardized and validated template&#xD;
      for well child visits, endorsed for use by the College of Family Physicians of Canada20, and&#xD;
      used by many physicians at the Bruyere/Primrose clinics. FHT team members of all disciplines&#xD;
      will be asked to review the work-flow model during a consultation session to provide&#xD;
      feedback, buy-in, and validation. The plan will then be tested with a selected cohort of&#xD;
      infants and children and adjustments will be made according to feedback and previously&#xD;
      unanticipated issues. The pilot project will then commence and run for a 9-month period to&#xD;
      allow for multiple visits with the same patients, recall of patients requiring specific WCC&#xD;
      tasks and possibly alternating visits with the nurse and the family physician. The goal is to&#xD;
      perform 50 nurse WCC visits within the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: To address our secondary research question, semi-structured interviews will&#xD;
      explore the acceptability of nurse-provided WCC for parents, nurses and physicians at the&#xD;
      Bruyere/Primrose FHT, focusing on potential facilitators and barriers to the introduction of&#xD;
      such a model of care. Interviews will be held with the provider cohort before and after the&#xD;
      intervention phase, and with patients after the nurse WCC visit. Interviews will stopped when&#xD;
      theme saturation is achieved or 10 providers and 20 patients have been interviewed, which&#xD;
      ever comes first. The interview guide will be developed by the research team using&#xD;
      information from the literature review, the competency mapping-exercise and the consultations&#xD;
      with the FHT members around recruitment and work-flow planning (see Appendix B for potential&#xD;
      interview questions). To further assess the acceptability and feasibility of nurse led WCC,&#xD;
      the investigators will compile initial participation rates (percentage of patients contacted&#xD;
      who accepted the nurse WCC) and continuation rates (percentage of participants who were&#xD;
      eligible for additional visits and who agree to at another nurse-led WCC visit within the&#xD;
      study period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to provide quantitative data about the acceptability of nurse-provided WCC, the&#xD;
      electronic medical records of participants at the Bruyere/Primrose FHT will be searched for&#xD;
      quality indicators such as immunization rates, WCC visits attended by eligible patients, the&#xD;
      use of standard developmental questionnaires (eg. the Nippissing District Developmental&#xD;
      Screen), the completion of a template like the Rourke Baby Record, the proper documentation&#xD;
      of growth parameters, the frequency of visits during the study period, and appropriate&#xD;
      follow-up plans according to the WCC visit findings. Further or different indicators may be&#xD;
      selected, based on the competency-mapping exercise currently underway. Using the same data&#xD;
      extraction sheet developed for the participants' chart audit, similar data will be extracted&#xD;
      from a randomly selected age-matched cohort of control subjects not offered the intervention&#xD;
      and compared for the nine months before the intervention and during the 9 month study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: The transcripts of the semi-structured interviews will be anonymized and then read&#xD;
      by several members of the research team, including the investigators. A coding template will&#xD;
      be developed based on the literature review and study objectives and may be iteratively&#xD;
      adapted during the initial interviews to allow for emerging themes. Thematic analysis will be&#xD;
      used to code the data, at first creating many codes, which will then be grouped and collapsed&#xD;
      into major themes and sub-themes21. At analysis meetings, the entire research team will&#xD;
      review the codes, themes and sub-themes to reach consensus about how the data answers the&#xD;
      question of feasibility and acceptability of nurse-provided WCC. To ensure rigour, these&#xD;
      themes will be compared to findings from the literature review and chart audit, triangulated&#xD;
      and then, final conclusions will be drawn22, 23, 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data from the chart audit will be analyzed using SPSS 21 and descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be generated to compare proportions receiving recommended care across the two&#xD;
      groups pre- and post-intervention. Our hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the&#xD;
      appropriate care manoeuvres received between the control group and the intervention group.&#xD;
      Patient characteristics will be summarized and reported by group. Discrete variables will be&#xD;
      summarized using frequencies and proportions. Comparisons of discrete variables between&#xD;
      groups will be made by using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. As this is a&#xD;
      pilot project, the investigators do not expect to be powered to detect a significant&#xD;
      difference in care but these results will be used to triangulate the findings from the&#xD;
      qualitative data about appropriate care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation rates will be calculated based on the proportion of invited patients who&#xD;
      participate in the intervention. Completion rates will be calculated to determine what&#xD;
      proportion of those who start with nurse-provided WCC continue with the intervention for all&#xD;
      of their visits during the full duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The quantitative and qualitative results will be integrated and reported together to&#xD;
      provide a description on the feasibility and acceptability, as well as the efficacy compared&#xD;
      to usual care of nurse-provided WCC.&#xD;
