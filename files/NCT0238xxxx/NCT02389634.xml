      The purpose of the study is to identify novel genetic and protein markers for the process of&#xD;
      cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral vasospasm is a recognized and poorly understood complication for many patients who&#xD;
      have aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Constriction of the cerebral arterial vasculature&#xD;
      occurs as free subarachnoid blood under high pressure comes into contact with the surfaces of&#xD;
      vessels, particularly in the basal cisterns. However, the exact pathophysiology of vasospasm&#xD;
      is unknown. Morbidity and mortality rates for vasospasm are high despite improvements in&#xD;
      management. Excluding the initial hemorrhage, cerebral vasospasm is recognized as the main&#xD;
      cause of substantial disability and death. Cerebral vasospasm kills 7% of patients, and&#xD;
      causes severe deficit in another 7%. Cerebral vasospasm almost never occurs before day 3, has&#xD;
      maximal incidence at days 6-8, and rarely occurs after day 17. The disorder is clinically&#xD;
      characterized by confusion or decreased consciousness with focal neurological deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental evidence suggests that red blood cell hemolysis and subsequent release of&#xD;
      oxygen, hemoglobin, reactive oxygen species, and other as yet undescribed mediators are&#xD;
      necessary for the development of vasospasm. The goal of this study is to use modern tools of&#xD;
      genomics to identify novel molecular markers for the process of vasospasm by studying the&#xD;
      release of micro ribonucleic acids (RNA) that are secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      following the initiation of vasospastic cascades. Micro RNA's have recently been identified&#xD;
      as important regulators of many cellular processes including cell cycle progression,&#xD;
      proliferation, tumor suppressors, oncogenes, and regulators of metabolic pathways. The&#xD;
      researchers propose to study the levels of annotated micro RNA's in the cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF) of patients who present with subarachnoid hemorrhage from presentation through the&#xD;
      hospital stay. The researchers will correlate the level of these micro RNA's with patient&#xD;
      clinical presentation, including transcranial Doppler measurements, Glasgow Coma Scale score,&#xD;
      vital signs, and angiographic studies. It is well established that the process of vasospasm&#xD;
      occurs over the course of many days. Long before vasospasm becomes clinically evident,&#xD;
      cellular processes causing spasm are in action and the researchers hope to identify micro RNA&#xD;
      mediators of these processes using high throughput screening methods.&#xD;
