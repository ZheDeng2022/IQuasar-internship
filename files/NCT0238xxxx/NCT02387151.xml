      This study will test whether selected allogeneic bone marrow derived MSCs are safe by&#xD;
      assessing the composite end point Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection (BPAR)/ graft loss at 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease. However, despite advances in immunosuppressive therapy, long-term allograft&#xD;
      survival outcomes have not improved over the last decade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising novel therapeutic immunosuppressive option in the treatment of renal recipients&#xD;
      with a profound effect on the fibrosis reaction is the clinical application of mesenchymal&#xD;
      stromal cells (MSCs). Allogeneic MSCs offer the advantage of availability for clinical use&#xD;
      without the delay required for expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is believed that allo MSCs are immune privileged, they could possibly elicit an&#xD;
      anti-donor immune response, which may increase the incidence of rejection/ graft loss and&#xD;
      impact the allograft survival on the long term. These safety issues should be studied before&#xD;
      further studies are planned with allogeneic MSCs in the transplant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSCs are infused at a time point when immune suppression is lowered and the kidney is at&#xD;
      increased risk for developing immune mediated injury. In addition, a large amount of the&#xD;
      kidneys already has signs of fibrosis at this time point and MSCs might reduce the fibrosis&#xD;
      which so importantly affects long term survival. MSCs will have no Human Leucocyte Antigen&#xD;
      (HLA) sharing with the mismatches of the donor and the recipient should have no antibodies&#xD;
      directed to the MSCs to reduce the anti-donor immune respons risk.&#xD;
