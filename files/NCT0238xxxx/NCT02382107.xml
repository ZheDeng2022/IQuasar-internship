  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and especially the detection of drug resistance of&#xD;
      tuberculosis mycobacteria can be time consuming and costly. New and rapid diagnostic tests&#xD;
      are needed to improve early case detection and correct initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the planned cross-sectional diagnostic evaluation study the investigators are aiming for&#xD;
      the assessment of several new TB diagnostics (e.g. new AID strip assays and TrDNA assay in&#xD;
      urine) in TB suspects who are presenting themselves to the pulmonary ambulance (TB dispensary&#xD;
      for sector 4) at the Marius Nasta Institute (MNI). The study will be conducted in a&#xD;
      co-operation between the MNI and the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 400 TB suspects will be consecutively screened for their eligibility for participation&#xD;
      in the study. In those who are eligible (according to the criteria listed above) to&#xD;
      participate, 2 sputum samples and one urine will be collected for standard diagnostic testing&#xD;
      for TB in sputum (smear, Line Probe Assays and culture methods, as defined in the national&#xD;
      guidelines) and for the evaluation of the new assays; one blood sample will be collected for&#xD;
      analysis of lipoprotein profiles in serum of TB patients. Further, a HIV test and a clinical&#xD;
      examination will be performed in all study subjects. Information on risk factors for TB&#xD;
      disease (co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, co-medication such as steroids and risk&#xD;
      behaviour such as smoking) will be also documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All TB tests results and data which are generated in the study will be collected on&#xD;
      standardized study forms and entered in a password-secured data base. TB tests results will&#xD;
      be also shared with the medical staff treating the patients who are participating in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One follow up visit will be performed after 8 weeks in order to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      progress of the participants, either on TB treatment (if TB was confirmed) or alternative&#xD;
      therapy, in participants who were not diagnosed with TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The isolated TB strains will be sent to the Research Center Borstel in Germany for evaluation&#xD;
      through sequencing and phenotypic methods. The remnants of collected samples will be stored&#xD;
      in the National TB Laboratory for future evaluations of new tests.&#xD;
