  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at air quality in cabs and see if the air quality inside&#xD;
      taxi cabs is connected to increased risks for lung and heart health problems. Another purpose&#xD;
      of the study is to see if putting an air filter inside the car may help improve the air&#xD;
      quality and lower health risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is important because air pollution can be harmful to health. Air pollution is made up of&#xD;
      very tiny particles (things) floating in the air around us, called particulate matter.&#xD;
      Particulate matter is made up of dust, smoke, dirt, and gas fumes and can get into our bodies&#xD;
      as we breathe. It has been linked to risk for lung cancer and heart disease. It is important&#xD;
      because taxi drivers spend many hours of their day inside their cars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope that this study will help them find out if using air filters inside&#xD;
      cabs will help lower the levels of pollution in cabs and reduce its effects on the health of&#xD;
      taxi drivers. They will use these results to educate the taxi driver community.&#xD;

      DRIIVE (Data and Research on Interventions to Improve the Vehicular Environment) is a&#xD;
      community-engaged translational pilot project that will utilize a three parallel arm design&#xD;
      to obtain preliminary data on associations between Particulate Matter (PM)/air pollution and&#xD;
      physiologic measurements and biomarkers in taxi drivers, and to determine the impact of a&#xD;
      HEPA filter (to remove PM and volatile organic compounds) intervention on such physiologic&#xD;
      measurements and biomarkers. DRIIVE is funded by the New York State Department of Health&#xD;
      Empire Clinical Research Investigator Program (ECRIP), which trains physicians in clinical&#xD;
      research in New York. Drivers will be randomized to one of two groups: Intervention or&#xD;
      Wait-list Control. In total, two groups of 14 participants in each group will be recruited:&#xD;
      1) Wait List Control group, who will receive a HEPA filter at the end of the 1 month&#xD;
      participation period, and 2) Intervention group, who will receive a HEPA filter two weeks&#xD;
      into their participation period. The project will be completed within a 2 year timeframe.&#xD;
