      The study aims to get an insight on the causative bacteria of sepsis derived from the urinary&#xD;
      tract. Furthermore, it is the intention to understand the outcomes of these patients. For&#xD;
      this purpose a non-interventional, observational study will be conducted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, non-interventional, observational registry participants diagnosed with&#xD;
      urosepsis will be registered to the study to capture the events and outcomes of interest.&#xD;
      There will be no additional intervention and evaluation for the purpose of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pathogens: Causative pathogens and their susceptibility profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical outcomes: Development of organ failure and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Costs: Hospital resources used and costs acquired&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Risk factors: Influence of patient characteristics (medical &amp; urological history,&#xD;
           comorbidities) on severity of urosepsis (simple, severe &amp; septic shock), causative&#xD;
           pathogens profile and outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Appropriateness of antibiotic treatment: The influence of appropriate antibiotic&#xD;
           treatment, identified through empirical treatment provided and the pre-treatment culture&#xD;
           results, on the clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Economic evaluation: Identify the cost and health state changes according to&#xD;
           appropriateness of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Rationale: Results of the GPIU registries 2003 to 2013 showed, that the rate of&#xD;
           urosepsis in &quot;health-care&quot; associated infections of urological patients increased from&#xD;
           15% in 2003 to 25% in 2013. This creates an extra burden of health systems that needs to&#xD;
           be better understood in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Early management in urosepsis is imperative. An important step of the management is&#xD;
           appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment that requires an understanding of local and&#xD;
           global pathogen susceptibility profiles. Furthermore, our pilot analysis from GPIU has&#xD;
           shown that individual patient characteristics can be helpful in guiding empirical&#xD;
           treatment. Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment has shown to be associated with&#xD;
           better clinical outcomes and lower length of stay (LOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of this registry is to investigate the epidemiology of urosepsis primarily in&#xD;
           Europe, with specific examination of causative pathogens and their resistance, the&#xD;
           associated risk factors, clinical data, costs associated and value of initial&#xD;
           appropriate antimicrobial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1. Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Describe the prevalence of organisms causing urosepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Describe the susceptibility profile of organisms causing urosepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Describe the clinical and economic burden of urosepsis caused by resistant Gram&#xD;
           negative pathogens of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Characterize risk factors for infection with resistant gram negative pathogens of&#xD;
                interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Examine the impact of initial inappropriate antibiotic therapy on clinical and&#xD;
                economic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a prospective, longitudinal data collection as an ancillary registry to the 2013&#xD;
           Global Prevalence of Infections in Urology (GPIU) point prevalence registry performed&#xD;
           annually by the European Association of Urology (European Section of Infection in&#xD;
           Urology). Participating hospitals will perform data collection with a goal of collecting&#xD;
           complete hospital course data on 600 cases of urosepsis. The GPIU group will handle&#xD;
           contracting, data collection, and data analysis for this part of the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           The population to be observed will be adults patients with clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
           urosepsis. Observations will be initiated when a patient is diagnosed with urosepsis&#xD;
           based on the clinical symptoms and findings as part of routine clinic practice through&#xD;
           emergency and accident, urology or internal medicine units.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data of the bacterial isolates and their susceptibility results used in this study&#xD;
           will be obtained as part of routine clinical care. The necessity of informed patient&#xD;
           consent is at the discretion of the participating institution. All patient data will be&#xD;
           analyzed anonymously.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Patients to be observed&#xD;
&#xD;
           Identification of observations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients to be observed will be identified through emergency and accident, urology,&#xD;
           intensive care and internal medicine units at participating sites. Eligibility criteria&#xD;
           checklist of all cases considered to be observed will be filled in by participating&#xD;
           principal investigator (PI). Clinical information from the initial diagnosis should be&#xD;
           used to asses eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Observations Diagnosis observations&#xD;
&#xD;
           Routine clinical signs and symptoms assessed by the managing physician should be used to&#xD;
           evaluate the patient. The following observations should be carried out at the time of&#xD;
           diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Microbiology cultures&#xD;

           treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment unit&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post-treatment observations&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subsequent to initiation of treatment the following observations will be registered:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • End organ failure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Shift in treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
           Registration will be carried out on post diagnosis day 3,7,9 and 30 to capture the&#xD;
           changes within the following time-gaps respectively:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diagnosis day to day 3&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post diagnosis day 4 to 7&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post diagnosis day 8 to 9&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post diagnosis day 10 to 30&#xD;
&#xD;
           For patients where treatment extends beyond 30 days additional registrations will be&#xD;
           carried out only when there is a change in the listed post-treatment observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Completion of treatment - observations&#xD;
&#xD;
           When treatment of patients is finalized due to either complete resolution of sepsis or&#xD;
           death the following observations will be carried out:&#xD;

                mean, standard deviation, range, and median. Categorical data will be expressed as&#xD;
                counts and percentages of patients in the categories. Chi-square or Fisher's tests&#xD;
                will be used to test for statistical differences in categorical variables and T- or&#xD;
                Mann-Whitney tests will be utilized for determination of statistical differences in&#xD;
                continuous variables where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Management The GPIU study team will provide support for the participating centers.&#xD;
                The secretarial staff at the EAU-Research foundation will provide clerical support&#xD;
                to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Administration, logistics &amp; quality assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sharing of observations&#xD;
&#xD;
           Electronic (e) case report forms (CRF) will be used for collection of observational&#xD;
           information. EAU-RF will and study coordinator will provide guidance to sites to aid the&#xD;
           completion of the eCRFs. The study scientific group reserves the right to amend or add&#xD;
           to the eCRF template as appropriate. Such changes to not constitute a protocol amendment&#xD;
           and revised or additional forms should be used by sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Central data monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
           After eCRFs are completed by the study site, the study coordinator will review it for&#xD;
           protocol compliance, and for inconsistencies and missing values.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Should any missing data or data abnormalities be found, queries will be raised for&#xD;
           resolution by the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any systematic inconsistencies identified through central data monitoring may be subject&#xD;
           to queries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Definition of end of registry:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The end of the study will be the date of the last observation captured.&#xD;
