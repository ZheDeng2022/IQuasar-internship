      Mirror therapy will consist of observing the unaffected limb reflected in a mirror positioned&#xD;
      in the midline to block the view of the affected limb. All therapy sessions will be&#xD;
      supervised by a physical therapist with the exception of weekends when the patients will&#xD;
      continue therapy on an independent basis. In an effort to objectively demonstrate cortical&#xD;
      reorganization associated with mirror therapy, patients can elect to participate in a&#xD;
      functional MRI (fMRI) portion of the study. The fMRI would be evaluated prior to initiating&#xD;
      the experimental or control therapy (Due to the sensitive timeline in this population and its&#xD;
      effect on recruitment, we have amended the protocol to allow recruitment and enrollment to&#xD;
      take place even if the timeline does not allow for the fMRI to be executed 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
      amputation. Though this would be ideal, we will accept subjects that are only available for&#xD;
      day before amputation scans), just before the operative procedure, at four weeks&#xD;
      post-operation and then again at one year. All subjects will be evaluated at 4 weeks, 8 weeks&#xD;
      (functional physical therapy (PT) tests only) 12 weeks, and 12 months postoperatively to&#xD;
      determine 1) the incidence, severity and functional impact of phantom limb pain 2)the ability&#xD;
      to meet various specialists' endpoints, to include participation in physical therapy, and 3)&#xD;
      overall quality of life which the patients can describe subjectively. This therapy could have&#xD;
      a dramatic impact on the long term prognosis of amputees whether due to trauma, metabolic&#xD;
      conditions, tumor, or peripheral vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will include performing fMRIs on a cohort of healthy, active duty, age matched,&#xD;
      male personnel to create reference data to compare the fMRI data of study participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects scheduled for amputation will be randomized to either receive perioperative plasma&#xD;
      ball (sham) or mirror therapy, which involves a daily session of 30 minutes of performing&#xD;
      physical therapy exercises using either a mirror or plasma ball under the supervision of a&#xD;
      certified physical therapist. Subjects scheduled to undergo limb amputation who opt in for&#xD;
      the fMRI portion of the study will undergo a pre-treatment baseline fMRI (2 weeks prior to&#xD;
      scheduled amputation, if possible, but as late as 1 day pre-operative), a post-mirror or sham&#xD;
      therapy (preoperative-day before) fMRI, post-operative fMRI at 4 weeks and one year.&#xD;
      Performing a baseline fMRI prior to any treatment, will provide objective data regarding the&#xD;
      location and extent of cortical involvement prior to initiating mirror therapy. Those&#xD;
      subjects randomized to the mirror therapy limb will undergo 14 days of daily mirror therapy&#xD;
      sessions preoperatively which will consist of observing the unaffected limb reflected for 30&#xD;
      minutes in a mirror positioned in the midline to block the view of the affected limb. Those&#xD;
      randomized to standard therapy will participate in an equivalent period of time undergoing a&#xD;
      sham therapy with a 22&quot; plasma globe involving contralateral limb interaction with the&#xD;
      sphere. All therapy sessions will be supervised by a physical therapist with the exception of&#xD;
      weekends when the patients will continue therapy on an independent basis. The subjects will&#xD;
      then undergo a repeat fMRI (or first baseline, depending if pre-operative fMRI was possible)&#xD;
      after completion of preoperative mirror or sham therapies and prior to surgical amputation to&#xD;
      evaluate for changes suggestive of mirror therapy induced normalization in cortical patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subject group will undergo 3 questionnaires and one functional fMRI exam. Imaging&#xD;
      protocol will be identical to preoperative imaging protocol for amputation subjects. This&#xD;
      data will aid in establishing baseline fMR activation values for all fMR paradigms tested.&#xD;
      The control group will not be randomized to receive either perioperative plasma ball (sham)&#xD;
      or mirror therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Subjects scheduled for surgery will then undergo amputation under the anesthetic&#xD;
      technique of provider choice. If regional/neuraxial anesthetic techniques are used they will&#xD;
      be standardized up to 1 day preoperative and 3 days postoperative. If using dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      and/or ketamine infusions, their use will be limit to intraoperative periods at doses of 0.2&#xD;
      mcg/kg/hr and 0.15mg/kg/hr limit respectively. Anesthesiologist/Anesthetist choice will be&#xD;
      permitted for all other intraoperative and postoperative meds. Within 1 week of amputation&#xD;
      subjects will again repeat 14 days of their respectively assigned therapy limbs as described&#xD;
      above in addition to routine post amputation care. All subjects will then be evaluated at&#xD;
      four weeks postoperatively with measures delineated in section 5.(Statistics) to determine 1)&#xD;
      incidence and severity of phantom limb pain 2) participation in therapy and ability to meet&#xD;
      functional endpoints 3) quality of life. These same measures will be assessed at 12 weeks (3&#xD;
      months) and again at one year post procedure. A repeat fMRI will be obtained in those&#xD;
      Subjects participating in the fMRI limb in order to evaluate how the postoperative cortical&#xD;
      mapping compares to prior preoperative and postoperative studies.&#xD;

    <description>For patients participating in the fMRI procedures, the scans will be compared among the four time-points (pre-initiation of mirror therapy (if possible), post-mirror therapy but pre-amputation, post-amputation at 4 weeks and at one year post-amputation). Primary analysis will compare the two treatment groups from baseline to 4 weeks following the initial catheter placement; but additional comparisons will be completed to help plan future investigations.</description>
