    <textblock>
      Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) affects over 700,000 Americans every year and is the leading&#xD;
      cause of long-term disability. Early neurological deterioration after AIS typically occurs&#xD;
      within 72 hours of stroke onset and affects 30% of all stroke patients, who have a higher&#xD;
      rate of death or poor outcome. Several mechanisms account for early neurological&#xD;
      deterioration, including hemorrhagic conversion, systemic illness, cerebral edema, and&#xD;
      seizure, but the most common cause is extension of the stroke into the &quot;penumbra,&quot; a region&#xD;
      of salvageable brain tissue surrounding the core of irreversible ischemic infarct. The&#xD;
      penumbra is tenuously perfused by collateral blood vessels. AIS management is primarily&#xD;
      focused on recanalizing the occluded artery causing the stroke, but an alternative and&#xD;
      relatively unexplored approach is optimization of collateral blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 60% of AIS patients present with a transient acute hypertensive response, which is&#xD;
      theorized to be the result of either increased sympathoadrenal tone, poorly controlled&#xD;
      underlying hypertension, or an unknown stroke-specific mechanism related to augmenting&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion through collateral blood flow. Epidemiological data suggests worse stroke&#xD;
      outcomes are associated with extremes of sustained hypo- or hypertension, which has led to&#xD;
      dozens of clinical trials involving over 20,000 patients to determine if pharmacologically&#xD;
      lowering blood pressure after AIS is beneficial. The results have been persistently neutral&#xD;
      or negative. In contrast, there have been no major clinical trials on the efficacy of using&#xD;
      vasopressor medications to maintain or increase baseline blood pressure after AIS, despite&#xD;
      promising preclinical data and pilot studies that showed no increase in cerebral hemorrhage&#xD;
      or edema. The only randomized trial of vasopressor use after AIS demonstrated an improvement&#xD;
      in clinical outcomes, but there was no difference in mean blood pressure between the control&#xD;
      and intervention arms, suggesting the beneficial effect was not exclusively related to&#xD;
      induced hypertension. One possibility is that the vasopressor reduced blood pressure&#xD;
      variability, which preliminary data has shown to be detrimental after AIS, although that&#xD;
      aspect of neurovascular coupling has not been adequately studied in the acute phase after&#xD;
      AIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reliance on IV vasopressors, which are only administered in the intensive care unit, is a&#xD;
      fundamental limitation of prior research. An alternative, but untested, approach is to use&#xD;
      the oral vasopressor midodrine hydrochloride. We hypothesize that frequent midodrine dosing&#xD;
      after AIS can optimize collateral blood flow and help salvage the ischemic penumbra. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to develop tools to quantify midodrine's effect on blood pressure&#xD;
      and the ischemic penumbra.&#xD;
