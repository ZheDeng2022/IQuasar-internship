  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of a novel vitro-ceramic biomaterial&#xD;
      (Biosilicate®) as treatment of caries-affected dentin in posterior resin restorations. A&#xD;
      total of 94 restorations of 66 participants were selected and assigned at random into four&#xD;
      groups: 1 (Biosilicate / Two-step etch and rinse system), 2 (Control / Two-step etch and&#xD;
      rinse system), 3 (Biosilicate / Two-step self-etching system) and 4 (Control / Two-step&#xD;
      self-etching system). Two operators carried out the adhesive protocols and restored the&#xD;
      cavities with a nano-hybrid resin composite (IPS Empress, Ivoclar) using the incremental&#xD;
      technique. Participants were recalled at one week, 6, 12 and 18 months for clinical&#xD;
      evaluation performed by two blinders and calibrated examiners according FDI criteria.&#xD;

      Background: Dental caries has decreased in recent years, but is still the main oral health&#xD;
      problem in developed and undeveloped industrialized countries. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate clinical performance of resin-based composite Class I and II restorations in&#xD;
      association with Biosilicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Eighty patients with carious lesions will be receive restorations in premolars and&#xD;
      molars, which will be randomly allocated in four experimental groups: G1 (Biosilicate,&#xD;
      AdperSingle Bond 2 and IPS Empress Direct composite), G2 (Adper Single Bond 2 and IPS Empress&#xD;
      Direct composite), G3 (Biosilicate, AdheSe and IPS Empress Direct composite) e G4 (AdheSE and&#xD;
      IPS Empress Direct composite) To participate in the clinical trial, qualified subjects must&#xD;
      meet for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sixty-four (64) selected volunteers will be fully&#xD;
      informed on the nature of the study and after had signed a Term of Acceptance defined by the&#xD;
      Ethics Committee (FORP - USP), they will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carious teeth will be cleaned with a pumice-water slurry and rubber cup to remove salivary&#xD;
      pellicle and any bacterial plaque. As much as possible, local anesthesia will be. After&#xD;
      caries removal (high and low-speed handpieces under abundant water irrigation), patients will&#xD;
      be allocated randomly in the four experimental groups cited above. Final contouring and&#xD;
      polishing of the restorations will be performed at the same appointment, using a fine-grit&#xD;
      diamond bur (KG Sorensen), silicon carbide polisher (Viking Kit, KG Sorensen), silicone&#xD;
      rubber tips (Viking Kit, KG Sorensen) flexible discs (Sof-Lex, 3M ESPE), and polishing pastes&#xD;
      (Diamond Excel, FGM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two trained and calibrated evaluators, fully blinded to the restorative techniques used, will&#xD;
      be evaluating the restorations at baseline (one week after placement of restorations), after&#xD;
      06, 12 and 18 months using FDI criteria. All restorations will be photographed at every&#xD;
      evaluation point. Esthetic, Functional and Biological proprieties will be used as key&#xD;
      parameters determining the overall clinical success. Data will be analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>Two experienced and calibrated dentists, not involved with the placement of the restorations will be assess the efficiency of Biosilicate under composite restoration of Class I and Class II dentin caries lesions by record instrument to record the esthetic, functional and biological properties over a 18 months time frame. These variables will be ranked according to the FDI criteria in the following scores: clinically very good, clinically good, clinically sufficient/ satisfactory, clinically unsatisfactory and clinically poor.</description>
