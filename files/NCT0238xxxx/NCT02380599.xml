    <textblock>
      Spinal mobilization and spinal manipulation are common techniques utilized in the field of&#xD;
      physical therapy. Despite their common utility, little is known about the physiological&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying the changes experienced following the interventions. Recent research&#xD;
      suggests that neurological mechanisms may be involved in the post interventional changes, but&#xD;
      research supporting this view is still evolving. Therefore, this study will explore whether&#xD;
      there is a neurophysiological difference between spinal manipulation and spinal mobilization&#xD;
      techniques. The neurophysiological difference will be measured by monitoring heart rate&#xD;
      variability, a cardiovagal indicator of autonomic nervous system activity. The primary&#xD;
      hypotheses of this study are three-fold, first that spinal manipulation will result in a&#xD;
      change in heart rate variability that is different then sham intervention. Second, spinal&#xD;
      mobilization will result in a change in heart rate variability that is different then sham&#xD;
      intervention. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that spinal mobilization and spinal&#xD;
      manipulation will produce different changes in heart rate variability.&#xD;

      This study will utilize a crossover design to study autonomic nervous system responses in&#xD;
      healthy subjects. Prior to commencing data collection, Institutional Review Board approval&#xD;
      has been obtained from the Mount St. Mary's College Committee for the Protection of Human&#xD;
      Subjects. Once obtained subjects will be recruited from faculty, students, and staff of the&#xD;
      College. A snowball methodology will be used to recruit friends, family, and acquaintances of&#xD;
      these initial connections. To be included in this study, candidates must be between the age&#xD;
      of 18 and 55 years of age. They must not have pain in any area of their body that is chronic&#xD;
      in nature (has been present for greater then three months). Subjects who are pregnant or have&#xD;
      a history of spinal surgery will be excluded from participation in this study. All subjects&#xD;
      who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be informed of the intent, methods and&#xD;
      risks associated with the study and given an opportunity to ask questions. Following this&#xD;
      information session, and if agreeing to participate in the study, subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      fill out the attached informed consent form. All subjects will be notified and given the&#xD;
      opportunity to withdrawal from the study at any time without repercussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once accepted into the study, subjects will fill out a personal history questionnaire to&#xD;
      gather demographic information such as age, medical history, gender, and current pain levels.&#xD;
      The subject will also be asked to fill out the General Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale&#xD;
      Questionnaire. Once collected, subjects will be assigned a confidential subject number and&#xD;
      all personal identifiers will be removed from subject information. All data will be scanned&#xD;
      and stored in a personal computer that is password protect. Also at this time, subjects will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to a treatment group. Since this is a crossover design, all subjects&#xD;
      will receive all interventions, but the order of these interventions will be predetermined&#xD;
      and randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, subjects will be taken to a quiet room located within the Department of&#xD;
      Physical Therapy. This room is used as a lab and data collection room and has a physical&#xD;
      therapy treatment table. The subject will be asked to lie prone on the table and an&#xD;
      electrocardiographic recording sensory will be placed upon each wrist (two total). This&#xD;
      sensory will feed data regarding heart rate to a laptop computer that will be collected using&#xD;
      the Biocomm HRV Live! Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Data Acquisition program. Once the&#xD;
      strength and stability of the signal is verified, the subject will be instructed to rest&#xD;
      quietly for five minutes in order to gather baseline heart rate data. Following this&#xD;
      five-minute timeframe, the subject will receive one of three interventions based upon the&#xD;
      previously mentioned randomization process. The three interventions utilized in the study&#xD;
      will be a posterior to anterior spinal manipulation delivered to T4-5 spinal segment,&#xD;
      posterior to anterior spinal mobilization applied to the T4-5 spinal segment for 30 seconds,&#xD;
      or sham therapeutic ultrasound applied to the T4-5 spinal region bilaterally for 30 seconds&#xD;
      (the ultrasound machines will not be turned on). Between each of these interventions,&#xD;
      subjects will be instructed to rest quietly for five minutes in order to stabilize the body's&#xD;
      cardiovagal responses. Following completion of these three interventions, subjects will&#xD;
      allowed to ask additional questions and will be given the number of the principal&#xD;
      investigator and the IRB office to contact if they have questions or concerns in the future.&#xD;
