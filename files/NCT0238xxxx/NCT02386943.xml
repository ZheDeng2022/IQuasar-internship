    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to explore the effects of two DPP-4 inhibitors(Sitagliptin,&#xD;
      Saxagliptin) on β- and α-cell function, as well as the incretin effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, randomized, three-way crossover and single-dose study.Subjects&#xD;
      with newly onset T2DM are enrolled. They are assigned to take a single dose of sitagliptin&#xD;
      (100 mg), saxagliptin (5 mg), or blank control in a randomized order separated by a washout&#xD;
      period of 7-14 days.Then the two-step hyperglycemic clamp is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each experimental day, the subject will take the given dose of Sitagliptin, Saxagliptin&#xD;
      and nothing for blank control two hours before the clamp experiment starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hyperglycaemic clamp will be performed after an overnight fast. Subjects will be placed&#xD;
      in a recumbent position and cannula will be inserted in a dorsal hand vein. The hand will be&#xD;
      placed in a heating box (50℃) throughout the experiment to allow frequent sampling of&#xD;
      arterialized blood. A second cannula will be inserted in a contralateral cubital vein for&#xD;
      glucose infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At time zero (0 min), a 50% glucose bolus will be injected during 1 min to increase PG to&#xD;
      15mM. The glucose bolus will be calculated as:(15mM-FPG)×35 mg glucose × body weight (kg). PG&#xD;
      will be measured bedside every 5 min and maintained at 15mM by an adjustable continuous 20%&#xD;
      glucose infusion. After 90min, PG will be lowered down to 7mM for the islet cells to rest,&#xD;
      then the subject will be instructed to consume 75g glucose solution orally in 5min. 40min&#xD;
      after the oral glucose consumption, the 90min-hyperglycaemic clamp experiment wil be&#xD;
      restarted. The oral period of hyperglycaemic clamp process is the same as what's done in&#xD;
      fasting period. Blood samples will be collected in -2h, 0min, 10min, 90min in both&#xD;
      hyperglycaemic clamp experimental process for the measurement of insulin, c-peptide,&#xD;
      glucagon, active GLP-1 and other incretin hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus we could evaluate the beta cell function represented by the first phase and the second&#xD;
      phase of insulin secretion(C-peptide secretion) and alpha cell function represented by the&#xD;
      change of glucagon concentration during the fasting period and oral period of hyperglycaemic&#xD;
      clamp experiment and the change of active GLP-1.&#xD;
