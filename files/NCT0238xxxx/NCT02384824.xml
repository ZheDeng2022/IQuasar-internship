  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the plaque morphology in patients with acute&#xD;
      STEMI by OCT after aspiration thrombectomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current guideline for treating acute STEMI is primarily PCI and stent placement in the&#xD;
      infarct-related coronary artery. But, the underlying plaque morphology is not routinely&#xD;
      identified due to the limited resolution of conventional imagine modalities. However, autopsy&#xD;
      studies have shown that there are different atherosclerotic plaque morphologies involving in&#xD;
      acute thrombotic occlusion of coronary arteries other than atherosclerotic plaque rupture,&#xD;
      such as plaque erosion, calcified nodule, etc. Some studies have suggested that PCI and&#xD;
      stenting might not always be necessary in about 30 - 40% of ACS patients, and an alternative&#xD;
      treatment strategy is needed for these patients based on the characteristics of plaque&#xD;
      morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo emergent angiography and&#xD;
      followings: If no thrombus was observed, OCT examination will be performed in the target&#xD;
      vessel;&#xD;
&#xD;
      If thrombosis was confirmed, the subject will undergo manual aspiration thrombectomy and&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy, and TIMI flow will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If TIMI flow grade &lt; 3, the subject will receive stent implantation as the standard of care&#xD;
      followed by OCT examination; If TIMI flow grade of 3, the subject will not receive stent&#xD;
      implantation but will be sent to CCU for monitoring and antiplatelet treatment, and have a&#xD;
      repeat angiography and OCT examination at Day 7; within the 7days post STEMI, ischemia-driven&#xD;
      angiography and/or PCI are allowed, and an OCT examination will be performed in these subject&#xD;
      before PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients without undergoing initial stent implantation will have scheduled 30-day and&#xD;
      12-month follow-ups for clinical outcomes.&#xD;
