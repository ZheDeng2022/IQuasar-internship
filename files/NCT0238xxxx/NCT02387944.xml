  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess coagulation and platelet function in children with&#xD;
      congenital heart disease, measured with a bedside device (thromboelastometry and impedance&#xD;
      aggregometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also aim to determine if this device detect post-cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      clotting derangements and may help to manage bleeding in this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemostasis, a main concern during and after any surgical procedure, is traditionally&#xD;
      monitored by the following laboratory tests: activated Partial Thrombin Time (aPTT),&#xD;
      prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, platelets count. They neither provide a reliable estimate&#xD;
      of the risk of bleeding, nor allow determining useful interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New investigations of hemostasis are now used and validated during and after surgery:&#xD;
      Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM速) and impedance aggregometry. This is a quick bedside&#xD;
      functional analysis of the patient's clotting. Children who undergo surgery under&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are particularly at risk of bleeding and this population hasn't&#xD;
      been studied with large cohort yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Hemostasis in children with CHD, especially when cyanotic, is intrinsically&#xD;
      abnormal. The corrective surgery on CPB induces further hemostatic disorders which can be&#xD;
      identified by the ROTEM platelet速.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the hemostatic function of the child with congenital&#xD;
      heart disease using a Point-Of-Care (platelet-ROTEM 速) system, before surgery and after&#xD;
      alterations induced by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, observational, prospective study. Expected duration: 2 years. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to include 200 patients with CHD, 100 patients undergoing surgery with CPB&#xD;
      and 100 patients with congenital heart disease requiring cardiac catheterization. Recruitment&#xD;
      will be conducted by the Division of Paediatric Cardiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria include an age of 0-16 years and a diagnosis of congenital heart disease&#xD;
      requiring surgery with CPB or cardiac catheterization. Patients with known dyscrasia or&#xD;
      treated with antiaggregant within 10 days/oral anticoagulants within 48h before&#xD;
      surgery/catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROTEM platelet速 test will be performed before surgery/catheterization. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery will have a second test within 30 minutes after the end of cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
      All patients will benefit from the usual cares.&#xD;
