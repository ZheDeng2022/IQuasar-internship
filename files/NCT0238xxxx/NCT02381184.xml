    <textblock>
      One hundred and thirty six anovulatory women with CC-resistant PCOS were scheduled randomly&#xD;
      into two equal groups. Group A (n=68); received CC (100 mg/day from cycle day 3 for 10 days)&#xD;
      for up to six cycles. Group B (n=68) underwent LOD and followed up for 6 months. The primary&#xD;
      outcome was the ovulation rate in each group; secondary outcomes were midcycle endometrial&#xD;
      thickness and serum estradiol, midluteal serum progesterone, and the rates of clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy and abortion.&#xD;

      This prospective randomized trial included 136 anovulatory women with CC-resistant PCOS among&#xD;
      those attending the Gynecology Outpatient Clinics of, Benha University Hospital, and private&#xD;
      practice settings, Alkalubia, Egypt from August 2012 to August 2014. The study protocol was&#xD;
      approved by the Local Ethics Committee and written informed consents were obtained before the&#xD;
      study commenced. Diagnosis of PCOS was based on the Rotterdam criteria (18), whereby&#xD;
      diagnosis of PCOS require the presence of two of three criteria after the exclusion of other&#xD;
      etiologies, i.e., oligomenorrhea and/or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism, and/or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. Inclusion criteria: 1- Age:&#xD;
      between 18-35 years. 2- Period of infertility &gt; 2 years. 3- Serum level of FSH &lt;10 U/L in the&#xD;
      early follicular phase. 4- All women were CC-resistant PCOS, as they failed to ovulate with a&#xD;
      dose of CC of 150 mg/day for 5 days per cycle for at least three consecutive cycles. 5- All&#xD;
      women had patent Fallopian tubes proved by hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy and their&#xD;
      partners satisfied the normal parameters of semen analysis according to the modified WHO&#xD;
      criteria (19). Exclusion criteria: 1- Infertility due to causes other than CC- resistant PCOS&#xD;
      or due to combined factors. 2- Body mass index (BMI) ≥35 Kg/m². 3- The use of metformin,&#xD;
      gonadotropins, hormonal contraception or diet regimen within the last 6 months. 4- Women with&#xD;
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hyperprolactinaemia or abnormal thyroid function. 5-&#xD;
      Hypersensitivity or contraindications to Letrozole or clomiphene treatment. 6- Previous LOD.&#xD;
      The study was started two months after last CC treatment cycle to eliminate any&#xD;
      post-treatment effect of CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At admission, a thorough evaluation of all participants was carried out via history taking&#xD;
      and physical examination, which included anthropometric measurements. A baseline transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound examination was done using 7-10 MHZ probe (Voluson 730 PRO V, GE Healthcare, USA)&#xD;
      to measure endometrial thickness and exclude any pelvic pathology before treatment. Basal&#xD;
      hormonal assays were performed on day 3 of the spontaneous or progestin induced cycle and&#xD;
      included measurement of the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH),&#xD;
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was done according to a computer generated random numerical table into two&#xD;
      equal groups. Treatment allocation was concealed by using sequentially numbered opaque sealed&#xD;
      envelopes. Envelopes were opened consecutively by a third person (study nurse), who assigned&#xD;
      patients to the extended Clomiphene Citrate group (Group A) or LOD group (Group B). Once&#xD;
      allocated, the treatment was revealed to both the investigator and the patient. Group A (n&#xD;
      =68) assigned to receive100 mg of clomiphene citrate (Clomid®; Hoechst Marion Russel, Cairo,&#xD;
      Egypt) daily starting on day 3 of spontaneous or progestin induced cycle for 10 days. Group B&#xD;
      (n =68) underwent LOD. Laparoscopy was performed under general anesthesia, using&#xD;
      three-puncture technique. Each ovary was cauterized perpendicular to its antimesenteric&#xD;
      border at four points, each for 4 seconds at 40 W with a mixed current, using a monopolar&#xD;
      electrosurgical needle (Karl Storz, ND, Germany). Each puncture was about 4 mm in diameter&#xD;
      and 6-8 mm in depth. The ovary was cooled by irrigation with normal saline solution. Any,&#xD;
      intraoperative or postoperative complication was reported. The follow-up was started from the&#xD;
      next cycle after ovarian drilling up to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting from cycle day 9, ultrasound scans were repeated daily to monitor follicle growth&#xD;
      (number and mean diameter). Ultrasound examination was done by the same doctor to avoid&#xD;
      interobserver variability and he was blinded to the treatment groups. When the optimal&#xD;
      follicle size was reached (i.e. mean follicular diameter ≥ 18 mm), HCG 10,000 IU (Epifasi,&#xD;
      EPICO, Egypt) was given intramuscular to trigger ovulation. No HCG was given and protected&#xD;
      sexual intercourse was advised, if there were ≥ 3 follicles with a diameter ≥16mm to avoid&#xD;
      the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and multiple gestations. Intrauterine&#xD;
      insemination was performed 36 - 40 hours after HCG injection using soft tip catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum E2 and the endometrial thickness were measured on the day of HCG administration. The&#xD;
      endometrial thickness was measured in a sagittal plane in the fundus of the uterus (point of&#xD;
      maximal thickness) from the echogenic interface at the junction of the endometrium and&#xD;
      myometrium Ovulation was confirmed when midluteal (day 21of the cycle) serum progesterone was&#xD;
      ≥ 5 ng/mL. Serum β-hCG was determined 2 weeks after HCG injection for diagnosis of&#xD;
      biochemical pregnancy. Sonographic evidence of an intrauterine gestational sac at 6 weeks&#xD;
      gestation was considered an evident of a clinical pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment continued for up to six months. Patients were counseled for further lines of&#xD;
      treatment if there was no ovulation as confirmed by midluteal serum progesterone level less&#xD;
      than 5 ng /ml within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the ovulation rate in each group. Secondary outcomes were the&#xD;
      endometrial thickness and serum estradiol (pg/ml), on the day of the hCG injection, midluteal&#xD;
      serum progesterone (ng/ml) and the rates of clinical pregnancy and first trimester&#xD;
      spontaneous abortion. The ovulation rate was calculated as the percentage of ovulatory cycles&#xD;
      per total observed cycles. The cumulative pregnancy rate was defined as the number of&#xD;
      pregnant patients to the total number of patients. The abortion rate was defined as the&#xD;
      percentage of miscarriage during the first 12 weeks of gestation per total pregnancies, while&#xD;
      the biochemical miscarriage was considered if pregnancy loss occurred in any confirmed&#xD;
      biochemical pregnancy without ultrasound evidence of intrauterine pregnancy.&#xD;
