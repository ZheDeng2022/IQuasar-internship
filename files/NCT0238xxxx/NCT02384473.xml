      This pilot clinical trial studies real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and shear wave&#xD;
      elastography in predicting treatment response in patients with soft tissue sarcomas.&#xD;
      Ultrasonography and elastography are diagnostic imaging tests that use sound waves to make&#xD;
      pictures of the body without using radiation (x-rays). Real-time contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasonography and shear wave elastography may help measure a patient's response to&#xD;
      treatment given before surgery in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate whether two different radiologists can reliably interpret the following&#xD;
      quantitative criteria regarding the maximally enhancing portion of a soft tissue sarcoma&#xD;
      (STS), on sequential contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) exams performed before, during, and&#xD;
      after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC): change in peak enhancement (decibels), change in slope&#xD;
      of enhancement curve, and change in area under the curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate CEUS as a potential early response assessment biomarker by comparing the CEUS&#xD;
      rating result to computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rating results.&#xD;
      (Exploratory) III. To examine the agreement between CEUS versus CT/MRI determined treatment&#xD;
      response within each radiologist rater. (Exploratory) IV. To examine the agreement between&#xD;
      CEUS versus CT/MRI determined treatment response based on the consensus rating result from&#xD;
      the two radiologist raters. (Exploratory) V. To explore potential quantitative biomarker from&#xD;
      all possible parameters that can be extracted from CEUS data for assessing an early treatment&#xD;
      response to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in sarcoma using receiver operating characteristic&#xD;
      (ROC) curve when predicting radiologists rated binary outcome: responders versus&#xD;
      non-responders. (Exploratory) VI. To collect preliminary data for shear wave elastography&#xD;
      (SWE) in the same patient population. (Exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo real-time CEUS and SWE at baseline, 6 weeks after initiation of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy, and 9 weeks after initiation of neoadjuvant therapy (prior to surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24 hours.&#xD;
