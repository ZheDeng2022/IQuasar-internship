    <textblock>
      The purpose of the two RCT registered here is to determine whether clinicians trained on the&#xD;
      Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST)-linked brief intervention&#xD;
      (BI) through the NextGenU.org model of training are able to deliver effective brief&#xD;
      intervention for risky level of alcohol use. It is one study part of a larger program of&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the NextGenU.org model of online training with mentor and&#xD;
      peer activities is an effective way to train clinicians to deliver the ASSIST-linked brief&#xD;
      intervention. The investigators hypothesize that eligible participants receiving the brief&#xD;
      intervention will decrease their alcohol consumption and experienced improved health and&#xD;
      social outcomes more than those receiving only screening results and written information&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.05). The investigators hypothesize the level of decrease in alcohol consumption will be&#xD;
      similar to that of trials conducted in high-income countries (HIC).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to answer the challenge of integration of screening and core&#xD;
      packages of Mental Health (MH) and Substance Use Disorder (SUD) services into routine primary&#xD;
      health care (PHC) through innovative e-learning technologies. The training of health&#xD;
      professionals in Kenya (and other LMIC) has very limited content on addressing alcohol,&#xD;
      tobacco and other substance use disorder in PHC. The investigators aim to help address this&#xD;
      problems by adapting NextGenU training model for capacity-building of health care providers&#xD;
      in LMIC to provide SUD screening and core services in PHC. NextGenU.org draws on&#xD;
      already-existing, free, expert-created competencies and computer-based learning resources&#xD;
      from accredited sources to assemble courses certified by its network of partners. The&#xD;
      computer-based didactic learning experience is complemented with 1) peer-to-peer interactions&#xD;
      in a local and global community of learners simultaneously studying this topic, and 2) the&#xD;
      use of local qualified mentors, which can supplement the training taking into account local&#xD;
      variations in organizational structures, culture, tradition and beliefs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention evaluated through this program of research includes training lay health&#xD;
      worker or facility support staff to screen patients presenting to the facility. Those support&#xD;
      staff then refer those who are at moderate or high risk from tobacco, alcohol or other&#xD;
      substance use to trained PHC clinician for brief intervention (BI) related to any of the&#xD;
      substances they use at risky level. The training intervention includes teaching the&#xD;
      clinicians to deliver BI, and identify and manage co-morbidities or complications. The&#xD;
      program of research around that intervention includes (1) a developmental evaluation of the&#xD;
      on-line training through a pilot with students and clinical faculties in educational&#xD;
      institutions, followed by the assessment of the training of already practicing health care&#xD;
      providers in the field; (2) pre and post training assessment of clinicians and non-clinicians&#xD;
      knowledge, attitudes and skills (including assessing their level of stigma toward those who&#xD;
      use psychoactive substances); (3) RCTs to assess the impact of the BI on alcohol consumption&#xD;
      and other health and social variables of interest in public and private facilities; and (4)&#xD;
      the assessment of the impact of quality improvement training on sustainability of the&#xD;
      screening and BI. This trial registration is only for the RCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two independently powered RCTs, one in private facilities and one in public facilities, will&#xD;
      be run. The rational to run two independently powered RCT is that other studies of PHC&#xD;
      workers training for depression in LMIC have shown that the intervention implemented in&#xD;
      public facilities was successful at improving patients' outcomes, while it was not in private&#xD;
      facilities. However, since a large proportion of the population uses private facilities, the&#xD;
      investigators did not want to exclude private facilities from participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT with public institutions takes place in two rural counties, Machakos and Makueni,&#xD;
      chosen as they are very similar in terms of geography and socio-demographic characteristics,&#xD;
      and are pretty typical of rural counties in Kenya and other LMIC. They both have a population&#xD;
      of over 700,000, with a moderate burden of substance abuse for Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT with private health care institutions (CliniX and Shalom) will takes place in the&#xD;
      Nairobi metropolitan area. The Shalom facility is technically in the County of Machakos, very&#xD;
      close to Nairobi city limit and serving a very similar population to that of the CliniX&#xD;
      facilities (urban middle class Kenyans who can afford private health care consultations out&#xD;
      of pocket or who have insurance through their workplace). The RCTs will be complemented with&#xD;
      qualitative methodologies to monitor other aspects besides the clinical effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention. On-going results will be shared with stakeholders, and may result in adapted&#xD;
      implementation of the training as the study progresses, as per the developmental evaluation&#xD;
      methodology. The context and rationale of any changes will be documented as part of the&#xD;
      research process, and are expected to inform the development of the innovation, including&#xD;
      scalability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology for the RCTs is based on the methodology followed by Flemming et al in their&#xD;
      studies on BI for alcohol. These highly-ranked studies have been included in the latest&#xD;
      version of the Cochrane meta-analysis on brief alcohol intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible sites for the RCTs includes those which are offering PHC, are willing and able to&#xD;
      participate in the training program (access to electricity, internet through cell phone&#xD;
      networks, staff expressing interest in being trained), have a sufficient number of clinicians&#xD;
      and support staff who have completed the training to screen and deliver BI, and are amenable&#xD;
      to follow the research protocol. The investigators aim to enlist in the training at least 4&#xD;
      public facilities per district, and 4 private facilities, as there are uncertainties over how&#xD;
      many clinics will have their staff complete the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each clinic, a community health worker (in public facilities) or complementary staff (in&#xD;
      the private clinics) will offer patients presenting for consultation who are aged 18 years or&#xD;
      older to be screened for healthy lifestyle and to receive feedback on their results. The&#xD;
      person performing the screening will obtain consent specifically to participate in the&#xD;
      screening. To mask the topic of the trial at this early stage and avoid potential&#xD;
      stigmatization of participants, the study will be presented as one about general lifestyles&#xD;
      (as was done in the Flemming et al. studies). The screening will include self-reported weight&#xD;
      and height, (for body mass index - BMI), level of physical activity, and the Alcohol, Smoking&#xD;
      and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). The inclusion of the BMI and level of&#xD;
      physical activity is to mask the purpose of the intervention, by decreasing the focus on&#xD;
      substance use. The lay health worker will provide the results of the BMI, physical activity&#xD;
      and the ASSIST and will offer a leaflets with further explanation about those lifestyles. The&#xD;
      screener will send all of those who screen to moderate risks or above from alcohol use to the&#xD;
      research assistant (RA). The RA will offer patients to participate in the RCTs, assess&#xD;
      eligibility, obtain consent, collect baseline data and demographic, and randomize patients to&#xD;
      either BI or no further intervention (the patients will have already received their screening&#xD;
      results). The RA will explain that it is a study about lifestyles, without disclosing that he&#xD;
      is asking them to participate because of their level of risk due to alcohol. Those eligible&#xD;
      will be randomized to either the BI or the control group separately for men and women in each&#xD;
      site using a computer-generated allocation method. All practitioners will have both control&#xD;
      and intervention subjects in their practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those in the BI arm will be asked by the research staff to show and discussed with the&#xD;
      clinicians their screening results. The clinician will deliver the BI for alcohol use&#xD;
      reaching moderate or high risk level from the ASSIST as well as advice to stop the&#xD;
      consumption of harmful levels of any substances reported by the patient. The BI should&#xD;
      include discussion of risky level of alcohol consumption, associated adverse effects, and&#xD;
      followed the adapted ASSIST BI steps for Kenya, which include asking the patient to come back&#xD;
      for follow-up about a month after the BI. Clinicians will record their baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      clinical assessment and management through clinical follow-up forms. The total BI should be&#xD;
      around 15 minutes, with a follow-up visit of about the same length. Any further follow-up&#xD;
      will be at the discretion of the clinician, as part of on-going PHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To blind the subject to the control or the intervention allocation, they will be told that&#xD;
      the trial focuses on healthy lifestyles including weight, substance use, and exercise. The&#xD;
      clinician and complementary health workers will not be told which of their patients are&#xD;
      randomized in the control or intervention arm. This methodology ensures appropriate&#xD;
      concealment and should prevent contamination. The participants in both the control and the&#xD;
      intervention arms will be contacted for follow-up interviews at one, three and six months to&#xD;
      assess outcomes. Sub-samples of both control and intervention subjects will be selected for&#xD;
      participation in focus groups to seek input into their experience of using the new knowledge&#xD;
      and skills in practice, and how it might be improved in the Kenyan context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients who are ineligible on the basis of increased acute risk will be asked to&#xD;
      discuss their ASSIST results with their PHC provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable of interest is difference in mean alcohol consumption (previous&#xD;
      7 and 14 day use measured in g/week) between subjects in the intervention group and the&#xD;
      control group, and collected through a timeline follow-back assessment. A statistical test&#xD;
      frequently used in this type of study is an independent samples t-test. We used the SPSS&#xD;
      SamplePower calculator to estimate the sample size needed to achieve 80% power, with a&#xD;
      two-tailed level of significance (alpha) of 0.05. We use the number of grams of alcohol&#xD;
      consumed per week obtained from the 1997 Flemming trial: a mean (SD) of 137.7 (135.7) g/wk in&#xD;
      the intervention group, and 185.5 (155.2) in the control group. The sample size needed is&#xD;
      then n=146 in each arm. The average consumption in the Flemming trial was on the lower side,&#xD;
      with a difference in mean reduction very similar to the other studies with adequate&#xD;
      allocation concealment included in the Cochrane review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assumptions used to estimate the recruitment period needed to reach that sample size are&#xD;
      as follows: Using a conservative estimate of number of visits per day from those 18 years old&#xD;
      and over (30 visits for each public clinic and 55 visits for private clinic), with 10% a&#xD;
      prevalence of moderately risky levels of alcohol use, based on a study conducted in similar&#xD;
      PHC centres in Kenya using the ASSIST; subtracting returning patients (an average of 30%). An&#xD;
      enrollment of 80% was assumed. This is a conservative estimate, since enrollment has reached&#xD;
      about 95% in previous studies of drug and alcohol use or mental illness, conducted by AMHF.&#xD;
      Based on these assumptions, about 570 patients in the public clinics and 520 in the private&#xD;
      clinics should be enrolled in three months. Loss to follow-up is estimated at 10% at one&#xD;
      month, another 10% at three months, and another 10% at six months. At six months of follow-up&#xD;
      it is expected to have approximately 370 recruited patients in public clinics and 340&#xD;
      patients in private clinics. This would result in sufficient power to detect the expected&#xD;
      decrease in consumption separately in the public and the private sector. If for any&#xD;
      unforeseen reason, the estimated needed sample size is not reached in three months, the&#xD;
      enrollment period will be extended, and still have the capacity to do a 6 months follow-up on&#xD;
      all the recruited subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower average effect size obtained by including all studies in the Cochrane review,&#xD;
      despite a lack of adequate concealment or other methodological issues, is a reduction of&#xD;
      about 33g/week. Using a two-tailed t-test, a consumption by the intervention group of&#xD;
      117g/week versus a consumption of 150 g/week by the control group, a SD of 120 for a 95% CI&#xD;
      of (-53.66,-12.34) and an intention to treat sample at initial enrollment of 520 (260 in each&#xD;
      arm), the study will have a power of 87.9% to yield a statistically significant result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect size used is the average across men and women. The study is not powered to assess&#xD;
      the separate effect on each gender, but sub-analyses estimating the effect of gender as a&#xD;
      covariate can be done. Potential confounders and effect modifiers will be tested in multiple&#xD;
      linear and logistic regression models depending on the distribution of the outcome variable.&#xD;
      The longitudinal data across our four proposed time points will be analyzed using a general&#xD;
      linear model, repeated measures technique, in order to understand the effect of variations&#xD;
      due to groups (i.e., a between-groups effect) and due to follow-up time (i.e., a&#xD;
      within-groups effect). An interaction term between groups and follow-up time will also be&#xD;
      fitted. Missing data will be handled through multiple imputation techniques as necessary.&#xD;
