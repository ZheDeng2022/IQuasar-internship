      The aim of this study is to determine the validity of a self-questionnaire detecting seniors&#xD;
      phobia of falling living at home. A prospective monocentric observational study compares in a&#xD;
      blind way the presence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth&#xD;
      edition (DSM-IV) criteria for specific phobia, considered as the gold standard to the score&#xD;
      obtained at the detecting questionnaire for ≥70 years old seniors suspected of phobia of&#xD;
      falling and attending geriatric day hospital at the Bretonneau hospital (APHP, Paris).&#xD;

      Context : The phobia of falling strongly contributes to the frailty of the elderly, and plays&#xD;
      a key role in falls occuring and their deleterious effect. It concerns a big part of seniors&#xD;
      living at home, fell before or not, and frequently leads to a restriction of their mobility.&#xD;
      When the phobia of falling occurs, the fear of falling down takes an excessive scope, it is&#xD;
      associated with anxious reactions when seniors dread the risk, and leads them to avoid these&#xD;
      situations reducing their mobility. This reduction of activities contributes to the premature&#xD;
      decline of physical capacities, worsens social life, increases the falling and&#xD;
      institutionalization risk. However, there is no specific tools for the detection of seniors&#xD;
      falling phobia, enabling us to turn patients towards a therapeutic and diagnostical adapted&#xD;
      care. A detecting self-questionnaire was thus designed by the research geriatric team after&#xD;
      an analysis of the literature and half-directive interviews with a representative sample of&#xD;
      the target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives : The main objective of this study is to evaluate the validity of a&#xD;
      self-questionnaire so as to detect falling phobic seniors living at home. The optimal&#xD;
      threshold of the questionnaire score, obtained from a receiver operating characteristic curve&#xD;
      (ROC curve), will let us evaluate its concordance compared to the gold standard, formed by&#xD;
      DSM-IV criteria for specific phobia. The results of the questionnaire will be kept secret&#xD;
      while the study occurs. The secondary objectives will be to control the feasibility of the&#xD;
      self-questionnaire detecting phobia of falling, the validity of internal structure and&#xD;
      external construction by the exploration of its correlation with other close psychological&#xD;
      and physical health measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design : A 1 year prospective monocentric observational study is led with seniors attending&#xD;
      geriatric day hospital at the Bretonneau hospital (APHP, Paris). While the same day hospital,&#xD;
      all eligible patients will have a current evaluation of cares adapted to their admission&#xD;
      causes. These patients will fill out the self-questionnaire detecting phobia, designed by the&#xD;
      research geriatric team. The final clinical diagnostic of phobia of falling will be&#xD;
      disconfirmed or affirmed from DSM-IV-TR (TR stands for text revision) criteria. At the end of&#xD;
      the day hospital, an adapted care to their pathologies will be suggested to all the patients,&#xD;
      according to usual practice.&#xD;
