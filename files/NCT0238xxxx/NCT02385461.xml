    <textblock>
      The occurrence of a spontaneous fetal loss (FL) is a rather frequent event: it has been&#xD;
      estimated that up to 15% of pregnancies result in a fetal loss. However, recurrent events,&#xD;
      defined as &gt;2 or &gt;3 loss, depending on the guidelines used (American College of Obstetricians&#xD;
      and Gynecologists or Royal College of Obstetricians Gynaecologists guidelines), occur in 1 %&#xD;
      of all pregnancies and it is noteworthy that Recurrent Fetal Loss ( RFL) in about 30-40% of&#xD;
      cases remain unexplained after standard gynaecological, hormonal and karyotype&#xD;
      investigations. Furthermore, it is important to consider that chromosomal abnormalities are&#xD;
      responsible for at least 60% of FL in the first trimester, thus an abnormal karyotype in the&#xD;
      fetus should be excluded prior to consider testing women for genetic susceptibility to&#xD;
      placental vascular complications (inherited thrombophilia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common inherited conditions, the factor V Leiden (FV) and the factor II G20210A (FII)&#xD;
      mutations have been recognized as risk factors for FL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of treatment with antithrombotic drugs during pregnancy in women with a history&#xD;
      of RFL/ Intra Uterine Fetal Death (IUFD) and thrombophilia is still debated, due to scarcity&#xD;
      of available data. Italian guidelines suggest the use of Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH)&#xD;
      in women with FV or FII mutations and previous otherwise unexplained obstetric complications,&#xD;
      while guidelines released by RCOG suggest that heparin therapy during pregnancy may improve&#xD;
      the live birth rate in women with second trimester loss associated with inherited&#xD;
      thrombophilias. Hence, the idea to propose this prospective observational study comparing&#xD;
      clinical data and outcomes in women with common inherited thrombophilias and in women&#xD;
      without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study the investigators will collect and evaluate clinical data from examinations&#xD;
      and visits by patients, eligible for the study as carriers of thrombophilic defects. This&#xD;
      observation will begin before pregnancy and continue until the puerperium, allowing us to&#xD;
      study all possible factors influencing these conditions. The study will add knowledge for&#xD;
      improving feto-maternal prognosis and preventing spontaneous and recurrent FL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of the study: multicenter observational study&#xD;
