  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of the clinical trial are to determine whether the SA4Ag vaccine can prevent&#xD;
      postoperative Staphylococcus aureus infections in patients who are undergoing elective spinal&#xD;
      fusion surgery, and to evaluate the safety of SA4Ag in patients who are undergoing elective&#xD;
      spinal surgery.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Postoperative Staphylococcus (S.) Aureus Bloodstream Infection (BSI) And/or Surgical-site Infection (SSI-Including Deep Incisional or Organ/Space) Occurred Within 90 Days After Spinal Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of surgery (Day 1) up to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>BSI: clinical infection involved a recognized pathogen (S. aureus) cultured from 1 or more blood cultures or a commensal organism cultured from 2 or more blood cultures whether primary or secondary to infection at another site. SSI: infection at a surgical incision. Types of SSI in this outcome measure: Deep incisional SSI: infection involved deep soft tissues of incision (example [e.g.] fascial and muscle layers), Organ/space SSI: infection involved any part of body excluding skin incision, fascia or muscle layers, that was opened or manipulated during operative procedure. Overall number of participants with postoperative BSI and/or SSI (including deep incisional or organ/space), caused by S. aureus, occurred within 90 days of post elective open posterior spinal fusion surgery with multilevel instrumentation, as confirmed by event adjudication committee (EAC) have been reported. A participant may have met criteria for both BSI and SSI (deep incisional or organ/space).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Local Reactions Within 10 Days After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 days after Vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Local reactions were recorded using an electronic diary (e-diary). Local reactions included redness, swelling and pain at the injection site. Redness and swelling were categorized as mild (2.5 to 5.0 centimeters [cm]), moderate (5.5 to 10.0 cm) and, severe (greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 10.5 cm). Pain at the injection site was defined as mild (did not interfere with activity), moderate (interfered with activity), and severe (prevented daily activity). Participants may be represented in more than 1 row. Here, &quot;Any&quot; for redness, swelling, pain at the injection site represents any grade of these local reactions among mild, moderate or severe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Systemic Reactions Within 10 Days After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 days after Vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic reactions included fever, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle pain and joint pain, were recorded using an e-diary. Fever was graded as 38.0 to 38.4 degree Celsius (C), 38.5 to 38.9 degree C, 39.0 to 40.0 degree C and greater than (&gt;) 40.0 degree C. Vomiting was graded as mild (1-2 times in 24 hours), moderate (&gt;2 times in 24 hours) and severe (required intravenous hydration). Diarrhea was graded as mild (2-3 loose stools in 24 hours), moderate (4-5 loose stools in 24 hours) and severe (&gt;=6 loose stools in 24 hours). Headache, fatigue, muscle pain and joint pain were graded as mild (no interference with activity), moderate (some interference with activity) and severe (prevented daily routine activity). Participants may be represented in more than 1 row. Here &quot;any&quot; for fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, joint pain represents any grade of these systemic reactions among mild, moderate or severe.</description>

Overall number of participants with postoperative BSI and/or SSI (including deep incisional or organ/space), caused by S. aureus, occurred within 90 days of post elective open posterior spinal fusion surgery with multilevel instrumentation, as confirmed by event adjudication committee (EAC) have been reported.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Systemic Reactions Within 10 Days After Vaccination</title>
        <description>Systemic reactions included fever, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle pain and joint pain, were recorded using an e-diary. Fever was graded as 38.0 to 38.4 degree Celsius (C), 38.5 to 38.9 degree C, 39.0 to 40.0 degree C and greater than (&gt;) 40.0 degree C. Vomiting was graded as mild (1-2 times in 24 hours), moderate (&gt;2 times in 24 hours) and severe (required intravenous hydration). Diarrhea was graded as mild (2-3 loose stools in 24 hours), moderate (4-5 loose stools in 24 hours) and severe (&gt;=6 loose stools in 24 hours). Headache, fatigue, muscle pain and joint pain were graded as mild (no interference with activity), moderate (some interference with activity) and severe (prevented daily routine activity). Participants may be represented in more than 1 row. Here &quot;any&quot; for fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, joint pain represents any grade of these systemic reactions among mild, moderate or severe.</description>
