    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label, dose finding study using induced blood stage malaria&#xD;
      (IBSM) infection to characterize the pharmacodynamic interaction between OZ439 and DSM265,&#xD;
      administered around 120 minutes apart for treatment of early Plasmodium falciparum blood&#xD;
      stage infection. The study will be conducted in up to three cohorts (n=8 per cohort) using&#xD;
      different doses of OZ439 and DSM265. The doses of OZ439 and DSM265 that will be investigated&#xD;
      in the first cohort will be 200 mg of OZ439 and 100mg of DSM265, both administered as single&#xD;
      doses around 120 minutes apart. Subsequent doses in subsequent cohort(s) will be determined&#xD;
      following a review of observed OZ439 and DSM265 safety, and pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic interaction outcomes, particularly the antimalarial activity of the drugs&#xD;
      given in combination as defined by parasite clearance kinetics. The doses used in Cohort 2&#xD;
      and 3 may be adjusted but will not exceed the maximum acceptable doses predefined for this&#xD;
      study (which are 400 mg for DSM265 and 500mg for OZ439) as determined in previous safety and&#xD;
      pilot efficacy studies. The dose will be determined by the funding sponsor and the principal&#xD;
      investigator (PI) following Safety Review team (SRT) and scientific evaluation. If no safe&#xD;
      alternative dose can be determined the option exists to curtail the study to less than three&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant in the cohort will be inoculated on Day 0 with ~1,800 viable parasites of&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes (BSPC) administered intravenously. On an&#xD;
      outpatient basis, participants will be monitored daily via phone call and then daily (AM)&#xD;
      from day 4 (until PCR positive for presence of malaria parasites). Once PCR positive they&#xD;
      will be monitored twice-daily morning (AM) and evening (PM) until treatment, for adverse&#xD;
      events and the unexpected early onset of symptoms, signs or parasitological evidence of&#xD;
      malaria. On the day designated for commencement of treatment, as determined by qPCR results,&#xD;
      participants will be admitted to the study unit and monitored. The threshold for commencement&#xD;
      of treatment will be when PCR quantification of all participants is = 1,000 parasites/mL. If&#xD;
      the PCR quantification of any participant is = 5,000 parasites/mL and is accompanied by a&#xD;
      clinical symptom score &gt;5, or if clinical or parasitological evidence of malaria occurs in&#xD;
      any participant before all participants have reached the treatment threshold (PCR&#xD;
      quantification of = 1,000), then treatment of that participant will begin within a 24 h&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following treatment with OZ439 and DSM265, participants will be followed up as inpatients for&#xD;
      at least 48 hours to ensure tolerance of the treatment and clinical response, then if&#xD;
      clinically well on an outpatient basis for safety and clearance of malaria parasites via PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compulsory commencement of treatment with Riamet® (artemether-lumefantrine) will occur on&#xD;
      study day 16 ±3 days post OZ439 and DSM265 treatment unless required earlier. Early standard&#xD;
      anti-malarial drug intervention can occur if either poor responses or fast responses are seen&#xD;
      following OZ439 and DSM265 treatment. This is to ensure participant safety and to avoid&#xD;
      participant inconvenience if useful data cannot be obtained. A poor response is defined as a&#xD;
      decrease in parasitaemia of less than 20% from baseline by 3 days post OZ439 and DSM265&#xD;
      treatment. A fast response occurs when, within the seven day period following the treatment,&#xD;
      two consecutive PCR assessments in 48 hours are negative. However, pre-emptive treatment with&#xD;
      Riamet® can commence whenever deemed necessary by the investigator. Participants will be&#xD;
      monitored, either in clinic, or by telephone for three days to ensure adherence to Riamet®&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated with a single dose (45 mg) of primaquine as described in section&#xD;
      4.3 in this protocol at the end of their Riamet® treatment if gametocytes are identified, to&#xD;
      ensure complete clearance of any gametocytes present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be monitored via telephone monitoring, within the clinical research unit,&#xD;
      and on outpatient review after malaria challenge inoculation and antimalarial study drugs&#xD;
      administration. Blood samples for safety evaluation, malaria monitoring, and red blood cell&#xD;
      antibodies will be drawn at screening and/ or baseline and at nominated times after malaria&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
