      The Radio Frequency Ablation for Atrial Flutter with Magnetic Resonance Guidance and Tracking&#xD;
      Pilot Study (hereafter referred to as &quot;pilot study&quot;) is a prospective, non- randomized,&#xD;
      single-center, pilot study. The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      performance of the Imricor Medical Systems, Inc. (Imricor) Vision Ablation Catheter when used&#xD;
      with related accessories for the treatment of type I atrial flutter. The Vision Ablation&#xD;
      Catheter and its accessories have been designed for use under fluoroscopic or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance guidance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An objective of the study is to perform the entire ablation procedure from subject&#xD;
      preparation through confirmation of bidirectional conduction block entirely under magnetic&#xD;
      resonance guidance. However, at the investigator's discretion, the preparation of the subject&#xD;
      may occur in a conventional electrophysiology laboratory followed by transferring the patient&#xD;
      to the magnetic resonance suite for the ablation procedure. Additionally, if bidirectional&#xD;
      conduction block is not achieved within 90 minutes from the initial catheter placement, the&#xD;
      subject may be transferred from the magnetic resonance suite to a conventional&#xD;
      electrophysiology lab to complete the procedure. Clinical success is bidirectional conduction&#xD;
      block regardless of the environment within which the ablation occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at a single center, Herzzentrum Leipzig University Hospital, in&#xD;
      Germany, and a maximum of 30 subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will participate&#xD;
      in the study. This study requires the use of investigational products from two independent&#xD;
      manufacturers: Imricor and Philips. Imricor has developed the ablation catheter with related&#xD;
      accessories, introducers, and recording system. Philips has developed an image guidance and&#xD;
      mapping system that is compatible with the Imricor products. The Vision Ablation Catheter&#xD;
      will be used in conjunction with the following investigational products: Vision Ablation&#xD;
      Catheter Cable Set (accessory sterile cable), Vision Hemostasis Introducer, Vision&#xD;
      Dual-Deflect Sheath, Horizon recording system, and the interventional MRI Suite (iSuite)&#xD;
      image guidance and mapping system. With the exception of iSuite, which is manufactured by&#xD;
      Philips, Imricor will provide all investigational devices used in the study. Each procedure&#xD;
      will utilize the following two single-use products: two Vision Ablation Catheters and an&#xD;
      accessory Catheter Cable set. At the discretion of the investigator, Vision Hemostasis&#xD;
      Introducers may be used for femoral access and a Vision Dual- Deflect Sheath and may be used&#xD;
      in conjunction with the Vision Ablation Catheter Cable Set. Ablation for the treatment of&#xD;
      arrhythmia is an inherently complex procedure. Use of the investigational products listed&#xD;
      above under magnetic resonance guidance is a new approach to performing the interventional&#xD;
      electrophysiology procedure. The study population will consist of adult patients requiring&#xD;
      ablation for type I atrial flutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will require a follow-up visit or telephone call at 7 days post procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the expected total study duration is approximately six months with study start&#xD;
      planned for October 2014.&#xD;
