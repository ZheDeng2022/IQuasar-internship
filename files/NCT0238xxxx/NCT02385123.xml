      This is an open label, single arm, study of longitudinal immunologic responses to influenza&#xD;
      vaccine in healthy adult subjects. This study will enroll males and non-pregnant females,&#xD;
      18-49 years old. The subjects will be screened at enrollment with a history and physical exam&#xD;
      and laboratory testing to ensure they are healthy enough to participate. Qualifying subjects&#xD;
      will be vaccinated with an FDA approved seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV)&#xD;
      according to the package insert. The study will enroll 10 healthy volunteers per vaccination&#xD;
      season in years 1, 2, and 4; as well as 20 healthy volunteers per vaccination season in years&#xD;
      5 and 6 of this study, for a total enrollment of 70 subjects. The primary objective of the&#xD;
      study is to characterize HA-specific plasmablasts and memory B cells after influenza&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;

      This is an open label, single arm, study of longitudinal immunologic responses to influenza&#xD;
      vaccine in healthy adult subjects. This study will enroll males and non-pregnant females,&#xD;
      18-49 years old. The study duration is 6 years and participant duration of 180 days. The&#xD;
      subjects will be screened at enrollment with a history and physical exam and laboratory&#xD;
      testing to ensure they are healthy enough to participate. Qualifying subjects will be&#xD;
      vaccinated with an FDA approved seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) according to the&#xD;
      package insert. Approximately 450 ml of blood will be collected for the research assays&#xD;
      during the course of the study. Specifically, 16 ml will be collected for screening; 48ml&#xD;
      will be collected at enrollment; 96ml will be collected at visit days 7 and 14; and 64 ml&#xD;
      will be collected at 28, 90, and 180 days post vaccination. The study will enroll 10 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers per vaccination season in years 1, 2, and 4; as well as 20 healthy volunteers per&#xD;
      vaccination season in years 5 and 6 of this study, for a total enrollment of 70 subjects.&#xD;
      Individuals who complete the study will be given the option to re-enroll in subsequent years&#xD;
      as long as they continue to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Re-enrolling subjects will&#xD;
      be re-consented, given new subject identifiers, and counted towards the enrollment number&#xD;
      goal for each year of participation. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all non-essential research&#xD;
      was halted in mid-March 2020. New enrollments were placed on hold for this study. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to characterize HA-specific plasmablasts and memory B cells after&#xD;
      influenza vaccination and the secondary objective is to investigate the longevity of humoral&#xD;
      immunity to influenza virus in humans.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Female subjects of child bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known infection with HIV, HCV, or HBV. This information will be obtained verbally from&#xD;
             the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If female, active pregnancy or breast-feeding or plans to become pregnant during study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site principal&#xD;
             investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, is a contraindication to study&#xD;
             participation. This includes any chronic medical disease or condition, defined as&#xD;
             persisting 3 months (defined as 90 days) or longer, that would place the subject at an&#xD;
             unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the&#xD;
             protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses or the subject's&#xD;
             successful completion of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have an acute illness, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate&#xD;
             sub-investigator, within 72 hours prior to study vaccination. An acute illness which&#xD;
             is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms remaining is allowable if, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, the&#xD;
             residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess safety parameters as&#xD;
             required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Persons taking anticoagulants, long-term aspirin therapy, or long-term systemic&#xD;
             steroids (greater than 3 months in the past 12 months and any within 30 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have known hypersensitivity or allergy to eggs, egg or chicken protein, or other&#xD;
             components of the study vaccine;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have a known latex allergy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have a history of severe reactions following previous immunization with licensed&#xD;
             influenza virus vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have a history of Guillain-Barre syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects who had or are suspected to have had an influenza infection in the current&#xD;
             influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects who, at screening, have abnormal vital signs and/or physical exam, including&#xD;
             a temperature &gt; / = 38.0 C, Systolic blood pressure &lt; / = 90 or &gt; / = 160 mmHg, pulse&#xD;
             &lt; / = 60 or &gt; 110 beats per minute, new rash, signs of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects who have already received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the current&#xD;
             influenza vaccination season.&#xD;
