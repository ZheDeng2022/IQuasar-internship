    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that hypertension increases the&#xD;
      anti-natriuretic effects of an angiotensin receptor antagonist during mental stress in&#xD;
      overweight/obese African-American's who retain sodium during mental stress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a crossover design, we will compare the effects of a placebo to an angiotensin II&#xD;
      receptor antagonist on the urinary sodium excretion response in obese normotensive subjects&#xD;
      and untreated hypertensive African-Americans subjects. We expect that the urinary sodium&#xD;
      excretion response to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy will be less in the&#xD;
      overweight/obese hypertensive subjects compared to the overweight/obese normotensive&#xD;
      subjects. This study will also employ a double blind placebo controlled cross-over drug&#xD;
      study. Half of the subjects will be normotensive and half drug naïve hypertensive. The&#xD;
      normotensive subjects will be identified as described above for Studies 1 and 2. The&#xD;
      hypertensive subjects will be identified by Dr. White or his team in the hypertension clinic.&#xD;
      These patients will be restricted to those not currently on anti-hypertensive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve a screening visit, two first dose visits and two testing weeks over&#xD;
      an approximate 5 week period (this includes a one week &quot;washout&quot; period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each testing week will have a 3 day salt-controlled diet prior to testing and an approximate&#xD;
      3-hour testing period on Day 4. The 3-hour testing period will include 10 minutes of a&#xD;
      baseline rest, 45 minutes of mild stress (competitive video game), and 45 minutes of a&#xD;
      recovery rest. A total of 4 blood and 4 urine samples will be collected during the 3-hour&#xD;
      period. Each blood draw will consist of about 7 teaspoons for a total of 28 teaspoons per&#xD;
      week. If female, a pregnancy test will be performed at the beginning of each testing visit&#xD;
      (screening, first dose-1, test day-1, first dose -2 and test day-2) to confirm that they are&#xD;
      not pregnant. The week before testing, the subject will come to the Georgia Prevention&#xD;
      Institute or Children's Research Unit for the First Dose Visit and meet with one of the study&#xD;
      physicians who will give me instructions on how to take Avapro. This appointment will last&#xD;
      about 2 ½ hours. They will take their first dose of Avapro or the placebo and will be&#xD;
      monitored for the next 2 hours. If female subject, they will provide a urine sample for a&#xD;
      pregnancy test to make sure they are not pregnant before they are given the first dose of the&#xD;
      study medication. During this time, their blood pressure will be taken every 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening and testing, each subject will be asked to take the MoCA (the Montreal&#xD;
      Cognitive Assessment) test in order to measure cognitive thinking after stress. It is a brief&#xD;
      30-question test which takes around 10 minutes to complete. It measures different types of&#xD;
      cognitive abilities, including orientation (the approximate position of something/someone),&#xD;
      short-term memory (remember information for a short period of time), executive function&#xD;
      (planning and problem solving), language abilities (assign appropriate names to appropriate&#xD;
      items), and visuospatial ability (determine distance from one object to another). Each&#xD;
      question is awarded a particular number of points depending on the accuracy of the answers&#xD;
      given. We will be looking to see if the total number of points earned changes in response&#xD;
      before and after stress. During the screening visit, they subject will take the MoCA test&#xD;
      which will take approximately 10 minutes. Someone from the research team will instruct the&#xD;
      subject as to what to do for each question and they will answer each one to the best of their&#xD;
      ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On testing day, a nurse/phlebotomist will insert a small needle attached to a plastic tube&#xD;
      called a catheter into a vein in the hand or arm. This procedure will allow the&#xD;
      nurse/phlebotomist to collect the 4 blood samples over the 3-hour testing period. The needle&#xD;
      stick may cause some temporary pain and may result in a black and blue mark. A device that&#xD;
      automatically takes blood pressure will then be put on the opposite arm. The subject will&#xD;
      also be given water to sip on during the duration of testing. Before testing begins, the&#xD;
      subject be instructed to take their last dose of medication. During the first 10 minute&#xD;
      baseline rest period, they will relax in a reclining chair. They can listen to music, read a&#xD;
      book or magazine or watch movies to pass the time. Blood pressure will be taken before and&#xD;
      after this 10 minute rest period. Once the baseline rest period is over, a blood and urine&#xD;
      sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the stress period, the subject will play a video game against another subject for 45&#xD;
      minutes. Blood pressure will continue to be measured every 10 minutes. They will also&#xD;
      continue to sip on water during this time. At the end of the game, another blood and urine&#xD;
      sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will then be asked to complete the MoCA test a second time. It will be the same&#xD;
      questions that was asked during the screening visit. A research team member will instruct the&#xD;
      subject again as to how to answer each question and they will answer them to the best of&#xD;
      their ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last 45 minute recovery period of relaxation will be the same as the first (reading,&#xD;
      listening to music or watching movies). Blood pressure will continue to be taken every 10&#xD;
      minutes. Once the 45 minutes has ended the last blood and urine sample will be collected and&#xD;
      the testing day will have been completed. They will repeat this whole process a second time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During test day one or test day two, each subject will have a Dual Energy X-ray&#xD;
      Absorptiometer (DEXA) scan and a Peripheral Quantitative Computer Tomography (pQCT) scan&#xD;
      performed on them The DEXA is to assess bone mineral density (BMD), body fat percentage and&#xD;
      lean tissue. The pQCT will assess bone strength at the radius and tibia. For The DEXA, the&#xD;
      subject will remove any items that may contain metal - including jewelry, belts, shoes and&#xD;
      piercings. A gown will be provided if needed. The subject will lie on a table for&#xD;
      approximately 6 minutes, while the table rotates and a mechanical arm moves above the subject&#xD;
      body measuring for the BMI. For the pQCT, the subject will be seated and position their&#xD;
      forearm into the pQCT device and remain still for 3-5 minutes. They will then place their&#xD;
      lower leg into the same device for another 3-5 minutes to be scanned. If the subject is&#xD;
      female, a pregnancy test will be performed before any testing begins for each testing visit&#xD;
      in order to confirm the subject is not pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone and Body Composition Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry will be performed at baseline and posttest to assess total&#xD;
      body composition. The body composition variables of interest will be fat-free soft tissue&#xD;
      mass and fat mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral quantitative computed tomography will be performed at baseline visit only to&#xD;
      assess bone strength at the radius and tibia. During the scan, the participant must place&#xD;
      their forearm or lower leg into the pQCT unit and remain still for three to five minutes&#xD;
      (actual scan duration for each).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the forearm scan, the participant is seated in a chair at the side of the pQCT unit. The&#xD;
      participant sits as close as possible to the unit. The shoulder should be close to the front&#xD;
      side of the gantry. The armrest of the machine is adjusted to the measured forearm length.&#xD;
      The elbow is fixed at the corner of the armrest with the Velcro strap and the distal forearm&#xD;
      is fixed with the clamp. The angle between upper arm and forearm should not exceed 90°. The&#xD;
      hand lies on the hand rest. The fixation of the arm should prevent movement artifacts but&#xD;
      must not hurt. The participant is asked to search for a convenient and natural position to&#xD;
      avoid movement or discomfort during the scanning period of 3-5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the lower leg scan, the participant is seated on a chair in front of the pQCT unit. When&#xD;
      the machine is at the start position, the participant's lower leg is moved through the gantry&#xD;
      and the foot is rested on the foot holder. With the foot holder positioned all the way to the&#xD;
      front of the pQCT unit, the lower leg is centered and fixed into the concentric acrylic&#xD;
      cylinder (diameter 18 cm), which is located at the gantry opening. The foot is now fixed with&#xD;
      the Velcro strap to the foot holder. Before the scan, the participant is asked to find a&#xD;
      convenient and natural position to reduce movement artifacts during the 3-5 minute scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radial and tibial measurements will be taken at the 4% and 20% sites for bone outcomes,&#xD;
      proximal to the articular surface of the distal end of the tibia and radius. The 4% and 20%&#xD;
      sites represent areas high in trabecular and cortical bone, respectively. Each scan will be&#xD;
      acquired with a 0.4 mm voxel size and a slice thickness of 2.4 mm. The anatomic reference&#xD;
      line (for determination of the distal end of the radius or tibia) will be identified by&#xD;
      acquisition of a 30 mm planar scout view of the joint line and automatically set by the&#xD;
      software at 4% or 20% sites. Image processing and calculation of the bone measures will be&#xD;
      determined using the Stratec software (version 6.02 d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the trabecular sites of the radius and tibia, total volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD,&#xD;
      mg/cm3) and total cross-sectional area (CSA, mm2) will be measured to calculate bone strength&#xD;
      index (BSI; mg2/mm4, Equation 1), an estimate of bone's ability to withstand compressional&#xD;
      strains. At the cortical bone sites of the radius and tibia, cortical vBMD (mg/cm3), cortical&#xD;
      CSA (mm2), and cortical thickness (mm) will be measured to calculate the strength-strain&#xD;
      index (SSI, mm3), which reflects torsional bone strength. The SSI is calculated as the&#xD;
      integrated product of the section modulus and the density of cortical bone (Equation 2).&#xD;
      Section modulus is calculated as (a x d2)/dmax, where a is the CSA of a voxel, d is the&#xD;
      distance of the voxel from the center of gravity, and dmax is the maximum distance of one&#xD;
      voxel to the center of gravity. The ratio of cortical vBMD and normal physiological density&#xD;
      (ND = 1200 mg/cm3) provides an estimate of the modulus of elasticity.&#xD;
