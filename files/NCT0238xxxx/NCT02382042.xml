      Background Participation in continuing care is one of the two most significant factors in&#xD;
      preventing relapse after intensive Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment.1 A primary&#xD;
      component of continuing care, social support, is a protective factor for SUD treatment&#xD;
      relapse.2 Social support provided by community self-help groups (e.g. 12-step programs such&#xD;
      as Alcoholics Anonymous) improves Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment outcomes.1,4&#xD;
      Post-treatment referral to self-help groups was recently described as &quot;an effective, low-cost&#xD;
      option,&quot;3 but counselors vary in their referral methods, often simply telling patients to&#xD;
      find and attend meetings in their community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study of urban veterans leaving treatment, researchers increased 1-year SUD abstinence&#xD;
      rates by more than 24% through a three-step intensive referral intervention.5 First,&#xD;
      counselors discussed the importance of social support and meeting attendance. Second,&#xD;
      counselors identified accessible self-help meetings near the SUD treatment site and arranged&#xD;
      for a meeting liaison to accompany the patient to a meeting. Third, counselors followed up on&#xD;
      attendance and addressed obstacles. A follow-up study found patients with co-morbid SUD and&#xD;
      psychiatric problems significantly benefitted from the intervention.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have adapted this intervention so that it can be utilized in a rural as&#xD;
      well as urban setting. The investigators have trained clinical staff, measured their fidelity&#xD;
      to the intervention and successfully implemented it across three Veteran's Affairs (VA)&#xD;
      Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment programs (Omaha, Lincoln and Grand Island). In 2012 an&#xD;
      intriguing study showed that peer referral to 12-step support groups was significantly more&#xD;
      effective than clinician referral.7 This is of particular interest given the scarcity of&#xD;
      addiction counselors in rural communities and enhances the intervention's applicability to&#xD;
      rural settings and other disciplines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim The investigators propose implementing this intervention in a correction&#xD;
      population (Intervention Group) and comparing outcomes between the Intervention Group and a&#xD;
      group who are receiving standard correction services (Standard Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Phase I: Adapt Intensive Referral Intervention for correction population Phase II:&#xD;
      Train correction staff in Intervention Research staff will train and continue to monitor&#xD;
      trained correction staff to ensure fidelity to intervention and provide feedback to staff and&#xD;
      leadership regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III: Comparison between Intervention Group and Standard Group The two groups will be&#xD;
      compared on measures of interest to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services and on&#xD;
      measures of substance use, support group attendance and involvement at standard time points.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rural veterans have disproportionately served in OEF and OIF and are returning to their&#xD;
      communities with significant substance use disorder (SUD) and trauma-related symptoms.&#xD;
      Participation in post-treatment continuing care is one of the two most significant factors in&#xD;
      preventing relapse after intensive SUD treatment,1 but as a result of the reorganization of&#xD;
      SUD services within the VHA, rural veterans have less access than non-rural veterans to&#xD;
      continuing care. A primary component of continuing care, social support, is a protective&#xD;
      factor for SUD treatment relapse2 and post-deployment traumatic stress symptoms.3 Social&#xD;
      support provided by community self-help groups (e.g. 12-step programs such as Alcoholics&#xD;
      Anonymous) improves outcomes1,4 and efforts to promote participation reduce continuing care&#xD;
      costs.2 Post-treatment referral to self-help groups was recently described as &quot;an effective,&#xD;
      low-cost option,&quot;3 but treatment counselors vary in their referral methods, often simply&#xD;
      telling patients to find and attend meetings in their community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study of urban veterans leaving treatment, researchers increased 1-year SUD abstinence&#xD;
      rates by more than 24% through a three-step intensive referral intervention.5 First,&#xD;
      counselors discussed the importance of social support and meeting attendance. Second,&#xD;
      counselors identified accessible self-help meetings near the SUD treatment site and arranged&#xD;
      for a meeting liaison to accompany the patient to a meeting. Third, counselors followed up on&#xD;
      attendance and addressed obstacles. A follow-up study found patients with comorbid SUD and&#xD;
      psychiatric problems (like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) significantly benefitted from the&#xD;
      intervention.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementing intensive referral with rural veterans is problematic because their initial SUD&#xD;
      treatment typically occurs in an intensive residential setting in a location which is removed&#xD;
      from the veteran's home and family. During this intensive residential SUD treatment, rural&#xD;
      veterans attend self-help meetings near the residential treatment program with the goals of&#xD;
      1) identifying meetings they enjoy, 2) developing relationships with others who attend these&#xD;
      meetings, and 3) obtaining a sponsor who will serve as a mentor to the newly sober veteran.&#xD;
      However, upon discharge from residential SUD treatment, rural veterans return to their rural&#xD;
      communities without these supports in place. Additionally, rural veterans attending 12- step&#xD;
      meetings are likely to have challenges unique to their rural settings. In rural communities&#xD;
      veterans are more likely to be recognized by others they know and rural residents rate&#xD;
      self-help groups as less acceptable than urban residents do.7 Additionally, the only&#xD;
      self-help groups consistently available in small communities are AA meetings which may cause&#xD;
      some tension and ambivalence in those with problems other than alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members are another source of social support preventing SUD relapse,8 but rural&#xD;
      veterans may not receive the same family support benefits urban veterans do. In urban&#xD;
      veterans' SUD treatment, family members are typically involved in their treatment. The family&#xD;
      members of rural veterans, however, are less likely to attend educational, individual or&#xD;
      group sessions given their distance from the residential SUD treatment site and typically&#xD;
      have no support themselves as they interact with their returning veteran. Thus, rural&#xD;
      veterans return home to live with families who may be less able to provide meaningful support&#xD;
      to their newly sober veteran.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further complicating this clinical picture is the presence of trauma symptoms. Among those&#xD;
      seeking SUD treatment, nearly all report lifetime trauma exposure and one-third are diagnosed&#xD;
      with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).9 The prevalence among veterans is likely higher.&#xD;
      Persons with dual disorders, such as PTSD and SUD, have poorer SUD treatment outcomes, and&#xD;
      may be at higher risk for homelessness. Self-help groups improve the outcomes for those with&#xD;
      concurrent PTSD and SUD.10 Dr. Timko's work has established that the intensive referral&#xD;
      intervention, to be adapted in this project, resulted in an 18% reduction in the number of&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms and a 26% reduction in perceived need for mental health treatment.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose an intensive referral adapted to the needs of rural veterans,&#xD;
      modifying the existing intensive referral two ways. First, the adapted intensive referral&#xD;
      will present information addressing recovery challenges specific to rural veterans: building&#xD;
      support networks, overcoming distance, finding transportation, locating professional&#xD;
      resources, using online support, and preparing for relapse emergencies. These modifications&#xD;
      will also be provided as options for those accessing the VA's intensive referral Self-Help&#xD;
      Toolkit, available online. Second, the adapted intensive referral will enlist family support&#xD;
      for self-help groups, stressing the importance of meetings and encouraging family members to&#xD;
      provide transportation and/or attend the meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to adapt an intensive self-help referral intervention for the&#xD;
      450 rural and highly rural veterans in SUD treatment in NWI HCS, train one-half of the&#xD;
      Nebraska Wwesterion Iowa Health Care System SUD treatment staff in the intervention and test&#xD;
      it as a pilot project. The Specific Aims of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether adapted intensive referral to community-based support groups&#xD;
           increases the effectiveness of SUD treatment in rural veterans,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if co-occurring PTSD and family involvement are factors in responsiveness&#xD;
           to the adapted intensive referral intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Intensive Referral Self-Help Toolkit Adapted to Serve Rural Veterans The&#xD;
      investigators will adapt the VA's Intensive Referral Self-Help Toolkit, a practical guide to&#xD;
      assist veterans' transition into community self-help groups. The adaptation will specifically&#xD;
      address factors which are unique to rural veterans such as lack of &quot;drug-related&quot; meetings,&#xD;
      concerns about anonymity, distance and transportation. Secondly, the intensive referral will&#xD;
      be adapted to include the enhancement of family involvement in the referral process. Dr.&#xD;
      Timko will assist us with the adaptation and feedback from veterans, family members, 12-step&#xD;
      group liaisons and providers will inform modification of the Toolkit to address the specific&#xD;
      needs of rural veterans, their families, and their healthcare providers. Also in Phase I the&#xD;
      Project Peer Support Specialist will canvass self-help groups throughout rural Nebraska and&#xD;
      western Iowa to identify 12-step meetings which are welcoming to persons with drug as well as&#xD;
      alcohol addictions and individuals willing to serve as a group liaison to support and attend&#xD;
      meetings with the veteran and their family member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: SUD Staff Trained in Intervention Dr. Grant and the Project Manager will meet with&#xD;
      SUD treatment leadership and staff at the three Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System&#xD;
      (NWI-HCS) locations (Grand Island, Lincoln and Omaha) and orient them to the project.&#xD;
      One-half of the Addiction Therapists at each site will be trained in the modified Intensive&#xD;
      Referral Self-Help Toolkit in Year One. These Addiction Therapists will role-play this&#xD;
      intervention with Project staff in individual and group settings. The remaining Addiction&#xD;
      Therapists will continue to utilize Standard Referral (i.e. simply encouraging meeting&#xD;
      attendance). The Program Manager will continue to monitor those trained Addiction Therapists&#xD;
      to ensure that the intervention remains consistent with the Toolkit and will meet with staff&#xD;
      and leadership regularly at each site to provide feedback. Veterans assigned to trained&#xD;
      Addiction Therapists will receive Intensive Referral while those assigned to other Addiction&#xD;
      Therapists will receive Standard Referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III: Comparison Between Intensive Referral Group and Standard Care Group Rural veterans&#xD;
      will be contacted by telephone at 6-months post discharge from intensive SUD treatment. The&#xD;
      two groups (Intensive Referral v. Standard Referral) will be compared on measures of&#xD;
      substance use, addiction severity, trauma symptoms, satisfaction with referral process,&#xD;
      family support, support group attendance and involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of data analysis and statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be contacted by telephone at 6-months post discharge from intensive&#xD;
      SUD treatment. The two groups (Intensive Referral v. Standard Referral) will be compared on&#xD;
      measures of substance use, addiction severity, trauma symptoms, family support, support group&#xD;
      attendance and involvement and satisfaction with the referral process. The investigators also&#xD;
      will determine whether veterans with a co-occurring PTSD diagnosis benefit more from the&#xD;
      enhanced intensive referral compared to standard referral and the investigators will&#xD;
      determine whether 6-month abstinence rates are lower for those with family support compared&#xD;
      to those without family support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the populations of interest for this study are rural and highly rural Veterans, rural&#xD;
      and highly rural status will be defined by zip code of residence at the time the follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaire is administered, six months after discharge from SUD treatment. Patients may be&#xD;
      admitted from a 'rural zip code' but at discharge move to a residence in an 'urban zip code.'&#xD;
      The investigators will initially compare outcomes between all participants who received the&#xD;
      Intensive Referral and those who received Standard Referral. The investigators will then&#xD;
      compare outcomes between the two groups (Intensive Referral v. Standard Referral) in those&#xD;
      veterans who are living in rural or very rural zip codes at six months post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to compare two groups of veterans (those who received Intensive Referral and those&#xD;
      who received Standard Referral), a series of independent sample t-tests will be run to see&#xD;
      whether these two groups significantly differ on measures of substance use, addiction&#xD;
      severity, trauma symptoms, satisfaction with referral process, and family support. Next the&#xD;
      investigators will use Pearson correlation coefficients to look for significant positive or&#xD;
      negative effects of referral type (i.e., intensive v. standard) with the measures listed&#xD;
      above. The next step of the process will be to run ordinary least squares (OLS) regression&#xD;
      models given the continuous nature of our main outcome variable, substance use. The&#xD;
      investigators will first run models to examine main effects. Next, the investigators will&#xD;
      test for interaction effects to determine whether the effect of PTSD on substance use&#xD;
      disorder varies by type of referral. Finally, ordinary least squares regression models will&#xD;
      be run to determine whether 6-month abstinence rates are lower for those without family&#xD;
      support compared to those with family support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, this will be the first evidence-based substance abuse intervention to be&#xD;
      modified for rural veterans. If effective, this SUD intervention will be the first to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specifically improve sobriety rates in rural veterans,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incorporate family members into the intervention,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess rural veteran satisfaction with the intensive referral,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if trauma symptoms are improved in rural veterans with adapted intensive&#xD;
           referral,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if family involvement enhances responsiveness to adapted intensive referral,&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significantly decrease relapse rates in rural veterans, thus decreasing their&#xD;
           re-hospitalizations and subsequent health care costs.&#xD;
