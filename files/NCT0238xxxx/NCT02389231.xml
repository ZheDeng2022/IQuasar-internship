  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have demonstrated that the mean percentage of circulating CD8+ regulatory T&#xD;
      (CD8 Tregs) cells is significantly higher in patients with warm hemolytic anemia (wAHAI) in&#xD;
      remission than in controls and is correlated to hemoglobin levels. In vitro, low dose of&#xD;
      interleukine-2 (IL2) induce the expansion of CD8 Tregs. The objective is to demonstrate that,&#xD;
      over a 9 week treatment period; low doses of IL2 can induce the expansion of CD8Tregs in&#xD;
      patients with active wAHAI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      wAIHA is a B-cell-mediated autoimmune disease in which red blood cells are targeted by&#xD;
      autoantibodies, which leads to marked decrease in their lifespan. The investigators&#xD;
      demonstrated two years ago in a multivariate retrospective study that the CD3+CD8+ HLA-DR+&#xD;
      T-cell population was associated to a better outcome. The investigators observed that the&#xD;
      proportion of circulating CD3+CD8+CD25highFoxp3+ T cells was significantly higher in patients&#xD;
      with wAIHA in remission than in controls and correlated to hemoglobin levels. Extensive&#xD;
      phenotyping and functional analysis revealed that those cells were bona fide Tregs acting in&#xD;
      an IL10-dependent manner. Finally, culture of PBMC from normal donors or active wAIHAI&#xD;
      patients with low dose of IL2 promoted the expansion of functional CD3+CD8+CD25+Foxp3+. Those&#xD;
      observations constituted the rationale to propose low dose of IL2 to treat patients with&#xD;
      active wAIHA with the objective of demonstrating that this treatment is able to induce the&#xD;
      expansion of CD8Tregs, over a 9 week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four courses of IL2 (aldesleukin [Proleukin, Novartis]) will be administered subcutaneously&#xD;
      for 5 days. The first course will be limited to a dose of 1.5 million IU per day and followed&#xD;
      by a 9 day wash-out. The other courses of 3 million IU per day will be initiated after a 16&#xD;
      day wash-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated on day 1 and day 5 of each treatment course, before the first and&#xD;
      last administration of interleukin-2 and will also be evaluated at 6 months.&#xD;
