    <textblock>
      A single-arm, open-label Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the effect of G-202 on the&#xD;
      perfusion and volume of the prostate using non-invasive multiparametric prostate magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (mpMRI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than one-third of patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer who undergo radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy eventually relapse with distant disease and some data suggest that neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment in this patient population may be helpful. This study is based on prodrug tumor&#xD;
      targeting, in which an inactive form of a toxic agent is administered systemically and gets&#xD;
      activated in specific locations in the body, resulting in higher concentrations of the&#xD;
      cytotoxic form at the tumor location. G-202 is a prodrug that is activated in prostate cancer&#xD;
      tissue and in the blood vessels of tumors, but not normal tissue; once activated, G-202 leads&#xD;
      to disruption of intracellular calcium levels and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Thus,&#xD;
      G-202 is expected to bring about cell death in prostate cancer cells and to destroy the blood&#xD;
      supply of prostate tumors. G-202 has led to disease stabilization in some patients, but the&#xD;
      drug has not been evaluated in the neoadjuvant setting. This single-arm, open-label Phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial will evaluate the safety and activity of G-202 in patients with localized&#xD;
      high-risk prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy. Through its effects on the&#xD;
      neovasculature of tumors, G-202 is anticipated to disrupt the blood supply of the prostate&#xD;
      tumor, resulting in decreased perfusion and subsequent tumor volume. The primary endpoint of&#xD;
      this study is evaluation of G-202 on the perfusion and volume of the prostate using&#xD;
      non-invasive multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).&#xD;
