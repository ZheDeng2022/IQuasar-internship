    <textblock>
      IgA nephropathy occurs when IgA-a protein that helps the body fight infections-settles in the&#xD;
      kidneys. IgA deposits may cause the kidneys to leak blood and sometimes protein in the urine.&#xD;
      Proteinuria (abnormal amounts of protein in urine) can be a sign of kidney damage. Current&#xD;
      treatments for IgA nephropathy is limited to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor&#xD;
      medications with fish oil. ACE Inhibitors, also called ACEI medications, slows the&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme so that blood vessels can be relaxed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves the study drugs, Acthar and Lisinopril (an ACEI medication routinely&#xD;
      given for high blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous clinical studies, some subjects with IgA nephropathy have experienced reductions&#xD;
      in proteinuria with consistent use of Acthar. Acthar is approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) and used to treat patients with proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to study the safety and effectiveness of the study drug Acthar given at&#xD;
      different doses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participation in this study may last up to 2 years (from first visit to final visit) and&#xD;
      includes 10 study visits and 8 phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will receive Acthar 80 unit injection 2 times per week or&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B will receive Acthar 80 unit injection 3 times per week&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be prescribed Lisinopril (10mg per day or higher depending on your&#xD;
      blood pressure) as part of regular care for their condition. If they are already on another&#xD;
      ACEI, Lisinopril will be prescribed. If subjects are unable to tolerate Lisinopril or other&#xD;
      ACEI medications, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) will be prescribed. ARBs are another&#xD;
      type of medication that also helps relax blood vessels if subjects cannot tolerate ACEI&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of which treatment group subjects are assigned,everyone will self-inject the study&#xD;
      drug using a subcutaneous (SC) injection under the skin using a needle and syringe. Subjects&#xD;
      will be trained on the proper technique to be used for each injection before taking study&#xD;
      drug home. Enough of the study drug will be given to take home (based on which group the&#xD;
      subject is in) to administer until they are seen in 3 months for their next study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken for lab tests at each visit and biomarkers (Screening Visit and&#xD;
      Visit 9). Women of childbearing potential will also have a pregnancy test done. Approximately&#xD;
      4 teaspoons of blood will be drawn for the Screening Visit and Visit 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must fast at least 8 hours prior to the blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING VISIT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent will be obtained;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed, demographics and medical history will be&#xD;
           collected (including PCR and urinalysis results as these tests are routinely done as&#xD;
           part of regular care);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test if subject is a female of child bearing potential;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height/Weight collected;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs will be obtained. Blood pressure will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples collected for study specific tests (aldosterone and cortisol)&#xD;
           (approximately 2 teaspoons) and biomarkers (approximately 2 teaspoons). No more than&#xD;
           approximately 4 teaspoons will be collected at this study visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who do not meet eligibility criteria during the initial screening attempt will be&#xD;
      permitted to rescreen 2 times, for a total of 3 screening attempts. Rescreen subjects must&#xD;
      first be registered as screen failed in the CTMS system and subsequently registered as a&#xD;
      rescreen subject. Once the subject is registered as rescreened, all screening procedures will&#xD;
      need to be repeated.;The exact time interval of each re-screen would be at the discretion of&#xD;
      the investigator. Completion of rescreen would be no greater than 6 months from the initial&#xD;
      screening date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 1 (BASELINE, DAY 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test if subject is a female of child bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first study drug dose in the clinic under the supervision of the study staff.&#xD;
           Subject will remain at the clinic for at least 1 hour for monitoring of any allergic&#xD;
           reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will receive enough study drug (8 for those dosing twice a week and 11 for&#xD;
           those dosing three times a week) to take home until their next visit in 3 months.&#xD;
           Subjects will also receive a dosing diary to keep track of each dose taken and any side&#xD;
           effects they may feel. Subjects will bring dosing diary with them to each study visit on&#xD;
           Visits 2-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the study staff will also call subjects once a week for the first 4 weeks after&#xD;
      starting study drug (Visit 1) to make sure they are taking the study drug as required,&#xD;
      completing the dosing diary, if they are taking any other medications and if they are&#xD;
      experiencing any side effects. There will be 4 phone calls between Visit 1 and Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISITS 2-5 ONLY (MONTHS 3, 6, 9, 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosing diary is collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study medication accountability is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test if subject is a female of child bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acthar medication is dispensed (Visits 2-4 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney biopsy performed - Visit 5 only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney biopsy procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have to go to nearby hospital within 1 week of completing Visit 5 to have this&#xD;
      outpatient procedure done. Subjects will be asked to lie on their stomach face down with a&#xD;
      pillow under their rib cage for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Ultrasound may be used to find the&#xD;
      proper biopsy site. A local numbing medicine (anesthetic) will be injected under their skin&#xD;
      near the biopsy area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital staff will make a tiny cut in the skin and insert a biopsy needle into the area&#xD;
      and to the surface of the kidney. Subjects will be asked to take a deep breath and hold&#xD;
      breath as a thin needle is passed through the skin into the kidney. Inside the needle is a&#xD;
      sharp edge that will remove small pieces of the kidney. The biopsy needle will then be&#xD;
      withdrawn, and pressure will be applied to the biopsy site to stop the minor bleeding that&#xD;
      usually occurs after the biopsy. After the procedure, a bandage will be applied to the biopsy&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital staff will give subject numbing or pain medicines as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISITS 2-9 (MONTHS 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed, demographics and medical history will be&#xD;
           collected;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height/Weight collected;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs will be obtained. Blood pressure will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples collected for study specific tests (aldosterone and cortisol)&#xD;
           (approximately 2 teaspoons). Biomarkers (approximately 2 teaspoons) will also be&#xD;
           collected at Visit 9. No more than approximately 4 teaspoons will be collected at Visit&#xD;
           9;&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Visit 2, a member of the study staff will continue to call you about every 1 Â½ months&#xD;
      to make sure subjects are taking the study drug as required, if subjects are taking any other&#xD;
      medications and if they are experiencing any side effects. There will be 4 more phone calls&#xD;
      that will occur between Visit 2-3, Visit 3-4, Visit 4-5 and Visit 5-6. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      a total of 8 phone calls during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total amount of blood collected over the course of this study is no more than&#xD;
      approximately 38 teaspoons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with the study drugs will continue for the first 12 months of participation in this&#xD;
      study. If subjects do not respond after 3 months of treatment or only partially respond to&#xD;
      the treatment, dosage may be increased (up to 120 unit injections twice a week for 3 months).&#xD;
      If subjects still do not respond at the increased dose, the study drug will be discontinued&#xD;
      after another 3 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects respond to the treatment during the 12 months of treatment but then their&#xD;
      response goes away during the follow up period, they will be placed back on study drug for an&#xD;
      additional 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, for any reason, the study drug is stopped before the last treatment visit, subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to come into the clinic to complete study procedures. Subjects will be asked to have&#xD;
      all end-of-study testing done for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acthar cannot be abruptly stopped and must be gradually lessened. Except if subjects are&#xD;
      experiencing an allergic reaction, the drug will be administered at half the dose for 1 week,&#xD;
      then Â¼ dose for another week, then stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects are on insulin or other oral antidiabetic medications, Acthar may decrease&#xD;
      glucose (sugar) tolerance. This may result in an increase blood sugar. Subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to let the study doctor know if they are on these medications to discuss glucose monitoring&#xD;
      and a plan on how to keep taking these medications while on Acthar and what to do if they&#xD;
      experience an increase in blood sugar.&#xD;
