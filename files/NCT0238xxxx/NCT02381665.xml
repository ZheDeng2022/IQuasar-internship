  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic constipation is a strong public health problem. Its prevalence is about 15% in&#xD;
      Western countries with a significant impact on quality of life and health care costs . Two&#xD;
      subtypes of constipation can be identified: slow transit constipation (STC), characterized by&#xD;
      impaired propulsion of stool and due to dysfunction of colonic smooth muscle (myopathy) or&#xD;
      its innervation (neuropathy), or both; and evacuation disorders, characterized by difficulty&#xD;
      or inability with stool expulsion. They include disorders of the anorectal function such as&#xD;
      dyssynergic defecation, as well as structural disorders such as rectocele, descending&#xD;
      perineum syndrome and rectal prolapse .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first line therapy of chronic constipation is based on medical treatment combined with&#xD;
      laxatives and dietary rules. However, these treatments are often disappointing. In case of&#xD;
      failure, few treatment options are currently available. Surgery can sometimes be discussed&#xD;
      for intractable chronic constipation. Sub-total colectomy can be proposed in case of STC but&#xD;
      is associated with a significant morbidity. In case of pelvic floor disorders, a specific&#xD;
      surgical treatment can be indicated. However, surgery is invasive, has a significant&#xD;
      morbidity and the results are inconsistent. Recently, some studies have assessed the efficacy&#xD;
      of sacral neuromodulation in the treatment of chronic constipation with some success, but&#xD;
      this technique is expensive and requires the surgical implantation of a medical device . More&#xD;
      recent works, including a randomized trial have showed, in children, the efficacy of&#xD;
      interferential current stimulation in the treatment of chronic transit constipation . This&#xD;
      treatment is used daily, at home, and uses four adhesive surface electrodes, two abdominal&#xD;
      (placed below the costal margin) and two paraspinal (placed between T9 and L2) producing two&#xD;
      sinusoidal currents crossing the body, 1 hour per day for 1-3 months. To date, only one&#xD;
      open-label study has evaluated this technique in adults and has shown encouraging results in&#xD;
      three months with an efficiency on 7/11 patients (63.6%) in the number of stools, severity&#xD;
      score of constipation, quality of life's score associated with improved bowel transit time&#xD;
      measured by radio-markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interferential therapy is a new treatment that has demonstrated its efficiency in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic constipation in children. Our team has published the first and only&#xD;
      pilot study in adults that also demonstrated encouraging results. These data are of&#xD;
      particular interest since laxative treatments are often disappointing, are expensive and may&#xD;
      have adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would be the first randomized study to evaluate a non-invasive and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment of chronic constipation in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If its effectiveness is demonstrated, it will provide, for the first time, a new non-invasive&#xD;
      step for patients with laxative treatment failure before considering surgical treatment.&#xD;
