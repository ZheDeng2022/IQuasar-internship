  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diet plays a central role in the regulation of chronic inflammation. However, until the&#xD;
      investigators developed the dietary inflammatory index (DII) there had been no scientifically&#xD;
      valid way to relate what individuals eat to the capacity of foods consumed to modulate&#xD;
      inflammation. The DII provides a tool that will form the basis of a counseling/instructional&#xD;
      system aimed at helping patients and their providers to control chronic, systemic&#xD;
      inflammation by improving the diet with specific, actionable dietary recommendations,&#xD;
      counseling, and expert instruction. The goal of this study is to test the applicability of a&#xD;
      DII mobile tool and associated counseling measures in clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large, persuasive, and ever-increasing body of evidence links chronic inflammation to&#xD;
      virtually all of the chronic diseases that cause the majority of disability and death in the&#xD;
      U.S., including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and cancer. Diet plays a central&#xD;
      role in the regulation of chronic inflammation. However, until the investigators developed&#xD;
      the dietary inflammatory index (DII) there had been no scientifically valid way to relate&#xD;
      what individuals eat to the capacity of foods consumed to modulate inflammation. The new&#xD;
      generation DII has now produced an impressive research base that ranges from predicting blood&#xD;
      levels of inflammatory markers, to clinical conditions associated with inflammation, to a&#xD;
      variety of health-related endpoints including cancer incidence, CVDs and mortality (several&#xD;
      of which are already published). Connecting Health Innovations (CHI), LLC and the scientific&#xD;
      and clinical research partners at the University of South Carolina are committed to&#xD;
      translating these research findings to places of clinical need and public health relevance.&#xD;
      That commitment to translation provides the motivation for the current proposal. The DII&#xD;
      provides a tool that will form the basis of a counseling/instructional system aimed at&#xD;
      helping patients and their providers to control chronic, systemic inflammation by improving&#xD;
      the diet with specific, actionable dietary recommendations, counseling, and expert&#xD;
      instruction. This project is part of Phase II of the grant, which includes: 1) Designing and&#xD;
      implementing an intervention trial based on DII response associated recommendations aimed at&#xD;
      reducing levels of chronic inflammation in two diverse populations in Columbia, South&#xD;
      Carolina and 2) Providing data for developing methods for commercialization/ dissemination of&#xD;
      the product and associated software.&#xD;
