  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to estimate the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ADXS31-164.&#xD;
      Once the RP2D has been selected, up to 4 expansion cohorts will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, dose-escalation, open-label study in subjects with HER2 expressing solid&#xD;
      tumors. Subjects will receive escalating doses of ADXS31-164 every 3 weeks during a 12-week&#xD;
      treatment cycle. Subjects will receive a prophylactic regimen completed at least 30 minutes&#xD;
      prior to each ADXS31-164 infusion to mitigate and manage the potential immune response seen&#xD;
      with immunotherapy administration. In addition, all subjects will participate in a 3 year Lm&#xD;
      surveillance period. The surveillance period will begin following the last dose of study&#xD;
      treatment or at the time of study discontinuation. This period is intended to help ensure the&#xD;
      eradication of Lm bacteria. This period will also include a 6- month course of&#xD;
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole which will be initiated approximately 72 hours after the&#xD;
      completion of the last dose of ADXS31-164 or immediately following study discontinuation. In&#xD;
      subjects with a sulfa allergy, the 6-month course should consist of ampicillin 500 mg 4 times&#xD;
      daily initiated approximately 72 hours following the last dose of study treatment or&#xD;
      immediately following study discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalations and de-escalations will be dictated by a 3+3 design. Three dose levels may&#xD;
      be evaluated during the dose escalation portion starting with Dose Level 1 at 1 x 109 colony&#xD;
      forming units (CFU). Once the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and RP2D have been identified, up&#xD;
      to 4 HER2 overexpressing tumor specific expansion cohorts will be evaluated. The specific&#xD;
      tumor types included in the expansion cohorts may include breast and gastric cancer with the&#xD;
      remaining to be determined by the sponsor after review of data from Part A. Treatment cycles&#xD;
      can be repeated at the RP2D (or less) for each subject for up to 2 years, until a study&#xD;
      discontinuation criterion is met or he/she has completed &gt;6 months of study therapy and at&#xD;
      least 1 cycle of treatment post observation of a complete response (CR)&#xD;
