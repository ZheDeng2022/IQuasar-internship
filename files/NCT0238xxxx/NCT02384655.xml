  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feeding human milk to preterm infants does reduce the risk of serious and costly neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit acquired morbidity such as NEC and the late onset sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is often difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of human milk from mothers of preterm&#xD;
      infants most of whom are breast pump-dependent for weeks or months. Mothers will try to use&#xD;
      galactogogues in an attempt to increase milk production. Fenugreek (Trigonella&#xD;
      foenum-graecum) seeds is the most commonly used herbal galactogogue and is a member of the&#xD;
      pea family. Our experience at the NICU is that around 30% of preterm mothers desperately&#xD;
      looking for ways to increase their breast milk supply will eventually took fenugreek (Hilbe)&#xD;
      as food supplement. Although widely recommended, there is limited evidence to support the&#xD;
      effectiveness of fenugreek as a galactogogue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to evaluate whether maternal consumption of fenugreek seeds has&#xD;
      any effect on macronutrients composition of breast milk and whether fenugreek is transferred&#xD;
      to the infant via mother milk. In addition any changes in mother and infant health status&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
