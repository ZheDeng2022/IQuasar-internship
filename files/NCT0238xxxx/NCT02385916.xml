  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the Canadian Cancer Society, 1 in 9 Canadian women will develop breast cancer in&#xD;
      her lifetime and 1 in 30 will die. The single greatest risk factor of breast cancer is poor&#xD;
      estrogen metabolism. EstroSense®/MD is a natural health product that promotes and supports&#xD;
      healthy estrogen metabolism. It may increase the ratio of &quot;good estrogen&quot; to &quot;bad estrogen&quot;&#xD;
      and potentially reducing the risk of breast cancer. For this proposed study, the&#xD;
      investigators will be examining the effect of EstroSense®/MD compared to placebo, on estrogen&#xD;
      metabolism in 120 women.&#xD;

      This randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover trial will evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of daily consumption of EstroSense®/MD on estrogen profile in female subjects. 120 consenting&#xD;
      women will be enrolled (randomised) to participate in this study. Potential subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited by advertisements placed on notice boards around the university and at local&#xD;
      naturopath clinics. Advertisements may also be placed in local newspapers. The study consists&#xD;
      of four clinic visits. Individuals who are interested in participating will be asked to&#xD;
      contact the study coordinator to schedule their first clinic visit (Visit 1). At Visit 1 the&#xD;
      participant will be given information about the study and be given an opportunity to ask&#xD;
      about the study. Those women who are still interested in participating will be asked to sign&#xD;
      a consent form. Once consent if obtained screening and baseline data collection will begin.&#xD;
      If eligible, participants will be scheduled to return to the clinic 19-21 days after the&#xD;
      beginning of their last or next menstruation for Visit 2. At Visit 2 baseline data collection&#xD;
      will continue followed by random assignment to an intervention sequence. All participants&#xD;
      will be given and instructed to consume 3 capsules per day of EstroSense®/MD or Placebo for&#xD;
      three menstrual cycles. After consuming the study intervention for 3 cycles, the participant&#xD;
      will be asked to return to the clinic (19-21 days after the start of their third&#xD;
      menstruation) for Visit 3. At Visit 3 data will be collected and participants will be crossed&#xD;
      over to the other treatment for three more cycles. After 3 menstrual cycles (19-21 days after&#xD;
      the start of their third menstruation) the participant will return to the clinic for Visit 4&#xD;
      for final data collection. Visit 4 marks the end of the study. Participants will also be&#xD;
      provided with a diary throughout the study to record supplement use and any adverse events.&#xD;
