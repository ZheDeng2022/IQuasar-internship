    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of dasatinib and temsirolimus when&#xD;
      given together with cyclophosphamide in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread&#xD;
      to other places in the body, have come back, or have not respond to previous treatment.&#xD;
      Dasatinib and temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving dasatinib and temsirolimus&#xD;
      together with cyclophosphamide may be a better treatment for advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of&#xD;
      combination treatment with dasatinib, cyclophosphamide and temsirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of the combination of dasatinib, cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and temsirolimus administered on this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of the combination of dasatinib,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and temsirolimus within the confines of a phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Preliminary assessment of biological markers and correlates of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dasatinib and temsirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, cyclophosphamide PO&#xD;
      once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days&#xD;
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing stable disease or better may&#xD;
      continue treatment with the approval of the study chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
