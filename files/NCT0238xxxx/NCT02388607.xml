    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a psychiatric pathology, which concerns around 1% of adult population. It is&#xD;
      characterized by clinical symptoms combining positive and negative symptoms and thinking&#xD;
      disorganization. Schizophrenia is also characterized by cognitive deficits, likely to play an&#xD;
      important part in adaptation of these patients in their every-day life, and to affect their&#xD;
      clinical symptomatology. Among them, there are deficits in sustained attention which are&#xD;
      associated with a difficulty for these patients to maintain efficiently their cognitive&#xD;
      activity on a source of stimulation or task. This basic attentional process is fundamental&#xD;
      for the efficiency of the overall of cognitive processes, and so for all behaviors directed&#xD;
      on an aim. The question of whether or not patients with schizophrenia have difficulty&#xD;
      sustaining attention is of high relevance, in the sense that it could undermine performance&#xD;
      on nearly any task and so provide a compelling causal explanation of many other impairments&#xD;
      observed in these patients. Yet it has not been conclusively answered in over four decades of&#xD;
      research. Consequently, the main objective of the protocol is to evaluate sustained attention&#xD;
      abilities in schizophrenic patients and to better understand the specific functioning of&#xD;
      cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying these abilities (attentional resources and&#xD;
      cognitive control mechanisms).&#xD;
