  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in assessing the value of and comparing the use of automated&#xD;
      breast ultrasound (ABUS) (either as a primary screening approach or as a supplementary&#xD;
      procedure) with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). The purpose of this project is to perform&#xD;
      a preliminary prospective study on women who are most likely to benefit from the use of ABUS&#xD;
      and/or DBT (or a combination of both) in the screening environment.&#xD;

      1. After appropriate training and certification of technologists and Mammography Quality&#xD;
           Standards Act (MQSA) qualifications of the participating radiologists, the investigators&#xD;
           will recruit sequentially approximately 600 women known to have a defined region of&#xD;
           highly dense tissue or with known heterogeneously dense and/or primarily dense breast&#xD;
           tissue (from a prior mammogram) who are scheduled to undergo routine mammography&#xD;
           screening that includes a DBT examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Consenting women will undergo a DBT examination as part of their routine clinical exam&#xD;
           and an ABUS examination as a part of the experiment. All examinations will be performed&#xD;
           by certified technologists in the performance of each of the procedures in question (DBT&#xD;
           or ABUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. DBT, ABUS, and a combination of both, will be independently reviewed and interpreted&#xD;
           (Breast Imaging, Reporting and Data System rated) by experienced and specifically&#xD;
           trained, MQSA qualified radiologists in a cross balanced (cases by mode and by reader)&#xD;
           study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Using the results of the interpretations in a slightly modified &quot;LOGICAL OR&quot; mode,&#xD;
           namely the highest rating determines the recommendation/need for follow up, the&#xD;
           investigators will perform imaging based diagnostic work ups as needed (i.e., resulting&#xD;
           from the &quot;arbitration step&quot;). All diagnostic follow up studies, as needed, will not be a&#xD;
           part of the study protocol, with the exception of acquiring diagnostic outcome measures&#xD;
           from medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The investigators will compare rates of false positives as a result of interpreting DBT&#xD;
           vs. ABUS vs. a combination of both, including recall for additional testing,&#xD;
           short-interval follow-up rates and biopsy rates. The sample in this preliminary study is&#xD;
           too small to assess positive predictive values (PPVs), so the investigators will focus&#xD;
           here on negative predictive values (NPVs). For marginal value assessment when utilizing&#xD;
           both modalities, the investigators will also assess the type of abnormalities detected&#xD;
           by each modality, assuming that a larger study will be required to assess cancer&#xD;
           detection rates (by type etc.).&#xD;
