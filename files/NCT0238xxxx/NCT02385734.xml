      This study hypothesized that Concentrated Growth Factors'(CGF) placement together with&#xD;
      Coronally Advanced Flap (CAF) may enhance the healing of soft tissues. Therefore, the aim of&#xD;
      this study was to determine the clinical effect of CGF combination with CAF compared to CAF&#xD;
      alone in the treatment of adjacent multiple gingival recessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gingival recessions have been successfully treated by several periodontal plastic surgery&#xD;
      procedures. Among the different types of procedures used, Coronally Advanced Flap (CAF) was&#xD;
      the most frequent approach, and when combined with a connective tissue graft is accepted as a&#xD;
      gold standard therapy. Recently, investigators reported the use of CGF in the reconstruction&#xD;
      of bone defects. They concluded that bone formation had significantly increased by using CGF&#xD;
      It has been used to accelerate new bone formation associated with guided bone regeneration in&#xD;
      sinus augmentation.They stated that CGF may have a better regenerative capacity and high&#xD;
      versatility. Therefore, this study hypothesized that CGFs' placement together with CAF may&#xD;
      enhance the healing of soft tissues. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the&#xD;
      clinical effect of CGF combination with CAF compared to CAF alone in the treatment of&#xD;
      adjacent multiple gingival recessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients of this randomized, split mouth and controlled clinical trial study protocol&#xD;
      were selected from individuals referred to the Department of Periodontology, at Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Bülent Ecevit University, for either dentin hypersensitivity or aesthetic&#xD;
      complaints between April 2013 and April 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects received oral hygiene instructions and full-mouth scaling were performed 1&#xD;
      month before surgery. They were instructed to perform a non-traumatic brushing technique&#xD;
      (Roll) using an ultra soft toothbrush. In twenty subjects (mean age 37.10 ±1.03, 20-45years,&#xD;
      13 females, 7 males), one side of the jaw received CAF (control sites)( 59 defects), the&#xD;
      opposite site received CAF+CGF (test sites) (60 defects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full-mouth Plaque index and Gingival index were evaluated before surgery. Custom acrylic&#xD;
      guides were fabricated to measure the clinical parameters at the mid-buccal aspect of the&#xD;
      treated teeth.Probing depth (PD), Clinical Attachment Loss (CAL),Recession Depth&#xD;
      (RD),Keratinized Gingiva Width (KGW) were recorded at the mid-buccal aspect of the treated&#xD;
      teeth. Gingival Thickness (GT) was evaluated mid-facially, 2mm apical to the gingival margin&#xD;
      at the attached gingiva or the alveolar mucosa, using a 20 endodontic reamer attached to a&#xD;
      rubber stopper under the local anesthesia. After carefully removing the reamer, GT was&#xD;
      measured with a digital caliper with 0.05 resolution PD, CAL, RD, KGW and GT were assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and 6th months. Complete root coverage (CRC)and Percentage Root Coverage(PRC) were&#xD;
      calculated at 6th months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous blood was collected and placed into two different a 10mL glass-coated plastic&#xD;
      tube without anticoagulant solutions. These tubes were then immediately centrifuged with a&#xD;
      CGF centrifuge machine. The CGF clot was removed from the tube and separated from the Red&#xD;
      Blood Cell by using microsurgical scissors. The CGF was squeezed in a special box that&#xD;
      produces membranes at a constant thickness of 1mm.CGF membrane was immediately placed over&#xD;
      the recession area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeries were performed by the same expert periodontist during a single surgical session&#xD;
      Gingival recession sites were randomly determined as either test or control site by tossing a&#xD;
      coin immediately before the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sutures were removed after 10 days and plaque control was maintained by CHX for additional 2&#xD;
      weeks. The patients started brush the tooth at the end of the 3rd week and they were again&#xD;
      instructed in mechanical tooth cleaning of the treated tooth using an ultra soft toothbrush&#xD;
      and roll technique. Oral hygiene instructions were provided at each postoperative visit.&#xD;
