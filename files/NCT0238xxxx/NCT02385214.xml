  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a primary invasive melanoma are recommended to undergo excision of the primary&#xD;
      lesion with a wide margin. There is evidence that less radical margins of excision may be&#xD;
      just as safe. This is a randomised controlled trial of 1 cm versus 2 cm margin of excision of&#xD;
      the primary lesion for adult patients with a primary invasive cutaneous melanomas &gt;=1mm thick&#xD;
      to determine differences in the rate of local recurrence and melanoma specific survival. A&#xD;
      reduction in margins is expected to improve quality of life in patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether there is a difference in local recurrence rates and&#xD;
      melanoma survival rates for patients treated with either a 1cm excision margin or 2cm margin&#xD;
      for both intermediate &amp; high risk melanomas. The study is designed to be able to prove or&#xD;
      disprove that there is no difference in risk of the tumour recurring around the scar or&#xD;
      anywhere else in the body between the two groups of patients. This study is designed to show&#xD;
      that the risk of long-term pain associated with surgery can be halved. If the study shows no&#xD;
      risk of the tumour recurrence then we will also be able to determine how much of an impact&#xD;
      the narrower excision has on patients in terms of improved quality of life and reduced side&#xD;
      effects from the surgery and melanoma disease. This trial will also evaluate and determine&#xD;
      the economic impact of narrower excision margins on the health services and society in&#xD;
      general.&#xD;

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a treatment which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the treatment timing, whether or not considered related to the treatment. An AE is any adverse change (developing or worsening) from the participant's pre-treatment condition, including intercurrent illness.&#xD;
AEs and any pre-existing medical conditions will be recorded at the Baseline assessment and routinely at Follow Up, until the participant completes the study, withdraws or dies.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a primary invasive cutaneous melanoma of Breslow thickness greater&#xD;
             than 1 millimetre as determined by diagnostic biopsy (narrow excision, incision or&#xD;

          4. An uninterrupted 2cm margin must be technically feasible around biopsy scar or primary&#xD;
             melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Randomisation and the primary study intervention, including staging sentinel node&#xD;
             biopsy, must be completed by 120 days of original diagnosis.&#xD;

                  malignancies,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There has been no evidence of recurrence of any prior malignancies for at least&#xD;

             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Planned adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary melanoma site after Wide Local Excision&#xD;
             is not permitted as part of the protocol and any patients given this treatment would&#xD;
             be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Oral or parenteral immunosuppressive agents (not topical or inhaled steroids) at any&#xD;
