  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke is one of the top causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States.&#xD;
      Despite a great deal of effort to improve outcomes of patients with ischemic cerebral&#xD;
      strokes, the lack of a bona fide animal model representative of cerebral ischemia in man&#xD;
      makes the study of the pathological processes involved difficult. Additionally, the subtle&#xD;
      but significant differences between biology of animal models and the biology of humans make&#xD;
      translatability of animal results to humans difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use an iatrogenic model of stroke, meaning those strokes&#xD;
      inadvertently caused by endovascular coiling of elective aneurysms, to study the biology of&#xD;
      stroke in humans. Clinical evidence suggests that simple catheterization of cerebral&#xD;
      vasculature causes small, usually clinically silent, embolic strokes. These strokes are&#xD;
      evident on MRI scans. Additionally, since the practitioner knows the onset of an&#xD;
      interventional procedure, he by default knows the timing of injury. This simple model allows&#xD;
      one to study stroke in real-time with knowledge of the time of onset. Magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) evaluation allows the practitioner to identify the volume of stroke caused by&#xD;
      the intervention. Alternatively, patients who present to the emergency room with large&#xD;
      ischemic infarcts provide a natural control population for this study. These patients present&#xD;
      with large, usually devastating strokes. In most cases the timing of the onset of deficit is&#xD;
      known. The investigators propose to use the simple model of ischemia from endovascular&#xD;
      interventions with the more obvious devastating cases of ischemic stroke who present to the&#xD;
      emergency room to better understand the molecular pathways involved in stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Global analysis of biological markers is an established mechanism to study complex&#xD;
      disease processes. The introduction of microarray technology and systems wide analysis has&#xD;
      improved the understanding of various biological and disease processes. This revolution has&#xD;
      been ongoing since the early 1990's. The rationale for performing these studies is to augment&#xD;
      the understanding of the basic mechanisms of stroke in humans. As previously mentioned, there&#xD;
      is no bona fide model of stroke and the researchers' experimental design provides a rather&#xD;
      simple in human model for cerebral ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study requires four blood draws, each 5 mL in volume; blood draws are timed with normal&#xD;
      times of blood draw these patients would be experiencing and do not place the patient at any&#xD;
      additional risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples will be analyzed as follows: total ribonucleic acid (RNA), including the&#xD;
      microRNA fraction, and protein will be isolated and quantified from the blood samples. The&#xD;
      researchers will load the RNA samples onto Febit microRNA arrays. The Febit miRNA chip has&#xD;
      all of the known human miRNAs and miRNA star sequences from Sanger's miRBase 14. With this&#xD;
      platform total RNA is loaded directly onto the array. There are no RNA labeling or&#xD;
      amplification steps. miRNA hybridization on the chip is followed by a microfluidic primer&#xD;
      extension assay. In this case, only hybridization of the correct miRNA to the probe allows&#xD;
      the primer extension step to proceed efficiently, giving the array high sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity. In addition, the researchers have created custom microarrays, adding several&#xD;
      spike-in controls. Our spike-ins provide feedback on the variability in RNA isolation and are&#xD;
      an additional signal for array normalization. The protein fraction will be analyzed using Ray&#xD;
      Biotech's Quantibody Arrays. These are arrays of antibodies that are designed to capture&#xD;
      specific protein species (the researchers will target approximately 120 unique proteins) in a&#xD;
      fully quantitative fashion. These arrays essentially function as the traditional&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) but on a glass slide substrate. The assays offer&#xD;
      several advantages over ELISA's, including the requirement for very low amounts of sample&#xD;
      input but, perhaps more importantly, they facilitate the quantitative investigation of&#xD;
      hundreds of proteins at once and therefore greatly accelerate the ability to search for and&#xD;
      identify protein-based signatures and/or biomarkers. The data will be statistically analyzed&#xD;
      using statistical tools that are deemed appropriate at the time of data analysis by&#xD;
      investigators from TGen and Dr. Kalani. Drs. Kalani and Nakaji will then correlate the&#xD;
      identity and quantity of identified molecular markers, their temporal appearance,&#xD;
      concentration, and disappearance to the collected clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neuroradiologist will perform evaluation and interpretation of the computerized axial&#xD;
      tomography (CT)/MRI scans collected during the subject's inpatient stay and outpatient&#xD;
      visits. The neuroradiologist will be recording size and caliber of the blood vessels, looking&#xD;
      for malformations, dissections, aneurysms, or other abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will also correlate the level of identified markers to how well the patient&#xD;
      performs upon discharge from the hospital and at followup for up to two years from discharge,&#xD;
      using Modified Rankin Scale scores and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). As a part of followup,&#xD;
      researcher will assess time to return to work (if applicable), complaints, results of&#xD;
      followup laboratory (complete blood counts, coagulation studies, response to anti-platelet&#xD;
      medications including aspirin resistance assay and the p2yp12 assays, and basic metabolic&#xD;
      panels) and imaging, and an updated complete history and physical to identify new conditions&#xD;
      that may have resulted post-ischemia. This information will be collected at the time of&#xD;
      followup with the neurosurgeons. Once this is done, if a candidate microRNA or protein is&#xD;
      identified, the researchers will share the results (again in a manner that excludes any&#xD;
      patient specific information) with our collaborators (Department of Health and Human Services&#xD;
      associated organizations such as the NIH).&#xD;
