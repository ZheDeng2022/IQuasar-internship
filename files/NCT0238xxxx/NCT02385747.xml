      100 women with abnormal uterine bleeding (peri and postmenopausal) were subjected to&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound , saline sonohysterography , Diagnostic hysteroscopy and fractional&#xD;
      curettage followed by histopathological examination and immunohistochemical analysis for&#xD;
      estrogen and progesterone receptors.&#xD;

      Conventional TVUS will be done to all participants to measure the uterine size &amp; endometrial&#xD;
      thickness and other pathology. TVUS will be done with an empty bladder in the lithotomy&#xD;
      position using an endovaginal curved linear probe (EV 4-9/10 ED) with frequency 4-9 MHz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIS will be performed for all patients at the same setting of TVUS. With the patient in the&#xD;
      lithotomy position, . A 6 or 8 French Foley's catheter will be inserted through the external&#xD;
      cervical os into the cervical canal. Its balloon tip will be inflated with 2-3 mL of saline,&#xD;
      depending on patient comfort, to help hold it in place. The speculum was then removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaginal probe was then reinserted and a 5-10 mL syringe filled with sterile saline was&#xD;
      attached to the catheter. Fluid will be instilled while the transducer moved from side to&#xD;
      side (cornua to cornua) in a long-axis projection then the transducer was rotated 90° into an&#xD;
      axial plane. More fluid was instilled while fanning down toward the endocervical canal and up&#xD;
      toward the uterine fundus to obtain a detailed survey of the endometrium. Every portion of&#xD;
      the uterine cavity should be imaged, to exclude any focal abnormality as polyps, myomas,&#xD;
      hyperplasia, and carcinoma. Any detected intrauterine pathology is described; including its&#xD;
      shape, size and site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hysteroscope used in this study is a rigid continuous flow panoramic hysteroscope, 25 cm&#xD;
      in length, 4 mm in diameter with an outer sheath 5 mm diameter and 30° fibro-optic lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique used to provide constant uterine distention will be by attaching plastic bags&#xD;
      of saline. Infusion pressure was elevated by pneumatic cuff under manometric control at a&#xD;
      pressure of 100-120 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed hysteroscopic examination will be performed under general anesthesia with the&#xD;
      patient in the lithotomy position, The thickness, colour, aspect and vasculature of the&#xD;
      mucous membrane lining the uterine cavity will be observed and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial curettage will be done to all patients, and specimens were fixed in Formalin 10%&#xD;
      solution for histopathological examination. Patients in whom endometrial polyps were found by&#xD;
      hysteroscopy, had polypectomy performed before curettage. The first sample will be taken from&#xD;
      the endocervical canal before hysteroscopy or cervical dilatation. Following diagnostic&#xD;
      hysteroscopy, cervical dilatation u. A sharp curette will be introduced into the uterine&#xD;
      cavity, and curettage will be done starting with the fundus then posterior, anterior, right&#xD;
      and left lateral walls consecutively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological examination. All curettage &amp; polypectomy specimens were embedded in&#xD;
      paraffin wax, then slides will be prepared to be stained by the conventional Haematoxylin and&#xD;
      Eosin (H &amp; E) stain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of estrogen &amp; progesterone receptors in the specimens (formalin-fixed, paraffin&#xD;
      wax-embedded) using immunohistochemical staining which will be carried out by using the Dako&#xD;
      ER/PR pharmDx™ Kit which specifically detects the ERα protein as well as the PR-A protein&#xD;
      located in the cell nuclei of ER and PR expressing cells, respectively.&#xD;
