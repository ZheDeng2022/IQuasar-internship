  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center feasibility study of effectiveness and safety of the&#xD;
      Senza System in subjects with chronic, intractable pain of the upper limbs and/or neck. Data&#xD;
      at follow-up visits will be compared to Baseline data collected at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be identified from the pool of candidates for SCS therapy affiliated&#xD;
      with, or referred to, the clinical sites. Subjects will participate in this investigational&#xD;
      plan that includes entry criteria evaluation, Baseline assessments, trial stimulation phase,&#xD;
      and post-trial assessment. Subjects with a successful Trial Phase will receive a permanent&#xD;
      implant of an Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) and leads, and undergo 12 months of&#xD;
      stimulation delivery with assessments at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months Post-Permanent Device&#xD;
      Activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who sign the informed consent will undergo evaluations to determine eligibility for&#xD;
      the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Baseline assessments will also&#xD;
      include measures for pain, disability, functioning, medication use, quality of life,&#xD;
      depression and sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantation and use of the Senza System will follow the Nevro Physician's Manual and&#xD;
      supporting Manuals. Subjects will undergo a Trial Phase lasting up to 14 days to determine&#xD;
      his/her response to SCS therapy. Following the Trial Phase with external device stimulation,&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed for their pain, and those who have a successful Trial Phase will be&#xD;
      eligible to proceed to permanent implantation of a SCS system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following permanent device implant, the IPG will be &quot;activated&quot; and thus, stimulation&#xD;
      delivered on an ongoing basis for 12 months. At 1 month and 9 months following Post-Permanent&#xD;
      Device Activation, assessments of pain and adverse events will be made. At 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months Post-Permanent Device Activation, subjects will be assessed for pain and adverse&#xD;
      events as well as disability, functioning, medication use, quality of life, depression and&#xD;
      sleep. Patient Global Impression of Change, Clinician Global Impression of Change and subject&#xD;
      satisfaction will be recorded at 3 and 12 months Post-Permanent Device Activation.&#xD;
