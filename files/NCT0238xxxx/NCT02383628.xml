      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of indocyanine green (ICG)&#xD;
      endoscopy to evaluate tissue perfusion during endoscopic neurosurgery. This includes patients&#xD;
      with pituitary and intracranial tumors and treatment of vascular abnormalities such as&#xD;
      aneurysms and compressive syndromes. ICG will be evaluated to determine the value of the&#xD;
      additional visual information supplied during the treatment of these pathologies.&#xD;

      Over the past decade, a technique widely used by ophthalmologists to assess retinal blood&#xD;
      flow, near-infrared ICG angiography, has been applied to neurosurgical patients undergoing a&#xD;
      wide variety of cerebrovascular procedures. This technique offers the advantage of real-time&#xD;
      visualization of cerebral blood flow through the operating microscope at the time the&#xD;
      procedure is being performed. Indocyanine green is an ideal agent for imaging vessels as it&#xD;
      is tightly bound to plasma albumin, has a short half-life, and maintains an acceptable safety&#xD;
      profile. Furthermore, the excitation and emission profiles for ICG lie in the near-infrared&#xD;
      wavelengths, which allow penetration and imaging of vessels below a few millimeters of&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with either an aneurysm, compressive syndromes or pituitary and intracranial tumor&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. By taking advantage of the natural fluorescence of indocyanine&#xD;
      green (ICG) within the red spectrum and applying a light filter to the endoscope eyepiece and&#xD;
      camera it will show as to whether this technique provides adequate visual information to&#xD;
      differentiate perfusion in tumor and surrounding structures and to evaluate normal vessels&#xD;
      for aneurysm and compressive syndromes procedures.&#xD;

        Patient population would include those patients with pituitary tumors, intracranial tumors,&#xD;
        aneurysms, and normal tissue adjacent to tumors to clarify normal from abnormal. Also,&#xD;
        patients with compressive syndromes to ensure patency of normal vessels. This would be all&#xD;
        patients undergoing endoscopic surgery, both endonasal and open (retromastoid or&#xD;
        transcranial).&#xD;
