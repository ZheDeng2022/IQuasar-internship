      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ropidoxuridine in treating&#xD;
      patients with gastrointestinal cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually&#xD;
      cannot be cured or controlled with treatment undergoing radiation therapy. Ropidoxuridine may&#xD;
      help radiation therapy work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct a phase I dose escalation trial, to determine the safety and the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD), of oral (po) IPdR (ropidoxuridine) given daily for 28 consecutive days&#xD;
      with concurrent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients with advanced&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancers treated with palliative radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To establish the pharmacokinetics of daily&#xD;
      po dosing of IPdR x 28 days. III. To assess, for patients treated at the MTD, for biochemical&#xD;
      evidence of IPdR effect in normal tissue (circulating granulocytes) and tumor tissue (in&#xD;
      patients with accessible tumor tissue) by measuring %iododeoxyuridine (IUdR)-deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) cellular incorporation by flow cytometry and high-pressure liquid chromatography&#xD;
      (HPLC) analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the use of %IUdR-DNA cellular incorporation (measured by the investigational&#xD;
      laboratory assays of flow cytometry and HPLC) as an exploratory biomarker of IPdR for the&#xD;
      following effects: the %IUdR-DNA tumor cell incorporation from day 8 tumor biopsies in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients receiving MTD doses of IPdR as an exploratory biomarker&#xD;
      of tumor radiosensitization using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the use of %IUdR-DNA cellular incorporation (measured by the investigational&#xD;
      laboratory assays of flow cytometry and HPLC) as an exploratory biomarker of IPdR for the&#xD;
      following effects: the %IUdR-DNA cellular incorporation in patients' circulating granulocytes&#xD;
      taken weekly during the 28-day IPdR MTD dose, on day 29, and week 8 as an exploratory&#xD;
      biomarker of IPdR systemic toxicities to bone marrow as measured by complete blood count&#xD;
      (CBC)/differential values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ropidoxuridine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 30 minutes to 2 hours before radiation therapy, patients receive ropidoxuridine PO&#xD;
      once daily (QD) on days 1-28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Beginning on day 8, patients undergo IMRT 5 days a week for 3 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
