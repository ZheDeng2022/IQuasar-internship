      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate safety and efficacy of the Cutera enlighten&#xD;
      dual-pulse duration, dual-wavelength 532nm KTP/1064nm Nd:YAG laser for the treatment of&#xD;
      melasma and lentigines on the face in Asian skin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective, 2 cohort study in 80 male or female subjects of&#xD;
      Asian-descent, who desire laser treatment for moderate to severe melasma (all types) or&#xD;
      lentigines (all types) located on the face. Forty subjects will be enrolled in cohort 1 and&#xD;
      randomized to either treatment or control arm. Forty subjects will be enrolled for treatment&#xD;
      of facial lentigines in cohort 2.&#xD;
