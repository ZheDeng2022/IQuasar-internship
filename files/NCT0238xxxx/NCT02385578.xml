&#xD;
        2. the emergency gastroscopy, such as, esophageal foreign body, gastric foreign body, upper&#xD;

        8. don't do as the test plan demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a retrospective analysis of the ten young endoscopist's painless gastroscopy examination&#xD;
           from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014. According mainly to the endoscopic report and&#xD;
           pateint's History, quantity of gastroscope, gastric cancer and the early gastric cancer.&#xD;
           In addition, for early gastric cancer patients, it was record,(1) the patient's name,&#xD;
           (2)gender, (3)age, (4)the location of the lesion- longitudinal (upper, middle and&#xD;
           lower),(5) the location of the lesion -circumferential (lessor curvature, Greater&#xD;

           imaging (red, white, no change), (8)EM-NBI VS type (boundaries, microvascular pattern&#xD;
           and microsurface pattern; don't do it), (9)microscopy types (uplift type, flat type,&#xD;
           concave type or IIc I/IIa or IIb), (10)histological type (differentiated and&#xD;
           undifferentiated type) and (11) pathological (low grade neoplasia, high-level neoplasia&#xD;
           etc.). For the treatment of ESD patients, further pathological results were recorded&#xD;
           after ESD, including the pathology, edge and basal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (A) those had been diagnosed outside the hospital before gastroscopy, withhold, listed&#xD;
           separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (B) for anesthesia, or not to determine whether anesthesia, withhold, separately listed;&#xD;
           (C) considering the actual clinical situation, in the absence of pathological report,&#xD;
           endoscopy reports generally will not report &quot;early gastric cancer&quot;, but will use&#xD;
           descriptive language diagnosis as &quot;erosion&quot; &quot;apophysis&quot; &quot; ulcer&quot;. The investigators will&#xD;
           find out the suspected early gastric cancer, then go on to confirm the diagnosis by the&#xD;
           pathologic findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (D) considering the actual clinical situation, the investigators often wrote the&#xD;
           Malignant tumor （MT） instead of the gastric cancer in patients' report. Don't miss the&#xD;
           descriptive language as &quot;ulcer&quot; patients. Found out the suspected patients and confirmed&#xD;
           by pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the first step of the train the trainer plan(TTT) activised in March 19-20,2015,which&#xD;
           including the diagnosis and operation &quot;hand in hand&quot; teach by Professor Yano&#xD;
           Takeshiin,and the case discussion,and so on. Core: First, a detailed examination by&#xD;
           white light is used to look for an irregular margin or a depressed spiny area.Then&#xD;
           narrow-band imaging is used to look for a demarcation line, an microvascular pattern and&#xD;
           microsurface pattern .five young endoscopist accepted the TTT plan and the other five&#xD;
           not accepted.&#xD;

      doctor accepted the TTT and not? (D) is the rates of EGC detection different among T1, T2,&#xD;
      T3, T4 ? Is the rates of Gastric cancer detection increasing? (F) early cancer patients was&#xD;
      found after TTT training, comparison the endoscopic diagnosis with Pathology, and pay&#xD;
