  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 20% of women who receive breast radiotherapy (RT) experience moderate to severe breast&#xD;
      hardening and shrinkage. These side-effects have been shown to be important factors&#xD;
      influencing quality of life after breast radiotherapy. It is thought that the likelihood of&#xD;
      developing these side-effects is related to the presence of underlying genetic differences in&#xD;
      patients. In order to identify these genetic differences, the severity of side-effects needs&#xD;
      to be accurately measured. Currently, clinical assessments are conducted by a clinician but&#xD;
      this is not specific enough to be able to relate development of breast shrinkage and&#xD;
      hardening to genetic differences. For example, clinical assessment often fails to distinguish&#xD;
      between hardness due to swelling (known as oedema) and hardness due to generalised&#xD;
      radiation-induced scarring (known as fibrosis). Ultrasound techniques, however, may be able&#xD;
      to help quantify and characterise radiotherapy-associated changes in breast tissue allowing&#xD;
      for better correlation with genetic abnormalities. Once genetic changes can be identified,&#xD;
      adjustment of breast RT treatments (or add drugs) to help reduce side-effects in women at&#xD;
      higher genetic risk of side-effects may be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study tests the ability of two forms of ultrasound, shear-wave elastography (USE) and&#xD;
      ultrasound backscatter spectroscopy (UBS), to quantify and characterise breast shrinkage and&#xD;
      firmness with a view to using these techniques to measure the late side-effects of breast RT&#xD;
      to study the underlying causes of radiotherapy toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principle research question: Can a new ultrasound technique (shear wave elastography) measure&#xD;
      radiation-induced side-effects in women who have received breast radiotherapy?&#xD;
