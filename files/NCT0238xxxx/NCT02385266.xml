  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of D-Cycloserine versus placebo&#xD;
      treatment in reducing pain from urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded, randomized control trial (RCT) over a 21 week period that aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the treatment efficacy of placebo and D-cycloserine(DCS) in men suffering from&#xD;
      UCPPS. The brain functional and anatomical properties associated with treatment response will&#xD;
      also be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will emphasize on comparing, both clinically and by brain imaging, the analgesic&#xD;
      response to placebo in both placebo responders and non-responders in addition to a novel&#xD;
      treatment (DCS) that targets the brain's pain mechanism for UCPPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to 2 arms, in a 1:1 ratio, to a DCS medication group (n=20) and a&#xD;
      placebo medication group (n=20). Questionnaire outcomes and brain scans will occur prior to&#xD;
      initiating treatment and at the end of the treatment period. The actual visits required are&#xD;
      minimized, 9 visits spread out over 21 weeks, as pain, quality of life and pill ingestion&#xD;
      timings are collected using a secure study website accessible electronically.&#xD;
