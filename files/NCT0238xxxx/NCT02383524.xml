      The Investigators have designed this exploratory study in patients suffering from&#xD;
      zygapophysial joint mediated pain to investigate if a correlation exists between&#xD;
      inter-individual genetic variability (genotype) with treatment response (phenotype). More&#xD;
      specifically, the investigators aim to identify any form of correlation between a specific&#xD;
      SNP of the BDNF gene (Val66Met) and the effectiveness and/or duration of radiofrequency facet&#xD;
      joint neurotomy. The study population is patients suffering from chronic low back pain who&#xD;
      have been scheduled for radiofrequency neurotomy following the diagnosis of facet joint&#xD;
      mediated pain (using medial branch block test). The investigators will evaluate if a common&#xD;
      variant of BDNF gene (Val66Met) can be directly correlated to a significant degree of pain&#xD;
      relief following RF treatment, and whether the result of such a procedure can be predicted&#xD;
      from a specific genetic profile.&#xD;

      Study Hypothesis It is possible to predict individual responsiveness to radiofrequency&#xD;
      denervation for zygapophysial (facet) joint mediated pain on the basis of a specific genetic&#xD;
      pattern (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, [SNP])?&#xD;

    <description>Numerous studies have concluded that facet joint pain can be accurately diagnosed if a significant (but temporary) reduction in pain is achieved with a procedure called a Medial Branch Block (MBB). The clinician delivers a targeted injection of local anesthetic to the joint itself, or in close proximity to the medial branch of the posterior rami of the dorsal root. A significant decrease in pain confirms that the pain originates from the facet joint. If or when the pain returns after successful MBB treatment the patient may be considered for radiofrequency denervation (neurotomy) which selectively disrupts the joint's nerve supply and provides longer-term sustained relief</description>
