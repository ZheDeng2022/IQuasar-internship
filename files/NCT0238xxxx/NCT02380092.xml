    <textblock>
      LEGION™ Primary Total Knee System is CE-marked and marketed in all study regions. This study&#xD;
      serves as post-market surveillance for LEGION™ Primary Total Knee System with the VERILAST™&#xD;
      bearing surface (OXINIUM™ femoral component with highly cross-linked polyethylene tibial&#xD;
      insert).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects will receive a LEGION™ Primary Total Knee System with VERILAST™ bearing&#xD;
      surface and the results will be analysed against historical data from patients who received a&#xD;
      Genesis II knee replacement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LEGION™ Primary Total Knee System (TKS) is a comprehensive, state-of-the-art system that&#xD;
      empowers surgeons to address diverse surgical challenges and provide personalized joint care.&#xD;
      The LEGION™ Primary TKS implant designs were built on the legacy of the GENESIS™ II TKS. For&#xD;
      more than 15 years and in more than 30 countries, the GENESIS™ II TKS has achieved&#xD;
      outstanding clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As CE-mark and 510k approval for the LEGION™ Primary TKS has been obtained, it is being used&#xD;
      in clinical practice in several countries including Europe and the US but clinical studies&#xD;
      need to be carried out in order to confirm its safety and efficacy and in order to conform to&#xD;
      the medical device directives (MEDDEV. 2.7.1 Rev.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is therefore a post-market study to evaluate the short-, mid- and long-term safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of the LEGION™ Primary TKS with VERILAST™ bearing surface (the combination&#xD;
      of an OXINIUM™ femoral component with highly cross-linked polyethylene tibial base plate&#xD;
      inserts). The clinical outcome from a large cohort of subjects who are treated with the&#xD;
      LEGION™ Primary TKS as part of their standard of care will be documented. The study is&#xD;
      designed to reflect standard clinical practice as closely as possible because it allows the&#xD;
      results of such a study to represent the true clinical outcome that would be achieved in&#xD;
      clinical practice, up to a maximum. Only subjects who will be treated with the LEGION™&#xD;
      Primary TKS as part of their normally planned care will screened for participation in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
