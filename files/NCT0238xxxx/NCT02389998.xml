  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at investigating the efficacy of placebo for symptom relief in children&#xD;
      with abdominal pain related functional gastrointestinal disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if prescribing an open label placebo to children&#xD;
      with functional gastrointestinal disorders will help improve symptoms and their overall&#xD;
      quality of life. Open label means you/your child are aware you are taking liquid placebo&#xD;
      drops and not an active medication. Symptoms associated with functional gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorders (FGIDs) of children and adolescents are commonly encountered symptoms in general&#xD;
      pediatrics and pediatric gastroenterology. The FGIDs the investigators are studying include&#xD;
      functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and functional dyspepsia. The liquid&#xD;
      placebo drops contain no active medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research studies have shown improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms after taking&#xD;
      liquid placebo drops in both children and adults with FGIDs. A randomized research study for&#xD;
      a medication used to treat children with FGIDs showed a very significant placebo effect,&#xD;
      meaning patients receiving placebo also experienced improvement in their symptoms. Randomized&#xD;
      refers to the fact that subjects were randomly selected to receive either the study&#xD;
      medication or placebo. A recent adult study gave adult patients a placebo and told them it&#xD;
      was a placebo, and these adults also had significant symptom improvement. The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to further explore using open label (or non-deceptive) placebo use to treat children&#xD;
      with FGIDs.&#xD;

    <description>The study is divided into three phases: 1 one-week baseline assessment followed by 2 three-week study phases (phase A and phase B). Phase A will require subjects to take 1/4 teaspoon placebo suspension 2 times a day (morning and night), and a third dose if necessary. In phase B subjects will not take the placebo. After 3 weeks in initial phase (either Phase A or B), subjects will switch to the alternate phase and continue the study for another 3 weeks. Hyoscyamine is available as a rescue medication during Phase A and Phase B. Half of the subjects will be randomized to begin with Phase A and half will be randomized to begin with Phase B.</description>

Placebo Suspension: The study is divided into three phases: 1 one-week baseline assessment followed by 2 three-week study phases (phase A and phase B). Phase A will require subjects to take 1/4 teaspoon placebo suspension 2 times a day (morning and night), and a third dose if necessary. In phase B subjects will not take the placebo. After 3 weeks in initial phase (either Phase A or B), subjects will switch to the alternate phase and continue the study for another 3 weeks. Hyoscyamine is available as a rescue medication during Phase A and Phase B. Half of the subjects will be randomized to begin with Phase A and half will be randomized to begin with Phase B.&#xD;
Hyoscyamine: While not an intervention of interest to our study, patients will have hyoscyamine available as a rescue medication throughout the study. This can be taken on a PRN basis for breakthrough pain a maximum of 4x daily.</description>
