    <textblock>
      A single centre open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial, recruiting healthy&#xD;
      Nepalese infants aged 40-60 days, who present to the immunisation clinic at Patan Hospital,&#xD;
      Kathmandu, Nepal, randomised to receive a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) at&#xD;
      either;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 6+10 weeks and 9 months OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 6+14 weeks and 9 months The study will enroll 152 healthy Nepalese infants in each&#xD;
           treatment arm (304 in total). Demographic and clinical data will be collected on an&#xD;
           electronic case report form to allow monitoring remotely. Participants will receive the&#xD;
           study vaccine according to their allocated treatment arm in addition to their other&#xD;
           routine vaccines. The investigators will collect 3 blood samples for analysis of serum&#xD;
           antibody responses to the PCV10 vaccine serotypes throughout infancy (see Table 1). The&#xD;
           data collected will be analysed in order to determine whether the 6+10 schedule is&#xD;
           non-inferior to the 6+14 schedule in generating immune responses against the vaccine&#xD;
           serotypes above the ≥0•35μg/mL threshold. These data will then be used to inform&#xD;
           decision-making around augmenting the currently recommended 6+14 schedule to a 6+10&#xD;
           schedule in Nepal. The investigators will collect a nasopharyngeal swab at 2 time points&#xD;
           to look at carriage of pneumococcus over time and to assess differences between the 2&#xD;
           groups. This is of critical importance because much of the programmatic impact of PCV is&#xD;
           ultimately conferred by reductions in carriage at the community level and indirect&#xD;
           effects resulting from that nasopharyngeal (NP) protection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Streptococcus pneumoniae is the predominant cause of bacterial&#xD;
      pneumonia, meningitis and septicaemia in children worldwide, and disproportionately affects&#xD;
      children from developing countries. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) reduce&#xD;
      pneumococcal disease burden by direct protection and by reducing nasopharyngeal carriage,&#xD;
      thereby preventing transmission and inducing herd protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Nepal, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is responsible for a substantial disease burden&#xD;
      in children. Surveillance conducted since 2005 at Patan Hospital, Kathmandu indicates the&#xD;
      majority of IPD is due to serotypes 1, 5 and 14, and that the greater proportion occurs in&#xD;
      late infancy and toddlerhood.7 Vaccine introduction began in January 2015 with PCV10. GAVI&#xD;
      (Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance) has funded an impact assessment programme (including IPD,&#xD;
      pneumonia, nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization and health economics), which is underway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial conducted by investigators at Patan Hospital in collaboration&#xD;
      with the Oxford Vaccine Group, using a 10-valent PCV, demonstrated a two-dose prime (at 6 and&#xD;
      14 weeks) and 9-month booster to have non-inferior immunogenicity at 18 weeks and 10 months&#xD;
      and superior immunogenicity in early childhood (2-4 years of age) compared to a conventional&#xD;
      three-dose priming only schedule (6, 10, and 14 weeks). This two-dose prime and boost&#xD;
      schedule, with an 8 week interval between the priming doses, has been adopted as an&#xD;
      acceptable schedule by the World Health Organization (WHO) and recommended in late 2014 by&#xD;
      the Nepal Ministry of Health as a result of the study. However the WHO have also recommended&#xD;
      the introduction of a single inactivated poliomyelitis virus vaccine at 14-weeks of age in&#xD;
      order to mitigate the risk of outbreaks from vaccine derived serotype 2 poliomyelitis virus,&#xD;
      to protect against serotype 2 poliomyelitis virus once countries switch to bivalent OPV (oral&#xD;
      polio vaccine) from trivalent OPV, and to enhance immunogenicity to poliomyelitis vaccine&#xD;
      serotypes 1 and 3. This has created a programmatic dilemma and concerns around vaccine&#xD;
      coverage as a result of requiring three injections at the 14-week visit. Thus the Nepalese&#xD;
      Ministry of Health, based on these concerns around public acceptance and feasibility have&#xD;
      decided to move the second PCV10 priming dose from 14 weeks to 10 weeks of age. Given this&#xD;
      decision it is essential to evaluate the immunogenicity of the intended schedule, comparing&#xD;
      it to the schedule that has been shown to provide a level of immunogenicity that would&#xD;
      predict substantial program impact on disease and colonisation. This importance is further&#xD;
      increased given that the Nepal PCV10 impact study is currently underway and the limited data&#xD;
      on two-dose priming schedules with a one-month interval between priming doses in other&#xD;
      settings shows a reduction in immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this study will be undertaken in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      10-valent PCV priming at 6 and 10 weeks being implemented by the Nepal Ministry of Health,&#xD;
      compared to priming at 6 and 14 weeks of age in healthy Nepali infants. In both groups a&#xD;
      PCV10 booster will be given at 9 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nepal Nepal is a low-income country in South Asia with a population of 25.8 million people&#xD;
      and an estimated under 5 year mortality of 54/1000 live births. Access to health care varies&#xD;
      considerably within the country, but as few as 18% of children under 5 years with pneumonia&#xD;
      are taken to health care facilities. The capital city, Kathmandu, resides in a large valley,&#xD;
      which in 2011 had a total population of about 1,744,240 people, with approximately 10% of&#xD;
      these being children under 5 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of children in Nepal receive immunisation through local government outpatient&#xD;
      clinics. The national Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI )schedule being followed in&#xD;
      Nepal currently includes Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) at birth, diphtheria-tetanus-whole&#xD;
      cell pertussis-hepatitis B-Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTwP-HBV-Hib) and oral Polio (OPV)&#xD;
      vaccines at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, IPV at 14 weeks of age, measles and rubella vaccine at&#xD;
      9 months of age, Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine at 12-23 months of age (in endemic&#xD;
      regions only; Kathmandu is one of these regions) and tetanus toxoid during pregnancy. Vaccine&#xD;
      coverage is high in Nepal with over 90% of infants receiving DTP, by 14 weeks of age in the&#xD;
      past 3 years. PCV10 vaccine at 6 and 10 weeks and a booster at 9 months of age was initiated&#xD;
      in the new birth cohort only (i.e. no catch up program is being instituted ) as of January&#xD;
      2015 with roll-out beginning in the west of the country and expected to reach the whole of&#xD;
      the country by late 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patan Academy of Health Sciences and Patan Hospital will lead this study in Nepal. Patan&#xD;
      Hospital is one of only two hospitals in Kathmandu with paediatric referral and inpatient&#xD;
      services and is based in Lalitpur, in the south of the City. Over 300 children commence&#xD;
      immunisation at the 'Under 14 clinic' in the Patan Hospital paediatric outpatient department&#xD;
      each month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumococcal Disease in Kathmandu On-going surveillance of IPD serotypes has been occurring&#xD;
      at Patan Hospital in Kathmandu since 2005, identifying all paediatric admission from whom&#xD;
      pneumococcus is isolated from normally sterile body fluids. This programme was initially&#xD;
      funded through PneumoADIP as part of the South Asia Pneumococcal Alliance (SAPNA) with&#xD;
      extensive collection of clinical, radiological and laboratory data, demonstrating&#xD;
      pneumococcus to be a significant cause of disease in children in Kathmandu, and is currently&#xD;
      funded by the World Health Organisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of these data up until late 2012, show a predominance of non-vaccine serotypes in&#xD;
      early infancy, followed by a shift towards vaccine serotypes, particularly serotype 1, in&#xD;
      late infancy and into childhood. The finding of serotypes 1, 5 and, 14 to be the most&#xD;
      frequent disease causing isolates is in keeping with data summarized in the Global Serotype&#xD;
      Project which demonstrated serotype disease order of frequency in low-income countries was&#xD;
      14, 5, 1, 6B, 19F, 23F and 6A. The age distribution of vaccine type disease reinforces the&#xD;
      importance of initiating vaccine coverage early in infancy such that early boosting at 9&#xD;
      months may be performed to maintain coverage into early childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity of PCV10 in Kathmandu We previously conducted an open-label, parallel group,&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial at Patan Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from June 2010 to November&#xD;
      2011 with follow-on between February and October 2013. In this study we compared the then WHO&#xD;
      recommended PCV schedule of three priming doses in early infancy (6, 10, and 14 weeks) to a&#xD;
      two-dose prime (6 and 14 weeks) and boost at 9 months of age. We demonstrated using the&#xD;
      ten-valent PCV (PCV10) that the two-dose prime with booster at 9 months provided analogous&#xD;
      immunogenicity to the three-dose prime schedule during early infancy, with improved&#xD;
      protection through early childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global Polio Eradication Initiative Over the last decade the oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV)&#xD;
      has been extremely efficacious in preventing wild-type polio disease across the world,&#xD;
      including Nepal. The OPV used in the routine vaccine schedule contains three serotypes of&#xD;
      weakened poliomyelitis virus (types 1, 2 and 3), and has facilitated the eradication of&#xD;
      wild-type poliomyelitis in Nepal. On very rare occasions disease may occur as a result of&#xD;
      circulating vaccine derived polio viruses (cVDPV), particularly of serotype 2. Thus, in&#xD;
      countries such as Nepal, there is the situation where wild-type disease has been eradicated&#xD;
      yet there remains a rare risk of vaccine derived disease outbreaks. This had led to the&#xD;
      proposal to switch to a bivalent OPV (types 1 and 3), globally. This cannot happen however,&#xD;
      unless populations are protected from type 2 disease through some other means. Furthermore&#xD;
      the inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV), which is administered as an intramuscular&#xD;
      injection, generates immunity using killed strains of the three poliomyelitis serotypes, and&#xD;
      thus does not produce vaccine type disease or result in the emergence of cVDPV outbreaks.&#xD;
      This has led the WHO to recommend the introduction of IPV in order to interrupt and mitigate&#xD;
      the risk of cVDPV type 2 disease, prior to the phasing in of the bivalent OPV and cessation&#xD;
      of OPV-type 2 use. In Nepal a single dose of the IPV at 14 weeks of age in addition to the&#xD;
      routine schedule of trivalent OPV, has now been implemented (September 2014). Nepal was the&#xD;
      first GAVI (Gavi The Vaccine Alliance) country to introduce IPV, and is ready to participate&#xD;
      in the globally synchronized switch to bivalent OPV that will be coordinated by WHO in 2016 .&#xD;
      IPV is given at 14 weeks of age; the proposed PCV10 schedule of 6 weeks, 14 weeks, and 9&#xD;
      months of age meant that children would receive three injections at 14 weeks of age (IPV,&#xD;
      PCV10 and dose 3 of DTwP-HBV-Hib vaccine). The perception by the health care providers and&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health is that this will not be acceptable and will lead to reduced vaccine&#xD;
      coverage. Therefore the Nepal Ministry of Health has introduced in January 2015 PCV10 on a&#xD;
      schedule of 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 9 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on locally available IPD data and a prior immunogenicity study in Kathmandu,&#xD;
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccination utilising PCV10 with two priming doses at 6 and 14 weeks&#xD;
      followed by a 9-month booster has been demonstrated to be the WHO preferred schedule in&#xD;
      comparison to a three-dose prime only schedule. However the WHO have also recommended the&#xD;
      introduction of a single dose of IPV at 14 weeks of age in order to eradicate poliomyelitis&#xD;
      serotype 2 vaccine strain disease. Local experts anticipate a poor uptake of vaccine at 14&#xD;
      weeks of age due to the increase in number of injections from one to three at this&#xD;
      time-point. The Nepali government has thus suggested moving the 14 weeks PCV10 priming dose&#xD;
      to the earlier 10 week time-point, however there are no immunogenicity data to support this&#xD;
      decision. Therefore this study will aim to compare the immunogenicity of giving the two PCV10&#xD;
      priming doses at 6 and 10 weeks to that of 6 and 14 weeks. In addition this study will also&#xD;
      evaluate the adverse event profile following the 14 weeks of age visit in the two treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
