      This study aims to determine whether subjects who underwent large-diameter metal-on-metal hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty are more likely to have developed heart failure or other conditions as compared&#xD;
      to subjects with conventional hip replacements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to link the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland to the&#xD;
      National Heart Failure Audit and GP records.&#xD;

      Background: Chronic systemic exposure to very high concentrations of cobalt or chromium&#xD;
      following large diameter metal-on-metal hip resurfacing or hip replacement (MOMHR) associates&#xD;
      with cardiac, thyroid, visual, hearing, and peripheral neurological deficits. Chronic&#xD;
      exposure to lower circulating metal levels also associates with changes in cardiac function&#xD;
      and bone metabolism in case-control analyses. However, it remains unclear what the risk of&#xD;
      these problems is in the general population exposed to MOMHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: We aim to establish the prevalence of cardiac, endocrine, neurological disorders, and&#xD;
      distant site fracture history (forearm, spine) in recipients of MOMHR, and establish whether&#xD;
      this differs to that found in the general population of the same age and sex distribution,&#xD;
      and also to recipients of hip replacement using a conventional bearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We will use NJR data linked to the Clinical Practice Research Dataset (CPRD) to&#xD;
      establish the prevalence of cardiac, endocrine, neurological disorders, and distant site&#xD;
      fracture history (forearm, spine) in the 3 study populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: All defined as the event occurring at any point following MOMHR surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of cardiac failure, as defined by IDC9-CM code 150, or equivalent CPRD codes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History of treated or untreated acquired hypothyroidism (ICD9 244.8), or equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fracture history at a site distant to the ipsilateral hip (ICD9 820.00 to 826.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Acquired neurological disorders, including extra-pyramidal disorders (ICD9 332 and 333),&#xD;
           spinocerebellar degenerative disease (ICD9 334) and other paralytic syndromes (ICD9 344)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Acquired blindness and low vision (ICD9 369)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Acquired hearing loss (ICD9 389)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be conducted with age, sex, and joint disease diagnosis matching. Analyses will&#xD;
      be stratified by sex to establish whether any differences are sex specific, and adjusted for&#xD;
      age and other comorbidities, including history of type 2 diabetes, pre-existing ischaemic&#xD;
      heart disease, hypertension, and pre-existing use of drugs that may affect cardiac function.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable patients registered with an up to standard practice which participates in&#xD;
             the CPRD linkage scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have at least 6 (or 12) months of valid follow up in the primary care database.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary or revision hip replacement on National Joint Registry (NJR) database&#xD;
             occurring to during the period of availability of metal-on-metal implants, and during&#xD;
             the available primary care follow up period for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient consent to NJR use of patient data (which is present for 99.6% of records on&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Procedures on NJR database performed in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (as these&#xD;
             areas are not been included in the CPRD linkage scheme)&#xD;
