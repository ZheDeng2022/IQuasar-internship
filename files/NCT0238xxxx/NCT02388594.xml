        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 infection, as documented by a rapid HIV test or any FDA-approved HIV-1 Enzyme or&#xD;
             Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit and confirmed by Western blot at any&#xD;
             time prior to study entry or HIV antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA, or second antibody test by&#xD;
             a method other than rapid HIV and E/CIA. Alternatively, if a rapid HIV test or any&#xD;
             FDA-approved HIV-1 Enzyme or Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit is not&#xD;
             available, two HIV-1 RNA values ≥ 2000 copies/mL at least 24 hours apart performed by&#xD;
             any laboratory that has CLIA certification, or its equivalent, may be used to document&#xD;
             infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4+ T cell count of ≥450 cells/mm3 at screen; and a documented CD4 nadir of not lower&#xD;
             than 200 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate venous access and no other contraindications for leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values obtained at screen:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Hemoglobin: ≥ 10.0 (males); ≥ 9.5 (females) g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC): ≥ 1000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Platelet count: ≥ 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT): ≤ 2.5 times&#xD;
                  the upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to comply with study-mandated evaluations; including not&#xD;
             changing their antiretroviral regimen (unless medically indicated) for 2 months in&#xD;
             step 2 or until undergoing the analytical treatment interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be male or female, 18 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness of subject to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a Karnofsky Performance Score of 70 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have no polymorphisms in the CCR5 ZFN target region as determined by Cel I snp assay&#xD;
             at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3: LVEF &gt; or equal to 40%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically stable on their first or second HAART regimen. Changes while the patient&#xD;
             HIV viral load is undetectable does not count toward the number of ART regimens used,&#xD;
             only changes made for virologic failure (for example an individual switching from an&#xD;
             NNRTI-based regimen to an integrase inhibitor based regimen while the HIV viral load&#xD;
             is undetectable will still be in their first regimen). Site investigator anticipates&#xD;
             that a fully active alternative ART regimen could be constructed in the event of&#xD;
             virologic failure on the current ART regimen. The current regimen should have no&#xD;
             changes within 4 weeks of enrollment. Subjects must be willing to continue on current&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy for the duration of the study except for the duration of the 16&#xD;
             week analytical treatment interruption. NOTE: Subject's ART regimen must be in&#xD;
             accordance with the Department of Health and Human Services Document &quot;Guidelines for&#xD;
             the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1 Infected Adults and Adolescents.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 RNA undetectable by ultrasensitive assay copies/ml obtained at study screening&#xD;
             visit or within 60 days prior to study screening visit performed with an&#xD;
             ultrasensitive HIV-1 PCR assay. All subjects must have received at least 18 months of&#xD;
             therapy and have HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL using a FDA-approved assay for at least 48&#xD;
             weeks prior to enrollment. HIV-1 RNA must be measured at least once in the 24 weeks&#xD;
             prior to enrollment and at least 3 days before the screening measure. Single&#xD;
             determinations that are between ≥50 and &lt;500copies/mL (i.e., blips) are allowed as&#xD;
             long as the preceding and subsequent determinations are &lt;50 copies/mL. The screening&#xD;
             value may serve as the subsequent determination &lt;50 copies/mL following a blip. NOTE:&#xD;
             subjects who have participated in other trials using ATI's will be permitted since&#xD;
             detectable virus during the interruption does not represent virologic failure. These&#xD;
             subjects should have at least 24 weeks of VL &lt;50 copies/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a recorded viral load set point&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection (as further defined in section&#xD;
             6.3.4 and 6.3.8 of this protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior AIDS diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cancer or malignancy, with the exception of successfully treated basal cell&#xD;
             or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or any features on physical examination indicative of active or unstable&#xD;
             cardiac disease or hemodynamic instability. NOTE: subjects with a history of cardiac&#xD;
             disease may participate with a physician's approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or any features on physical examination indicative of a bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been previously treated with any HIV experimental vaccine within 6 months prior&#xD;
             to screening, or any previous gene therapy using an integrating vector. Note: Subjects&#xD;
             treated with placebo in an HIV vaccine study will not be excluded if documentation&#xD;
             that they received placebo is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of chronic systemic corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, or immunomodulating agents&#xD;
             (e.g., interleukin-2, interferon-alpha or gamma, granulocyte colony stimulating&#xD;
             factors, etc.) within 30 days prior to study screening visit. NOTE: Recent or current&#xD;
             use of inhaled steroids is not exclusionary. If subjects are prescribed a brief course&#xD;
             of oral corticosteroids, the use should be limited to less than 7 days. Use of&#xD;
             steroids before apheresis and immune assessment blood draws should be discouraged as&#xD;
             it will affect white blood cell function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast-feeding, pregnant, or unwilling to use acceptable methods of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipated use of aspirin, dyprydamole, warfarin or any other medication that is&#xD;
             likely to affect platelet function or other aspects of blood coagulation during the&#xD;
             2-week period prior to leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site&#xD;
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to study screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asymptomatic baseline serum chemistry elevations in LFTs, bilirubin, lipase and serum&#xD;
             creatinine due to HAART medication are not exclusionary, when in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, the abnormalities are not attributable to intrinsic hepatorenal disease.&#xD;
             Such baseline elevations must be due to HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of vaccination within 30 days prior to study screening visit. NOTE: It is&#xD;
             recommended that subjects enrolling into this study should have completed their&#xD;
             routine vaccinations (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, pneumococcus, and tetanus diphtheria&#xD;
             booster) at least 30 days prior to screening for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum albumin,&#xD;
             DMSO and Dextran 40).&#xD;
