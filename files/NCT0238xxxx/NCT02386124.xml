  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Italy, life expectancy at birth has reached 80 years in men and 85 in women; in about 50&#xD;
      years, life expectancy at the age of 80 has increased by an extraordinary 61% and 55%,&#xD;
      respectively, due to more effective therapies and lower mortality of many diseases. Yet,&#xD;
      chronic diseases are nowadays more important, and often coexist as comorbidity or&#xD;
      multimorbidity, depending on whether an index condition has been considered. These conditions&#xD;
      increase the risk of death and reduce functional autonomy in the elderly and, therefore,&#xD;
      should be carefully considered within comprehensive geriatric assessment. The epidemiology of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, as demonstrated among others by the Oxford Vascular Study, shows a&#xD;
      clear trend in age-dependent, as the number of events and their incidence increases with age,&#xD;
      and about half are concentrates over 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, some observational studies in elderly patients have suggested an association&#xD;
      between frailty and cardiovascular disease: fragility and cardiovascular disease share a&#xD;
      common biological pathway, and cardiovascular diseases may accelerate the onset of frailty.&#xD;
      The frailty syndrome was identified in 25% to 50% of patients with cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      according to the rating scale used and the population studied. Frail patients with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, in particular those undergoing invasive procedures or suffering from&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and aortic valve disease, have a much higher adverse events and&#xD;
      complications, suggesting the need for a more accurate functional stratification and a more&#xD;
      careful evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio of some invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the numerous tests proposed in the literature for the functional evaluation and&#xD;
      objective measures of physical capability in elderly patient, the Short Physical Performance&#xD;
      Battery (SPPB) and the evaluation of hand grip strength (grip strength) are those&#xD;
      characterized by an improved prognostic ability and an easy administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is performed to assess if SPPB and handgrip are helpful to better stratify&#xD;
      the prognosis (all-causes death and hospital admission for all causes) in elderly patients&#xD;
      admitted to hospital for cardiac causes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study. This a multicenter study involving 4 Italian&#xD;
      Cardiology Units (Ferrara, Cento, Forlì, Ravenna).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to enroll at least 400 consecutive patients with ≥70 years, which are&#xD;
      admitted to our cardiovascular departement for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GROUP A: acute coronary syndrome,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GROUP B: bradycardia or tachyarrhythmias requiring device implantation (pace-maker,&#xD;
           implantable cardioverter defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GROUP C: acute heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GROUP D: symptomatic severe aortic stenosis receiving aortic valve replacement or aortic&#xD;
           balloon valvuloplasty or transcatheter aortic valve implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main group of the study is the group A. The Authors will enroll at least 300 patients of&#xD;
      the group A. The main finding of the study will be for ACS patients. The results of group A&#xD;
      will be reported by Authors in a separate and principal paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To generate hypothesis for future studies, the Authors will enroll also other groups of&#xD;
      patients admitted to hospital for cardiac cause (group B, C and D). These patients will be&#xD;
      object of separate publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, the following functional assessments will be performed before the hospital&#xD;
      discharge:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  handgrip test (see definition below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ, see definition below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB, see definition below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI, see definition below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate if SPPB value is able to stratify prognosis in elderly&#xD;
      patients admitted to hospital for cardiac causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITION OF ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As suggested by current guidelines, we define a patient suffering from ACS if he meets the&#xD;
      following criteria (the first mandatory which must add up to at least one criterion 2 or 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. chest pain suggestive of cardiac origin lasting at least 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ECG changes compatible with signs of myocardial ischemia (ST over at least one mm in at&#xD;
           least two contiguous leads or new onset left bundle branch block not known before or&#xD;
           ST-segment depression of at least one mm in at least two contiguous leads or negative/&#xD;
           flattening of T wave)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. detection of rise of cardiac biomarker values with at least one value above the 99th&#xD;
           percentile of the upper reference in two consecutive blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITION OF ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (ESC GUIDELINES 2012)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term acute myocardial infarction should be used in case of evidence of myocardial&#xD;
      necrosis in a clinical picture compatible with acute myocardial ischemia. And in particular&#xD;
      it must verify detection of movement enzyme preferentially typical of troponin above the 99th&#xD;
      percentile than the limit of the standard and in the presence of at least one of the&#xD;
      following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms of ischemia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in de novo ST-segment and T-wave, new-onset left bundle branch block,&#xD;
           development of pathological Q waves on the ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence of loss of viable myocardium imaging or detection of new wall motion defects,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of an intracoronary thrombus on coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITION OF HEART FAILURE (ESC GUIDELINES 2012) It defines heart failure or an abnormality&#xD;
      of the structure of the cardiac function that involves an insufficient ability of the heart&#xD;
      to provide for the oxygen requirements in relation to the metabolic demands of the tissues,&#xD;
      despite normal or increased filling pressures. Heart failure is a syndrome that is&#xD;
      characterized by the presence of typical symptoms (dyspnea, peripheral edema and fatigue) and&#xD;
      signs resulting from an abnormality of cardiac structure and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITION AND METHODS OF ASSESSMENT TEST DELL'HANDGRIP (HGT). The handgrip test measures the&#xD;
      force of contraction of the flexor muscles of the fingers through the use of a dynamometer.&#xD;
      From literature it is known as such index correlates with the eventual malnutrition of the&#xD;
      subject, with its capacity of recovery and functional recovery post-surgery, as well as to be&#xD;
      in relation with age. The measurement will be made at the time of admission, namely within 24&#xD;
      hours of admission in acute coronary care in the event that the patient is admitted with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation or before being subjected&#xD;
      to coronary angiography in case aortic valve disease or acute coronary syndrome without&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation, under the supervision and assistance of medical staff. In each patient,&#xD;
      three measurements will be carried out. Will be taken into consideration for the study the&#xD;
      highest value. The measurement will be performed as indicated by current guidelines, with the&#xD;
      patient seated, with the dominant hand and the elbow flexed 90°. They are well known&#xD;
      limitations of the method and its variability. At the same time this method was chosen&#xD;
      because it is not laborious, virtually cost-free, well-administered in all patients admitted&#xD;
      for ACS or aortic valve disease and therefore readily identifiable as a method of coarse&#xD;
      screening in elderly patients without known diagnosis of &quot;frail elderly&quot; but at risk to be.&#xD;
      All medical personnel involved in the study performed a specific course to learn the proper&#xD;
      management and execution of screening with handgrip tes and has personal experience in its&#xD;
      proper execution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SHORT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BATTERY (SPPB). The scale SPPB is a short battery of tests created&#xD;
      to evaluate the functionality of the lower limbs. This battery is made up of 3 different&#xD;
      sections designed to assess a balance with 3 tests: the maintenance of the position with the&#xD;
      feet together for 10 seconds then the semi-tandem and finally tandem again for 10 seconds.&#xD;
      The score of this section varies from a minimum of 0 if the patient is unable to maintain&#xD;
      position with your feet together for at least 10 seconds to a maximum of 4 if he can&#xD;
      accomplish all three tests. The second section of the test is intended to evaluate the&#xD;
      progress of 4 linear meters and depending on the time of the performance section of the score&#xD;
      ranges from 0 if unable, at one point if the performance has a longer duration of 8.7&#xD;
      seconds, for a up to 4 if he can accomplish the task in less than 4.80 sec. The third section&#xD;
      investigates the ability of the battery to run for 5 consecutive times, getting up from a&#xD;
      chair without using the arms in this regard that must be crossed in front of chest. Also in&#xD;
      this case, the score ranges from 0 incapable or if the performance has a duration greater&#xD;
      than 60 seconds, to a maximum of 4 if such performance is carried out in less than 11.20&#xD;
      seconds. The scores range from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A score between 5 and 9 shows seniors still independent, but with reduced physical&#xD;
      performance, which can therefore be regarded as fragile and high risk, deserving of special&#xD;
      attention and specific interventions, acts to reduce the risk of adverse consequences. Data&#xD;
      in the literature confirm that the SPPB correlates with the risk of developing disability in&#xD;
      BADL and mobility, in proportion to the decrease of the SPPB score, regardless of age, sex&#xD;
      and presence of certain chronic diseases. The SPPB score then emerges as a powerful predictor&#xD;
      of disability and mortality in the elderly population. The battery SPPB proved to be a valid&#xD;
      predictor of prognosis in heart patients: in elderly hospitalized for acute exacerbation of&#xD;
      chronic heart failure, the SPPB score at discharge was able to predict the long-term&#xD;
      mortality. This assessment thus appears to be safe and feasible in hospitalized patients:&#xD;
      test will be performed in patients with hemodynamic stabilization prior to discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROGNOSITC INDEX (MPI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) is a prognostic tool based on a standard&#xD;
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) that predicts short- and long-term mortality in&#xD;
      elderly subjects. The MPI includes 63 items distributed in 8 domains of CGA as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Activities of Daily Living (ADL): 6 items&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL): 8 items&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ): 10 items&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mini Nutritional Assessement (MNA): 18 items&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Exton-Smith Scale (ESS): 5 items&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cumulative Index Rating Scale - Comorbidity Index (CIRS-CI): 14 items&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Number of drugs used: 1 item&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Co-habitation status: 1 item On the basis of MPI values, it is possible to calculate the&#xD;
           short- and long-term mortality risk of the older subjects and to define the severity&#xD;
           grade of mortality risk: low, moderate and severe. Several studies showed that the&#xD;
           prognostic accuracy of the aggregated MPI was significantly greater than the prognostic&#xD;
           accuracy of its individual components considered singularly. Thus the multidimensional&#xD;
           approach can be successfully used in elderly patients for both clinical and&#xD;
           administrative purposes.&#xD;
