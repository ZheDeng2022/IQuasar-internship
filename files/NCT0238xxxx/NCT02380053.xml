      What are the differential effects of beta-blockers on lung and heart function during exercise&#xD;
      in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? COPD is a major cause of illness and death.&#xD;
      Not only do these individuals suffer from lung disease, but COPD often leads to other&#xD;
      illnesses, particularly heart disease. Beta-blockers very successfully treat heart disease.&#xD;
      It is therefore logical that one would want to use this treatment in COPD patients with heart&#xD;
      disease too. However, there has always been concern that beta-blockers could cause&#xD;
      significant problems in COPD by worsening lung function, as these can have the opposite&#xD;
      effect to inhalers used to treat COPD that open up airways. Pointedly, there is increasing&#xD;
      evidence that despite this problem, COPD patients who have been prescribed beta-blockers have&#xD;
      been shown to gain benefit particularly in terms of preventing death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators therefore want to examine which beta-blocker might be the&#xD;
      safest for COPD patients, as each work slightly differently. Some beta-blockers may have a&#xD;
      more beneficial effect on airways than others, whilst still benefitting the heart. The&#xD;
      investigators will study two different beta-blockers; one that potentially narrows airways&#xD;
      and one that potentially opens airways. The investigators will be using cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise testing (an exercise bike that measures both heart and lung function during&#xD;
      exercise) to look for differences between both beta-blockers primarily in terms of lung&#xD;
      function but also with information about the heart. The investigators will recruit people&#xD;
      with moderate to severe COPD who are able to complete a cycle exercise test through their&#xD;
      respiratory research department. The study will last for 10-12 weeks with 5 main visits to&#xD;
      the department for serial exercise tests, breathing tests, simple heart function tests and&#xD;
      simple blood tests that will tell the investigators what other effects these beta-blockers&#xD;
      are having on the heart and lungs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of illness and death. In fact,&#xD;
      by 2020, the World Health Organization predicts that COPD will become the third leading cause&#xD;
      of death (currently fourth), and the fifth leading cause of disability (currently twelfth)&#xD;
      worldwide. COPD and cardiovascular (heart) disease are intertwined due to the associated risk&#xD;
      of smoking related atherosclerosis. Beta-blockers are generally avoided in COPD patients due&#xD;
      to the associated risk of worsening lung function and acute bronchospasm (airway narrowing)&#xD;
      due to beta-2-receptor blockade. Despite these concerns a recent Cochrane review has shown&#xD;
      that chronic beta-blockade with &quot;cardioselective&quot; beta-blockers (for example bisoprolol) that&#xD;
      preferentially block beta-1 (mostly heart) over beta-2 (mostly airway) receptors are well&#xD;
      tolerated with less beta-2-blockade and subsequently less bronchospasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, observational studies evaluating the impact of beta-blocker use in COPD patients&#xD;
      have shown benefits on survival with beta-blockers. We have published retrospective data from&#xD;
      5,977 patients with COPD with a mean follow up of 4.35 years, showing that patients using&#xD;
      beta-blockers (88% cardio-selective) produced a 22% overall reduction in death as well as&#xD;
      significant reductions in respiratory hospital admissions and oral steroid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beta-blockers are pharmacologically different and there now needs to be an assessment of the&#xD;
      clinical consequences of different beta-blockers in COPD. Despite being &quot;cardioselective&quot;,&#xD;
      bisoprolol still shows significant beta-2-receptor blockade at usual treatment doses, which&#xD;
      results in a significant worsening in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1second - FEV1 (a major&#xD;
      marker of lung function) following chronic use. Celiprolol however is a unique beta-blocker&#xD;
      which in addition to its beta-1-receptor blockade has partial beta-2-agonist activity and&#xD;
      therefore it does not cause bronchoconstriction or interact with short and long acting&#xD;
      beta-agonist inhalers which are the mainstay of COPD treatment. Thus celiprolol might confer&#xD;
      an ideal profile for use in COPD (i.e. good for heart and not detrimental to lungs),&#xD;
      especially in more severe patients where even a small fall in FEV1 might have significant&#xD;
      consequences on their breathing and exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor exercise tolerance is associated with worsening quality of life and increased risk of&#xD;
      death and thus provides a valuable surrogate marker of death. Worsening respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      in COPD patients are more commonly seen on exertion than at rest, and associated with&#xD;
      abnormal increases in lung volumes where air that is breathed in becomes trapped and cannot&#xD;
      completely escape when breathing out (dynamic hyperinflation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing provides a global assessment of both respiratory (lung) and&#xD;
      cardiovascular (heart) response to exercise. Whilst studies have shown a worsening of dynamic&#xD;
      hyperinflation with bisoprolol, due to their differing pharmacological properties it might be&#xD;
      that celiprolol will not result in worsening dynamic hyperinflation, whilst also&#xD;
      demonstrating improvement in cardiovascular outcomes such as stroke volume (the pump function&#xD;
      of the heart) and heart rate recovery following exercise. Whether these effects result in an&#xD;
      improved exercise tolerance is unknown. Another interesting property of celiprolol is reduced&#xD;
      cholesterol and increased High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) fraction conferred by partial&#xD;
      beta-2-agonist activity. We will also measure serum markers of cardiac dysfunction (B-type&#xD;
      Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and Galectin-3) and their response to beta-blockade which to the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge has never been performed in a COPD study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regards to measuring cardiovascular outcomes of cardiac output and stroke volume, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to use a novel non-invasive monitor which is based on the phenomenon of&#xD;
      bioreactance that occurs when a small alternating current is passed through the chest. To the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge this device has never been used when assessing cardiovascular&#xD;
      response to beta-blockers during exercise, but it is safe and easy to perform at the same&#xD;
      time as the standard exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore wish to assess the relative effects of both celiprolol and&#xD;
      bisoprolol in COPD patients and establish whether the proposed benefits on survival with&#xD;
      beta-blockers in COPD are reflected in improved cardiovascular and respiratory response to&#xD;
      exercise and importantly exercise tolerance. The investigators also want to see if celiprolol&#xD;
      is superior to bisoprolol on these markers (particularly lung function) as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information gathered from this study will be invaluable as it will provide further&#xD;
      information about the effects of beta-blockers in COPD and will be used to pump-prime larger&#xD;
      long-term studies examining the effects of beta-blockers on survival in many more COPD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between bisoprolol and&#xD;
      celiprolol in terms of cardiorespiratory outcomes during incremental exercise testing in&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe COPD - specifically no difference in the proposed primary&#xD;
      outcome measure of dynamic hyperinflation during cycle endurance testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The investigators have chosen a randomised crossover design to answer this question&#xD;
      because it is unknown which, if either, beta-blocker might be better for lung function and&#xD;
      exercise capacity in moderate to severe COPD patients. The crossover design allows the use of&#xD;
      the same patients as their own comparators, thus allowing the investigators to expose fewer&#xD;
      patients to these medications with the same statistical power as a parallel group study&#xD;
      (different patients in each group). Each participant will therefore receive both treatments&#xD;
      in sequence but with their initial one decided at random using a randomisation algorithm.&#xD;
      Importantly the investigators have not used a placebo control arm here, as it is already&#xD;
      known that beta-blockers are of benefit to COPD patients (particularly those with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease) whereas placebo provides no benefit. In other words the investigators&#xD;
      are drilling down to see which particular medication has the most beneficial therapeutic&#xD;
      profile. The justification for using open-label beta-blockers is that this is a pilot study&#xD;
      and it helps to keep the overall costs of the study down at this stage of investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The investigators will perform a randomised, cross-over, open label trial of&#xD;
      bisoprolol versus celiprolol with 10 people who have moderate to severe COPD. The study will&#xD;
      last between 10-12 weeks for each person. Potential participants will be recruited from our&#xD;
      existing database of volunteers with COPD, contacted either by telephone, email or post and&#xD;
      invited to participate. Those invited will receive a written patient information document&#xD;
      detailing the requirements of the study and the extent of their participation before&#xD;
      attending for a screening visit. Participants will be given at least 24hours to read the&#xD;
      information document before deciding whether or not they agree to be screened. The study will&#xD;
      include 5 visits to the department (including the screening visit) for the various tests&#xD;
      outlined below. Each visit may last for around 3 hours. If participants agree to coming along&#xD;
      for a screening visit, they will be asked to withhold any long-acting bronchodilators for&#xD;
      48hours and short acting bronchodilators for 6 hours as is standard practice when confirming&#xD;
      the diagnosis of airway obstruction / COPD using clinical pulmonary function measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit At the screening visit, the information document will be discussed with the&#xD;
      participant and written informed consent will be obtained if they agree to take part in the&#xD;
      study. The following will then be performed: a general medical examination by a doctor; a&#xD;
      pregnancy test for all females; lung function measurements (spirometry, impulse oscillometry,&#xD;
      reversibility to salbutamol); heart function measurements (resting ECG [electrocardiogram],&#xD;
      echocardiogram where possible if not done in last year); vital signs (oxygen levels, blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulse); 'practice' cardiopulmonary exercise test (to confirm ability to cycle and&#xD;
      to counter any 'learning effect' from future baseline exercise test); baseline blood tests.&#xD;
      Inhaler technique will also be assessed and confirmed adequate. Participants found to be&#xD;
      eligible for the remainder of the study after these tests will proceed through a 1 week&#xD;
      run-in period on their usual medications before coming back for the first (baseline) visit.&#xD;
      Those who do not fulfil the study criteria will continue on their usual medication and their&#xD;
      General Practitioner (GP) informed of any medically relevant data. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      be provided with portable monitors to measure their own lung function, pulse and oxygen&#xD;
      saturations at home twice daily to be recorded in a daily diary which will also include&#xD;
      details of their reliever use and symptoms. This diary will be kept throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits Prior to participants attending for their first (baseline) study visit they will&#xD;
      be asked to only withhold their short-acting reliever inhaler for 6 hours. Participants will&#xD;
      not be required to withhold any long-acting bronchodilators for study visits as we are&#xD;
      assessing any effects of the beta-blockers in addition to these standard treatments and we&#xD;
      will have confirmed the diagnosis of COPD at the screening visit. Diary cards will be&#xD;
      reviewed and the following measurements will be recorded at visit 1: resting lung function&#xD;
      (impulse oscillometry, spirometry, whole body plethysmography); resting ECG; vital signs; St&#xD;
      George's Respiratory Questionnaire (disease specific quality of life questionnaire); blood&#xD;
      sample (BNP, Galectin, Cholesterol/HDL, Creatine Kinase (CK), Potassium); cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test. Provided the participant's measurements still correspond to the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria for the study, they will be randomised to one of the two beta-blocker&#xD;
      treatments: Bisoprolol (2.5mg daily for 2 weeks, then 5mg daily for approximately 2 weeks) OR&#xD;
      Celiprolol (200mg daily for 2 weeks, then 400mg daily for approximately 2 weeks).&#xD;
      Beta-blockers will be up-titrated at home after 2 weeks with advice about contacting us if&#xD;
      side effects develop. Participants will be contacted both before and after this up titration&#xD;
      either by telephone or email. However, if adverse effects occur on the higher dose, then&#xD;
      participants will be allowed to drop back to the lower dose for the remainder of the study&#xD;
      period. At the end of each treatment period, study measures will be repeated as above. After&#xD;
      visit 2 participants will have an approximately 1 week washout period prior to being given&#xD;
      the alternate beta-blocker treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study After visit 4 each participant will have completed the study and they will be&#xD;
      returned to their usual medications. The overall study will be complete when the last&#xD;
      enrolled participant completes the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis and final reporting All analyses will be performed at the end of the study. There&#xD;
      will be no interim analysis. The report will be published in a high impact peer reviewed&#xD;
      journal.&#xD;
