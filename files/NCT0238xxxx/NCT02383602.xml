      HIV counseling and testing, risk reduction counseling, provision of condoms and lubricants&#xD;
      Same-day result HIV testing along with pre-test and post-test counseling, including risk&#xD;
      reduction counseling, will be provided according to the standard practice at each study site&#xD;
      at enrollment and every 6 months in HIV-negative participants. HIV-negative participants can&#xD;
      also access non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis service and symptomatic STD service if&#xD;
      these are available at study sites. HIV-positive participants will also receive risk&#xD;
      reduction counseling every 3 months. Condoms and lubricants will be provided free of charge.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective observational cohort study that will enroll up to 6,000 Thai MSM&#xD;
      and TG from drop-in centers in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Chonburi and Songkhla. Each participant&#xD;
      will have HIV testing at baseline and will be followed up for 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-negative participants will be asked to have HIV re-testing every 6 months. HIV-positive&#xD;
      participants will have POC CD4 testing and ART initiation regardless of CD4 count will be&#xD;
      offered. Those who accept ART will be followed up at week 2, week 4, month 2, month 3 and&#xD;
      every 3 months thereafter. Those who deny ART will be followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uptake of HIV re-testing will be determined. Access to POC CD4 testing and acceptability of&#xD;
      ART initiated at HIV diagnosis regardless of CD4 count along with ART adherence will also be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
