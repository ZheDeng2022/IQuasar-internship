    <textblock>
      Improving or maximising cardiac output in the perioperative setting through the use of goal&#xD;
      directed fluid therapy has been shown to reduce complications and length of hospital stay in&#xD;
      patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. The evidence for patients having surgery to&#xD;
      repair a fractured neck of femur is less robust but many of these latter patients are elderly&#xD;
      and often at high risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing surgery (including surgery for hip fracture) under spinal anaesthesia&#xD;
      have not had access to goal directed fluid therapy because of the invasive nature of the&#xD;
      existing monitoring technology such as oesophageal doppler. The availability of a non&#xD;
      invasive cardiac monitoring device, the Clearsight™, now makes goal directed fluid therapy a&#xD;
      possibility for this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised controlled, observer blinded trial to assess the effects of goal&#xD;
      directed fluid therapy in high-risk patients undergoing surgical repair of proximal femoral&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the trial is to test the hypothesis that maximising circulating volume&#xD;
      intra-operatively with balanced crystalloid reduces post-operative morbidity in high-risk&#xD;
      patients undergoing urgent surgical repair of proximal femoral fractures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of fractured neck of femur in the elderly population is of clinical and&#xD;
      political interest in the United Kingdom at present, with a current national audit in&#xD;
      progress to look at anaesthetic management and clinical outcomes. It is estimated that the&#xD;
      number of patients that sustain a hip fracture will reach 100,000 cases per annum by 2033&#xD;
      with a cost to the NHS of some £ 2.7 billion. Outcomes for this group remain poor with a&#xD;
      mortality of 8% at 1 month, increasing to 20-33% at 1 year4. Complication rates for this&#xD;
      group also remain significant with between 20 and 60% of patients having significant&#xD;
      postoperative complications. These complications are not only associated with increased&#xD;
      length of stay and healthcare costs, but also reduced long-term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving or maximising cardiac output in the perioperative setting either through the use of&#xD;
      intravenous fluids, or in combination with inotropes has been shown to reduce complication&#xD;
      rates following surgery in a variety of settings including those with fractured neck of&#xD;
      femurs. A recent meta analysis of optimisation trials has shown that for every 100 patients&#xD;
      in whom the intervention is provided, patients will avoid a complication, and length of stay&#xD;
      will be reduced by 1 day. Importantly the intervention is also associated with no harm. In&#xD;
      1997 by using the oesophageal Doppler to guide fluid therapy in an attempt to maximise&#xD;
      cardiac output, Sinclair managed to reduce the time patients who were operated on for a&#xD;
      fractured neck of femur were deemed fit for medical discharge from 15 to 10 days (P&lt;0.05).&#xD;
      Stroke volume was significantly increased in the protocol group, and although postoperative&#xD;
      complication rates were not reported in this trial, it is inferred that they were reduced. A&#xD;
      similar trial comparing conventional fluid therapy versus therapy guided by either central&#xD;
      venous pressure measurements or oesophageal Doppler showed a similar reduction in time to&#xD;
      being medically fit for discharge. This trial did report morbidity, which showed a&#xD;
      non-significant trend to improvement in subjects who received oesophageal Doppler monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main limitations of these trials are the relatively small numbers, with just 20&#xD;
      per group in the Sinclair trial and 30 per groups in the Venn trials, yet even with small&#xD;
      numbers an improvement in outcome was seen. A larger trial has recently been completed using&#xD;
      a more invasive calibrated measure of cardiac output, targeting a somewhat aggressive oxygen&#xD;
      delivery of &gt; 600ml/min/m2 using inotropic support in elderly fractured neck of femur&#xD;
      patients. Few patients actually achieved this goal, however there was again a non-significant&#xD;
      reduction in complications (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.54-1.16) however the trial was underpowered due&#xD;
      to issues with recruitment. The trial recruited 149 patients in total and to date is the&#xD;
      largest study to examine this population despite the impact that this population has on the&#xD;
      health services both within the NHS and worldwide. In addition all of the trials described&#xD;
      included in their recruitment a broad group of patients some of whom could be considered to&#xD;
      be at low risk of post operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this group of elderly patients a high-risk group exist. The Nottingham hip fracture&#xD;
      score (NHFS) is a validated scoring system that predicts patients at increased risk of both&#xD;
      30 day and 1-year mortality. A NHFS ≥ 5 was associated with a mortality of 13.7% vs. 3.5% at&#xD;
      30 days (P&lt;0.001) and 45.5% vs. 15.9% at 1 year (P&lt;0.001). It is assumed that this high-risk&#xD;
      group with an increased mortality rate also have an increased complication rate, and hence&#xD;
      any effective intervention would have a greater impact on outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing number of operations to repair fractured necks of femur are being performed&#xD;
      awake under spinal anaesthesia. Technology such as oesophageal Doppler is not suitable as it&#xD;
      cannot easily be tolerated when awake, and arterial based pulse waveform analysis requires an&#xD;
      invasive procedure to be performed. Hence many patients do not receive goal directed therapy&#xD;
      even though it may be of clinical benefit. A recent economic analysis has also suggested that&#xD;
      goal directed therapy in this group is not only cost effective but also associated with cost&#xD;
      savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clearsight™ non invasive cardiac output device measures blood pressure using the volume&#xD;
      clamp method developed by the Czech physiologist Jan Penaz. Using a simple non-invasive&#xD;
      finger cuff, the volume of an artery is kept clamped at a constant diameter. Changes in&#xD;
      diameter are measured by a photo-plethysmograph within the finger cuff, and a servo&#xD;
      controller applies counter pressure to keep the diameter of the artery constant. This allows&#xD;
      the measurement of beat to beat blood pressure and hence cardiac output can also be&#xD;
      calculated. The simple and non invasive nature of this device makes it suitable to use in&#xD;
      patients undergoing repair of fractured neck of femur regardless of the type of anaesthetic.&#xD;
      It requires no calibration, and would make goal directed therapy accessible to this group.&#xD;
      The Clearsight has been shown to be a valid measure of cardiac output.&#xD;
