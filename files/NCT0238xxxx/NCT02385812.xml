    <textblock>
      Asbestos defines a group of naturally occurring mineral silicate fibers which are easily&#xD;
      inhaled, resulting in a variety of diseases of the respiratory system including lung cancer&#xD;
      and malignant mesothelioma. Despite some advances in treatment, there has been little impact&#xD;
      on overall survival for both lung cancer and mesothelioma in the past 20 years in great part&#xD;
      because patients usually present with disease at an advanced and incurable stage. This study&#xD;
      aims to develop and implement a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening approach for&#xD;
      lung cancer and mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed workers in Alberta.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer mortality above the next three culprits&#xD;
      combined (breast, colon and prostate cancer). Cigarette smoking is the most important risk&#xD;
      factor in the development of lung cancer. Another population of particular interest in&#xD;
      Alberta involves workers with occupational exposure to asbestos as asbestos and tobacco&#xD;
      exposure results in a synergistic effect on lung cancer risk. Mesothelioma is a rare cancer&#xD;
      of the lining of the lung with poor prognosis of which 80% of cases are believed to be&#xD;
      related to asbestos exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, despite some advances in treatment, there has been little impact on overall&#xD;
      survival for both lung cancer and mesothelioma in the past 20 years in great part because&#xD;
      patients usually present with disease at an advanced and incurable stage. Additional&#xD;
      strategies are desperately needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to develop and implement a LDCT screening approach for lung&#xD;
      cancer and mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed workers in Alberta; to determine participants'&#xD;
      motivation and expectations associated with a screening program, their satisfaction with the&#xD;
      program, and the psychosocial consequences of the screening program; to determine the&#xD;
      accuracy of a lung cancer risk prediction model modified to include asbestos exposure; and to&#xD;
      determine the 3-year clinical incidence of lung cancer in asbestos-exposed individuals&#xD;
      interested in lung cancer screening but who do not meet minimal risk threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will offer a combined lung cancer and mesothelioma screening program for&#xD;
      200 Alberta asbestos-exposed workers based on low-dose CT scanning.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 50 - 80 years (either gender, any ethnic group)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented exposure to asbestos for at least one year, at least 10 years prior to&#xD;
             study entry&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical condition, such as severe heart disease (e.g. unstable angina, chronic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure), severe lung disease or lung disease requiring supplemental&#xD;
             oxygen, solid organ transplant, that in the opinion of the physician unlikely to&#xD;
             benefit from screening due to shortened life-expectancy from the co-morbidities or&#xD;
             inability to tolerate diagnosis and treatment of a screen detected abnormality&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been previously diagnosed with lung cancer or mesothelioma&#xD;

             cancers: non-melanomatous skin cancer, localized prostate cancer, carcinoma in situ&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CT scan of the chest in the past 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
