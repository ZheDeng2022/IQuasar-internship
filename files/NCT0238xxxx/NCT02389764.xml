  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if OfevÂ® (nintedanib, also called&#xD;
      BIBF1120) can help to control IBC. The safety of this drug will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Nintedanib is commercially available and FDA approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of certain types of lung disease. Its use in this study is investigational. The&#xD;
      study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 44 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take nintedanib capsules&#xD;
      by mouth 2 times each day. Each dose should be about 12 hours apart, at about the same times&#xD;
      every day. The capsules should be swallowed whole with about a cup (8 ounces) of water within&#xD;
      30 minutes after eating a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you forget to take the capsules and it has been more than 2 hours since you were scheduled&#xD;
      to take the dose, you should skip that dose and take the next dose as scheduled. Do not&#xD;
      double the next dose to &quot;make up&quot; the missed one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a study drug diary to write down when you took each dose of study drug. You&#xD;
      will need to bring back any empty or partially used bottles of study drug, along with any&#xD;
      leftover study drug, with you to the clinic at each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you experience side effects, you will be given standard drugs to help decrease the&#xD;
      symptoms of the side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs&#xD;
      are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests and procedures below will be performed before your dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of every cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-7 and then every odd-numbered cycle after that (Cycles 9,11, 13, and so&#xD;
      on), the physical exam and blood draw will be performed at MD Anderson . On Day 1 of Cycles 8&#xD;
      and then every even-numbered cycle after that (Cycles 10, 12, 14, and so on), the physical&#xD;
      exam and blood draw may be performed at a local clinic or doctor's office and the results&#xD;
      will be sent to the study doctor for review. The study doctor will discuss this option with&#xD;
      you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 3, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will also be drawn for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, and then every odd numbered cycle after that (Cycles 9, 11, 13,&#xD;
      and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, photographs will be taken of any areas affected by&#xD;
           the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an x-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, PET/CT&#xD;
           scan, and/or a bone scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any point that the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an EKG, ECHO, and/or MUGA&#xD;
      scan. You may have any of the above tests/procedures repeated as well, if the doctor thinks&#xD;
      it is needed, to check on your health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 2 years. You will no longer be able to take&#xD;
      the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are&#xD;
      unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 14 days after the last study visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, photographs will be taken of your skin and any areas&#xD;
           affected by the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an x-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, PET/CT&#xD;
           scan, and/or a bone scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an EKG and either an ECHO or MUGA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be called by a member of the study staff every 3 months for up to 1 year after your&#xD;
      end-of-treatment visit and asked how you are doing. These calls should last about 2 minutes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit defined as participants who achieve CR or PR within 3 months post-treatment, or participants who experience SD for at least three months post-treatment. Clinical benefit rate determined by RECIST 1.1 version.&quot; PATHOLOGICAL CR: No evidence of residual invasive tumor, including no residual tumor in the axillary lymph nodes. PR is defined as 30% or greater decrease for a minimum of 4 weeks in the measurable lesion as determined by the product of the perpendicular diameters of the lesion. Every lesion should not regress to qualify as a PR. However, if any lesion progresses or if new lesions appear, the response cannot be classified as a (PR). Minor Response [MR] Decreases in tumor masses insufficient to qualify as a partial remission, i.e. &lt;50%. SD between MR and PD. PD increase in the size by 25% of any measured lesion from baseline. Appearance of new lesions will also constitute increasing disease. Mixed responses will be considered PD.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, including an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a pharmaceutical product.

        <description>Clinical benefit defined as participants who achieve CR or PR within 3 months post-treatment, or participants who experience SD for at least three months post-treatment. Clinical benefit rate determined by RECIST 1.1 version.&quot; PATHOLOGICAL CR: No evidence of residual invasive tumor, including no residual tumor in the axillary lymph nodes. PR is defined as 30% or greater decrease for a minimum of 4 weeks in the measurable lesion as determined by the product of the perpendicular diameters of the lesion. Every lesion should not regress to qualify as a PR. However, if any lesion progresses or if new lesions appear, the response cannot be classified as a (PR). Minor Response [MR] Decreases in tumor masses insufficient to qualify as a partial remission, i.e. &lt;50%. SD between MR and PD. PD increase in the size by 25% of any measured lesion from baseline. Appearance of new lesions will also constitute increasing disease. Mixed responses will be considered PD.</description>
