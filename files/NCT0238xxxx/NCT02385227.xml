  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, forced-switch, parallel, proof-of-concept study to assess&#xD;
      exposure to biomarkers of tobacco exposure following short-term ad lib use of three blu&#xD;
      e-cigarette products. The primary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare changes in selected urine and blood biomarkers of tobacco exposure within&#xD;
           cohorts following a 5-day forced-switch from usual brand conventional combustible&#xD;
           cigarettes to exclusive use of blu e-cigarettes, dual use of blu e cigarettes and the&#xD;
           subject's usual brand combustible cigarette, or smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare changes in selected urine and blood biomarkers of tobacco exposure among cohorts&#xD;
           following a 5-day forced-switch from usual brand conventional combustible cigarettes to&#xD;
           exclusive use of a blu e cigarette, dual use of a blu e-cigarette and the subject's&#xD;
           usual brand combustible cigarette, or smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare changes in selected physiological endpoints affected by tobacco exposure within&#xD;
           cohorts during a 5-day forced-switch from usual brand conventional combustible&#xD;
           cigarettes to exclusive use of blu e cigarettes, dual use of blu e cigarettes and the&#xD;
           subject's usual brand combustible cigarette, or smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare changes in selected physiological endpoints affected by tobacco exposure among&#xD;
           cohorts following a forced-switch to exclusive use of a blu e cigarette, dual use of a&#xD;
           blu e-cigarette and the subject's usual brand combustible cigarette, or smoking&#xD;
           cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine daily nicotine consumption from blu e-cigarettes following exclusive use of&#xD;
           blu e cigarettes or dual use of blu e-cigarettes and the subject's usual brand&#xD;
           combustible cigarette over a 5-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the effectiveness of exclusive use of blu e-cigarettes or dual use of blu&#xD;
           e-cigarettes and the subject's usual brand combustible cigarette to reduce the urge to&#xD;
           smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess subject opinions of various characteristics of blu e-cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assess the safety and tolerability of short-term use of blu e-cigarettes.&#xD;

      Subjects checked in to the clinic on Day -2 and continued to smoke their usual brand&#xD;
      cigarette ad lib through the evening of Day -1 upon request to the clinic staff. Baseline&#xD;
      assessments were made from the morning of Day -1 through the morning of Day 1 prior to the&#xD;
      start of randomized product use. On the morning of Day 1, subjects were randomized into one&#xD;
      of the study arms noted above and post-baseline assessments were made through the morning of&#xD;
      Day 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With limited exceptions, all product use was ad lib from 07:30 to 23:00 on Days -2 to 5.&#xD;
      Smoking of cigarettes and use of the e-cigarette products were limited to separate sections&#xD;
      of the clinic to minimize the chance for illicit product use and cross-contamination.&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to the cessation arm were housed in a separate section of the clinic&#xD;
      after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Day 1 to the end of the study all subjects randomized to an e-cigarette cohort were&#xD;
      allowed to carry the assigned product with them throughout the day and use their product ad&#xD;
      lib within identified sections of the clinic. Subjects randomized to the dual-use cohorts&#xD;
      were allowed to smoke no more than 50% of the number of cigarettes per day reported at&#xD;
      Screening. Cigarettes were were provided to the subjects upon request to the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily product use of blu e-cigarettes and usual brand cigarettes was assessed on Days -1&#xD;
      through Day 5. Each blu e-cigarette was weighed prior to dispensing and following the return&#xD;
      of the product and the estimated amount of nicotine delivered from each blu e-cigarette will&#xD;
      be calculated by multiplying the weight difference (mg) by 2.4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine biomarkers of exposure and effect were assessed from 24-hour urine collections from the&#xD;
      morning of Day -1 to the morning of Day 1 and from the morning of Day 5 to the morning of Day&#xD;
      6. Urine biomarkers of exposure included NNAL, nicotine equivalents (nic + 5), 3-HPMA, CEMA,&#xD;
      1-OHP, NNN, MHBMA, and S-PMA. The urine biomarker of effect included F2-isoprostane&#xD;
      (8-iso-PGF2 Type III). Biomarker concentrations were adjusted for urine creatinine&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood biomarkers of exposure included COHb, nicotine, cotinine, and trans-3'hydroxycotinine.&#xD;
      Samples were collected on Days -1, 1, 3, and 5 in the morning prior to the start of product&#xD;
      administration and in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other physiologic endpoints included spirometry (FVC and FEV1, assessed in the afternoon on&#xD;
      Day -1 and Day 5, exhaled CO and NO measurements (assessed in the afternoon on Days -1, 1, 3,&#xD;
      and 5), and blood pressure and pulse rate (assessed on Days -1 through 5 in the morning prior&#xD;
      to the start of product administration and evening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires administered included the Fagerstr√∂m Test for Nicotine Dependence and the&#xD;
      Brief Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (Day -1), smoking urge (Days -1&#xD;
      through 5 in the morning prior to the start of product administration and evening), and the&#xD;
      Modified Cigarette Evaluation Scale (evening of Day 5, not administered to subjects in the&#xD;
      cessation arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations included physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      assessments (clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology), urine drug and&#xD;
      alcohol screens, urine cotinine and exhaled CO screens, and pregnancy tests (females only).&#xD;
      Adverse events spontaneously reported by the subjects or observed by the Investigator or&#xD;
      other study personnel were monitored from the time of Check-in until the End-of-Study (or&#xD;
      Early Termination). Any concomitant medications taken from 30 days prior to Check-in through&#xD;
      the End-of-Study (or Early Termination) were recorded.&#xD;
