  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will have been diagnosed with advanced breast cancer that has&#xD;
      become worse while being treated with fulvestrant. Participants will have estrogen-receptor&#xD;
      positive disease, and have completed menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is information from research labs which suggests that drugs that work like MLN9708 help&#xD;
      kill breast cancer cells that have been treated with fulvestrant. The purpose of the study is&#xD;
      to determine the proper dose as well as the good and bad effects of MLN9708 when it is given&#xD;
      in combination with fulvestrant. The Investigators also want to learn more about how the drug&#xD;
      combination affects tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of MLN9708 participants receive will be determined by when they enter this study.&#xD;
      Three different doses will be given to different participants. The Investigators expect to&#xD;
      enroll a total of 12-18 people.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer with disease progression on Fulvestrant, for&#xD;
      whom continuation of endocrine therapy would be an appropriate treatment, will be treated&#xD;
      with the combination of MLN9708 (proteasome inhibitor) and Fulvestrant (anti-estrogen).&#xD;
      Subjects with visceral or soft tissue disease will have a tumor biopsy while on treatment&#xD;
      with Fulvestrant but prior to initiation of MLN9708 to confirm ER/PR/HER2 status, and to&#xD;
      provide a baseline specimen for molecular analysis. A biopsy of the same tumor will be&#xD;
      obtained after 2 days of treatment with MLN9708 plus Fulvestrant (i.e. on day 3). Patients&#xD;
      with bone-only disease will be eligible for the study, but will not be biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators propose a 3x3 dose-escalation trial to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Fulvestrant and three dose levels of MLN9708 (2.3, 3, and 4mg) Subjects will be treated with&#xD;
      Fulvestrant (500mg) once every four weeks on day 1. The dose of MLN9708 will start at 2.3mg,&#xD;
      which is about 50% of the phase 3 dose in another ongoing study. If 2.3mg MLN9708 does not&#xD;
      induce any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, or any grade 4 hematologic toxicity by CTCAE&#xD;
      v4.0 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) in any of the 3 subjects&#xD;
      treated for 1 cycle, the Investigators will treat another 3 subjects with the combination of&#xD;
      Fulvestrant and MLN9708 (3mg); and if no grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, or any grade 4&#xD;
      hematologic toxicity by CTCAE v4.0 is seen over the first cycle, the Investigators will treat&#xD;
      another 3 subjects with Fulvestrant and MLN9708 (4mg, which is the phase 3 dose). If&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity is observed in 1/3 subjects, the Investigators will treat an&#xD;
      additional 3 subjects at that same dose. If dose-limiting toxicity is seen in 2 of 6 subjects&#xD;
      at any dose level, that dose level will be considered the maximum tolerated dose, and a total&#xD;
      of 6 subjects will be treated at the prior dose. Plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of MLN9708&#xD;
      will be determined over 21 days after the first dose of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies will be formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Tissue&#xD;
      sections will be analyzed by H&amp;E (Hematoxylin and eosin) staining and immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      using antibodies against markers of proliferation, apoptosis, estrogen receptor alpha&#xD;
      activation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and polyubiquitin. Proteasome activity of whole&#xD;
      blood will be determined using samples acquired prior to treatment initiation, and on day 3.&#xD;
      Tumor-specific plasma DNA will also be measured prior to treatment initiation and after the&#xD;
      first two doses of MLN9708.&#xD;

          1. Female post-menopausal patients 18 years or older. Voluntary written consent must be&#xD;
             given before performance of any study related procedure not part of standard medical&#xD;
             care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time&#xD;
             without prejudice to future medical care.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. The invasive cancer must be HER2-negative, defined as IHC0-1+, or with a FISH ratio of&#xD;
             &lt;1.8 if IHC is 2+ or if IHC has not been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer for which endocrine therapy is an&#xD;
             appropriate treatment option.&#xD;
