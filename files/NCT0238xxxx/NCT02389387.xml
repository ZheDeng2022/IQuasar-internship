  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to facilitate coordination of transplant centers in North&#xD;
      Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia to share kidney transplant referral data in patients&#xD;
      with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who are candidates for kidney transplantation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disparities exist in access to kidney transplantation where poor and minority patients are&#xD;
      less likely to access each step of the kidney transplant process. Current national&#xD;
      surveillance data does not capture information on transplant referral, and it is unclear to&#xD;
      what extent dialysis facility-level factors may influence disparities in access to&#xD;
      transplantation. Due to significant variability in the standardized transplant ratios&#xD;
      observed at each facility, the investigators hypothesize that there may be facility-related&#xD;
      reasons that impact disparities in access to the first step of the kidney transplant process&#xD;
      -- referral to the transplant center to undergo an evaluation for the suitability for&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;

    <description>Two hundred twenty (220) dialysis facilities will follow standard of care practices and the intensive intervention in their management of ESRD patients. The intensive intervention will consist of 1) A multi-module, secure, web-enabled software application called Transplant Referral EXchange (T-REX) to enhance coordination between dialysis and transplant staff and track ESRD patients through the seven primary steps to transplant , 2) educational webinars/seminars for staff, 3) facility-specific performance feedback reports, 4) assistance with and review of center-specific action plans to increase transplant referral, 5) scheduled bi-annual phone calls with an SETC member to monitor progress, 6) patient education on transplant via creation of an Education Station in facility lobby, and 7) development of a Peer Mentor program.</description>

    <description>I.A multi-module, secure, web-enabled software application called Transplant Referral EXchange (T-REX):1) real-time communication between staff across healthcare settings, documenting the use of transplant education materials, 2) sending/receiving electronic referrals for transplant specific to a transplant center's requirements and 3) tracking patients' status in the transplant process (e.g., patient interest in transplant, referral for transplant, evaluation start/completion, waitlist status, and transplant) II. Educational webinars/seminars for staff, III. Facility-specific performance feedback reports, IV. Assistance with and review of center-specific action plans to increase transplant referral, V. Scheduled bi-annual phone calls with an SETC member to monitor progress, VI. Patient education on transplant via creation of an Education Station in facility lobby, VII.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Kidney transplant centers in the geographic area of North Carolina (NC), South&#xD;
             Carolina (SC) and Georgia (GA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Low rates of referral for kidney transplantation (6-month crude referral risk mean of&#xD;
             0.06 and all facilities with a crude referral risk less than the mean)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The presence of a racial disparity (African American vs. Caucasian) in referrals for&#xD;
             kidney transplantation (racial disparity calculated based on the crude referral risk&#xD;
             difference and the standardized referral risk difference.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        The final pool of 440 facilities will be randomized to either the intervention or control&#xD;
        group using a one to one ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Close out date populated&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Transplant and hospital-based facility&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Home dialysis facility&#xD;
&#xD;
