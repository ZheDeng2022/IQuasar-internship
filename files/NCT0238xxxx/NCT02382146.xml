      We designed this randomized, double- blind, single-center study to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      the combination of dexamethasone with ondansetron and dexamethasone with dimenhydrinate&#xD;
      undergoing plastic surgery.&#xD;

      A total of 60 voman patient, ASA status I-II , aged 18-65 year and scheduled for elective&#xD;
      rhinoplasty were enrolled in the study. Exclusion criterias hypersensitivity or&#xD;
      contraindication for the studied medications, received an antiemetic drug or steroid within&#xD;
      24 hours before anesthesia, have history of diabetes history of motion sickness (MS) or PONV,&#xD;
      or pregnant and lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were informed on how to use the patient controlled analgesia device during the&#xD;
      postoperative period. The risk criterias for PONV were recorded for each patient.Patients&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to two study groups of 30 patients. All patients were premedicated&#xD;
      with intravenous (iv) midazolam (1-2 mg). On arrival in the operating room, standard&#xD;
      anesthetic monitors were applied. Anesthesia was induced with iv propofol (2-3 mg/kg) and&#xD;
      fentanyl (1-1.5 μg/kg). Tracheal intubation was facilitated with rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg).&#xD;
      After tracheal intubation all patient received iv 8 mg dexamethasone. Normocapnic mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation was performed after intubation. General anesthesia was maintained with&#xD;
      sevoflurane (1 minimum alveolar concentration) in oxygen / air mixture and remifentanil&#xD;
      (0.1-0.3 μg/kg/min) infusion.Four mg ondansetron and for each patient 1 mg/kg dimenhydrinate&#xD;
      in the 5 ml syringe solution were prepared by pharmacy department, and given to the blinded&#xD;
      investigators. The patients, anesthesiologists (with the exception of the primary author),&#xD;
      statistician, and observes were all blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dimenhydrinate was administered in group DD (1mg/kg), and ondansetron was administered in&#xD;
      group DO (4mg), and all patients received tramadol (1.5mg/kg) and tenoksikam (20mg) half an&#xD;
      hour before emergence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia was provided with a patient controlled analgesia system by using iv&#xD;
      tramadol (5mg/mL) (2 ml bolus and 10 minutes lockout interval without basal infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery, muscle relaxation was reversed by administering neostigmine (0.05mg/kg)&#xD;
      and atropine (0.015mg/kg). Patients were extubated and transferred to the recovery unit.&#xD;
