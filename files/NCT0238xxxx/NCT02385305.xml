  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective study is to determine the effect of pressure support ventilation&#xD;
      (PSV) on minute alveolar ventilation (MAV) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) in&#xD;
      anesthetized spontaneously breathing subjects by observing alterations of respiratory rate&#xD;
      (RR), expiratory tidal volume, MAV and ETCO2 at variable levels of pressure support.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia induction will be performed with usual anesthetics without any opioids and&#xD;
      followed by the placement of a laryngeal mask airway. Optimal anesthesia level will be&#xD;
      maintained with inhalation anesthesia so as to obtain a bispectral index of 30 to 50.&#xD;
      Subjects will be ventilated with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) by the anesthesia&#xD;
      ventilator until the presence of spontaneous breathing can be affirmed. A carbon dioxide/flow&#xD;
      sensor (Adult Combined CO2/Flow Sensor; Novametrix medical systems INC., Wallingford, CT)&#xD;
      will be placed between the LMA and the breathing circuit. The sensor will be connected to a&#xD;
      noninvasive cardiac output monitor (NICO; Noninvasive Cardiopulmonary management System,&#xD;
      model 7300; Respironics Corp., Murrysville, PA). NICO data (end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), tidal&#xD;
      volume and flow waveforms) will be recorded and stored on a personnel computer. At the start&#xD;
      of surgery, the anesthesia care provider will administer opioids to control nociceptive&#xD;
      stimuli from surgery. Figure 2 shows the procedural course of the study. Once spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing is observed, PSV will be applied with pressure support (PS) of 3, 8, 13 and 18&#xD;
      cmH2O in this order, with slope of 1.0 second and no PEEP. The fraction of inspired oxygen&#xD;
      will be titrated to achieve SpO2 over 98%. Five minutes will be allowed to achieve&#xD;
      equilibrium at each PS level after which an additional recording of one minute of data will&#xD;
      be obtained. Once the PSV is completed at 18 cmH2O, ventilation will be carried out in&#xD;
      reverse order of PS; 13, 8 and 3 cmH2O of PS. If at any point in the course of the study the&#xD;
      subjects ETCO2 is higher than 60 mmHg, obvious body motion is observed or abnormal vital&#xD;
      signs [NIBP; &gt;160/90 mmHg or &lt;80/50 mmHg, HR; &gt;100 mmHg or &lt;40 mmHg, SpO2; &lt;94% at a given&#xD;
      fraction of inspired O2] occur, the study will be terminated and routine care will be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
