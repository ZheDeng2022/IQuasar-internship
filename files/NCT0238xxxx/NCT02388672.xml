      Coffee as one of the most favorite worldwide beverages comprises a variety of chemicals with&#xD;
      health benefits. Most investigations have so far focused on the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      caffeine but knowledge about non-caffeine coffee compounds such as chlorogenic acid (CGA) is&#xD;
      scarce. The reducing risk of a variety of diseases following CGA consumption has been&#xD;
      mentioned in recent basic and clinical studies. However, there is a lack of studies that&#xD;
      examine the behavioral effects of CGA. This study aims to fill this gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized double-blind study, the investigators test the acute effects of coffee&#xD;
      enriched with CGA or CGA supplement on physiological functions such as blood pressure, blood&#xD;
      glucose, and heart rate, and on psychological functions such as mood and cognitive&#xD;
      performance in 30 healthy adult subjects (18-40 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allocated to an intervention plan using computer-generated random&#xD;
      numbers. Treatments comprise of (1) 6g decaffeinated (5 mg caffeine) coffee (250 ml) with&#xD;
      high total CGA (560 mg), or (2) 6g decaffeinated coffee (250 ml) with normal total CGA (224&#xD;
      mg), or (3) 6g decaffeinated coffee (250 ml) with normal total CGA and 800mg green coffee&#xD;
      bean extract with total CGA (560mg), or (4) 6g decaffeinated coffee (250 ml) with normal&#xD;
      total CGA and placebo, or (5) no treatment group. Upon arrival in the laboratory,&#xD;
      participants will complete a 24-hour food recall, a psychometric test battery, and mood and&#xD;
      cognitive performance tests. The tests will be repeated 40 min following CGA application,&#xD;
      which coincide with the approximated peak of CGA blood concentrations and at 120 min post&#xD;
      treatment. Blood pressure, blood glucose and heart rate recordings will be taken prior to&#xD;
      treatment and at 1, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min post-treatment. The response to GCE-enriched&#xD;
      coffee will be compared to GCE supplement for each of the groups of variables.&#xD;

      Coffee as one of the most favorite worldwide beverages comprises a variety of chemicals&#xD;
      maintaining the greatest health benefits among the commonly consumed beverages. Most&#xD;
      investigations have so far focused on the beneficial effects of caffeine. On the contrary,&#xD;
      knowledge on potential health benefits of non-caffeine coffee compounds is scarce. Coffee&#xD;
      contains many polyphenols, especially chlorogenic acids (CGA), which have purported&#xD;
      antioxidant abilities. With increasing incidence of degenerative diseases, the general public&#xD;
      is turning to use natural herbal supplements, as one of these agents, CGA has been&#xD;
      biologically and medically emphasized and can be expected to become a topic addressed in&#xD;
      future studies, medical trends and pharmacology. The reducing risk of a variety of diseases&#xD;
      following CGA consumption has been mentioned in recent basic and clinical studies. However,&#xD;
      there is a lack of studies that examine the behavioral effects of CGA. This study aims to&#xD;
      fill this gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized double-blind study, the investigators test the acute effects of coffee&#xD;
      enriched with CGA or CGA supplement on physiological functions such as blood pressure, blood&#xD;
      glucose, and heart rate, and on psychological functions such as mood and cognitive&#xD;
      performance in 30 healthy adult subjects (18-40 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allocated to an intervention plan using computer-generated random&#xD;
      numbers. Treatments comprise of (1) 6g decaffeinated (5 mg caffeine) coffee (250 ml) with&#xD;
      high total CGA (560 mg), or (2) 6g decaffeinated coffee (250 ml) with normal total CGA (224&#xD;
      mg) , or (3) 6g decaffeinated coffee (250 ml) with normal total CGA and 800mg green coffee&#xD;
      bean extract with total CGA (560mg), or (4) 6g decaffeinated coffee (250 ml) with normal&#xD;
      total CGA and placebo, or (5) no treatment group. Participants will be instructed to abstain&#xD;
      from alcohol, foods, and beverages containing caffeine, chlorogenic acids and high polyphenol&#xD;
      content for 24 hours prior to the experiment. Upon arrival in the laboratory, participants&#xD;
      will complete a 24-hour food recall, a psychometric test battery consisting of the&#xD;
      questionnaire on competence and control beliefs (FKK), the Life Orientation Test-Revised&#xD;
      (LOT-R), the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), the Sensitivity to Punishment and&#xD;
      Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ), General Self-Efficacy (SWE) questionnaire, and mood and&#xD;
      cognitive performance tests consisting of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire, a&#xD;
      parametric Go/no-Go test (PGNG) and the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). The POMS,&#xD;
      Go/no-Go, and CVLT will be repeated 40 min following CGA application, which coincide with the&#xD;
      approximated peak of CGA blood concentrations and at 120 min post treatment. Blood pressure,&#xD;
      blood glucose and heart rate recordings will be taken prior to treatment and at 1, 30, 60, 90&#xD;
      and 120 min post-treatment. The response to GCE-enriched coffee will be compared to GCE&#xD;
      supplement for each of the groups of variables.&#xD;
