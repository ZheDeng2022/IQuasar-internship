      Part A: This is a phase Ib trial combining the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib with the PI3K&#xD;
      inhibitors taselisib, or pictilisib. There are two treatment arms during the dose escalation&#xD;
      phase where patients will receive either taselisib OR pictilisib in combination with&#xD;
      palbociclib. Palbociclib, taselisib and pictilisib can all be given orally once daily with&#xD;
      food, in a 21-days-on and 7-days-off schedule. Once the MTD is reached, the combination with&#xD;
      the optimum safety and PK/PD profile will be taken forward to the dose expansion phase (Part&#xD;
      B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B1: At the MTD dose expansion, fulvestrant will be administered in addition to&#xD;
      palbociclib and taselisib or pictilisib orally once daily, in a 21-days-on and 7-days-off&#xD;
      schedule in the ER+ve HER2-ve PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cohort. Fulvestrant will be given&#xD;
      intramuscularly on Day 1, Day 15 in cycle one followed by Day 1 for all subsequent cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B2: At the MTD dose expansion, patients with PIK3CA mutant advanced solid tumours will&#xD;
      be treated with palbociclib and taselisib or pictilisib orally once daily, in a 21-days-on&#xD;
      and 7-days-off schedule.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib trial of palbociclib in combination with either taselisib or pictilisib.&#xD;
      The study will include a dose escalation phase (Part A), and an MTD dose expansion phase&#xD;
      (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: will investigate escalating doses of palbociclib with either pictilisib or taselisib&#xD;
      administered orally, continuously for 21 days out of a 28 day cycle in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumours recruited simultaneously into two parallel arms (up to 24 patients in each arm&#xD;
      with a maximum of 48 patients in Part A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD is determined the combination with the optimum safety and PK/PD profile as&#xD;
      determined by the SRC will be taken forward to the dose expansion phase (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: The MTD dose expansion phase will be conducted using the optimal combination from&#xD;
      Part A in two parallel arms as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B1: Patients (n=25) with PIK3CA mutant ER + HER2-ve advanced breast cancers will be treated&#xD;
      with a triplet combination of palbociclib and either taselisib or pictilisib along with&#xD;
      fulvestrant. Part B1 will require at least two of the first 15 patients to respond to&#xD;
      progress to recruit the full 25 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B2: Patients (n=20) with PIK3CA mutant advanced solid tumours including at least 8 patients&#xD;
      with PIK3CA mutant ER negative and/or HER2 positive breast cancers will be treated with the&#xD;
      doublet combination of palbociclib and either taselisib or pictilisib. Other cancers with&#xD;
      relevant genetic aberrations (e.g. KRAS mutations) may be considered, depending on emerging&#xD;
      preclinical and clinical data on these novel antitumour agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, it is expected that a minimum of 70 and up to a maximum of 93 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the trial, the final number will depend on the number of dose escalations&#xD;
      required to reach DLT. If &lt; 48 patients are enrolled in Part A, investigators will be&#xD;
      permitted to enrol &gt; 45 patients in Part B, providing the maximum number of patients remains&#xD;
      ≤93 patients across the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated accrual rate during the dose escalation phase is estimated at 2 patients per&#xD;
      month. Accrual in the expansion phase is estimated at 4 patients per month across 2 centres.&#xD;
      It is expected that the trial will have a duration of recruitment of 12 to 24 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. History of malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteral&#xD;
             absorption. For example active intestine inflammation (e.g., Crohn's disease or&#xD;

             patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree&#xD;
             to use two highly effective forms of contraception (oral, injected or implanted&#xD;
             hormonal contraception and condom, have an intra-uterine device and condom, diaphragm&#xD;

             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception&#xD;
             [condom plus spermicide] during the trial and for six months afterwards). Men with&#xD;
             pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception&#xD;
             (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or&#xD;
             neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NB: Male patients who are potentially fertile should be made aware that palbociclib&#xD;
             causes testicular degeneration in animal models and may wish to consider sperm&#xD;
             preservation prior to beginning therapy.&#xD;

             appendix 4 for grading), unstable angina pectoris, stroke or myocardial infarction&#xD;
             within 6 months, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment, with the exceptions&#xD;
             of atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or conduction&#xD;
             abnormality that has been treated and for which the patient is no longer at risk for&#xD;
             serious arrhythmia (e.g., Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome treated with surgical&#xD;
             ablation).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Clinically significant history of liver disease, including cirrhosis, current alcohol&#xD;
             abuse, or current known active infection with hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Active infection is defined as requiring treatment with antiviral therapy or presence&#xD;
             of positive test results for Hepatitis B (Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and/or&#xD;
             total Hb core antibody [anti-HBc]) or Hepatitis C (Hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody).&#xD;
             Unless required by local regulations, patients are not required to have HIV, HCB, or&#xD;
             HCV assessments at screening if these assessments have not been previously performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who are positive for anti-HBc are eligible only if testing is also positive&#xD;
             for Hepatitis B surface antibody [HbsAb] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is&#xD;
             negative for HBV DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who are positive for HCV serology are eligible only if testing for HCV RNA is&#xD;
             negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Immunocompromised status due to current known active infection with HIV or due to the&#xD;
             use of immunosuppressive therapies for other conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Need for current chronic corticosteroid therapy, specifically dexamethasone or ≥ 10 mg&#xD;
             of prednisone per day or an equivalent dose of other anti-inflammatory&#xD;
             corticosteroids. Stable use (i.e., no change in dose within 1 month prior to Day 1 of&#xD;
             Cycle 1) of inhaled corticosteroids is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Prior bone marrow transplant or extensive radiotherapy to greater than 25% of bone&#xD;
             marrow within eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial,&#xD;
             whilst taking part in this Phase I study. Participation in an observational trial&#xD;
             would be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Current malignancies of other types, with the exception of adequately treated&#xD;
             cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin. Cancer survivors, who have undergone potentially curative&#xD;
             therapy for a prior malignancy, have no evidence of that disease for 3 years or more&#xD;
             and are deemed at negligible risk for recurrence, are eligible for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Patients who require daily supplemental oxygen&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a&#xD;
             good candidate for the clinical trial.&#xD;
