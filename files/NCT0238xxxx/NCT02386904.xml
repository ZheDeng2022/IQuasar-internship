      Safety and therapeutic efficacy of Phosphate enema (Kleen Enema®) in patients undergoing&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy. Prospective, interventional, single arm study in patients undergoing day care&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy for evaluation of efficacy and safety of Kleen Enema®(120ml phosphate enema);&#xD;
      manufactured by Nabiqasim Industries (Pvt) Ltd, Karachi, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods &amp;Material:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will be conducted in patients undergoing sigmoidoscopy in day care at Dow University of&#xD;
      Health Sciences, Ojha campus, Karachi. Each subject will receive the single dose of&#xD;
      investigational drug (phosphate enema 120ml). Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of Kleen Enema® for bowel preparation in out-patients&#xD;
           undergoing to sigmoidoscopy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the Safety of Kleen Enema® in outpatients requiring sigmoidoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This would be helpful to determine the efficacy and safety of investigational product in&#xD;
      local population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Condition :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in outpatients admitted for day care sigmoidoscopy requiring left&#xD;
      sided bowel preparation for procedure. Each subject will receive the single dose of&#xD;
      investigational drug (phosphate enema 120ml). Patient will remain in fasting condition at&#xD;
      least 6 hours before procedure and half an hour after recovery from sedation; after this&#xD;
      patient can take normal diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted after the approval by an Institutional review board of Dow&#xD;
      University of Health Sciences, Karachi and in accordance to declaration of Helsinki,&#xD;
      International Conference of Harmonization - Good Clinical Practices and Pakistan Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practices guidelines to protect the rights and safety of human subjects as&#xD;
      participants in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration for primary efficacy end point evaluation will be the time period till&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy procedure is completed and patient is discharged from day care. While patient&#xD;
      will come again for follow-up visit. Whole study will be completed in five months, after&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational drug will be administered to 40 Patients.The data of at least 35 patients&#xD;
      will be included for efficacy study. While all enrolled patients who receive a single dose of&#xD;
      study product will be included for safety evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening procedure Out patients visiting gastroenterology Out Patient Department requiring&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy will undergo screening procedure. Medical examination, history, vital signs,&#xD;
      electrolytes test (Ca, Phosphate, Sodium and potassium levels) and CBC test will be&#xD;
      performed. However the normal procedure and conditions required for sigmoidoscopy will be&#xD;
      followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration Method for rectal enema:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients should lay on left side with both knees bent, arms at rest.Remove protective&#xD;
      shield from the enema container. With steady pressure, gently insert enema comfort tip into&#xD;
      anus with nozzle pointing towards navel. Squeeze bottle until nearly all liquid is expelled.&#xD;
      Discontinue use if resistance is encountered. Forcing the enema can result in injury.Return&#xD;
      enema to carton for disposal. Generally, 2 to 5 minutes are sufficient to obtain the desired&#xD;
      effect maximum to 30 minutes. Study subject may have an urge to evacuate the bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confinement :&#xD;
&#xD;
      After sigmoidoscopy is completed, patients will be monitored in the recovery room of&#xD;
      endoscopy suite till patients are out of sedative effect.Safety Assessment Health assessment,&#xD;
      including vital signs, physical examination and clinical laboratory testing (electrolyte test&#xD;
      and CBC) will be performed at baseline; before sigmoidoscopy and electrolyte will be repeated&#xD;
      within 10-30 minutes after dosing. Patients will be monitored after drug administration to&#xD;
      determine any adverse events. Patients are encouraged to report any unusual feeling or&#xD;
      adverse event to endoscopy research staff or research assistant. Patients will be monitored&#xD;
      for pruritus, dehydration, nausea,vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, diarrhea,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal pain and any other adverse&#xD;
