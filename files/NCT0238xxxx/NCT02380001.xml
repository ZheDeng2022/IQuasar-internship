      The purpose of the present investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preoperative&#xD;
      administration of Dexketoprofen Trometamol, employing the third molar surgery model, when&#xD;
      compared to postoperative administration of the same drug. It was hypothesized that&#xD;
      preoperative oral Dexketoprofen trometamol will reduce the intensity of pain by 30% after 8&#xD;
      hours of the surgery, when compared with post-operative administration.&#xD;

      MODEL OF SURGICAL REMOVAL OF TOOTH IMPACTION. The model of Dental Impaction Pain Model (DIPM)&#xD;
      is the most utilized of all the acute pain models. Its popularity is due to a&#xD;
      well-established, well-validated, and extensively used postsurgery pain model in assessing&#xD;
      the efficacy of analgesics on inflammatory pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure is very standardized and surgery require either minimal or nothing use&#xD;
      of CNS depressant anesthetics. The methodology is similar to other models of acute pain;&#xD;
      however, the DIPM is much more versatile than most other models. The model can be easily&#xD;
      adapted to carry out studies of multiple-dose, pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics,&#xD;
      preventive interventions and analgesic efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impacted lower third molar extraction involves the manipulation of hard and soft tissue,&#xD;
      making the patient undergoes a series of effects which include acute pain, inflammation and&#xD;
      trismus in the immediate postoperative period and goes from 24 to 72 postoperative hours. The&#xD;
      pain associated with the surgical removal of a third molar is moderate to severe, increasing&#xD;
      with greater intensity during the first 24 hours after surgery with spikes of pain between&#xD;
      the first six to eight hours when using a conventional local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the control of pain and inflammation post-surgical associated with third&#xD;
      molar removal has been very varied; highlighting the use of anti-inflammatory pain relievers&#xD;
      non (NSAIDs) and some opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAIN. Pain is defined as the perception of a potentially injurious stimulus; which jointly to&#xD;
      several not pleasurable experiences (sensory, emotional and cognitive), same that are caused&#xD;
      by tissue damage (actual, potential or described in terms of such damage) and manifested by&#xD;
      certain reactions physiological, autonomic and behavioral. Pain is typically classified as&#xD;
      either acute or chronic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pain: is of sudden onset and is usually the result of a clearly defined cause such as&#xD;
      an injury. The acute pain includes the estimated time as necessary so that the tissues heal,&#xD;
      as described by John Bonica in 1953, usually in the span of a month, according to the&#xD;
      Committee of taxonomy of the pains of IASP, the length limit for a sharp pain is three&#xD;
      months, however should be noted that there are authors who continue classifying pain acute&#xD;
      with a duration of up to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain: is defined as pain that lasts more than 12 weeks, or the one that according to&#xD;
      the characteristics of their origin, exceeds time which could usually be defined a similar&#xD;
      pain. It is accompanied by psychological commitment to important behavior disorders that can&#xD;
      lead to depressive states; depending on the individual baseline emotional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it can also be classified according to their structure (somatic or visceral) origin&#xD;
      and physiological mechanism (nociceptive or neuropathic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scheme to perceive pain needs: a) a peripheral structure that acts as a receiver; b) a&#xD;
      synapse in the spinal cord, c) pathways from spinal cord to superiority centers and d)&#xD;
      descending pathways from the superiority center to the marrow, which act as mainly inhibitory&#xD;
      mechanisms but also facilitated by change of neurotransmitters .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of the neurophysiology of pain has been an important advance in the knowledge of&#xD;
      the mechanism of the painful stimulus in the perioperative period describing a dynamic system&#xD;
      where multiple input have a place nociceptive, which conditions the first stage of peripheral&#xD;
      awareness that amplifies transmission of stimulation to condition a second tier of central&#xD;
      sensitization to keep in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENT OF PAIN. Clinicians and researchers have recognized that pain is a&#xD;
      multidimensional experience, which includes a number of qualities or measurable elements as&#xD;
      intensity, involvement, sensory quality, quality spatial (location), temporary quality, and&#xD;
      the impact on daily activities. While the focus on the measurement of pain remain in the&#xD;
      intensity, there has been an increase in the interest of measure other elements of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAIN INTENSITY SCALES. The domain of pain used in clinical studies and research is the&#xD;
      intensity of the pain. The three scales used to measure the intensity of pain are: a) visual&#xD;
      analog (VAS scale), b) the scale of numeric value (NRS) and c) the verbal value (VRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATEGIES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DENTAL PAIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In dental practice pain of moderate to severe intensity conditions are usually treated with&#xD;
      Nonstereoidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) drug, although there are other different types of&#xD;
      drugs used for this purpose that are described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NASAIDs are a class of drugs that provides analgesic and antipyretic effects. Since they&#xD;
           have a mechanism of action in common based on the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)&#xD;
           enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and general of Eicosanoids.&#xD;
           Unfortunately, prostaglandins mediate other physiological functions that cause&#xD;
           undesirables adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New inhibitors of COX show great power and analgesic effectiveness and are better at&#xD;
           reducing the incidence of adverse effects compared to the classic AINE´S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEXKETOPROFEN TROMETAMOL. Dexketoprofen is a new anti-inflammatory drug non-steroidal (NSAID)&#xD;
      belonging to the family of the arylpropionic acid derivatives. Dexketoprofen is the&#xD;
      enantiomer S (+) of the composite ketoprofen, a drug with analgesic effects and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory clearly documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexketoprofen has been developed (dexketoprofen trometamol) tromethamine salt as a&#xD;
      formulation with a higher than the free acid aqueous solubility. Pharmacokinetic studies&#xD;
      performed in healthy individuals showed that oral administration of dexketoprofen trometamol&#xD;
      presented a kinetic favorable profile for use in acute pain compared to the formulation of&#xD;
      free acid or racemic ketoprofen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexketoprofen trometamol, is one of the most powerful inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis&#xD;
      &quot;in vitro&quot;. 12.5-25 mg orally is given with a quickly absorbed on an empty stomach, which has&#xD;
      a strong binding to albumin and inactive metabolites after glucuronization renal excretion.&#xD;
      It is well accumulate in synovial fluid and its analgesic potency is comparable to 50 mg of&#xD;
      ketoprofen or diclofenac and more than 600 mg of ibuprofen, so its main indication is acute&#xD;
      postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The production of a unique isomer of ketoprofen formulation simplifies the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of the drug and allows a reduction of 50% in the dose. This can reduce adverse effects to&#xD;
      reduce the metabolic and renal work, rapid absorption appears to offer some protection&#xD;
      against gastrointestinal complications as a method to avoid gastrointestinal toxicity&#xD;
      different of the selectivity of COX presents a good profile of security and reported adverse&#xD;
      effects are similar to placebo in these studies, the uniqueness of the therapeutic profile of&#xD;
      the DKP.TRIS could be the result of a combination of factors which include the higher power&#xD;
      as it is given only the active molecule, inhibition of COX two isoenzymes, rapid absorption&#xD;
      from the gastrointestinal tract and high capacity to enter the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREVENTIVE ANALGESIA. Preventive analgesia (PA) is an antinociceptive treatment which&#xD;
      prevents the establishment of the altered processing of the sensory input, that amplifies and&#xD;
      chronic postoperative pain. The PA concept was formulated by Crile at the beginning of the&#xD;
      century on the basis of clinical observations. There are two terms in English which refer to&#xD;
      the same concept: preemptive analgesia, which consists of a treatment that is given before&#xD;
      the surgical incision and maintained for intervention to avoid an altered sensory processing&#xD;
      that amplifies and chronic postoperative pain. Is usually to compare the same way and the&#xD;
      same drug management before and after the incision; and preventive analgesia consists of a&#xD;
      longer lasting analgesic effect which that would theoretically be expected after&#xD;
      administration of a certain drug on the basis of its pharmacological properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In oral surgery, primary hyperalgesia is the awareness of the receivers of the mucosa and the&#xD;
      periosteum by a range of mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins. Secondary&#xD;
      hyperalgesia is central sensitization of neurons in the nucleus trigeminal and spinal supra&#xD;
      structures. Secondary hyperalgesia can be observed over the time, while the primary&#xD;
      hyperalgesia is provable within a few hours after the injury; Prostaglandins are synthesized&#xD;
      quickly after damage to the tissue and appear in significant concentrations 1 hour after&#xD;
      trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of preventive analgesia is based on the prior administration to the surgical&#xD;
      incision of a painkiller to dampen or prevent phenomena of hypersensitisation central in&#xD;
      order to reduce the consumption of analgesics in the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WORK PLAN. Using a format in which specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the&#xD;
      selection of the patients will be held, during this visit will also fill the form of&#xD;
      demographic data, status of the patient, current condition, medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, x-ray and diagnostic studies. See annex 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then patients will be randomized distributed in two groups of participants, group 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental drugs. The randomized patient is determined to a group according with the&#xD;
      administration of the drug in two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1 Oral administration of dexketoprofen Trometamol 25 mg, 30 minutes before the&#xD;
      beginning of surgery and administered immediately at the end of the same placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2 The placebo is oral administered 30 minutes before the beginning of surgery and&#xD;
      administered immediately at the end of the same dexketoprofen Trometamol 25 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure. All surgeries will be performed by the same surgeon, to achieve a local&#xD;
      anesthetic effect, a previous asepsis and antisepsis of the area will be necessary. The lower&#xD;
      alveolar nerve with reinforcement of the lingual nerve and long buccal nerve using 2&#xD;
      cartridges of lidocaine with epinephrine 2% with a concentration of 1:100 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the anaesthetic effect is present, surgery can be performed, a flap of total thickness&#xD;
      of mucoperiosteal will be made, using a triangular incision design liberating the tissue at&#xD;
      the level of the second mandibular molar, subsequently the third molar extraction will be&#xD;
      performed. Finally the reposition of the flap and suturing will be made using black silk&#xD;
      suture (3-0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases the duration of the surgery procedure will be registered in every step. see&#xD;
      annex 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of the variables. Intensity of pain. For both groups, a measure will be performed&#xD;
      between the distance in mm from point 0 to the point that the patient indicates; with the&#xD;
      understanding that the point represents the intensity of the pain using the NRS, values were&#xD;
      registered in the NRS scale of each patient. This procedure will beginning after the second&#xD;
      intake of the drug or placebo (basal), after 8 hours (8-NRS), 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours&#xD;
      post operatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to remedication. The time in minutes that the patient request remedication with&#xD;
      dexketoprofen, registering again the intensity of pain will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total of tablets consumed. The number of tablets consumed in the 72 hrs of the postoperative&#xD;
      will be recorded. The dosage of dexketoprofen 25mg will be standardized for every 8 hours,&#xD;
      and not to exceed 75mg every 24 hours until the patient deems necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibiotic used in the clinical trial will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clindamycin 300 mg every 8 hrs for 5 days. After 7 days of postoperative evolution, the&#xD;
      patient will return to the clinic for removal of stitches, evaluating the operative area and&#xD;
      general health condition, with this step, the attention will be concluded for the surgical&#xD;
      procedure and the medical discharge will be indicated.&#xD;
