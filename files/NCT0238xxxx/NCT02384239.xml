  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 70 patients with hormone receptor positive (HR+) advanced breast cancer will be&#xD;
      enrolled. All patients will receive either fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscular (IM) every 2&#xD;
      weeks x 3 then every four weeks) or tamoxifen (20 mg orally daily by physician choice).&#xD;
      Pre-menopausal women must be in chemical menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 will receive palbociclib 100 mg qd, days 1-21 every 28 days. Arm 2 will receive&#xD;
      palbociclib 125 mg qd, days 1-21 every 28 days. Restaging will be performed every 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Therapy will be continued until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to take either 100 mg or 125 mg of&#xD;
      palbociclib. Randomized treatment assignments will be made by permuted blocks, generated by&#xD;
      our collaborating statistician at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.&#xD;

             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
