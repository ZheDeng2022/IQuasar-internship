  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to gather baseline surveillance data about the current health&#xD;
      status of adults with chronic health conditions in La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia and identify&#xD;
      barriers to the management of NCDs during face-to-face outpatient encounters as well as via&#xD;
      novel mobile health services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within Latin America, there is a significant lack of data about the medical management and&#xD;
      self-care for patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes and&#xD;
      hypertension. In an effort to improve availability of such data in the Latin American region,&#xD;
      the World Health Organization (WHO) created and tailored a survey tool that has been used in&#xD;
      various countries throughout Central and South America. Our own research team has extensive&#xD;
      experience surveying clinic-based populations in Latin America regarding their chronic&#xD;
      disease burden and the potential effectiveness of novel approaches to self-care support via&#xD;
      mobile phones. The objective of the planned project is to gather baseline surveillance data&#xD;
      for non-communicable diseases in urban and peri-urban Bolivian communities, using the WHO&#xD;
      instrument as a foundation with modifications to reflect local public health priorities and&#xD;
      the goal of developing mobile health services that improve self-management support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be conducted by investigators and students of the University of Michigan&#xD;
      Schools of Medicine, Public Health, and Information, in partnership with the Catholic&#xD;
      University of Bolivia, San Pablo (UCB-San Pablo). The over-arching aim is to conduct a&#xD;
      longitudinal survey of health indicators in a variety of primary and ambulatory care sites&#xD;
      within clinics associated with Universidad Cat贸lica Boliviana, including SEDES La Paz and&#xD;
      Universidad Mayor San Andres, in La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia. The survey is based on: a) the&#xD;
      World Health Organizations' Division of Disease Prevention and Control's Program on&#xD;
      Non-Communicable Diseases' (NCD) Surveillance Toolkit: Risk Factors for Non-Communicable&#xD;
      Diseases, with the addition of b) the 8 Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) to screen&#xD;
      for Depression, c) the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), d) the Patient&#xD;
      Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) Questionnaire, e) questions developed by our&#xD;
      research team regarding the feasibility and desirability of mobile health monitoring and&#xD;
      self-care support and f) 8 item Morisky Medication use questions. By using validated survey&#xD;
      instruments, the investigators will be able to compare health indicators across countries and&#xD;
      provide the participating Bolivian government agencies and universities information crucial&#xD;
      to understanding the factors contributing to the development and maintenance of NCD services&#xD;
      in Bolivia. Specifically, this study will provide baseline data, which does not exist to&#xD;
      date, identifying the prevalent risk factors for NCDs and the barriers to those patients'&#xD;
      care. More generally, the investigators will gain invaluable experience regarding the&#xD;
      feasibility of enrolling large representative samples in various outpatient sites for use in&#xD;
      subsequent observational studies of NCD management and in randomized trials.&#xD;
