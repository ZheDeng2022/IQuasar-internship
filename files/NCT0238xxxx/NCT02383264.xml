    <textblock>
      Enteral nutrition of preterm and intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) infants is still a&#xD;
      challenge for neonatologists. Due to the immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract, preterm&#xD;
      infants are at high risk of developing feeding intolerance (FI) or necrotizing enterocolitis&#xD;
      (NEC), which is the most feared gastrointestinal complication of prematurity. The occurrence&#xD;
      of FI often prompts clinicians to withhold, decrease or discontinue enteral feeds; thus, the&#xD;
      establishment of an adequate early enteral nutrition is frequently hampered. Early&#xD;
      identification of preterm infants at high risk for gastrointestinal complications could help&#xD;
      clinical decisions on the introduction and the advancement of enteral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a non-invasive monitoring of regional oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (rSO2). A significant correlation between lower abdominal rSO2 values in the first&#xD;
      week of life and subsequent NEC development has been reported. To date, however, splanchnic&#xD;
      oxygenation patterns in response to the first bolus feed and possible correlations with&#xD;
      subsequent FI development have not been yet established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational prospective study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess abdominal rSO2 patterns in response to the first bolus feed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate possible correlations with subsequent development of gastrointestinal&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enteral nutrition of preterm and intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) infants remains a&#xD;
      major challenge for neonatologists. Early introduction of minimal enteral feeding (MEF)&#xD;
      enhances gut hormones release, reduces the intestinal permeability and improves the motility&#xD;
      of the intestinal tract, thus promoting gut functional maturation. Due to gastrointestinal&#xD;
      immaturity, however, preterm infants are likely to develop clinical symptoms of feeding&#xD;
      intolerance (FI), such as abdominal distention, vomiting, abundant and/or bilious gastric&#xD;
      residuals, occult or gross bloody stools. FI could represent an early sign of necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocolitis (NEC), the most feared gastrointestinal complication of prematurity. The&#xD;
      occurrence of FI often prompts neonatologists to withhold, decrease or discontinue enteral&#xD;
      feeds, thus hampering the establishment of an adequate early enteral nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early identification of preterm infants at high risk of gastrointestinal complications could&#xD;
      help clinical decisions on the introduction and the advancement of enteral feeding. The&#xD;
      administration of the first feed in healthy preterm infants leads to a post-prandial increase&#xD;
      of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow, detected by Doppler ultrasound. A significant&#xD;
      correlation between early feeding tolerance and increased SMA blood flow velocity has been&#xD;
      further observed one hour after the first feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a non-invasive monitoring of regional oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (rSO2) and has been previously used to evaluate mesenteric perfusion in preterm&#xD;
      infants at increased risk for intestinal complications. Abdominal rSO2 detected by NIRS has&#xD;
      been shown to effectively reflect mesenteric blood flow changes. A significant correlation&#xD;
      between lower abdominal rSO2 values in the first week of life and subsequent NEC development&#xD;
      has been recently observed in a cohort of preterm infants, confirming previous data from&#xD;
      animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evidences on the role of NIRS monitoring in predicting FI development are still&#xD;
      limited. To date, indeed, splanchnic oxygenation patterns in response to the first bolus feed&#xD;
      and possible correlations with subsequent FI development have not been established yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess abdominal rSO2 patterns in response to the first bolus&#xD;
      feed and to evaluate possible correlations with the development of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are consecutively enrolled in the&#xD;
      study if fulfilling the following criteria: gestational age â‰¤34 weeks, stable clinical&#xD;
      conditions, availability of antenatal Doppler data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enteral feeding prior to the enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major congenital abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central nervous system diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoxic injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic instability, hypotension, patent ductus arterioles, anemia, sepsis or other&#xD;
           infections at time of the first feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antenatal Doppler impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written, informed consent to participate in the study is obtained from the parents/legal&#xD;
      guardians of each infant before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first feed administration, the enrolled infants undergo a continuous monitoring of&#xD;
      cerebral and splanchnic rSO2 by means of an INVOS 5100 oximeter. NIRS recording is performed&#xD;
      from 30 minutes before to 3 hours after feeding administration. Cerebral and splanchnic rSO2&#xD;
      are recorded every 5 seconds. Baseline values are defined by the mean of the 15 minutes&#xD;
      before the meal; values recorded after feeding administration are clustered into 5-minute&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feeding intolerance is defined as enteral feeding withholding for at least 1 day due to the&#xD;
      onset of gastrointestinal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' characteristics (including gestational age, birth weight, tolerance to enteral&#xD;
      feeds during hospitalization) are recorded in a specific case report form at the time of&#xD;
      enteral feeding introduction and before discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to their clinical characteristics, the enrolled infants are retrospectively&#xD;
      allocated into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: infants developing FI during the hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: infants not developing FI during the hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistic version 20.0.0 (IBM Corporation, IBM Corporation&#xD;
      Armonk, New York, United States). Clinical characteristics in the study groups are compared&#xD;
      by t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables.&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test is used to compare abdominal rSO2 patterns in response to the first feed&#xD;
      between groups 1 and 2. A multivariate analysis is also performed to assess the effect of&#xD;
      possible confounding factors.&#xD;
