  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human, 3-part study&#xD;
      in which the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally administered AL-704 will be&#xD;
      assessed in healthy adult subjects and in adult subjects with CHC infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Healthy adult subjects will receive one of 5 single ascending oral doses (SAD) of&#xD;
      AL-704 ranging from 100 mg to 1,500 mg (Cohorts 1 to 5). Within each cohort subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either AL-704 or placebo (n=8 per cohort; 6 assigned to AL-704 and 2&#xD;
      assigned to placebo), in a fasted state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned dose-escalation scheme may be changed based on the emerging PK and safety data.&#xD;
      Two additional cohorts (Cohorts 6 and 7) may be enrolled for evaluation of additional doses&#xD;
      at the discretion of the Sponsor and Investigator, based on the emerging pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      profile, and the presence of an acceptable safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: To assess the food effect on pharmacokinetics, 8 healthy subjects from one full Part&#xD;
      1 cohort who received a single dose of AL-704 or placebo in a fasted state, will receive the&#xD;
      same single dose of AL-704 or placebo in a fed state in Part 2 after a washout period of 7-14&#xD;
      days (depending on PK results). It is expected that Cohort 3 of Part 1 (600 mg dose) will be&#xD;
      selected, however this depends on the evaluation of available PK and safety data from Part 1&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3: The following cohorts of 10 adult subjects each, with CHC infection, will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Subjects with CHC genotype 1 infection (Cohorts 8 to 10) and subjects with CHC&#xD;
      genotype 3 infection (Cohort 11) will be randomized to receive AL-704 or placebo for 7&#xD;
      consecutive days (n=10 per cohort, 8 assigned to AL-704 and 2 assigned to placebo) in a fed&#xD;
      state. The treatment is anticipated to be administered in a once daily dose regimen or a&#xD;
      twice daily dose regimen. The dose and dose regimen to be administered will be determined by&#xD;
      the Sponsor depending on the PK and safety outcomes of previous cohorts.&#xD;

             1 or 3 HCV infection at screening. In case of discrepancy between previously&#xD;
             documented geno- or subtype and the geno- or subtype determined at screening, the&#xD;
