  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is recommended for kidney stones &lt; 20 mm. However, the stone&#xD;
      clearance of lower pole calculi after SWL is limited, thus leading to an extended indication&#xD;
      for mini-percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL) even for stones between 10 and 20 mm in many&#xD;
      centers. This trend is further promoted by introduction of super-mini PCNL (SMP), which is&#xD;
      postulated to be less invasive compared to mini-PCNL due to the miniaturized instruments.&#xD;
      However, this issue remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, improvements in endoscopy technology have made retrograde stone removal&#xD;
      more attractive. This has led to an increasing use of RIRS as a primary treatment although it&#xD;
      is recommended only as 2nd-line option by current guidelines. However, the treatment of&#xD;
      symptomatic lower pole calculi is a challenge for RIRS because of lower clearance rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SMP and RIRS for the&#xD;
      treatment for symptomatic lower pole calculi renal calculi measuring 10-20 mm.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of SMP and RIRS for the treatment for symptomatic lower&#xD;
      pole calculi renal calculi measuring 10-20 mm.Investigators will do a multi-centers&#xD;
      international randomized controlled trial(RCT)，and investigators plan to perform this study&#xD;
      in 10 hospitals，which are the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University of&#xD;
      China, Department of Urology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University of China, Shenzhen People's&#xD;
      Hospital of China, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University of China, The&#xD;
      Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University of China, Zhujiang Hospital of&#xD;
      Southern Medical University of China, Jiangsu Province hospital, The First Affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital With Nanjing Medical University of China, Zhejiang provincial people's hospital of&#xD;
      china, Dr. Lutfi Kirdar Training and Research Hospital of Turkey and Global Rainbow&#xD;
      Healthcare of India respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to beginning their study at August in 2015 and end at July in 2017.One&#xD;
      hundred and sixty patients with symptomatic lower pole calculi renal calculi measuring 10-20&#xD;
      mm will be enrolled in this study. By simple random sampling technique, patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to two 80-patient groups.All the patients will be diagnosed definitely before&#xD;
      operations with non-contrast CT.Patients with positive preoperative urine culture should be&#xD;
      treated with suitable antibiotics based on the culture sensitivity result for at least 72h&#xD;
      before SMP/RIRS. Patients who have negative urine culture should receive a single dose of&#xD;
      broad spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis just prior to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMP&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the biochemistry tests and preoperative preparations are referenced to the mini-PCNL.&#xD;
      Under general anesthesia a 6 French(Fr).Open end ureteral catheter is first inserted in to&#xD;
      the relevant ureter. Patient is then turned into prone position and the desired calyx is&#xD;
      punctured under fluoroscopic or sonographic guidance. Nephrostomy tract dilation is carried&#xD;
      out using fascial dilators up to 12-14 Fr. as indicated. Corresponding size of&#xD;
      suction-evacuation sheath was placed. The sheath is connected to the specimen collection&#xD;
      bottle and the bottle then onto the aspirator. A rubber cap with a center aperture was placed&#xD;
      at the proximal end of the sheath. The negative pressure aspirator was adjusted to a setting&#xD;
      of 150-200 mm Hg. The miniature endoscope is inserted into the sheath through the cap. Stone&#xD;
      is visualized and lithotripsy is performed using either Holmium-yttrium aluminum garnet(YAG)&#xD;
      laser or pneumatic lithotripsy. At the end of procedure fluoroscopic images are obtained to&#xD;
      assess stone clearance status. Double J ureteral stent is placed only in the presence of&#xD;
      ureteral inflammatory polyp; evidence of ureteropelvic obstruction; presence of significant&#xD;
      pyelocalyceal blood clots following lithotripsy; significant residual stones. Indications for&#xD;
      nephrostomy tube placement included: significant residual stone fragments which would require&#xD;
      a second look procedure; significant pyelocalyceal blood clots or bleeding after lithotripsy&#xD;
      (because the nephrostomy tube could tamponade the access tract and drain the urine and&#xD;
      clots).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIRS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is placed in the lithotomy position, Cystoscopy and retrograde pyelogram were&#xD;
      preformed, and a 0.035'' flexible tip guidewire is placed into the renal pelvis. A 12 Fr/ 14&#xD;
      Fr ureteral access sheath (UAS) is advanced into the proximal ureter over the guidewire, and&#xD;
      a P5 or P6 Olympus flexible ureteroscope is passed through the UAS. The stones are fragmented&#xD;
      using a 200um holmium laser fibre at a 8-25 weeks energy setting. Some fragments are removed&#xD;
      using a stone basket for stone analysis, and the remaining stone fragments smaller than 2 mm&#xD;
      were left for spontaneous passage. A 5 Fr or 6Fr pigtail stent is placed at the conclusion of&#xD;
      the procedure. Double J stents were removed post-operative 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for the 2 groups-demographic characteristics,hemoglobin(HB) decrease, postoperative&#xD;
      pain, duration of postoperative, hospital stay, complications (modified Clavien system),&#xD;
      stone clearance (SFR after day 1 and final SFR) and the need for auxiliary treatment are&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean study endpoint: The primary endpoint was the SFR at 3-months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: Complications, duration of postoperative and hospital stay. re-SMP,&#xD;
      ureteroscopy and SWL are considered as auxiliary treatments. Demographic characteristics&#xD;
      include age, sex, BMI, stone size and location, etc…&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stone size is defined as the maximum diameter as determined by CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degree of hydronephrosis are assigned as follow: none (no calyx or pelvic dilation), mild&#xD;
      (pelvic dilatation alone), moderate (mild calyx dilation), or severe (severe calyx dilation&#xD;
      or calyx dilation accompanied by renal parenchyma atrophy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of operation time:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For SMP: recorded from the time of the first percutaneous renal puncture to the completion of&#xD;
      the stone removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For RIRS: recorded from insertion of an endoscope into the urethra to the completion of stent&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital stay are rounded to the nearest whole day and calculated from the day of surgery to&#xD;
      the day of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain (visual analogue scale(VAS), use of analgesics) and Postoperative comfort&#xD;
      scores (Bruggrmann comfort scale，BCS) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of hemoglobin decrease is assessed by comparing the preoperative Hb level with&#xD;
      24-hour postoperative Hb level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SFR is assessed by KUB and ultrasound at 1-day after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-contrast CT is obtained for all patients at 3 month after the operation to evaluate the&#xD;
      final SFR, allowing time for the spontaneous passage of stone fragments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stone-free status are defined as either the absence of any residual stone fragments or the&#xD;
      presence of clinically insignificant residual stone fragments in the kidney which were&#xD;
      defined as ≦ 3mm, asymptomatic, non-obstructive and non-infectious stone particles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the procedure is considered as successful, the pigtail stent is removed as outpatient&#xD;
      after 2 weeks. Follow-up including non-contrast CT will be generally scheduled in 3 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding severity is judged by the treating physician, and transfusions are administered&#xD;
      according to local practice guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of all patients are recorded according to modified Clavien classification&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
