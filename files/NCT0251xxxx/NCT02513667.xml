  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to see if Ceritinib can target ALK in non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      and slow down cancer growth and prevent it from spreading.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an, open-label, two-cohort protocol designed to evaluate the activity of targeted&#xD;
      therapy and SABR in ALK positive lung adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A will evaluate the combination in ALK-inhibitor naïve patients. Cohort B will&#xD;
      evaluate the combination in patients who have received treatment with one prior ALK&#xD;
      inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ceritinib will be administered to the patient until disease progression by RECIST 1.1,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation of the trial for any other&#xD;
      reason including death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary focus of this protocol is identifying response in ALK+ lung cancer patients.&#xD;
      Patients with Ventana assay and Vysis FISH probe positive tumors will be treated. Evidence of&#xD;
      ALK gene rearrangement will also be considered eligible for the trial.&#xD;

                       contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).&#xD;

             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior&#xD;
             to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of&#xD;

             required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug&#xD;
             via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patient has a history of pancreatitis or history of increased amylase or lipase that&#xD;

         15. Patient has other severe, acute, or chronic medical conditions including uncontrolled&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormalities that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation&#xD;
             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient has had major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic)&#xD;
             within 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment or has not recovered from side&#xD;
             effects of such procedure. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and mediastinoscopy&#xD;
             will not be counted as major surgery and patients can receive study treatment ≥1 week&#xD;
             after these procedures.&#xD;
