      The purpose of this Phase 1b, multi-centre, dose escalation study is to find the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of AZD1775 combined with olaparib in patients with refractory solid&#xD;
      tumours&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, multi-centre study of AZD1775 combined with olaparib administered orally&#xD;
      in patients with refractory solid tumours, or as combination therapy for relapsed small-cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (SCLC). There are 2 parts to the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Dose Escalation Part B: Dose Expansion&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, patients with refractory solid tumours will be assessed for safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD 1775 when combined with olaparib. Different dose levels will&#xD;
      be administered to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose expansion part (Part B) will further explore the safety, PK, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the AZD1775 RP2D and dosing schedule for the treatment of patients with SCLC who&#xD;
      previously had a confirmed response (either a Complete Response or Partial Response) to&#xD;
      first-line platinum therapy and then relapsed. Patients who progressed whilst on&#xD;
      platinum-containing therapy (platinum refractory) are not permitted to enter the study..&#xD;
&#xD;
      An olaparib pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study will precede the combined treatment with AZD1775&#xD;
      and olaparib for all patients in Part A. In the sub-study single agent olaparib will be given&#xD;
      orally BID for 3 or 5 consecutive days and venous blood samples will be collected on Day 3 or&#xD;
      Day 5 as appropriate for assessment of the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of single agent&#xD;
      olaparib. Patients will experience a short gap in treatment (approximately 4-5 days) between&#xD;
      Day 3 or Day 5 of the olaparib PK sub-study and Cycle 1 Day 1 of the combination treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive treatment with AZD1775 and Olaparib until disease&#xD;
      progression, intolerable toxicity, or discontinuation criteria have been met.&#xD;

             lovastatin are prohibited in this study. Co-administration of aprepitant or&#xD;
             fosaprepitant during this study is prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Caution should be exercised when inhibitors or substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp),&#xD;
             substrates of CYP1A2 with a narrow therapeutic range, sensitive substrates of CYP2C19&#xD;
             or CYP2C19 substrates with a narrow therapeutic range are administered with AZD1775.&#xD;
&#xD;
        12. Herbal preparations are not allowed throughout the study, including but not limited to:&#xD;
        St. John's wort, kava, ephedra (ma hung), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),&#xD;

        days prior to first dose of study treatment.&#xD;

        13. Any known hypersensitivity or contraindication to the components of the study drug&#xD;
        AZD1775 or olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias (patients with chronic rate&#xD;
             controlled atrial fibrillation in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities are&#xD;
             eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
             16. AZD1775 should not be given to patients who have a history of Torsades des pointes&#xD;
             (TdP) unless all risk factors that contributed to TdP have been corrected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             17. Mean resting corrected QTc interval using the Fridericia formula [QTcF]) ≥ 470&#xD;
             msec for female patients and ≥ 450 msec for male patients from 3 electrocardiograms&#xD;
             (ECGs) performed 2-5 minutes apart at study entry or congenital long QT syndrome. .&#xD;
&#xD;
             18. Pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
             19. Serious known active infection at the time of enrolment, or another serious&#xD;
             underlying medical condition that would impair the ability of the patient to receive&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             20. Presence of other known active invasive cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             21. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not&#xD;
             permit compliance with protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             22. Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical&#xD;
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples&#xD;
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (&lt; 3&#xD;
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal&#xD;
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung&#xD;
             disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder&#xD;
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             23. Immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients who are known to be serologically&#xD;
             positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
             24. Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or non-leukocyte depleted whole blood&#xD;
             transfusion within 120 days of genetic sample collection will exclude patients from&#xD;
             the pharmacogenetic portion of the study. If a patient declines to participate in the&#xD;
             optional exploratory pharmacogenetic research, there will be no penalty or loss of&#xD;
             benefit to the patient. The patient will not be excluded from other aspects of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
