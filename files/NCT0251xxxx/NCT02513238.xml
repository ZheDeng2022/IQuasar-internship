  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of the injection of autologous&#xD;
      adipost tissue derived MSCs on radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia&#xD;
      in head and neck cancer participants. The project can potentially help to develop a&#xD;
      clinically relevant treatment option for the growing number of patients suffering from&#xD;
      xerostomia after radiotherapy. The development of new therapies is especially important,&#xD;
      since only sub-optimal symptomatic treatments are currently available and the symptom of&#xD;
      xerostomia greatly reduces the quality of life.&#xD;

      Design Randomized, controlled trial with blinding. To maintain allocation concealment all&#xD;
      participants, care givers, trial investigators and outcome assessors except the Blood Bank&#xD;
      staff will be blinded to the intervention. Staff from the Blood Bank will not have direct&#xD;
      contact with the patients (hereafter the participants) as such.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project plan For inclusion in the study participants will have their usual medical history&#xD;
      taken according to guidelines from the Ear, Nose and Throat Surgical Department, Copenhagen&#xD;
      University Hospital Rigshospitalet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo a mini lip-suction, from which MSCs will be ex vivo expanded in&#xD;
      a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-approved clean room facility (The Blood Bank, section&#xD;
      2014). When the cells arrive at the Blood Bank, participants will be randomized to either ex&#xD;
      vivo expansion of their mesenchymal stem cells or having them frozen for potential later use.&#xD;
      Expected ex vivo expansion phase is 3-4 weeks. The purification and isolation will be based&#xD;
      on a protocol previously approved for clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amount of MSCs required for injection Based on published animal studies the amount given for&#xD;
      xerostomia to mice varies from 2 x 105 to 2 x 106 [19]. To convert these mice data to a&#xD;
      realistic dose in humans we have extrapolated based on the following data: The volume density&#xD;
      of submandibular glands very closely approximates 1 (1.06-1.07 mg/mm3) [27]. In the mice&#xD;
      studies on radiotherapy the mean gland weight was approximately 350mg, which corresponds to&#xD;
      an approximate volume of 350mm3. Therefore the mouse dose pr. gland volume is approximately&#xD;
      286.000-2.860.000cells pr. cm3 gland (when calculated from either 1 x 105 to 1 x 106). The&#xD;
      volume of the submandibular gland in human subjects after radiotherapy is 6.6-7.9cm3 [28].&#xD;
      This corresponds to an approximate dose pr. patient of between 1.9 x 106 to 2.2 x 106, or 1.9&#xD;
      x 107 to 2.2 x 107 cells pr. submandibular gland. From the above assumptions and in order not&#xD;
      to give to few cells we have chosen to proceed with the maximum dose corresponding to&#xD;
      2.8*10^6 MSC/cm^3 gland, i.e. a maximum total dose per patient of approximately 4,6 * 10^7&#xD;
      MSCs. However to standardize the dose given to patients, the amount given will be&#xD;
      standardized to the size of their submandibular glands, as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection of MSCs into submandibular glands Subjects will go to the ENT-department, section&#xD;
      2073 for inpatient procedures. The surgical procedure is done under local anaesthesia using&#xD;
      ultrasonic guidance and sterile technique. After receiving the MSC-suspension or&#xD;
      placebo-suspension, the surgeon will identify the submandibular glands and inject the&#xD;
      suspension MSCs. Calculation of injected number of MSCs pr. participant rests on the&#xD;
      following calculation: , where volume is the volume of the submandibular gland, and a&#xD;
      gland-volume of app. 7-8cm3 is the norm. Therefore the amount of cells given to each&#xD;
      participant will be app. in total. Afterwards the participant will be given a band-aid and&#xD;
      over the counter analgesics. The MSCs will be suspended in Isotonic NaCl (0,9 mg/ml) and&#xD;
      Human Albumin (HA) 1% to a final volume of 2ml. Placebo will be 2ml of Isotonic NaCl&#xD;
      (0,9mg/ml) and HA 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up MRI of the recipient place will be performed after 3-4 weeks and 3-4 months&#xD;
      postoperatively. MRI is used for volume determination of salivary glands and control of&#xD;
      recipient place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3-4 months, a small biopsy is randomly taken from one of the two salivary glands. The&#xD;
      procedure takes place under local anaesthesia. Histology is determined (samples are blinded&#xD;
      to the pathologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the final MRI, biopsy and salivary function test has been performed approx. 3-4 months&#xD;
      after treatment specific study related tests and activities are concluded. To detect late&#xD;
      complications or late adverse events all study participants who received MSC-treatment are&#xD;
      invited for a check-up 1 year and 3 years after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, isolation and propagation of MSC The Blood Bank has its cell-tissue approval from the&#xD;
      Danish Health and Medicines Authority (according to the Danish Tissue Law), as well as a&#xD;
      Manufacturer's/Importer's Authorisation regarding Human Medicinal Products, the necessary&#xD;
      physical facilities, personnel and operational resources to produce MSCs in accordance with&#xD;
      good manufacturing practice (GMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MSC product will be tested for recognized surface markers (CD73, CD90, CD105,) using flow&#xD;
      cytometry, and undergo general quality checks before the final release (cell viability and&#xD;
      tests for microorganisms). With regard to the cultivation of the MSC we will use basal medium&#xD;
      supplemented with human platelet lysate from healthy blood donors instead of the former use&#xD;
      of animal-derived serum (fetal bovine serum, FBS). This has the following benefits: 1) No&#xD;
      likelihood of transfection of both known and unknown animal pathogens, or risk of&#xD;
      xeno-immunization 2) Small batch-to-batch variation and thus more consistent growth&#xD;
      performance, since each group is prepared from approx. 50 healthy donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All harvest, isolation, expansion, etc. of MSC will be in accordance with GMP regulations.&#xD;
      The Blood Bank has clean room facilities approved by the Danish Health and Medicines&#xD;
      Authority for GMP compliant cell expansion for clinical use, and all studies will be carried&#xD;
      out by specially trained personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of xerostomia and subjective treatment outcome The subjective effect of the&#xD;
      treatment is assessed by a 100 mm visual analogue scale of xerostomia filled out by the&#xD;
      patient [31] and a physician-rated questionnaire [32], both carried out before as well as&#xD;
      after treatment. Each participant will also be asked about daily symptoms of dry mouth&#xD;
      according to the UKU side-effect rating scale item 3.3 [29]. This scale includes four scores&#xD;
      where 0 denotes no feeling of dry mouth, 1 denotes a slight feeling of dry mouth, 2 denotes a&#xD;
      severe feeling of dry mouth, and 3 denotes troublesome feeling of dry mouth that makes speech&#xD;
      and eating difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of salivary flow rate and objective treatment outcome Changes in the secretion&#xD;
      rate of the unstimulated whole saliva in the oral cavity is probably the most important&#xD;
      parameter for the biological development of xerostomia and accompanying pathological oral&#xD;
      conditions. Whole saliva, e.g., the mixed secretions from the major and minor salivary glands&#xD;
      is mixed in the oral cavity. A correct determination of this value is crucial for the&#xD;
      assessment of treatment outcome in this project. For assessment of the saliva flow rate,&#xD;
      whole saliva will be collected between 9 and 12 a.m. Subjects will refrained from eating,&#xD;
      drinking, smoking and oral hygiene for 2 hr before the collection. After being seated upright&#xD;
      in a chair, they relax for 5 min and are then instructed to make as few movements as&#xD;
      possible, including swallowing, during the collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after treatment unstimulated whole saliva will be collected using the spitting&#xD;
      method [33] where participants spit their saliva into a collection container over a period of&#xD;
      15 minutes. The salivary flow rate (SFR) (ml / min) is determined as the increase in weight&#xD;
      of the container divided by the collection time in minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the collection of unstimulated saliva, the subjects are instructed to chew on 1 g of&#xD;
      sterile paraffin wax. They will be asked to keep their mouths closed during chewing and to&#xD;
      avoid swallowing. Every 60 sec they will be asked to spit into a new saliva collector before&#xD;
      starting a new chewing period. This will be repeated for 5 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess treatment outcome of the submandibular glands, saliva is also collected directly&#xD;
      from the floor of the mouth in an unstimulated and stimulated state. The unstimulated whole&#xD;
      saliva flow rate of the submandibular glands will be assessed by the swab method with cotton&#xD;
      rolls placed buccally in each maxillary molar region and under the tongue on the floor of the&#xD;
      mouth. Immediately prior to the start of collection they will be asked to swallow, in case&#xD;
      this is not possible saliva will be extracted by a pipette. Collection takes place during two&#xD;
      subsequent periods of 3 min and, at the end of each period, the chin and lips will be wiped&#xD;
      with a napkin. Saliva flow rates are determined by weight (1 g equals 1 ml of saliva) with&#xD;
      rolls and napkins weighed before collection and reweighed after. The flow rates is calculated&#xD;
      as the increment in weight during collection and expressed as millilitres per minute. Saliva&#xD;
      from the cotton rolls will be extracted by centrifugation (1500g) and analyzed for its&#xD;
      composition. This stimulated collection process will be performed afterwards with&#xD;
      citrus-containing rolls to stimulate the submandibular glands maximally. From each of these&#xD;
      collections of saliva, saliva will be aliquoted and stored at -800C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical analysis of saliva Whole saliva contains a large number of bacteria and epithelial&#xD;
      cells, as well as gingival crevicular fluid. Therefore, whole saliva is normally not suited&#xD;
      for the analysis of sensitive chemical parameters. For this purpose, the selectively&#xD;
      collected saliva from individual glands is much better. As a result, the majority of analyzes&#xD;
      can be performed from either the parotid and submandibular gland / sublingualis saliva. The&#xD;
      following analyzes will be performed on the collected saliva: pH and bicarbonate by ionic&#xD;
      balance estimation [34], sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, chloride and fluoride [35],&#xD;
      total protein and selected proteins [36] and amylase [37]. The purpose of the studies is to&#xD;
      evaluate whether saliva will be normalized after treatment, and thus provide an estimate of&#xD;
      the saliva dental and mucosal protective capacity before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and analysis Source data: There will be source documentation for all data in&#xD;
      Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study director allows direct access to study data and study documents for the monitoring,&#xD;
      audit and inspection of the Science Ethics Committee, the Danish Health and Medicines&#xD;
      Authority or similar authorities in other countries. Permission will be sought from the DPA&#xD;
      for the processing of personal data under the Danish Data Protection Act. Applications will&#xD;
      be sent via the legal secretariat, Rigshospitalet.&#xD;
