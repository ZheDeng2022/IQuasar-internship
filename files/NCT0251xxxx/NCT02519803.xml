      Title: A Prospective Household observational cohort study of Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial&#xD;
      virus and other respiratory pathogens community burden and Transmission dynamics in South&#xD;
      Africa (The PHIRST Study) This study will improve understanding of the community burden of&#xD;
      influenza, RSV, pertussis, tuberculosis and pneumococcal infection in South Africa. It will&#xD;
      also provide data on the carriage prevalence of meningococcus and diphtheria. The data&#xD;
      generated from this study will also provide important information on the transmission&#xD;
      dynamics of influenza, RSV, pertussis and pneumococcus in the community allowing to better&#xD;
      strategize interventions (including targeted vaccination strategies) and evaluate their&#xD;
      potential impact. Moreover, there is an absence of prospective data on tuberculosis infection&#xD;
      from high tuberculosis burden countries. The data generated will both inform modelling of&#xD;
      transmission, sample size for prevention studies and surveillance assessing the impact of the&#xD;
      National Tuberculosis Control Program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Information on the community burden of influenza is essential to inform control,&#xD;
      but is not routinely collected. For example, influenza transmission models, which are widely&#xD;
      used to inform the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of vaccines, antivirals and&#xD;
      non-pharmaceutical countermeasures, depend on valid epidemiological estimates of the&#xD;
      community occurrence and transmission of disease. While community level studies such as the&#xD;
      Flu Watch cohort study in the United Kingdom have been implemented in recent years in&#xD;
      high-income countries, the community burden of influenza remains largely unknown in lower-&#xD;
      and middle-income countries, especially in Africa where the burden of influenza may be&#xD;
      higher. In addition, no data exist on the household transmission dynamics of influenza&#xD;
      viruses. Such data could provide important insight to inform targeted interventions, for&#xD;
      instance, how to maximize indirect effects of influenza vaccination to protect more&#xD;
      vulnerable groups for which the available influenza vaccines are currently not licensed or&#xD;
      the efficacy is low (e.g. children &lt;2 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of childhood acute lower respiratory&#xD;
      tract infection, especially among infants &lt;3 months of age. While a RSV vaccine is currently&#xD;
      not available, the efficacy of promising RSV candidate vaccines is being evaluated.&#xD;
      Alternative strategies for RSV vaccination have been proposed, including vaccination of older&#xD;
      age groups to indirectly protect vulnerable infants by reducing circulation of virus in the&#xD;
      population or preventing chains of transmission to the infant. Nonetheless, to evaluate these&#xD;
      effects knowledge of the RSV burden, transmission dynamics and source of infection for&#xD;
      infants in the community is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumococcus is the leading bacterial cause of pneumonia. The pneumcoccal conjugate vaccine&#xD;
      (PCV) was introduced into the expanded programme on immunisation in 2009. Data on carriage&#xD;
      prevalence, dynamics of carriage and interaction with other respiratory pathogens will be&#xD;
      helpful to guide interventions to target pneumococcal disease not prevented by vaccination.&#xD;
      Both diphtheria and pertussis have been identified as emerging pathogens in South Africa in&#xD;
      recent years, giving rise to outbreaks in 2014 and 2015 after years of low prevalence.&#xD;
      Meningococcus is an epidemic-prone disease causing cyclical outbreaks in South Africa but&#xD;
      little is known about the carriage prevalence in South Africa. Annual incidence of&#xD;
      tuberculosis in Southern Africa is the highest globally, with Swaziland, Lesotho and South&#xD;
      Africa have the highest rates of tuberculosis in the world. Moreover, in South Africa&#xD;
      tuberculosis is the leading cause of death on death notification forms and, in HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals (both not yet receiving antiretrovirals and whilst taking antiretrovirals), is&#xD;
      the leading serious opportunistic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the carriage prevalence and/or transmission dynamics of these pathogens are important&#xD;
      to guide control measures, including targeted vaccination strategies. Prevention efforts to&#xD;
      limit transmission in households are often recommended but data on household transmission and&#xD;
      the impact of HIV infection are limited to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the community burden of influenza and RSV, including: (i) the incidence of&#xD;
           influenza and RSV infection in the community; (ii) the symptomatic fraction associated&#xD;
           with influenza and RSV infection; (iii) the severity associated with symptomatic&#xD;
           infections; and (iv) the fraction of individuals with symptomatic infection seeking&#xD;
           medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the transmission dynamics of influenza and RSV infections in the community,&#xD;
           including: (i) the estimation of the household secondary infection risk (SIR), serial&#xD;
           interval and length of shedding; (ii) the estimation of transmission of infection&#xD;
           between age groups within the household and possibly the community; and (iii) the&#xD;
           estimation of the effective reproductive number (Rt) and its variation over time in the&#xD;
           community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary (selected)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the symptomatic fraction, the severity associated with symptomatic&#xD;
           infections and the fraction of individuals with symptomatic infection seeking medical&#xD;
           care among influenza or RSV positive cases by HIV serostatus and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the SIR and length of shedding of influenza and RSV among HIV-infected and&#xD;
           HIV-uninfected index cases and the rate of acquisition of influenza and RSV infection&#xD;
           among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected household members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the role of asymptomatic infections in the household transmission of influenza&#xD;
           and RSV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the heterogeneity of influenza and RSV virus strains within household clusters&#xD;
           and describe viral evolution within and between households as well as the association&#xD;
           between virus strains and the duration of virus shedding and HIV status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe and compare nasopharyngeal pneumococcal loads in healthy individuals by age&#xD;
           and over time, and how the loads may be altered by respiratory viral infection,&#xD;
           HIV-status and vaccination-status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the prevalence and duration of B. pertussis colonization within the&#xD;
           community by age group, vaccine status and over time, the transmission dynamics within a&#xD;
           household, and the proportion of individuals that develop symptomatic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the prevalence of N. meningitidis and C. diphtheria colonization within the&#xD;
           community by age group at a single point in time each year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the annual incidence of tuberculosis infection in individuals living in study&#xD;
           households and assess risk factors (including incident and prevalent HIV) for acquiring&#xD;
           tuberculosis infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ascertain the impact of housing quality, fuel use and indoor air quality and selected&#xD;
           measures of ventilation on tuberculosis infection and on household transmission of&#xD;
           respiratory viruses and bacteria Methods: We will conduct a household-level community&#xD;
           cohort study in a rural community in Mpumalanga Province where health and demographic&#xD;
           surveillance (HDSS) is conducted (the Agincourt HDSS surveillance site) and selected&#xD;
           urban areas in the Matlosana Muncipality in North West Province. Prospective,&#xD;
           hospital-based surveillance for influenza- and RSV-associated severe acute respiratory&#xD;
           illness has been conducted at these sites since 2010. The prospective cohort study will&#xD;
           be conducted for 3 consecutive years, from 2016-2018, to include 3 consecutive RSV and&#xD;
           influenza seasons. Approximately one hundred households (50 households per site, with an&#xD;
           expected average number of household members of 5 to recruit a total of 500 enrolled&#xD;
           individuals) will be randomly selected within the study population each year and&#xD;
           consented to participate to the study. For each household member, serum will be&#xD;
           collected quarterly (January-February, April-May, September-October and&#xD;
           November-December) including before and after the RSV (February to May) and influenza&#xD;
           (May to September) seasons and a final blood draw at the end of the year. The&#xD;
           demographic characteristics of the household members will be collected on enrollment.&#xD;
           Starting before the RSV and influenza seasons, upper respiratory tract samples will be&#xD;
           collected twice-a-week by trained study nurses from all household members irrespective&#xD;
           of the presence of respiratory symptoms throughout the year. During each visit the&#xD;
           development of symptoms (using a severity score) and healthcare seeking behavior of&#xD;
           symptomatic cases will be recorded. In addition, during winter at one household visit,&#xD;
           an oropharyngeal swab will be collected from each individual for testing for&#xD;
           meningococcus and diphtheria. Nasopharyngeal samples will be tested for the detection of&#xD;
           RSV or influenza virus and pneumococcus and B. pertussis infection by real-time&#xD;
           reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). Blood samples will be tested&#xD;
           for rise in RSV, influenza and pertussis antibody titers. From consenting patients,&#xD;
           blood samples will be tested for HIV infection. For tuberculosis infection, we will do a&#xD;
           tuberculin skin test (TST) at baseline and the end of the first year and annually&#xD;
           thereafter in people are found to be TST negative at their previous test. HIV testing&#xD;
           will be offered to all participants at baseline and then six monthly thereafter. All&#xD;
           participants will have a sputum sample taken for culture at baseline and thereafter&#xD;
           symptom screened for symptoms of tuberculosis monthly, and investigated with Xpert&#xD;
           Mtuberculosis/Rif if symptoms of tuberculosis are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of approximately 1500 individuals over 3 consecutive seasons will allow the&#xD;
      estimation of 20% risk of infection and a 10% risk of illness with 95% CI and 5% desired&#xD;
      absolute precision in the community. Individuals in the households enrolled in the first and&#xD;
      second year of the study will be have a single follow-up visit towards the end of the 2nd and&#xD;
      3rd year of the study (October). At this visit a blood specimen for testing for HIV&#xD;
      infection, influenza and RSV serology will be collected and TST testing for individuals found&#xD;
      to be TST negative at the previous test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: This study will improve understanding of the community burden of influenza, RSV,&#xD;
      pertussis, tuberculosis and pneumococcal infection in South Africa. It will also provide data&#xD;
      on the carriage prevalence of meningococcus and diphtheria. The data generated from this&#xD;
      study will also provide important information on the transmission dynamics of influenza, RSV,&#xD;
      pertussis and pneumococcus in the community allowing to better strategize interventions&#xD;
      (including targeted vaccination strategies) and evaluate their potential impact. Moreover,&#xD;
      there is an absence of prospective data on tuberculosis infection from high tuberculosis&#xD;
      burden countries. The data generated will both inform modelling of transmission, sample size&#xD;
      for prevention studies and surveillance assessing the impact of the National Tuberculosis&#xD;
      Control Program.&#xD;
