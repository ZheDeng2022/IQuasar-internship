    <textblock>
      A randomized, double blind, active controlled study in approximately 40 opioid dependent&#xD;
      subjects. The study includes a Screening period of up to 3 days and a 2-day, double blind&#xD;
      induction phase (subjects confined to the clinic). Screening and the first day of treatment&#xD;
      (Day 1) may occur on the same day or Screening may occur up to 3 days prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid dependent subjects who provide informed consent at the Screening visit; have a&#xD;
      Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) total score ≥12; and meet other entry criteria are&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment into the study. Subjects will be confined to the clinic beginning on&#xD;
      Day 1 (optional confinement on Day -1) and will remain there for up to 48 hours after&#xD;
      administration of the first study drug dose.&#xD;
