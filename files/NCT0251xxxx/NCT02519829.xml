    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty will be randomized to receive either monocryl&#xD;
      closure of fascial and dermal layers with dermabond and tegaderm covering versus standard&#xD;
      vicryl closure of fascia layer and staple closure for skin. Short term wound complications,&#xD;
      pain and patient and surgeon-rated cosmetic scar appearance will be measured. The&#xD;
      investigators will also measure operating room time and costs associated with dressing&#xD;
      changes and wound-related procedures (e.g. staple removal).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wound closure has always been based on surgeon preference and type of closure. Skin closure&#xD;
      is considered the most important part of the surgical procedure by some since it is often the&#xD;
      only visible evidence of the surgical procedure. In fact, conclusions about the success of&#xD;
      the surgery are often based on the appearance of the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been a few studies in a variety of surgical journals that have looked at the two&#xD;
      pertinent methods of closure with the majority coming from obstetrical journals comparing&#xD;
      caesarian section closure with staples versus a subcuticular monocryl suture. For the most&#xD;
      part, although patient satisfaction is quite high initially for a subcuticular closure, at&#xD;
      long term follow-up patient satisfaction scores are quite similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery recommended that staple closure&#xD;
      was more beneficial for skin closure than monocryl sutures for total hip and knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty. Their recommendations were based on an overall shorter operative time when&#xD;
      using staple closure compared to monocryl sutures. They also found that final patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and complication rates were relatively similar 3 months postoperatively. This&#xD;
      group published an earlier paper as well describing the use of glue for closure and did&#xD;
      report an decrease in overall drainage rates when they analyzed their data for subcuticular&#xD;
      sutures as opposed to staples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more recent study evaluated wound appearance at 3 months using a surgeon -rated visual&#xD;
      analogue scale to compared the use of adhesive tapes versus staples for skin closure&#xD;
      following total hip arthroplasty. Again, no significant difference in patient satisfaction&#xD;
      scores were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is a paucity of well-powered studies to compare outcomes in patients whose&#xD;
      wounds are closed using the usual staple methods compared to a monocryl suture method. In&#xD;
      addition, outcomes have focused on surgeon-ratings and not patient ratings. The proposal for&#xD;
      this study is to compare overall patient and surgeon-rated cosmetic scar appearance and&#xD;
      complications following total hip replacement with skin closure for using monocryl suture&#xD;
      versus staples. This study would use a more recent, validated assessment tool than the VAS&#xD;
      scale. The assessment is called the Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS ) and it&#xD;
      incorporates six essential features about the wound such as colour, malleability, etc. The&#xD;
      form is split so that the surgeon rating carries the same weight in the final score as the&#xD;
      patient assessment of their own scar. This scale gives a nice balance for determining overall&#xD;
      satisfaction and wound healing combining surgeon and patient scores.&#xD;
