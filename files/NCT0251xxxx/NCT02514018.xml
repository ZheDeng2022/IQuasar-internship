  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The re-activating nature of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) may allow life long boosting when&#xD;
      used as a vaccine vector in conjunction with HIV to generate durable immunity systemically&#xD;
      and at the mucosa. This study aims to characterize mucosal immunity before and after&#xD;
      vaccination with a commercial live-attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine with respect to&#xD;
      immune activation state, mucosal homing properties and VZV-specific effector immune responses&#xD;
      in healthy women at low risk for HIV acquisition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An ideal HIV vaccine should be able to induce an effector specific immune response at the&#xD;
      mucosal site which serves as the portal of HIV entry. The use of a persistent replicating&#xD;
      viral vector such as Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) has great potential to assemble this&#xD;
      specific response. Live-attenuated varicella-zoster virus has been used as a vaccine&#xD;
      worldwide for over 25 years and has a well-described safety profile. However, its&#xD;
      immunogenicity data in the African population are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of this study will be to measure the magnitude and kinetics of the&#xD;
      effector immune response and immune activation induced by live-attenuated varicella-zoster&#xD;
      virus vaccine in a population of Kenyan women. Specifically, the study will measure immune&#xD;
      activation in both cervical and rectal mucosae in the context of VZV-effector responses after&#xD;
      vaccination and compare the observed immune activation in mucosal tissues and in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 44 healthy women in Nairobi, aged 18-50 years will be recruited into the study,&#xD;
      after obtaining their written informed consent. Eligibility to participate in the study will&#xD;
      depend on results of laboratory tests, review of medical history, physical examination and&#xD;
      answers to questions about HIV risk behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess immune responses to both immediate and delayed administration of&#xD;
      live-attenuated virus varicella-zoster vaccine in VZV-seropositive individuals. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly divided into 2 groups. Group 1 will receive a single dose of the vaccine at&#xD;
      day 0 and Group 2 at day 84. The participants will be followed for a period of 9-12 months&#xD;
      after receiving the vaccine.&#xD;
