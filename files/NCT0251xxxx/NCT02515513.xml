  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between myopenia, nutritional status, and long-term oncologic outcomes&#xD;
      remains poorly characterized in patients with anatomically resectable pancreatic cancer (PC).&#xD;
      The investigators want to look at muscle properties in pancreatic cancer patients to&#xD;
      determine possible therapeutic options toward better nutritional status. Patients with benign&#xD;
      right upper quadrant pathology will be utilized as controls for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesize that improving cancer cachexia in PC will improve the quality of&#xD;
      life and ultimately increase overall survival. The long term goal of is to identify areas of&#xD;
      intervention to prevent and/or improve cachectic events in PC in order to significantly&#xD;
      improve clinical outcomes. The first step in this long term goal is to fully characterize&#xD;
      cachexia in the condition of PC. This research is to understand and modify the local response&#xD;
      within skeletal muscle leading to a clinically relevant persistent wasting and to understand&#xD;
      and interrupt the systemic stimulus produced by the tumor local environment resulting in&#xD;
      these muscle specific mechanisms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer cachexia (CC) is a devastating condition affecting up to 80% of cancer patients,&#xD;
      diminishing quality of life and contributing to increased mortality. Cancer cachexia is a&#xD;
      complex metabolic syndrome characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle mass and weakness.&#xD;
      The muscle pathology of cancer cachexia is not only related to muscle atrophy but also to&#xD;
      disruptions to the contractile apparatus of the muscle. While physiologic disruptions in&#xD;
      muscle sarcomere and myofiber membrane integrity have been observed despite the lack of&#xD;
      injury, the totality of the muscle specific mechanisms contributing to these phenotypes have&#xD;
      not been described, nor investigated in the context of pancreatic cancer (PC) where cachexia&#xD;
      is a significant clinical problem. Therefore, delineating specific mechanisms of muscle&#xD;
      catabolism in PC is critical to developing clinical therapies to control wasting and improve&#xD;
      patient quality of life, clinical outcomes and long-term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of tumor promoting and inflammatory cell signaling pathways have been implicated in&#xD;
      cancer cachexia, whereby pro-inflammatory cytokines have been implicated as a driving force.&#xD;
      Remarkably, approximately half of all patients with PC demonstrate a measurable acute phase&#xD;
      response, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Importantly, systemic elevations&#xD;
      of these inflammatory mediators are due to a complex local interplay between the developing&#xD;
      tumor and the immune system which subsequently leads to a systemic chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      state. PC appears to manipulate the immune system to promote its survival at the expense of&#xD;
      nutritional stores which results in cachexia. Therefore, understanding of the local and&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response in PC and its relation to muscle specific mechanisms is&#xD;
      crucial to developing effective therapies for cancer cachexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PC associated cachexia results in a significant therapeutic dilemma. Local approaches such as&#xD;
      surgery for curative intent encounter a high recurrence rate which is indicative of the&#xD;
      systemic nature of even very early-stage disease. Therefore, systemic therapies are necessary&#xD;
      for long-term survival. Unfortunately, effective chemotherapies are only offered to patients&#xD;
      with good clinical parameters such as nutritional status. In other words, if the patient is&#xD;
      too weak, they are not offered effective therapies for the risk of causing more harm than&#xD;
      good.&#xD;
