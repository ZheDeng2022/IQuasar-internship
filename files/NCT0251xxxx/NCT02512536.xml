    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff arthropathy is a cause of shoulder arthritis which is a common condition seen&#xD;
      both in primary and secondary care. It is a painful condition, with significant disability.&#xD;
      Specialist shoulder replacements have found acceptance within the trust, nationally and&#xD;
      internationally although there are high complication rates. There is however a significant&#xD;
      cost difference (fifty fold) between a reverse total shoulder replacement and a botox&#xD;
      injection, and to date there have been no randomised control trials, or any registered,&#xD;
      comparing the use of a botox injection for pain relief in cuff arthropathy versus no&#xD;
      treatment. If there is a significant clinical difference in the pain outcomes between the&#xD;
      two, this could result in significant savings to the NHS and the taxpayer as a whole. If high&#xD;
      levels of pain relief could be predictably obtained using Botulinum A toxin injections then&#xD;
      potentially patients could avoid the need for surgery.&#xD;

      Null Hypothesis This is a pilot / feasability study. The null hypothesis is that there is no&#xD;
      effect on the pain or oxford shoulder scores reported by patients receiving a targeted&#xD;
      botulinum A toxin injection in the presence of cuff arthropathy at 6 weeks, 3 months or 6&#xD;
      months compared with the baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The aim of this feasability study is to provide the necessary information for the&#xD;
      planning of a future trial. It will test the feasibility of running such a trial and provide&#xD;
      estimates of the differences in outcome measures and information on resource data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants for this study will be identified by an Orthopaedic Shoulder&#xD;
      Consultant in the shoulder clinics run at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Trust. The patients&#xD;
      will be screened for eligibility by a research associate (SG). The eligibility criteria will&#xD;
      be that the patient is medically fit for an operation, and has painful rotator cuff&#xD;
      arthropathy, that is deemed suitable for intervention by the consultant surgeon. The patients&#xD;
      will be informed verbally and in writing about the trial by the research associate and&#xD;
      informed consent will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating patients will be allocated to an USS guided botox injection. All patients&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires prior to the injection: the Oxford&#xD;
      Shoulder Score (OSS), a Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and the EQ-5D. The range of movement of&#xD;
      the shoulder joint will be documented in the usual fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injections will all be done by Dr Anaspure (Consultant Radiologist) under USS guidance in&#xD;
      a standard manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the injection, patients will be reviewed using the range of movement, OSS, a patient&#xD;
      satisfaction score and EQ-5D at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post injection. A record will&#xD;
      be kept of any complications associated with the treatment. This data will be collected by&#xD;
      the research associate, who is independent of either intervention.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion criteria The only eligibility criterion for participation in this study is&#xD;
             that the patient is medically fit for an operation and diagnosed with symptomatic&#xD;
             rotator cuff arthropathy. They must be able to give informed consent and have evidence&#xD;
             of cuff arthropathy on plain radiographs of the affected shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria Contra-indications to surgery (defined as severe cardiac&#xD;
             impairment, e.g. heart or valve replacement, arrhythmia, previous myocardial&#xD;
             infarction; severe respiratory impairment, e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
             asthma that has required hospital admission; any other systemic medical condition that&#xD;
             would produce a specific contraindication to a general anaesthetic).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence that the patient would be unable to adhere to trial procedures or complete&#xD;
        questionnaires, such as dementia or intravenous drug abuse Note: If a recruited patient&#xD;
        requires a contra-lateral shoulder botox injection during the trial period, this second&#xD;
        shoulder cannot be included in the study since the result of this intervention would not be&#xD;
        independent from the first intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other exclusion criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous fractures or dislocations of the shoulder. Previous surgery on the affected&#xD;
        shoulder. Any neurological or medical condition resulting in spasticity&#xD;
