  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a high dose of DHA begun prior to and continued&#xD;
      during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given prior to surgery) is likely to prevent&#xD;
      or lessen chemotherapy induced cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is often associated with problems of cognitive functioning such as decision&#xD;
      making, learning, and memory. These symptoms, collectively referred to here as cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction can appear as early as the first few months after starting chemotherapy and may&#xD;
      persist long after chemotherapy and anti-hormone therapy, if any, is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once developed there is no satisfactory treatment for cognitive dysfunction although&#xD;
      cognitive retraining and exercise may improve symptoms and/or function; at least for some.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omega-3 fatty acids derived from ocean fish are a new potential preventative treatment&#xD;
      against development of cognitive problems which can arise in some individuals during&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment. In doses of 1-2 grams per day it has been found to improve some&#xD;
      aspects of cognitive function in healthy adults who have low DHA dietary intake. It has also&#xD;
      been shown to improve some aspects of function in individuals with a mild reduction in&#xD;
      cognitive ability but not for those with marked impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last about 12 months. Participants will make visits to the&#xD;
      study site for both standard of care visits and additional study-related visits. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized (randomly assigned; like flipping a coin) to one of two groups. Neither&#xD;
      the Investigator nor the participant will know the assigned treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Ability-General Concerns Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change measured using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-General Concerns). There are a total of 34 questions. Each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five (never to very often). The total score is based on the sum of the responses, multiplied by the number of questions and then divided by the number of questions that were answered.</description>
