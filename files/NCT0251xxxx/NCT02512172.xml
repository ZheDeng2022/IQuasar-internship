    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the safety and effectiveness of the combination of&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) romidepsin and/or oral CC - 486 with IV MK-3475 in people with&#xD;
      microsatellite stable advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of CC - 486 in this research study is investigational. The word &quot;investigational&quot;&#xD;
      means that the oral form of CC - 486 is not approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA). Oral CC - 486 has only been given to a very small number of people so&#xD;
      far, and this combination has never before been given together to people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Romidepsin has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (blood&#xD;
      cancer). It is not approved by the FDA for use in other cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MK-3475 is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that the immune system uses to fight&#xD;
      infection. Researchers have designed MK-3475 to block PD-1. PD-1 is a molecule that can shut&#xD;
      down an immune response to infection or a cancer cell. An antibody to PD-1 can stop it from&#xD;
      turning off an immune response and may be able to boost the immune system against the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with advanced colorectal tumors that are microsatellite stable (MSS) may join this&#xD;
      study. Tumors that are MSS positive are not deficient in repair of DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study that will look at different ways of making MSS colorectal tumors&#xD;
      sensitive to MK-3475 by giving 14 or 21 days of an epigenetic agent (oral CC - 486 and/or&#xD;
      romidepsin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like drawing numbers from a hat) to one of&#xD;
      three study drug combinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Oral CC - 486 taken daily for 21 days (and later shortened to 14 days if there are side&#xD;
      effects) and IV MK-3475 given every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. IV romidepsin given once weekly for 3 weeks and IV MK-3475 given every 2 weeks C. Oral CC&#xD;
      - 486 taken daily for 21 days (and later shortened to 14 days if there side effects) and IV&#xD;
      romidepsin given every 2 weeks and IV MK-3475 given every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each arm is repeated every 28 days and will continue until the point that the study drug are&#xD;
      no longer working. It will not be possible to cross over onto another arm if a participant's&#xD;
      disease does not respond to the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study investigators are looking for the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What effects, good and/or bad, the combination of oral CC - 486 and/or romidepsin in&#xD;
           combination with MK-3475 has on participants' cancer; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the genetic and chemical make-up of participants' blood and tumor cells play a role&#xD;
           in a response to oral CC - 486 and/or romidepsin in combination with MK-3475.&#xD;

    <description>irPFS rate is defined as the percentage of patients with disease progression (irPD or relapse from irCR as assessed using irRC criteria) or death due to any cause at 20 weeks. Per irRC criteria, Complete Response (irCR) is the disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (irPR) is a decrease in tumor burden by 50% or greater by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation, Stable Disease (irSD) is the failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR (in absence of irPD), Progressive Disease (irPD) is at least 25% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be measured from date of first dose until death or end of followup (OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at the time of analysis). Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve.</description>
