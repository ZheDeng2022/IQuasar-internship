  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI&#xD;
      836909 administered by continuous i.v. infusion in patients with relapsed and/or refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. If the MTD is not reached based on safety findings, a recommended dose for&#xD;
      further development will be determined. This will depend on the safety data,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics data and potentially preliminary efficacy data. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to document the safety and tolerability of BI 836909, to perform&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses and to evaluate relevant biological effects in&#xD;
      terms of parameters of efficacy.&#xD;

    <measure>The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BI 836909</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1, up to 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI 836909, which was defined as the highest dose of the dose level tested where ≤1 patient out of 6 developed a Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The MTD was defined based on DLTs observed during Cycle 1. However, all Adverse Events corresponding to the definition of a DLT (see below) were to be considered for confirming the MTD. A DLT was defined as any drug-related non-haematological Adverse Event of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 Grade 3 or higher.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With an Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>On-treatment: From start of treatment till end of trial (EOT) visit, up to 61 weeks. Extended follow-up: From start of treatment till the last extended follow-up visit which was scheduled at 12 months after end of treatment, up to 113 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Objective responses: Stringent complete response (sCR): CR + normal Free light chain (FLC) ratio and no clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. CR: negative immunofixation on serum and urine, disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas, and &lt;5% plasma cells in bone marrow. Very good partial response (VGPR): serum and urine M protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or &gt;90% reduction in serum M protein plus urine M protein level &lt;100 mg/24h. PR: &gt;50% reduction of serum and 24 h urinary M protein by &gt;90% or to &lt;200mg/24h. If unmeasurable, a &gt;50% decrease in difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels instead of M protein criteria. if FLC assay was not measurable, a &gt;50% reduction in plasma cells was required instead of M protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell was &gt;30%. In addition to the listed criteria, a &gt;50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas was also required, if present at baseline.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was an open-label, non-randomised, phase I, dose escalation trial in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The first 4 dose levels (0.2, 0.4,0.8, and 1.6 Microgram Per Day (μg/d)) were tested in single patient cohorts. Dose levels ≥3.2 μg/d (3.2, 6.5, 13, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 μg/d) were to be tested in a 3+3 design. Once the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined, up to 6 additional patients were to be treated at the MTD or at the recommended dose.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Subjects attended a specialist site which ensured that they (the subjects) strictly met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Subjects were not to be allocated to a treatment group if any of the entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>

BI 836909 was administered as 4-week continuous intravenous infusion (c.i.v.) followed by a 2-week treatment break for 5 cycles or until progression, unacceptable adverse events, or any other reason necessitating withdrawal. In case of ongoing clinical benefit and if considered indicated by the investigator, 5 additional treatment cycles could be done, leading to a maximum of 10 cycles.</description>

        <description>The Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI 836909, which was defined as the highest dose of the dose level tested where ≤1 patient out of 6 developed a Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The MTD was defined based on DLTs observed during Cycle 1. However, all Adverse Events corresponding to the definition of a DLT (see below) were to be considered for confirming the MTD. A DLT was defined as any drug-related non-haematological Adverse Event of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 Grade 3 or higher.</description>

            <description>BI 836909 was administered as 4-week continuous intravenous infusion (c.i.v.) followed by a 2-week treatment break for 5 cycles or until progression, unacceptable Adverse Events, or any other reason necessitating withdrawal. In case of ongoing clinical benefit and if considered indicated by the investigator, 5 additional treatment cycles could be done, leading to a maximum of 10 cycles. The first 4 dose levels (0.2, 0.4,0.8, and 1.6 Microgram Per Day (μg/d)) were tested in single patient cohorts. Dose levels ≥3.2 μg/d (3.2, 6.5, 13, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 μg/d) were tested in a 3+3 design.</description>

        <description>Objective responses: Stringent complete response (sCR): CR + normal Free light chain (FLC) ratio and no clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. CR: negative immunofixation on serum and urine, disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas, and &lt;5% plasma cells in bone marrow. Very good partial response (VGPR): serum and urine M protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or &gt;90% reduction in serum M protein plus urine M protein level &lt;100 mg/24h. PR: &gt;50% reduction of serum and 24 h urinary M protein by &gt;90% or to &lt;200mg/24h. If unmeasurable, a &gt;50% decrease in difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels instead of M protein criteria. if FLC assay was not measurable, a &gt;50% reduction in plasma cells was required instead of M protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell was &gt;30%.

        <description>PFS was defined as time from first treatment with BI 836909 till disease progression or death. Progression was defined according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG 2006) response criteria as an increase &gt;25% from lowest response value in any of the following parameters: -Serum M protein (absolute increase had to be &gt;0.5 gram/ deciliters (dL)) -Urine M protein (absolute increase had to be &gt;200 milligram (mg)/24 hour) -Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M protein levels The difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. Absolute increase had to be &gt;10 mg/dL -Bone marrow plasma cell percentage; absolute percentage had to be &gt;10% -Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas -Development of hypercalcaemia (corrected serum calcium &gt;11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 Millimole/Liter) that was attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder.</description>

Progression was defined according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG 2006) response criteria as an increase &gt;25% from lowest response value in any of the following parameters: -Serum M protein (absolute increase had to be &gt;0.5 gram/ deciliters (dL)) -Urine M protein (absolute increase had to be &gt;200 milligram (mg)/24 hour) -Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M protein levels The difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. Absolute increase had to be &gt;10 mg/dL -Bone marrow plasma cell percentage; absolute percentage had to be &gt;10% -Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas -Development of hypercalcaemia (corrected serum calcium &gt;11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 Millimole/Liter) that was attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder.</description>
