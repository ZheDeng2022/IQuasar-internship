  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to evaluate the impact of a paraprofessional-delivered,&#xD;
      culturally adapted, evidence-based intervention (EBI) on sexually transmitted disease (STD),&#xD;
      substance use and poor mental/emotional health among American Indians (AI) through a&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). These intertwining risks have produced marked disparities&#xD;
      and have unique cultural and social determinants in Native communities. If aims are achieved,&#xD;
      scientific knowledge and community-based practice will be advanced in areas vital to AI&#xD;
      communities, and to STD and drug prevention science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this study, the investigators applied findings from research protocol (IRB#00005929)&#xD;
      and adapted a brief intervention to reduce risk and increase protective behaviors for STDs,&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS, substance use and poor mental/emotional health, and to promote STD screening. The&#xD;
      specific aim of the current study is to compare the efficacy of the adapted brief&#xD;
      intervention vs. a comparison condition on participants' condom use, STD screening and&#xD;
      treatment-seeking behaviors, substance use and emotional/mental health outcomes at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months post-intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      STDs including Neisseria gonorrhea, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis, are an&#xD;
      urgent problem in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities due to a constellation of&#xD;
      risk and contextual factors affecting tribal populations. Geographic isolation and cultural&#xD;
      and social stigmatization contribute to poor access to screening, counseling and education,&#xD;
      and diminished opportunities for early identification of STDs. Evidence-based prevention, STD&#xD;
      screening and early identification are the best public health strategies to address a&#xD;
      potential epidemic among AI/ANs. However, there is currently a paucity of such strategies&#xD;
      that have been demonstrated in AI/AN populations. An intervention targeting STD screening and&#xD;
      related risk reduction behaviors has the potential to circumvent the continuous transference&#xD;
      of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating Community: The Fort Apache Reservation is home to ~17,000 White Mountain Apache&#xD;
      tribal members, with almost half &lt;20 years of age. The reservation encompasses 1.7 million&#xD;
      acres along northeastern Arizona. The Tribe endures notable demographic and environmental&#xD;
      challenges that impact behavioral risks among community members: 61% of the population &gt;16&#xD;
      years old are either &quot;Not in Labor Force&quot; or unemployed. 47% of Apaches aged â‰¥25 have not&#xD;
      received a high school diploma. The median household income is $26,973 and 47% of the&#xD;
      population lives below the federal poverty line. Over half (53%)(1) of all Apache households&#xD;
      are led by single mothers;(2) 75% of children are born to unwed mothers.(3) These factors&#xD;
      contribute to high rates of school drop-out, substance use, high-risk sexual behavior and&#xD;
      poor mental and emotional health in the void of effective interventions. Despite these&#xD;
      challenges, the Apache community has successfully demonstrated the ability to adapt and&#xD;
      implement effective paraprofessional-administered interventions.(4,5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiology of STD and Related Risk Behaviors: Recently, STD rates have increased throughout&#xD;
      Arizona, and the state's AI population bears a disproportionately high burden of new&#xD;
      infections.(6) In 2011, the chlamydia rate among AIs in Arizona was 6 times the rate for&#xD;
      non-Hispanic Whites.(6) The rate of gonorrhea among AIs in Arizona tripled between 2009 and&#xD;
      2011, a rise largely attributed to &quot;outbreaks in tribal areas in the northeastern quadrant of&#xD;
      Arizona.&quot;(6) In 2011-2012, the chlamydia rate among Apaches was 2,116/100,000 for all ages,&#xD;
      nearly 5 times both Arizona and national all-ages rates. The Apache gonorrhea rate was&#xD;
      749/100,000 for all ages in 2011-2012, approximately 7 and 10 times higher than national and&#xD;
      Arizona all-ages rates, respectively. Previous studies indicate that among all races and&#xD;
      ethnicities AI/ANs have some of the highest rates of inconsistent condom use, multiple sex&#xD;
      partners and early sexual initiation.(7-10) The intersection of several behavioral risks such&#xD;
      as poor mental health, drug use and binge alcohol use has shown to increase STD risk&#xD;
      behaviors. A study conducted with Apache teens with recent suicidal behavior revealed high&#xD;
      rates of lifetime drug use: 92% for alcohol, 88% for marijuana, 38% for crack/cocaine, and&#xD;
      35% for methamphetamines, which is 3 times that of all AI/AN adolescents in 2009.&#xD;
      Highlighting the intersection of risk, 48% of those that were sexually active had ever used&#xD;
      cocaine compared with 17% of those not sexually active; similarly, 40% of sexually active&#xD;
      participants had ever used methamphetamine compared with 17% of participants that were not&#xD;
      sexually active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been scarce rigorous RCTs of behavioral health interventions among AI populations&#xD;
      and none that have analyzed an EBI promoting STD screening or addressing the interrelated&#xD;
      risks of substance use, poor emotional health and STDs/ HIV/AIDS. This study targets the&#xD;
      shared root causes of substance use and sexual risk behaviors and aims to develop&#xD;
      personalized, strengths-based risk reduction strategies tailored to participants' and the&#xD;
      community's specific risk profiles.&#xD;

    <description>The adapted Project EMPWR will be comprised of 2 sessions delivered approximately 7-10 days apart by a trained Apache paraprofessional interventionist. In the first session, interventionists will use curriculum to help participants understand their personal risk factors for STDs including HIV/AIDS (i.e., substance use, mental and emotional health, sexual health, etc.) and develop an achievable personalized risk-reduction plan that emphasizes individual and community-based strengths and resources.The second counseling session will consist of the disclosure of results (if tested) and the provision of social support to help participants develop a longer-term risk-reduction plan. At visit two, participants in both groups will be offered a STD screening protocol test.</description>
