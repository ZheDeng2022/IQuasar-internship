  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a modified microfracture using&#xD;
      collagen, and to compare them with those of a simple microfracture in patients with cartilage&#xD;
      defects in their ankles.&#xD;

      This study was an open-trial study. Sixty subjects participated in it. The study was&#xD;
      explained to the subjects and they voluntarily agreed to participate in it. Their eligibility&#xD;
      to participate in the study was checked, and they were randomized either into the simple&#xD;
      microfracture group or the modified microfracture group using collagen based on a&#xD;
      randomization table. They were asked to follow the guidelines of the investigators during the&#xD;
      study and to visit the hospital five times, including for screening. At each visit, the&#xD;
      subjects underwent an examination with doctors and MRI to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      procedure. (*If the subject began the first visit on the screening date, the total number of&#xD;
      his or her visits was four.)&#xD;
