      To see if there is a relationship between the level of LIF in IUGR fetuses and compared to&#xD;
      the level of LIF in AGA fetuses&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During embryonic development, there are several cytokines such as: LIF (Leukemia inhibitory&#xD;
      factor), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), epidermal growth factor family (EGF), neuregulin&#xD;
      1 (NRG1) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) that were found are associated with&#xD;
      neurogenesis and differentiation of brain cells .&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIF is a cytokine that is essential for the development of the central nervous system, and&#xD;
      has recently been shown in rats that maternal LIF stimulates placental ACTH that in turn&#xD;
      promotes secretion of fetal LIF from nRBC , which in turn promotes brain development of the&#xD;
      fetus Other studies on IUGR (Intra Uterine Growth Restriction) have shown that IUGR fetuses&#xD;
      have more CP (Cerebral palsy) than those who were AGA (Average for Gestational Age) The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that LIF is related to the proper development of the nervous system in the&#xD;
      fetus and by testing cord blood of embryos IUGR and the placenta we will find changes in LIF&#xD;
      and ACTH compared with AGA fetuses level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have also shown a relationship between CP and IUGR, but the mechanism for this&#xD;
      relationship is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our research is to see if there is a relationship between the level of LIF in&#xD;
      IUGR fetuses and compared to the level of LIF in AGA fetuses, in one of two ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the secretion of ACTH in placenta&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in levels of LIF in the umbilical cord blood&#xD;

    <description>After birth and fetal umbilical cord disconnection, a blood sample will be taken from the umbilical cord (cord blood) of IUGR and of AGA fetuses (5cc) for cytokine ELISA testing. Also a small sample of the placenta will be examined in order to assess the level of ACTH protein in IUGR and AGA embryos</description>
