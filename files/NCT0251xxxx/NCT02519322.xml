      This randomized phase II trial studies how well nivolumab with or without ipilimumab or&#xD;
      relatlimab before surgery works in treating patients with stage IIIB-IV melanoma that can be&#xD;
      removed by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, ipilimumab,&#xD;
      and relatlimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab alone or in combination with&#xD;
      ipilimumab or relatlimab before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of&#xD;
      normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;

      dual therapy administered in the neoadjuvant setting in patients with high-risk resectable&#xD;
      melanoma. Pathologic response will be assessed by percent viable tumor cells, percent tumor&#xD;
      necrosis, presence of fibrosis and melanoma proliferation as assessed by phosphohistone H3&#xD;
      from baseline, to on-treatment and surgical specimens. (Arm A and Arm B) II. To assess the&#xD;
      pathologic response rate of combination relatlimab with nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting&#xD;
      in patients with high-risk resectable Stage IIIB/C or oligometastatic Stage IV melanoma.&#xD;
      Pathologic response will be assessed by percent viable tumor cells, percent tumor necrosis,&#xD;

      Immunologic response will be determined by change in T cell infiltrate from baseline to&#xD;
      on-treatment and surgical specimens in response to therapy. (Arm A and Arm B) II. To assess&#xD;
      the objective response rate (ORR) of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab and ipilimumab dual&#xD;
      therapy administered in the neoadjuvant setting as assessed by imaging (Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria) in patients with high-risk resectable&#xD;
      melanoma. (Arm A and Arm B) III. To assess the 12-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) of patients with high-risk resectable melanoma treated with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab and ipilimumab dual therapy followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      nivolumab. (Arm A and Arm B) IV. To evaluate the safety of nivolumab monotherapy and dual&#xD;
      ipilimumab and nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting and peri-operatively as well as assess&#xD;
      the safety of adjuvant nivolumab. (Arm A and Arm B) V. To evaluate safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      relatlimab with nivolumab delivered in the neoadjuvant setting. (Arm C) VI. To assess the&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR) of relatlimab with nivolumab administered in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      setting as assessed by imaging (RECIST 1.1 criteria) in patients with high-risk resectable&#xD;
      melanoma. (Arm C) VII. To assess the 12-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) of patients with high-risk resectable melanoma treated with neoadjuvant and&#xD;
      adjuvant relatlimab with nivolumab. (Arm C) VIII. To evaluate immunologic and molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms of response and resistance to relatlimab with nivolumab. (Arm C)&#xD;

&#xD;
      I. Identification of immunologic and genomic markers correlating with clinical response or&#xD;
      resistance to nivolumab monotherapy and ipilimumab with nivolumab combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, and&#xD;
      43. Patients then undergo surgery on day 57. After surgery, patients receive nivolumab IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 13 doses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. (CLOSED TO ENROLLMENT AS OF 10/3/2018)&#xD;

      ARM B: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 1 hour and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1,&#xD;
      22, and 43. Patients then undergo surgery on day 57. After surgery, patients receive&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 13 doses in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. (CLOSED TO ENROLLMENT AS OF 10/3/2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 1 hour and relatlimab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and&#xD;
      29. Patients then undergo surgery on day 57. After surgery, patients receive nivolumab IV&#xD;
      over 1 hour and relatlimab IV over 1 hour every 4 weeks for 10 doses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years.&#xD;
