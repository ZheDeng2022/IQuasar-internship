      Gender dysphoria (DSM-5) or transsexualism (ICD10) is a condition in which a person's feeling&#xD;
      of gender identity is not congruent with the physical body. The hormonal treatment includes&#xD;
      inhibition of one's own sex hormone production followed by treatment with testosterone or&#xD;
      estrogen levels that are normal for the opposite sex. Seen as experimental model, this is a&#xD;
      process that provides an opportunity to study the sex hormone dependent influences that&#xD;
      explain differences in morbidity in men and women respectively. The differences that are&#xD;
      especially significant but not well known is 1) metabolic changes in the regulation of&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism 2) regulation of vascular function and structural&#xD;
      effects on the heart and arteries 3) regulation of skeletal muscle mass and fat tissue 4)&#xD;
      morphological and functional effects on discrete areas of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators will follow these patients for a year to study how the heart,&#xD;
      blood vessels, brain, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease affected by altered sex&#xD;
      hormone patterns and studying what happens in the muscles and fat in both the short and long&#xD;
      term with respect to particular gene expression and epigenetic changes and link it to&#xD;
      metabolic changes and body composition.&#xD;

      At the Centre for andrology and sexual medicine at Karolinska University Hospital about 30&#xD;
      genetic males (MtF) and 25 genetic females (FtM) every year start hormone replacement&#xD;
      therapy. This hormonal treatment includes inhibition of one's own sex hormone production&#xD;
      (down regulation of the gonadal axis) followed by treatment with testosterone or estrogen&#xD;
      levels that are normal for the opposite sex. Seen as experimental model, this is a process&#xD;
      that provides an opportunity to study the sex hormone dependent influences that explain&#xD;
      differences in morbidity in men and women respectively. Furthermore, the constitutional&#xD;
      differences distinguish them from those that are dynamically addressable through change in&#xD;
      the hormonal milieu. The differences that are especially significant but not well known is 1)&#xD;
      metabolic changes in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism 2) regulation&#xD;
      of vascular function and structural effects on the heart and arteries 3) regulation of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle mass and fat tissue 4) morphological and functional effects on discrete areas&#xD;
      of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that testosterone has a dose-response effect on body composition in men&#xD;
      while conditions are less well known in women. Thus, it is not known how the adult woman's&#xD;
      body responds to male levels of testosterone, and if the dose response relation is similar or&#xD;
      different than that of men. The clinical impression is that women have less effect of&#xD;
      androgen on muscle mass than men. Furthermore, it is not known whether the qualitative&#xD;
      properties are comparable, i.e. muscle force/unit area. The basic hypothesis is that there&#xD;
      are no constitutional sex differences in androgen response. If there are differences, we are&#xD;
      looking to identify differences in gene expression. Another hypothetical regulatory mechanism&#xD;
      is epigenetic differences which are not dynamically modifiable by androgen exposition.&#xD;
      Difference in cardiovascular morbidity between men and women is well known, but there is&#xD;
      considerable confusion if and how radical changes of sex hormone levels affects the function&#xD;
      of the cardiovascular system both with acute and chronic exposure. Radical change of estrogen&#xD;
      and testosterone levels can also affect the risk for metabolic disorders (lipid, carbohydrate&#xD;
      and protein metabolism) which can cause hazard for both metabolic diseases such as diabetes&#xD;
      and cardiovascular disease in the long term but also be a risk for future muscle weakness and&#xD;
      osteoporosis. Effects on the central nervous system as a result of changes of sex hormone&#xD;
      profile are not well known. However, we have several observations indicating that changes in&#xD;
      sex hormone levels have visual effects (shown by MRI and PET) on distinctive features of the&#xD;
      central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we will follow these patients for a year to study how the heart, blood vessels,&#xD;
      brain, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease affected by altered sex hormone patterns&#xD;
      and studying what happens in the muscles and fat in both the short and long term with respect&#xD;
      to particular gene expression and epigenetic changes and link it to metabolic changes and&#xD;
      body composition. Forty volunteers with gender dysphoria, 20 MtF and 20 FtM, are studied&#xD;
      before the onset of sex hormone therapy, after a four-week shutdown of endogenous sex&#xD;
      hormones and during one year of sex hormone treatment.&#xD;
