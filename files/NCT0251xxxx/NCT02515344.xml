      Objective : to demonstrate that providing to GPs a list of their patients who are not&#xD;
      compliant to colorectal cancer screening will 1) enhance patient participation to screening,&#xD;
      and 2) decrease the proportion of cancer diagnosed outside the screening organisation. Design&#xD;
      : Randomised controlled study, 3 parallel arms. Enrollment: GPs allocated in the 3 groups of&#xD;
      the study will be all GPs 1) from the &quot;Loire-Atlantique and Vendée&quot; geographic area (1300 GPs&#xD;
      on average) and 2) who have more than 100 patients in their patient list (based on data&#xD;
      provided by the Healthcare Insurance System Services). Patients will be eligible to the study&#xD;
      depending on their eligibility to the Faecal Occult Blood Test for colorectal cancer&#xD;
      screening : 1) they should be older than 50 and younger than 74; 2) they should not have a&#xD;
      personal history of colorectal cancer (or history of adenoma bigger than 1 cm) nor a family&#xD;
      history of colorectal cancer. Main outcomes measures : Patient participation to colorectal&#xD;
      cancer screening, and number of cancers screened in (versus diagnosed outside) the screening&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation rate for colorectal cancer screening in France is 39%. In a Cochrane review,&#xD;
      patient participation rates to colorectal cancer screening varies from 30 to 60%. Policy&#xD;
      makers usually consider that these participation rates should be higher, based on the premise&#xD;
      that the impact of the screening mainly depends on patient participation. In France, patients&#xD;
      at average risk of colorectal cancer are eligible to the Faecal Occult Blood Test for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer screening if: 1) they are older than 50 and younger than 74; 2) they have&#xD;
      no personal history of colorectal cancer (or history of adenoma bigger than 1 cm) and no&#xD;
      family history of colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that providing to GPs a list of their patients who are not compliant to&#xD;
      colorectal cancer screening will 1) enhance patient participation to screening, and 2)&#xD;
      decrease the proportion of cancer diagnosed outside the screening organisation. Design :&#xD;
      Randomised controlled study, 3 parallel arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled study. 3 parallel arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary care setting in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the intervention will focus on the GP. The statistical unit for the results&#xD;
      analysis will be the GP. GPs allocated in the 3 groups of the study will be all GPs 1) from&#xD;
      the &quot;Loire-Atlantique and Vendée&quot; geographic area (1300 GPs on average) and 2) who have more&#xD;
      than 100 patients in their patient list (based on data provided by the Healthcare Insurance&#xD;
      System Services).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs allocated to the intervention group (A) will receive a list of the patients who are not&#xD;
      compliant to colorectal cancer screening, while GPs allocated to the others groups will not&#xD;
      receive the corresponding information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 groups : (A) GPs will receive a list of the patients who are not compliant to colorectal&#xD;
      cancer screening, (B) GPs will receive a document providing general information on colorectal&#xD;
      cancer screening, (C) GPs will not receive any specific document (they continue regular&#xD;
      practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure: Patient participation to colorectal cancer screening Secondary&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: number of cancers screened in (versus diagnosed outside) the screening&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
