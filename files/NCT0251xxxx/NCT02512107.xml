  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a dried fruit and vegetable supplement (Juice&#xD;
      Plus+) can alter the gut microbiome and improve gut permeability and inflammatory levels in&#xD;
      an obese, stressed population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiome and its component genes are long known as critical determinants of the&#xD;
      nutritional value of the food we eat. Recently, it has become clear that the composition of&#xD;
      this microbiome and its metabolites influences the host immune system, thereby altering host&#xD;
      physiology. Both obesity and chronic stress have been shown to have an altered gut&#xD;
      microbiome; both these conditions also lead to increased systemic inflammatory molecules that&#xD;
      can lead to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and other diseases caused by chronic&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Juice Plus+ consumed by an overweight population combined with an eight week exercise regime&#xD;
      showed decreased markers of protein/lipid oxidation (ox-LDL), total lipid oxidation (TOS) and&#xD;
      lowered systemic concentrations of the inflammatory cytokine, TNF-Î±. As systemic cytokines&#xD;
      are altered by the composition of the gut microbiome, this study proposes to determine if&#xD;
      this decrease in inflammation by Juice Plus+ is due to a change in the species composition&#xD;
      and metabolism of the microbiome. This question is particularly relevant for populations with&#xD;
      high inflammatory loads resulting from excess weight in addition to increased psychological&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to determine 1) how Juice Plus+ consumption alters the microbiome&#xD;
      species composition and metabolism, 2) if there is an alteration in intestinal permeability&#xD;
      with the consumption of Juice Plus+ and 3) do these alterations coincide with lower systemic&#xD;
      markers of inflammation and oxidative stress among individuals who are psychologically&#xD;
      stressed and overweight. The investigators will use a randomized, placebo-controlled design&#xD;
      with a cohort of overweight, female, critical care health care professionals. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive the supplements or placebo for sixteen weeks. At the end of 16 weeks, the cohort&#xD;
      receiving the supplement will be randomized to also receive a meal replacement component or&#xD;
      follow their normal diet for an additional 4 weeks. Stool and a fasting blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected at the beginning of the study (baseline) and 8, 16 and 20 weeks later. At each time&#xD;
      point, subjects will also consume a cocktail of glucose, mannitol and lactulose and a second&#xD;
      blood draw performed to look at absorption of these molecules.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An anticipated eighty critical care, female health care professionals will be recruited. This&#xD;
      population has been shown to have a high occupational stress load and have increased risk for&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The subjects will be premenopausal, overweight/obese&#xD;
      (Body Mass Index -BMI : 25 - 40 kg/m2) and between the ages of 25-50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include smoking of any sort, smokeless tobacco use, chronic or excessive&#xD;
      alcohol consumption (&gt;1 drink per day), pregnancy or lactation, recent surgery or illness,&#xD;
      diabetes, heart disease, use of antibiotics or medications (other than medication deemed not&#xD;
      to impact outcome measures in this protocol-medication use will be reviewed on a case by case&#xD;
      basis by the principal investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health history, medication and dietary supplement questionnaires will be completed by all&#xD;
      subjects to determine eligibility. A health and perceived stress questionnaire will also be&#xD;
      completed at each sampling period. Characteristics of stool will also be recorded for the&#xD;
      three days prior to sampling using the Bristol criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All food and drink intake will be recorded for the 7-day period prior to providing the first&#xD;
      sample (baseline). Subjects will repeat this procedure at each sampling period. During the&#xD;
      initial recording period, subjects will be asked to consume foods that represent their usual&#xD;
      diet, with no more than a combined 4 fruit and vegetable servings each day, and be instructed&#xD;
      to attempt to mimic the same diet during the 7 day periods each sampling period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet records will be analyzed using nutrition software and the data will be used for analysis&#xD;
      purposes as needed. Subjects will be encouraged to consume their usual diet throughout the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be weighed and total body composition determined using Dual-energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA) for baseline subject characterization. Prior to the DXA scan a pregnancy&#xD;
      test will be performed to confirm that the subject is not pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to supplement or the placebo capsules. The intervention&#xD;
      will start between days 1 and 5 of the menstrual cycle to avoid confounding factors due to&#xD;
      menstrual cycle hormone variation. The capsules are to be taken with a meal in the morning&#xD;
      and in the evening with 3 capsules at each time, for a total of 6 capsules/day for a 20 week&#xD;
      period. At the beginning of the 17th week, subjects consuming the supplement will be&#xD;
      randomized with one group adding the &quot;Complete&quot; meal replacement component that will replace&#xD;
      the first meal of the day and the second group following their normal diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Laboratory Visit: screening visit During the initial visit to the laboratory,&#xD;
      subjects will complete the informed consent form, health history, medication and dietary&#xD;
      supplement usage and perceived stress questionnaires. Subjects' heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure, height, weight, waist, and hip circumference will be measured. A pregnancy test&#xD;
      will be performed to confirm that the subject is not pregnant. Body composition will be&#xD;
      determined via DXA to determine body composition, as increased visceral fat is causative in&#xD;
      obesity-induced inflammation. Upon completion of this screening visit, subjects will be&#xD;
      scheduled for their initial testing visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Visit Procedures For each condition (supplement and placebo), subjects will report to&#xD;
      the lab a total of three times. Subjects that continue on with the &quot;Complete&quot;&#xD;
      meal-replacement phase of the study will report to the lab one additional time. Subjects will&#xD;
      collect their stool during the 24 hours prior to reporting to the lab on each test occasion&#xD;
      (or as close as possible to that time point). Subjects will report to the lab in a 10 hour&#xD;
      fasted state, without having performed strenuous activity within the prior 48 hours. Subjects&#xD;
      will have been instructed to obtain at least 7 hours of sleep during the night prior to&#xD;
      testing. No supplement or placebo will be taken prior to blood collection, as described&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool Collection Stool samples will be collected by subjects during the 24 hours immediately&#xD;
      before reporting to the lab on each test occasion (or as close as possible to this time&#xD;
      point). Subjects will be instructed to line the pail with the biohazard bag, complete a bowel&#xD;
      movement in the bag, seal the bag with the zip tie, and place the bag in the insulated cooler&#xD;
      bag with two freezer packs. The pail, biohazard bag, zip tie, insulated cooler and freezer&#xD;
      packs will be provided by the investigator. Verbal and written instructions for collection,&#xD;
      storage, and delivery of the stool samples will be available to each participant. Upon&#xD;
      receipt by investigators, these samples will be stored at -70 degrees Celsius until&#xD;
      processing. All sample handling will occur in the fume hood and universal precautions will be&#xD;
      observed to minimize the risk of infection. Following publication of the study results,&#xD;
      remaining stool samples will be disposed of properly as biohazard waste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Collection Blood samples (approximately 20 ml; 4 teaspoons) will be taken from subjects&#xD;
      via venipuncture (by someone skilled in collecting blood). After the first blood draw,&#xD;
      subjects will consume a cocktail of glucose, lactulose and mannitol. Another blood sample (3&#xD;
      ml) will be collected 90 minutes after ingestion of this cocktail. The purpose of consuming&#xD;
      this cocktail and collecting a second blood sample is to determine the impact of the&#xD;
      treatment on glucose tolerance and also its effect on intestinal permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected blood samples will be processed and stored in multiple aliquots at -70 degrees&#xD;
      Celsius until analyzed. Following publication of the study results, remaining blood samples&#xD;
      will be disposed of properly as biohazard waste. Universal precautions will be observed to&#xD;
      minimize the risk of infection or injury to either the subject or the phlebotomist. Potential&#xD;
      risks for this procedure include soreness around the sampling site, bruising, and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White Blood Cell Harvest White blood cells will be harvested from the collected whole blood&#xD;
      using a density gradient (Ficoll) and stored in multiple aliquots at -70 degrees Celsius&#xD;
      until analyzed. Following publication of the study results, remaining cell samples will be&#xD;
      disposed of properly as biohazard waste. Universal precautions will be observed to minimize&#xD;
      the risk of infection or contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intake and Records All subjects will be asked to consume their usual diet throughout&#xD;
      the study period and be instructed to attempt to mimic the same diet during the 7 days prior&#xD;
      to sampling. Subjects will record all food and drink consumed during the 7 days prior to each&#xD;
      sampling day.&#xD;
