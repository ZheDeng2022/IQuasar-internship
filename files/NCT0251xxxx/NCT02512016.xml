      The Motherhood and Pelvic health study (MAP), Bridging physical and cultural determinants of&#xD;
      postpartum pelvic floor support and symptoms following vaginal delivery, uses mixed methods&#xD;
      research to study the influences of intra-abdominal pressure, physical activity and strength&#xD;
      on pelvic floor support and symptoms and the cultural context in which women experience those&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal delivery affects pelvic muscles, nerves and connective tissue. Despite the&#xD;
      similarities between vaginal delivery and other non-pelvic soft tissue injuries, research to&#xD;
      date has not focused on factors related to recovery from childbirth, but instead has been&#xD;
      directed at intrapartum interventions. A woman's pelvic floor derives its ability to&#xD;
      withstand loads from physical activities due to her inherent genetic make-up that sets the&#xD;
      foundation for her muscle, connective tissue, bone and other structures, her history of&#xD;
      injury, and her ability to recover from injuries. Over the past decade, investigators have&#xD;
      gained important information about some of the ways in which vaginal delivery affects the&#xD;
      structure and function of the pelvic floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, investigators know very little about how pelvic floor function recovers after&#xD;
      vaginal delivery. This study will look at whether the non-pregnant milieu, including physical&#xD;
      and cultural factors, mediate the effects of vaginal childbirth. Study investigators propose&#xD;
      that pelvic floor support and symptoms 1 year after the first vaginal delivery are affected&#xD;
      by biologically plausible factors that may impact muscle, nerve and connective tissue healing&#xD;
      during the postpartum recovery period (first 8 weeks postpartum) and pelvic floor function&#xD;
      during the postpartum strengthening period (remainder of the first postpartum year): in&#xD;
      particular, timing and dose of moderate/vigorous physical activity and inactivity, and timing&#xD;
      of and exposure to a range of intra-abdominal pressures. Our investigators further propose&#xD;
      that perception of pelvic floor support and symptoms 1 year after vaginal delivery are&#xD;
      influenced by cultural attributes and beliefs. Finding relationships between physical&#xD;
      activity, muscular strength, intra-abdominal pressure and pelvic floor support /symptoms will&#xD;
      provide realistic targets for disease prevention and pelvic floor health management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hispanics are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the United States. Although the risks for&#xD;
      pelvic floor disorders differ among ethnic and racial groups, few studies have examined these&#xD;
      differences. There is a critical need for research among Hispanic women. In this Program, our&#xD;
      investigators will study personal and cultural aspects of Mexican-American and Euro-American&#xD;
      primiparas' experiences of the earliest changes that happen after childbirth and make them&#xD;
      understandable to women and clinicians, creating an opportunity for dialogue across lay and&#xD;
      medical discourses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of each project are summarized below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT 1 Intra-abdominal pressure and postpartum pelvic floor support and symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using an intra-vaginal sensor to measure intra-abdominal pressure in primiparous women,&#xD;
      investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine whether IAP measured at 8 weeks postpartum during a) lifting and b)&#xD;
      abdominal muscle endurance testing predicts pelvic floor support and symptoms 1 year&#xD;
      postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine whether measures of muscular fitness modify the effect of IAP during lifting&#xD;
      on pelvic floor support at 1 year postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT 2: Physical activity, inactivity, and fitness: Impact on postpartum pelvic floor&#xD;
      support and symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To determine, in primiparous women after vaginal delivery, whether physical activity,&#xD;
      sedentary time and the characteristics of body habitus and muscular fitness are associated&#xD;
      with 1) pelvic floor support and 2) pelvic floor symptoms 1 year postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT 3: The cultural context of postpartum pelvic floor support following vaginal&#xD;
      delivery: a comparative ethnographic analysis of Mexican-American and Euro-American women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To describe primiparous Mexican-American and Euro-American women's experiences and&#xD;
      cultural knowledge of postpartum pelvic floor support changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-aim 1: To characterize the ways women perceive and make sense of early changes in pelvic&#xD;
      floor support as well as the ways they use language and discourse to construct meaning about&#xD;
      those changes in the year after their first delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.2: To describe how primipara share experiences and cultural understandings of&#xD;
      postpartum pelvic floor support with mothers, partners, sisters, and confidantes in their&#xD;
      families and social networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-aim 1: To explore the interplay of women's understandings of early changes in pelvic&#xD;
      floor support with sociocultural prescriptions/proscriptions regarding physical activity and&#xD;
      any resulting postpartum alterations of activity which they may undertake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated enrollment: 1530 women in third trimester to obtain final enrollment goal of 585&#xD;
      women at 1 year postpartum. (We estimate that, after initial enrollment, we will exclude&#xD;
      26.5% that deliver by cesarean, 10% that deliver before 37 weeks, and that 20% will withdraw&#xD;
      between delivery and 8 weeks postpartum, 20% will withdraw between 8 weeks and 1 year&#xD;
      postpartum, and 6% will have known pregnancy by 1 year postpartum, leaving 585 with final&#xD;
      1-year data.)&#xD;
