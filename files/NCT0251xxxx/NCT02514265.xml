      This study is the second phase of the MAPP Network and is designed to conduct a prospective,&#xD;
      observational study of men and women with UCPPS, referred to as the Symptom Patterns Study&#xD;
      (SPS), enriched with pre-defined subgroups, with longer follow-up, in order to further&#xD;
      investigate clinical and biologic factors associated with worsening and/or improvement of&#xD;
      reported urinary and non-urinary symptoms.&#xD;

      To better understand the etiology and treated natural history of UCPPS, and to identify&#xD;
      clinical factors and research measurements to define clinically relevant sub-groups of these&#xD;
      patients for future clinical trials, and to inform symptom management, the NIDDK established&#xD;
      the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network in&#xD;
      20089 (http://www.mappnetwork.org/). The primary clinical research effort carried out by this&#xD;
      network in Phase I was a prospective cohort study, the Trans-MAPP Epidemiology/Phenotyping&#xD;
      (EP) Study.10 From 12/14/2009 through 12/14/2012 1,039 men and women were enrolled, including&#xD;
      persons with UCPPS (n=424); persons with other co-morbid illnesses, including fibromyalgia,&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome (n=200 for all conditions); and&#xD;
      healthy controls (n=415). Study participants were extensively characterized (i.e.,&#xD;
      phenotyped) at baseline, and UCPPS participants were followed for 12 months. During&#xD;
      follow-up, using a web-based symptom data capture system, a small battery of self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires were repeated on a bi-weekly schedule for 48 weeks. In addition, neuroimaging&#xD;
      was performed in a subset of participants (n=279) at baseline, and biological samples were&#xD;
      collected on all participants at baseline and follow-up for studies to identify plasma and&#xD;
      urine biomarkers and potential infectious agents. This study was complemented by a number of&#xD;
      Discovery Site-Specific clinical research studies (i.e., studies generally conducted at a&#xD;
      single site) and investigations of animal models developed by multiple sites to mimic&#xD;
      symptoms of human UCPPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial analyses of these data have identified a number of provocative findings. There are&#xD;
      strong indications those certain subgroups of participants (albeit with small sample sizes)&#xD;
      with urinary and non-urinary symptoms tend to improve over time; whereas other subgroups tend&#xD;
      to worsen over time. These patterns of improving or worsening are differentially expressed&#xD;
      according to sex, subtype of bladder pain syndrome (BPS), and pain location (localized to the&#xD;
      pelvic region vs pain reported in the pelvic region and beyond).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of the MAPP Network is designed to conduct a prospective, observational&#xD;
      study of men and women with UCPPS, referred to as the Symptom Patterns Study (SPS). This&#xD;
      follow-up study will have pre-defined subgroups, with longer follow-up, in order to further&#xD;
      investigate clinical and biologic factors associated with worsening and/or improvement of&#xD;
      reported urinary and non-urinary symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed MAPP Phase II SPS also presents the opportunity to apply many of the most&#xD;
      promising research methods in the pain field (e.g. functional, chemical and structural&#xD;
      neuroimaging, quantitative sensory testing) during the course of the study (at baseline and&#xD;
      then longitudinally) to better characterize men and women with UCPPS. Most of these measures&#xD;
      were only collected at a single point in time in the Trans-MAPP Epidemiology/Phenotyping&#xD;
      Study of Phase I, and within a sample of UCPPS patients not enriched with predefined&#xD;
      subgroups. Further phenotyping in the second phase study will allow us to better determine&#xD;
      which of these measures, or any other measures identified during Phase I (e.g., urinary or&#xD;
      serum biomarkers), might identify individuals most likely to have spontaneous improvement of&#xD;
      their symptoms, versus transition to a more &quot;peripheral&quot; (pelvic pain only) or &quot;centralized&quot;&#xD;
      form (pelvic pain and beyond) of urinary and non-urinary pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be asked to participate in the study for up to 36 months. During&#xD;
      which they will be asked to complete a series of in-clinic study visits that will at various&#xD;
      time points a neuroimaging scan and quantitative sensory tests, online internet-based&#xD;
      questionnaires in clinic and off site/at home (assessing symptoms, health care utilization,&#xD;
      flare status, and quality of life), a physical exam, a pelvic exam, and prostate massage&#xD;
      (optional for males only).&#xD;
