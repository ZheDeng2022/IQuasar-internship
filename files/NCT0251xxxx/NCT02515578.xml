      Heart disease and strokes cause one in three deaths reported each year in the United States.&#xD;
      Primary care practices need to implement new research findings that help decrease patients'&#xD;
      risk for heart disease and stroke. This project will help to build primary care practice&#xD;
      capacity for quality improvement and change management in small and medium size primary care&#xD;
      practices in Colorado and New Mexico. This project will also help practices implement&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes research findings.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) causes one in three deaths reported each year in the United&#xD;
      States. Strategies derived from patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) that address CVD&#xD;
      risk factors can greatly reduce the burden of CVD. Primary care practices must transform to&#xD;
      deliver a higher level of PCOR evidence-based prevention to decrease cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
      PCOR interventions that emphasize patient-centered care including self-management support,&#xD;
      team-based care, improved information systems, and active quality improvement have been shown&#xD;
      to be effective. Practices often require assistance integrating new programs into clinical&#xD;
      operations. Practice facilitation has been shown to enhance implementation of new programs&#xD;
      for patients with chronic disease in primary care. Other methods of practice support,&#xD;
      including academic detailing, collaborative learning sessions, and health information&#xD;
      technology assistance, have also been shown to be effective, by themselves and in combination&#xD;
      with practice facilitation. Patient involvement may also aid practice transformation.&#xD;
      Increasingly, practices are actively including patients as part of the change process through&#xD;
      the creation of patient advisory councils and including patients in practice quality&#xD;
      improvement teams. Another method of patient involvement to inform implementation of&#xD;
      evidence-based care is the Boot Camp Translation process, in which patients collaborate with&#xD;
      primary care clinicians, staff members, and community members to translate best practices&#xD;
      into culturally and community relevant implementation at the local level. However, while&#xD;
      these efforts have had considerable success, no study has looked at the incremental value of&#xD;
      adding patient engagement strategies to the more standard approaches to practice&#xD;
      transformation listed above. This project would implement the Southwest Health Extension&#xD;
      Program to Enhance Research Dissemination (SHEPERD) as a cooperative program to build primary&#xD;
      care practice capacity for quality improvement, change management, and implementation of PCOR&#xD;
      findings in small and medium size primary care practices in Colorado and New Mexico, with an&#xD;
      initial focus on cardiovascular care. It also would conduct a cluster randomized trial with&#xD;
      an external matched cohort control group to examine the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,&#xD;
      Implementation, and Maintenance of two approaches to practice transformation to implement&#xD;
      PCOR interventions for reducing cardiovascular risks in primary care practices, comparing the&#xD;
      impact of 1) a standard practice transformation support intervention (including practice&#xD;
      facilitation, practice assessment with feedback, HIT assistance, academic detailing, and&#xD;
      collaborative learning sessions) to 2) an approach that adds patient engagement activities&#xD;
      (including patient advisory councils and boot camp translation) as part of the practice&#xD;
      transformation support. This project will provide critical information regarding the added&#xD;
      value of patient engagement in practice transformation efforts and will also result in a&#xD;
      network of practices across the region with increased capacity for practice transformation&#xD;
      and implementation of PCOR findings.&#xD;
