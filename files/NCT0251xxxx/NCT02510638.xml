      Dengue infection has been identified as the fastest spreading mosquito-borne viral disease by&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO), which affects more than 2.5 billion people living in the&#xD;
      subtropical and tropical regions. Malaysia is hyper-endemic with all four dengue virus&#xD;
      serotypes circulating and responsible for the escalating number of cases over the years. As&#xD;
      of 28 February 2015, there are 62 deaths secondary to dengue infection being reported in&#xD;
      Malaysia; and the total number of dengue cases reported in the same period was 23,966 which&#xD;
      is 46% higher than the same reporting period of 2014. Although dengue virus has been&#xD;
      identified for so many years and plenty of research work has been carried out, it was proven&#xD;
      that there are still many aspects that we are not too sure about the disease. Therefore, this&#xD;
      multi-center, observational cohort study is designed to investigate the clinical course of&#xD;
      hospitalized dengue infection in Malaysia. The study population of this study consists of&#xD;
      male or female patients with dengue to be randomly sampled from hospitals in Malaysia. This&#xD;
      study will be conducted in 2 stages whereby the 1st stage will only focus on the basic social&#xD;
      and clinical data to describe the clinical course of dengue as general and the 2nd stage will&#xD;
      collect the more detailed clinical and management data to describe the detailed clinical&#xD;
      course, management and prognosis of dengue. All hospital participation in this study is&#xD;
      voluntary, and approval will be obtained from National Institute of Health (NIH) and Medical&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee (MREC) prior to any recruitment.&#xD;

      Dengue infection have resurged and disseminated globally since late 1970s after successful&#xD;
      eradication programs of the dengue vector Aedes mosquitoes in Latin America in the 1940s. It&#xD;
      has been identified as the fastest spreading mosquito-borne viral disease by World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO), which affects more than 2.5 billion people living in the subtropical and&#xD;
      tropical regions. Approximately 75% of the current global dengue disease burden comes from&#xD;
      the population residing at Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions, which subsequently&#xD;
      lead to the formation of the Asia Pacific Dengue Strategic Plan (2008-2015) and the recent&#xD;
      Global Strategy for Prevention and Control (2012-2020) to reduce the dengue burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaysia is hyper-endemic with all four dengue virus serotypes circulating and responsible&#xD;
      for the escalating number of cases over the years. The number of reported dengue cases in&#xD;
      Malaysia has increased fourfold from 44.3 per 100,000 population in 1999 to 181 per 100,000&#xD;
      in 2007; with increased in dengue deaths in the adult populations since 2002. Worst still, as&#xD;
      of 28 February 2015, there are 62 deaths secondary to dengue infection being reported in&#xD;
      Malaysia; and the total number of dengue cases reported in the same period was 23,966 which&#xD;
      is 46% higher than the same reporting period of 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WHO has revised the dengue classification in 2009, which were shown to be more sensitive&#xD;
      than the WHO 1997 classification system in predicting severity of dengue. According to this&#xD;
      WHO 2009 classification, dengue infection is now categorized into dengue, dengue with warning&#xD;
      signs, and severe dengue. The proposed warning signs include abdominal pain or tenderness,&#xD;
      persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleed, lethargy or restlessness,&#xD;
      liver enlargement &gt; 2cm, increase in hematocrit concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet&#xD;
      count. Severe dengue is then defined as dengue infection with severe plasma leakage with&#xD;
      shock, severe bleeding or severe organ involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a large number of patients may recover from this self-limiting disease, a small&#xD;
      proportion may progress to develop severe dengue manifestations, which requires admission to&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring and intervention. However, the progression to&#xD;
      severe clinical manifestations is usually unpredictable. Early identification of signs that&#xD;
      can predict severe dengue may save lives by facilitating early initiation of interventions&#xD;
      and frequent monitoring. Dengue epidemics in Malaysia lead to a strong demand for hospital&#xD;
      beds and manpower, and inflicting large public and private hospitalization costs. Hence, it&#xD;
      is crucial to determine a predictive tools which can help to triage patients into those that&#xD;
      are least and most likely to develop complications in order for a better allocation of&#xD;
      limited healthcare resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies have been done to validate the utility of the proposed warning signs by WHO&#xD;
      2009 dengue classification, but the results vary and none of these studies are conducted in&#xD;
      our local setting. Although dengue virus has been identified for so many years and plenty of&#xD;
      research work has been carried out, it was proven that there are still many aspects that we&#xD;
      are not too sure about the disease. It got more confused with the sudden surge of dengue&#xD;
      cases and dengue mortality cases since last year. Therefore, this study aims to look into the&#xD;
      clinical course of the hospitalized dengue cases in Malaysia. It will then allow us to zoom&#xD;
      in to the specific area for more future research work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the clinical course of hospitalized dengue cases in Malaysia in from year 2009 till&#xD;
      2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the characteristics of patients hospitalized for dengue&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe the clinical presentation of patients hospitalized for dengue&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Verify the diagnosis of reported dengue cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Describe the spectrum of disease severity among patients hospitalized for dengue&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Describe the management of patients hospitalized for dengue including ICU care&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Describe the prognosis of patients hospitalized for dengue&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Estimate the resource utilization and cost of care of patients hospitalized for dengue&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Estimate the mortality outcome of patients hospitalized for dengue&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-center, observational cohort study designed to investigate the clinical&#xD;
      course of patients hospitalized for dengue infection in Malaysia. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 2 stages for the duration of 6 months. Data will be retrieved retrospectively in&#xD;
      both stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 1, a sample of dengue cases who visited general practitioner or who were&#xD;
      hospitalized in from year 2009 until 2015 will be sampled using PIK and Health insurance&#xD;
      claims database as sampling frame. Each hospital will be given a list of the dengue cases and&#xD;
      the local coordinator from respective hospital Clinical Research Centre (CRC) will trace the&#xD;
      medical records of all these dengue cases. Once the case notes of all the dengue cases are&#xD;
      traced, two trained research assistants will travel to the hospital to extract the basic&#xD;
      clinical data on social demographics, presentation and discharge status by using case report&#xD;
      form A. All the data collected in phase 1 will be categorized as basic clinical set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 2, a subset of the basic clinical set will be sampled conveniently. Only the cases&#xD;
      that were tested positive by dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1), immunoglobulin-M (IgM) or&#xD;
      high-titre immunoglobulin-G (IgG) will be included in the Stage 2 study. A more detailed&#xD;
      clinical subset data will be collected by research assistants at site. All co-morbidity,&#xD;
      serial clinical and laboratory data, in-hospital course and treatment data and Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (ICU) admission data will be extracted from medical records with case report form B. All&#xD;
      variables/data in the case report form is defined in Appendix I. All data collected in Stage&#xD;
      1 and 2 will then be compiled and analyzed with software Stata Version 10.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO 2009 classification will be adopted in this study. According to the WHO 2009 criteria,&#xD;
      probable dengue is defined as fever and two of the following: nausea or vomiting, rash, aches&#xD;
      and pain, leucopenia, and any warning signs. Warning signs are abdominal pain or tenderness,&#xD;
      persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleed, lethargy or restlessness,&#xD;
      hepatomegaly and hematocrit changes ≥20% concurrent with platelet &lt;50,000 on the same day.&#xD;
      Severe dengue is present if any of the following criteria fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Plasma leakage evidenced by hematocrit change of ≥20%, pleural effusion or ascites, or&#xD;
      hypoproteinemia, leading to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dengue shock syndrome (tachycardia, cold and clammy extremities, capillary refill time&#xD;
           greater than 3 seconds, weak or undetectable pulse, narrow pulse pressure ≤20 mmHg, or&#xD;
           systolic blood pressure &lt;90 millimetre mercury (mmHg) or unrecordable blood pressure);&#xD;
           or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluid accumulation with respiratory distress (respiratory rate ≥30/minute, oxygen&#xD;
           saturation ≤92% on room air, or mechanical ventilation) II) Severe bleeding manifesting&#xD;
           as gastrointestinal bleeding or menorrhagia, or requirement for transfusion of packed&#xD;
           red blood cells or whole blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III) Severe organ involvement as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum alanine or aspartate transaminase ≥1000 units/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impaired consciousness;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute renal impairment defined as serum creatinine &gt; two times upper limit of normal;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myocarditis or encephalopathy/encephalitis&#xD;
