    <textblock>
      A broad group of disorders is associated with severe stress existence in children or&#xD;
      adolescents. The most characteristic result, and one of the most serious being the state of&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), whose main source consists of physical or sexual&#xD;
      violence, and to a lesser extent, accidents public road or natural disaster, whose child was&#xD;
      the subject or witness. PTSD is associated with a deleterious effect on cognition and&#xD;
      including the mnemonic operation. The painful reminder of the traumatic event is one of the&#xD;
      most disabling symptoms. However, there are many other memory disorders that experimental&#xD;
      studies gradually update. They maintain a close link with emotional regulation that disturbed&#xD;
      you know if PTSD. However the majority of studies on emotion and cognition and their&#xD;
      relationship with brain activity took adult subject. Work in adolescents are few on the&#xD;
      morphological study, on rare neurobehavioral and reduced to two studies of functional&#xD;
      neuroimaging. Contrary to what is observed in adults, morphological studies report&#xD;
      consistently, no reduction in hippocampal volume. There is no study in the idle state. Two&#xD;
      studies in functional MRI, the first highlighted in PTSD patients inhibition of the activity&#xD;
      of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to stimuli such as to evoke the trauma, a second&#xD;
      reported increased activity in the prefrontal cortex Median (mPFC) in a inhibition. The&#xD;
      objective task of our study is to evaluate the impact of psychological trauma on brain&#xD;
      structures involved in the emotional component of the memory (amygdala, hippocampus,&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex in particular). For this, the investigators will take in 33 adolescents,&#xD;
      including patients with posttraumatic symptomatology and matched controls free of trauma age,&#xD;
      several neuroimaging exams, anatomical and functional. The functional review will include&#xD;
      some rest and another in activation during episodic memory task designed to assess the&#xD;
      influence of self-perception on memory impairment observed in patients. The investigators&#xD;
      will check, for each group of patients and controls, the involvement of cortical structures&#xD;
      in relation to the regulation of emotional memory (CCA, amygdala and hippocampus). The&#xD;
      anatomy of the hippocampus benefit specific imaging methods developed in the unit INSERM&#xD;
      U923. Endocrine correlates of stress tests will be studied by a fully-traumatic by salivary&#xD;
      cortisol sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will clarify the mechanisms involved in emotional and memory impairments&#xD;
      secondary to psychological trauma, their relationship with self (judgment and self-esteem)&#xD;
      and studying their morphological substrates. A longer-term goal is to offer help in the&#xD;
      diagnosis and monitoring of young patients with posttraumatic symptomatology.&#xD;
