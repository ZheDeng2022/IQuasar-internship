  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal source foods (ASF), such as meat and eggs, are rich in nutrients critical for growth&#xD;
      and development. Yet, for poor children in developing countries, ASF consumption is limited&#xD;
      by cost, inadequate caregiver knowledge, and lack of local production and physical&#xD;
      availability. The impact of HH- and village-level livestock interventions on household&#xD;
      dietary diversity and nutritional status in resource-poor communities is not well&#xD;
      established. The objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of local egg production&#xD;
      intervention on maternal and child diets and child nutrition status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project takes place in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia in partnership with a local&#xD;
      non-governmental organization, COMACO. Twenty communities will be assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention, and 20 matched communities will be selected as controls. In each intervention&#xD;
      community, an egg production facility will be built, owned, and operated by trained COMACO&#xD;
      farmers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Households (HHs) in each community will be sampled twice annually for 1 year pre-intervention&#xD;
      (baseline) and 1 year post-intervention to assess dietary diversity and nutritional status.&#xD;
      Data analysis will test for a change in these outcomes from baseline in each intervention&#xD;
      community compared to the matched control community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of an intervention establishing&#xD;
      local egg production on maternal and child diets and nutrition status. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that this intervention, combined with appropriate agricultural extension and&#xD;
      nutrition education programs, will result in: 1) increased total household, maternal, and&#xD;
      child consumption of eggs; 2) improved maternal and child dietary quality; and 3) improved&#xD;
      infant/ young child nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test this hypothesis in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia in partnership with&#xD;
      a local non-governmental organization, Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO). The forty&#xD;
      study sites are located in four geographic clusters (Chiefdoms) in Eastern Province Zambia.&#xD;
      These Chiefdoms are located in two districts: Mambwe (Mnkhanya, Jumbe, and Nsefu Chiefdoms)&#xD;
      and Lundazi (Mwanya Chiefdom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty communities will be assigned to the intervention (egg production), and 20 matched&#xD;
      communities will be selected as controls (no intervention). In each intervention community,&#xD;
      an egg production facility will be built, each owned and operated by trained COMACO farmers,&#xD;
      mostly women. Each group will be provided layer pullets at point-of-lay and layer mash.&#xD;
      Facility owners will make all business decisions, retain all profits, and will be responsible&#xD;
      for all upkeep costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a repeated cross-sectional study design, indicators of food security, wealth, diet,&#xD;
      nutritional status (anthropometrics), and health and wellbeing will be assessed in all&#xD;
      egg-producing HHs and in women/child dyads (children aged 6-36 months) residing in the area&#xD;
      surrounding each facility or central control point. Data will be collected twice annually for&#xD;
      1 year pre-intervention (baseline) and 1 year post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exposure of interest is living in an egg-producing community. In the primary analysis,&#xD;
      the investigators will use hierarchical mixed effects modeling to analyze the effect of the&#xD;
      program on each of the outcomes of interest (see Outcome Measures section for details).&#xD;
