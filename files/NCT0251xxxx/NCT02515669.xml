    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Doses for this study are based upon achieving a moderate to high degree of suppression in serum free myostatin at steady-state trough across 3 dose levels. A body weight-tiered, fixed-dose strategy targeting moderate (&gt;50%), high (&gt;85%) and near complete (&gt;95%) suppression of serum free myostatin was used to select the three doses for the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Starting at Week 5, participants whose weight exceeded or dropped below the dosing weight tier to which they were assigned (by &gt;1kg) were assigned to the new corresponding body weight-based dose within the participants assigned panel.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>A positive ADA sample is defined as one in which the presence of detectable ADAs is confirmed to be specific to RO7239361. A participant is considered as ADA positive if, after initiation of treatment, they have an ADA positive relative to baseline sample.&#xD;
Double-blind phase data for placebo participants is not included. Placebo participants in each arm moved on to RO7239361 upon entering the open label phase.&#xD;
Participants in Panel 1 received 4 mg RO7239361; participants in Panel 2 received either 12.5 mg (weight between 15 and 45 kg) or 20 mg (weight &gt;45 kg) RO7239361, and participants in Panel 3 and the Expansion Panel received either 35 mg (weight between 15 and 45 kg) or 50 mg (weight &gt;45 kg) RO7239361.</description>

        <description>A positive ADA sample is defined as one in which the presence of detectable ADAs is confirmed to be specific to RO7239361. A participant is considered as ADA positive if, after initiation of treatment, they have an ADA positive relative to baseline sample.&#xD;

Participants in Panel 1 received 4 mg RO7239361; participants in Panel 2 received either 12.5 mg (weight between 15 and 45 kg) or 20 mg (weight &gt;45 kg) RO7239361, and participants in Panel 3 and the Expansion Panel received either 35 mg (weight between 15 and 45 kg) or 50 mg (weight &gt;45 kg) RO7239361.</description>

          <description>Double-blind phase data for placebo participants are not included in this Whole Study outcome measure, but are reported in the outcome measure specific to the double-blind period. At the end of the double-blind period participants in the placebo arm switched to one of the RO7239361 arms upon entering the open label phase.&#xD;
Participants in Panel 1 received 4 mg RO7239361; participants in Panel 2 received either 12.5 mg (weight between 15 and 45 kg) or 20 mg (weight &gt;45 kg) RO7239361, and participants in Panel 3 and the Expansion Panel received either 35 mg (weight between 15 and 45 kg) or 50 mg (weight &gt;45 kg) RO7239361.</description>
          <population>The pharmacodynamics (PD) data set included all available data from subjects for whom PD measurements were available at baseline and at least one other timepoint. The Whole Study set reported here includes data from RO7239361-treated participants only.</population>
