      This is a single-centre, randomised-controlled trial, comparing management of preschool&#xD;
      wheeze. It specifically aims to compare management of preschool wheeze using current clinical&#xD;
      guidelines to management determined by eosinophilic inflammation and infection. Participants&#xD;
      will be children aged 1-5 years who have recurrent wheezing and will be allocated to one of&#xD;
      two treatment groups, either current clinical care or pathological phenotype based&#xD;
      management. They will be asked to make 2 study visits to the Royal Brompton Hospital over the&#xD;
      course of 4 months.&#xD;

      This study will determine the efficacy of treating preschool wheeze based on objective&#xD;
      biomarkers of inflammation and presence of bacterial infection, and compare this to current&#xD;
      clinical guidelines based management. Subjects will be recruited from out-patient clinics and&#xD;
      attend for a screening/research visit during which assessments of pathological phenotype&#xD;
      (bacterial infection and inflammation) will be made from induced sputum and blood. Their&#xD;
      clinical phenotype will be determined by the Consultant. Subsequently, patients will be&#xD;
      randomised to one of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) current clinical care ( as directed by their Consultant) ii) pathological phenotype based&#xD;
      management- presence of eosinophilia in blood (_&gt; 2%) or induced sputum (&gt;2.4%) - will&#xD;
      receive twice daily inhaled steroids ( beclometasone 200mcg bd) for 4 months, presence of&#xD;
      bacterial infection in induced sputum or oropharyngeal swab- will receive 4 weeks of&#xD;
      antibiotics targeted to the isolate, IF BOTH eosinophilic inflammation AND infection are&#xD;
      present, then inflammation alone will be treated for 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will continue on as required bronchodilator therapy, and any other&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory therapy ( other than inhaled steroids) e.g. montelukast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo an initial research/screening visit which will involve the&#xD;
      following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full blood count Total serum immunoglobulin E and radioallergosorbent test to house dust&#xD;
      mite, grass pollen, tree pollen, cat, dog, aspergillus, milk, egg, peanut Assessment of lung&#xD;
      function by incentive spirometry and lung clearance index (LCI) using the multiple breath&#xD;
      washout technique Exhaled nitric oxide- using the offline tidal breathing technique Sputum&#xD;
      induction using nebulised hypertonic saline Oro- pharyngeal swab Symptom questionnaire Health&#xD;
      related quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management in the pathological phenotype arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eosinophilic inflammation, no bacterial infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Children with sputum eosinophils &gt;2.4% or blood eosinophils equal to and above 2% will&#xD;
           be defined as eosinophilic and management will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Regular inhaled steroids ( beclometasone 200mcg bd) for 4 months in those previously&#xD;
           not on any regular therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii) Of children who have already been prescribed inhaled steroid therapy, those with an&#xD;
           eosinophilic phenotype will continue for a further 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii) Children who have already been prescribed a regular leukotriene receptor antagonist&#xD;
           will continue this and regular inhaled steroids (beclometasone 200mcg bd) will be added&#xD;
           to their maintenance therapy for 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv) Use of as required bronchodilator therapy will continue&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Non- eosinophilic, no inflammation, no infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Children with either sputum eosinophils _&lt;2.4% or blood eosinophils &lt;2% will be defined&#xD;
           as non- eosinophilic and management will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Use of as required bronchodilators for acute symptoms ii) Non- eosinophilic children&#xD;
           that have already been prescribed regular inhaled steroids will be asked to stop them&#xD;
           for 4 months Children with no bacterial growth from oropharyngeal swab or induced&#xD;
           sputum, and without eosinophilic inflammation will continue management according to the&#xD;
           non-eosinophilic, no inflammation, no infection profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bacterial infection, no eosinophilic inflammation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Children with a positive bacterial culture result from oropharyngeal swab or induced&#xD;
           sputum will be treated with a 4 week course of antibiotics. Four weeks of antibiotic&#xD;
           therapy will be used as this has been shown to be beneficial in a previous study of&#xD;
           severe preschool wheeze. If these children have already been prescribed regular inhaled&#xD;
           steroids, they will be stopped for 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Eosinophilic inflammation AND bacterial infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with raised eosinophils in induced sputum or blood AND positive bacterial culture&#xD;
      will be managed according to the eosinophilic inflammation alone guideline. They will only be&#xD;
      given inhaled steroids for 4 months, and no antibiotics. This is to assess only one&#xD;
      intervention at a time. However, the investigators do not anticipate many children will be in&#xD;
      this group as our previous data shows those with positive bacterial cultures are very&#xD;
      unlikely to have eosinophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management in the clinical guidelines arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will be treated as directed by their Consultant Paediatrician. The prescription&#xD;
      for the drugs to be used will be dispensed from the pharmacy department at the Royal Brompton&#xD;
      Hospital- as directed by the clinician. Usually only 2 weeks of medication is prescribed by&#xD;
      the pharmacy, but for this trial 4 months' supply will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following medication will be allowed to continue during the intervention period in both&#xD;
      study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use of rescue medication with bronchodilators for acute symptoms- salbutamol and/or&#xD;
           ipratropium bromide&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use of leukotriene receptor antagonist- montelukast- can continue regardless of whether&#xD;
           it is being taken regularly or as required for acute symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be monitored according to the monitoring plan agreed and written by the&#xD;
      Sponsor, based on internal risk assessment procedure. Where appropriate the CI will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a copy of the Sponsor's self-monitoring template. It is the responsibility of the&#xD;
      CI to ensure this is completed and submitted to the research organisation on request. It is&#xD;
      the responsibility of the research organisation to determine the monitoring risk assessment&#xD;
      and explain the rationale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may be subject to inspection and audit by Imperial College London under their remit&#xD;
      as Sponsor, the Study Coordination Centre and other regulatory bodies to ensure adherence to&#xD;
      good clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical data will be presented as number and percentage and comparisons between groups&#xD;
      done using the chi squared or Fishers exact test. All numerical data will be tested for&#xD;
      normality and normally distributed data will be presented as mean standard deviation and&#xD;
      comparisons between groups done using the 2 sample independent t test. For the data that are&#xD;
      not normally distributed the median (IQR) will be presented and comparisons between groups&#xD;
      done using the Mann-Whitney test. Poisson regression will be done to determine the factors&#xD;
      that affect the primary endpoint, the number of unplanned hospital visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be data checks to compare data entered into the registry, against predefined rules&#xD;
      for range using the INFORM database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of subjects to be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be aged between 1 and 5 years old. All subjects will have moderate to&#xD;
      severe preschool wheeze, defined as _&gt;2 oral steroid bursts for acute wheeze in the last 12&#xD;
      months, with at least one oral steroid burst in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on published data for children with moderate preschool wheeze it is apparent that&#xD;
      approximately five healthcare attendances occur per child per year. In the current study, the&#xD;
      investigators wish to reduce the proportion of healthcare contacts by at least one-third per&#xD;
      year. In order to achieve this with 80% power, and accepting statistical significance at the&#xD;
      5% level, the investigators require a minimum of 36 evaluable patients with moderate wheeze&#xD;
      per group. Evaluable patients are those from whom at least a blood sample to assess&#xD;
      inflammation and an oropharyngeal swab to determine infection can be obtained prior to&#xD;
      randomisation. A total of at least 72 children will therefore be recruited. However, this is&#xD;
      the minimum number, and the investigators aim to recruit 100 children (50 per group) if&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects is not based on a precise power calculation as this is a proof of&#xD;
      concept study to determine the feasibility of this approach, and to inform a future power&#xD;
      calculation for a large multi-centre trial addressing the same question.&#xD;
