  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the way the antidepressant concentration (amount of&#xD;
      medication) in the blood changes due to the physiological changes in the body (i.e., changes&#xD;
      in metabolism, hormones and body fluid) during pregnancy and postpartum and the impact of&#xD;
      genetic factors on the degree of these changes. Changes in antidepressant concentration are&#xD;
      important to monitor, as decreases in antidepressant concentration may lead to less than&#xD;
      therapeutic drug levels, which may cause an increase in mood symptoms or recurrence of&#xD;
      depressive episodes. Increases in antidepressant concentration have the potential to lead to&#xD;
      increased side effects. The study team is hoping to better understand the course of these&#xD;
      changes across pregnancy and postpartum and how an individual's genetic makeup impacts these&#xD;
      changes with the goal of developing guidelines to optimize antidepressant treatment of&#xD;
      pregnant women.&#xD;

      The overarching goal of this The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health&#xD;
      and Human Development (NICHD) funded U54 Obstetric-Fetal Pharmacology Research Center study&#xD;
      is to develop evidence to construct guidelines for the optimal use of selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants in pregnant women. The progressive changes in&#xD;
      plasma SSRI and metabolite concentrations across pregnancy and after birth will be determined&#xD;
      in an observational study. Serial evaluations of depressive and anxiety symptoms and side&#xD;
      effects will be obtained to evaluate their association with plasma concentrations at monthly&#xD;
      intervals during pregnancy and twice post-birth. To assess the subjects' metabolic&#xD;
      phenotypes, subjects have the option to receive a probe drug cocktail, which will be given to&#xD;
      evaluate the activities of enzymes involved in antidepressant metabolism during the third&#xD;
      trimester (when activity change is maximal) compared to the non-pregnant state after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the study team will investigate the impact of genomic variability on&#xD;
      inter-individual differences in SSRI dosing, plasma concentrations and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      during pregnancy, with a focus on genes involved in the metabolism and elimination of SSRIs,&#xD;
      drug transporters responsible for SSRI access to the central nervous system, and genes&#xD;
      encoding critical SSRI targets involved in therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the study team will determine the maternal-fetal plasma concentrations and&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic characteristics associated with neonatal SSRI abstinence syndrome. Maternal&#xD;
      and fetal genotypes will be assessed for their relationship to SSRI drug concentrations and&#xD;
      neonatal abstinence syndrome.&#xD;
