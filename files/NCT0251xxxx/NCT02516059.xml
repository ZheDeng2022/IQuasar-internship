  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystectomy with urinary diversion (ileal conduit, ileal orthotopic neobladder, catheterizable&#xD;
      ileal pouch) is major abdominal surgery, which is associated with a high incidence of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complications.Perioperative techniques aiming at an early return of bowel&#xD;
      function are to be pursued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal postoperative pain management is one of the key factors leading to enhanced recovery&#xD;
      after surgery. The perioperative use of an epidural analgesia for major abdominal surgery is&#xD;
      established, not only because of its excellent analgesic properties, but also because it can&#xD;
      accelerate the return of bowel function. However, epidural analgesia is associated with&#xD;
      additional costs, need for close monitoring and nursing. In addition each supplemental day&#xD;
      with an indwelling epidural catheter increases the risk of infection. So it is recommended to&#xD;
      re-assess the risk/benefit ratio of an epidural analgesia after 4 days, if not sooner.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to develop strategies that reduce its duration without impairing&#xD;
      the benefits. Systemic analgesics with prolonged-release oral formulation like oral oxycodone&#xD;
      (Oxycontin®) or combined drug mixture (oral oxycodone/naloxone (Targin®)) could be a valuable&#xD;
      alternative pain treatment as a second analgesic step, starting on postoperative day (POD) 3,&#xD;
      so that the epidural catheter could be removed earlier without impairing postoperative&#xD;
      enhanced recovery including return of the bowel function. Both oxycodone and naloxone orally&#xD;
      administered are a recognized and accepted treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the implementation of an oral opioid with or&#xD;
      without naloxone in the early postoperative period in patients undergoing open radical&#xD;
      cystectomy with urinary diversion and intraoperative and early postoperative use of epidural&#xD;
      analgesia. The investigators expect an unchanged early return of the bowel function and equal&#xD;
      analgesia with a reduced length of stay of the epidural catheter (primary endpoint), thus&#xD;
      potentially reducing epidural catheter associated complications and lowering costs (nursing&#xD;
      and pain service).&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection and urinary diversion is major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery, which is associated with a high incidence of postoperative complications.&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal complications are frequent and perioperative techniques aiming at an early&#xD;
      return of bowel function are to be pursued.The rationale for this patients population (i.e.&#xD;
      cystectomy patient with ileal urinary derivation) is that they are at high risk for&#xD;
      postoperative complications (around 50%) and specially gastrointestinal (8-20%). There is a&#xD;
      need for improvement in the postoperative setting aiming to reduce complications and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal postoperative pain management is one of the key factors leading to enhanced recovery&#xD;
      after surgery. The perioperative use of thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) for major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery is established, not only because of its excellent analgesic properties, but also&#xD;
      because TEA reduces the postoperative stress response, accelerates the return of bowel&#xD;
      function, and lowers postoperative morbidity and mortality. However, TEA is associated with&#xD;
      additional costs, need for close monitoring and nursing. Once successfully established, TEA&#xD;
      requires constant attention from skilled nurses and anaesthetists often from an acute pain&#xD;
      service to achieve and maintain optimal analgesia. Attention must also be directed to&#xD;
      limiting or avoiding side-effects such as hypotension or motor block, which will reduce the&#xD;
      benefits of the technique by preventing the patient from mobilizing effectively after&#xD;
      operation.In addition each supplemental day with an indwelling TEA catheter increases the&#xD;
      risk of infection, which is associated with a high morbidity. The mean length of stay of the&#xD;
      TEA catheter in cystectomy patients at the investigators' institution is 6 days. If the risk&#xD;
      of epidural infection is low (estimated 1:2000 in Switzerland, this risk increases the longer&#xD;
      the epidural catheter is left in place. It is recommended to re-assess the risk/benefit ratio&#xD;
      of TEA after 4 days, if not sooner. Therefore, it is important to develop strategies that&#xD;
      reduce the duration of TEA without impairing the benefits. Enhanced recovery after surgery&#xD;
      protocols, which have been established for colorectal surgery in the last 10 years, recommend&#xD;
      removing the TEA catheter in the morning of postoperative day (POD) 2, which does not impair&#xD;
      the return of the gastrointestinal function. However, while this approach is well established&#xD;
      for colorectal surgery, there is less evidence for small bowel surgery or cystectomy with&#xD;
      urinary diversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic analgesics with prolonged-release oral formulation like oral oxycodone (Oxycontin®)&#xD;
      or combined drug mixture (oral oxycodone/naloxone (Targin®)) could be a valuable alternative&#xD;
      pain treatment as a second analgesic step, starting on POD 3, so that the epidural catheter&#xD;
      could be removed earlier without impairing postoperative enhanced recovery including return&#xD;
      of the bowel function. Both oxycodone and naloxone orally administered are a recognized and&#xD;
      accepted treatment option.The selected dosages of both orally administered drugs are in&#xD;
      accordance with the literature and follow the recommendation of the manufacturers. In&#xD;
      addition the dosages reflect the clinical practice of the investigators' institution. These&#xD;
      drugs are daily used in a clinical setting in their pain service. The implementation of a&#xD;
      placebo controlled group is considered as a gold standard approach in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial aiming to assess the benefit of a drug for a specific indication. In addition, a rescue&#xD;
      pain medication is implanted in the protocol. Rescue medication for breakthrough pain will be&#xD;
      additional epidural boluses of 5 ml, limited to maximum one bolus per h. In case of&#xD;
      persistent pain, orally administered of 5 mg oxycodone every 4-6 hours will be allowed by the&#xD;
      ward nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect, by administering oxycodone/naloxone in the early postoperative&#xD;
      period to reduce the length of TEA without impairing the return of the bowel function. This&#xD;
      could reduce the risk induced by the prolonged TEA (i.e. local infection, malfunction) and&#xD;
      costs (pain service). This can result in the implementation in the future of a new&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia concept with the early postoperative administration of an oral pain&#xD;
      killer, reducing the length of epidural analgesia without impairing the enhanced recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 90 patients (30 per group) undergoing cystectomy with urinary diversion with&#xD;
      perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Batches and blinding will be organized by Mundipharma Medical Company (Basel, Switzerland)&#xD;
      and provided by Mundipharma Research GmbH &amp; Co. KG granting good manufacturing practice&#xD;
      (GMP). As Targin tablets are oblong in shape and the Oxycontin tablets are round a double&#xD;
      dummy approach is inevitable to warrant the fully blinding. It will not be able to optically&#xD;
      recognize the type of drugs administered. The one will contain only placebo, the second 20mg&#xD;
      of oxycodone (Oxycontin®) and the third a mixture of oxycodone (20mg) and naloxone (10mg)&#xD;
      (Targin®). Drugs will be orally administered at 12 hours intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study nurses on the Department of Urology will bring the randomized blinded drugs to the&#xD;
      intermediate care unit in a sealed package, only described with only the name of the included&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will allow for blinding of the patient, the patient's nurses of the IMC and ward and&#xD;
      urologist, and data assessor (including pain service).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be done by computer generated list, with blocks of 10 patients; allocation&#xD;
      will be left in concealed opaque and numbered envelopes. Patients will be included strictly&#xD;
      according to the lowest number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The annual case load of cystectomy is around 100 in the investigators' institution per year.&#xD;
      The investigators expect to recruit the participants within 24 months. To ensure that the&#xD;
      study can be conducted in the anticipated timeframe, an interim analysis of recruitment is&#xD;
      scheduled 1 year after Swissmedic study approval. If the recruitment remains below&#xD;
      expectations and completion of the study in a timely manner is jeopardized, this would result&#xD;
      in abandoning the Oxycodone arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven days (inclusion the day before surgery, finished after removal of the epidural&#xD;
      catheter)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time course of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission day:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed patient consent, patients will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of surgery till POD 3, morning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start after cystectomy combined with urinary diversion is successfully&#xD;
      performed in combined anesthesia (general plus TEA). After closure of the abdominal wall,&#xD;
      continuous epidural analgesia will be maintained with bupivacaine 1.25mg/ml using an&#xD;
      ambulatory infusion pump. The initial infusion rate will be 8 ml/h, with additional bolus&#xD;
      volumes of 4 ml (lockout time: 1 h). The infusion rate can be adapted if necessary based on&#xD;
      assessments made every 4 h to maintain a pain intensity lower than 3 at rest and lower than 5&#xD;
      during mobilization on the numeric rating scale (NRS), where 0=no pain and 10=worst pain&#xD;
      imaginable. The maximum infusion rate will be 10 ml/h. This epidural treatment is in&#xD;
      accordance with the investigators' internal standard and has been successfully implemented in&#xD;
      the last 15 years. Data on pain intensity, amount of epidural mixture used per 24 h and use&#xD;
      of rescue analgesics will be recorded daily. In addition, episodes of PONV, first flatus and&#xD;
      defecation and body weight will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POD 3 around 08:00 a.m.:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the randomization, patients will receive blinded batches with 20mg oxycodone,&#xD;
      20mg oxycodone plus 10mg naloxone or oral placebo every 12 h, starting with 10 mg bid&#xD;
      respectively 10mg/5mg and move to 20 mg bid (20mg/10mg) the other day. Epidural mixture&#xD;
      infusion will be reduced in steps of 2 ml according to the NRS score to maintain a pain&#xD;
      intensity lower than 3 at rest and lower than 5 during mobilization during 6 h. The epidural&#xD;
      catheter will be removed when during 6 h the rate is 2 ml/h, and the patient has a NRS &lt; 3&#xD;
      and &lt; 5 at rest and during mobilisation, respectively. If the epidural catheter cannot be&#xD;
      removed because of the subcutaneous administration of low weighted molecular heparin (LWMH)&#xD;
      (always around 20:00), the infusion will be stopped (0 ml/h) and the length of stay of the&#xD;
      epidural catheter registered (length of stay of the epidural catheter= insertion of the&#xD;
      catheter to rate of epidural mixture =0ml/h), and the catheter will be removed according to&#xD;
      the investigators' internal guideline (at least 12 h after subcutaneous administration of&#xD;
      LWMH). The time the epidural infusion was stopped will be recorded as removal of the epidural&#xD;
      catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the implementation of an oral opioid with or&#xD;
      without naloxone in the early postoperative period in patients undergoing cystectomy and&#xD;
      urinary diversion with intraoperative and early postoperative use of TEA. The investigators&#xD;
      expect an unchanged early return of the bowel function and equal analgesia with a reduced&#xD;
      length of stay of the epidural catheter (primary endpoint), thus potentially reducing&#xD;
      epidural catheter associated complications and lowering costs (nursing and pain service).&#xD;
