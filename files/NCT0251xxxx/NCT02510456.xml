      This study seeks to enroll women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of an investigational imaging technology known as Diffuse Optical&#xD;
      Spectroscopy Imaging (DOSI) in predicting patient response to chemotherapy treatment. DOSI is&#xD;
      a noninvasive imaging method that uses harmless near-infrared light using simple wearable&#xD;
      probes held against the skin by transparent dressings to predict tumor metabolic activity. It&#xD;
      uses nonionizing radiation, requires no external contrast agent and uses low light exposure&#xD;
      to human tissue. DOSI scans can be performed frequently at the bedside in settings such as a&#xD;
      doctor's office or infusion center.&#xD;

      This study seeks to enroll women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of an investigational imaging technology known as Diffuse Optical&#xD;
      Spectroscopy Imaging (DOSI) in predicting patient response to chemotherapy treatment. DOSI is&#xD;
      a noninvasive imaging method that uses harmless near-infrared light using simple wearable&#xD;
      probes held against the skin by transparent dressings to predict tumor metabolic activity. It&#xD;
      uses nonionizing radiation, requires no external contrast agent and uses low light exposure&#xD;
      to human tissue. DOSI scans can be performed frequently at the bedside in settings such as a&#xD;
      doctor's office or infusion center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSI has already shown promise in monitoring breast cancer patients undergoing preoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Several groups have demonstrated optical changes predictive of response in the&#xD;
      course of weeks to months of treatment. The investigators group has begun to show that DOSI&#xD;
      measurements during drug infusions and at early time-points (first 24 hours) correlate with&#xD;
      tumor final pathological response. While this data is provocative, significantly more work is&#xD;
      needed to confirm that early time-points are predictive in different treatment groups and&#xD;
      tumor molecular subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, breast cancer patients will receive DOSI scans at a subset or all of the&#xD;
      following time-points: baseline, during drug infusion, early therapy, mid-therapy and&#xD;
      post-therapy. DOSI results will be compared to standard of care pathology results determined&#xD;
      after surgery. Additionally, the investigators will correlate DOSI parameters with any&#xD;
      additional biopsy specimens taken during treatment (typically for patients on adaptive&#xD;
      treatment trials). Each DOSI scan will take about 30-60 minutes/ session, although infusion&#xD;
      measurements will take longer. DOSI can potentially help doctors to gain information&#xD;
      necessary to make evidence-based changes in treatment strategies of individual patients. The&#xD;
      investigators long-term goal is to provide oncologists with a relatively simple, risk-free&#xD;
      bedside tool that can help predict response early, thereby maximizing therapeutic response&#xD;
      and minimizing unnecessary toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of 10 additional patients with breast cancer who are not receiving neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (NAC) who will only be measured at baseline has been created. Complete&#xD;
      characterization of baseline properties in patients is essential for understanding subsequent&#xD;
      changes from baseline in response to chemotherapy. Adding an additional 10 patients who are&#xD;
      not receiving NAC to be enrolled will allow for better characterization of baseline&#xD;
      properties, which in turn will allow for a better understanding of the changes in properties&#xD;
      seen in those patients who are undergoing NAC.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will have up to 9 DOSI scans at 6 different time points during the course of their neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The time course of chemotherapy may vary between 3-9 months depending on the type chemotherapy subjects receive. Depending on chemotherapy schedule, subjects may or may not be asked to participate in all the 6 measurement time points. The number of DOSI scans each subject requires will be decided during consent. Each DOSI scan will take about 30-60 minutes, although scans at infusion time point will take longer in total due to repeated or continuous measurements.</description>
