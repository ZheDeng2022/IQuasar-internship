    <textblock>
      This Pharmacokinetic (PK) study is going to provide supplemental PK data for supporting&#xD;
      bipolar Phase III study for New Drug Application (NDA) filing according to regulatory&#xD;
      requirement. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the PK of lamotrigine&#xD;
      following repeat dosing of lamotrigine dispersible tablet in healthy Chinese subjects. This&#xD;
      study consisted of Screening Phase (Days-14 to 0), Open-label Phase (Days 1 to 51) and&#xD;
      follow-up Phase (10-17 days after last dosing). After signing the informed consent and&#xD;
      confirm the eligibility, subjects will start dosing with lamotrigine 25 mg dispersible tablet&#xD;
      once daily at Day 1 and remain at this dose level for two weeks (Days 1-14), then will be&#xD;
      titrated to 50 mg once daily at Day 15 and last for weeks 3-4 (Days 15-28), and then titrated&#xD;
      to 100 mg once daily at Day 29 during weeks 5-6 (Days 29-42). The total duration of the study&#xD;
      will be approximately 10 weeks including screening and follow-up phase.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PK profile will be assessed by AUC (0-tau[24 hours]); Cmax; and accumulation ratios (Rcmax and Ro) following single and repeat dosing of lamotrigine dispersible tablet</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 14, 15, 28, 29, 42 and 44 to 51</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Days 1, 14, 28, and 42 before dosing (pre-dose) and at 0.5,1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours after administration. Other blood samples will be taken at 1 and 3 hours post dose on Day 15, and at 2 and 4 h post dose on Day 29. Additional blood samples will be taken at 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 and 216 hours after the administration of last dose on Day 42. Area under the concentration-time curve for a dose interval (AUC [0-tau{24 hours}]); observed maximum concentration (Cmax); and accumulation ratios (Rcmax and Ro) will be determined from the serum concentration-time data. Accumulation ratio will be calculated as follows: Ro = AUC(0-24) of Day14/AUC(0-24) of Day 1; and Rcmax = Cmax of Day14 / Cmax of Day 1</description>
