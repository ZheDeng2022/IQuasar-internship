      Hypothesis: Nosten® device is able to reduce the time of underinflated balloon and removes&#xD;
      excess pressure. This device may thus reduce the risk of ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP)&#xD;
      and early tracheal lesions resulting from intubation with decreased discomfort, morbidity,&#xD;
      and nursing workload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the investigators is to show that Nosten® device is more effective than&#xD;
      monitoring and manual inflation of the balloon of the tracheal tube to prevent VAP&#xD;
      occurrence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, controlled, prospective randomized open study with blinded assessment of the&#xD;
      primary endpoint. Two groups are set up: one experimental group with the control of the cuff&#xD;
      pressure by the Nosten® device versus one control group with the manual monitoring of the&#xD;
      cuff pressure and inflation of the balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion: All orotracheally intubated patients for an expected period &gt; 48 hours will be&#xD;
      selected. Inclusion will be decided using an algorithm adapted to each center to limit the&#xD;
      number of inclusion per month without any biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of required insclusion is 500, or 250 / group. This calculation is based on&#xD;
      the assumption that a frequency of 25% of patients having at least one VAP in the reference&#xD;
      strategy, ensuring a 80% power in the detection by Chi-2 test with a difference 10%. A&#xD;
      bilateral risk of first species determined at 5% was considered.&#xD;
