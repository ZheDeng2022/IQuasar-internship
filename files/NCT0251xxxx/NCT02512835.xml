  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social determinants of health (e.g. the income, education, and environment of patients) may&#xD;
      exert greater influence on health outcomes than traditional clinical factors (e.g. lab&#xD;
      results, diagnoses, and family history). Calls for integrating primary care and public health&#xD;
      are therefore increasing, but merging these domains of care is logistically difficult.&#xD;
      Research is lacking on the incremental benefit of adding public health data at the practice&#xD;
      level-- in improving either health outcomes or care delivery. This proof of concept pilot&#xD;
      will merge data from electronic health records (EHRs) with community vital signs, a set of&#xD;
      metrics that describes key community resources that affect health. The investigators will&#xD;
      identify resource poor communities, or cold spots, based on four variables (education,&#xD;
      poverty, life expectancy, and access to healthy foods) at the census tract level - referred&#xD;
      to as a community vital sign. The hypothesis is that patients coming from cold spots are more&#xD;
      likely to have worse health outcomes and that clinicians will deliver better care if they&#xD;
      know a patient's community context and his/her specific social needs. This study will involve&#xD;
      12 primary care practices in Northern Virginia that care for more than 170,000 patients.&#xD;
      Patient addresses will be geocoded for each practice and determine which patients reside in&#xD;
      cold spots for each community vital sign. The variation for each community vital sign for&#xD;
      each practice's patients will be calculated and a bivariate and regression analyses will be&#xD;
      used to determine whether coming from a cold spot is associated with worse clinical quality&#xD;
      metrics. 15 clinicians will be alerted when they see a patient from a cold spot, patients&#xD;
      will complete a social needs survey, and clinicians will prospectively document through&#xD;
      surveys whether such knowledge affects interpersonal interactions (such as time spent with&#xD;
      patients and the use of clearer language) or clinical management (such as referrals to care&#xD;
      coordination or community resources). By pragmatically integrating community vital signs into&#xD;
      care, this innovative proposal will seek to understand which community data clinicians value,&#xD;
      how these data might influence care, and how best to incorporate these data into clinical and&#xD;
      population care.&#xD;

      The investigators will integrate community vital signs into clinical data, identify cold&#xD;
      spots, and determine prospectively how clinicians use these community data at the point of&#xD;
      care and for populations of patients. The investigators hypothesize that (1) the patients in&#xD;
      a primary care practice live in a range of communities with different social determinants of&#xD;
      health, including cold spots that lack health-promoting resources, (2) community vital signs&#xD;
      are associated with patient health outcomes (e.g., being up-to-date with preventive care,&#xD;
      control of chronic conditions, morbidity), and (3) knowing that a patient resides in a cold&#xD;
      spot will help clinicians improve patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a: Determine community vital sign cold spots in the catchment area of 12 primary care&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b: Determine whether patients residing in cold spots experience worse outcomes, such as&#xD;
      receiving inadequate care, worse chronic disease control, or higher morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine whether knowing a patient's community vital signs and social needs at the&#xD;
      point of care will change clinical management; and explore how practices could use community&#xD;
      vital signs for population care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Identify other community vital signs that practices would find useful for managing&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
