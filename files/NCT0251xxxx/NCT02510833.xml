  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD), neurodegenerative and common from 50 to 60 years, is characterized&#xD;
      by rigidity, bradykinesia and resting tremor that can interfere in the quality of life. To&#xD;
      maintain or improve this, there is the physiotherapy. Problems in access, such as walking and&#xD;
      financial difficulties, make home exercises target of interest. The study aims to assess the&#xD;
      impact of a program of home therapeutic exercises, with individualized approach and remote&#xD;
      monitoring by physical therapist, about signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease and quality&#xD;
      of life. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial, conducted at the Program&#xD;
      Pró-Parkinson of the Clinics Hospital, Federal University of Pernambuco, Neurology Clinic.&#xD;
      Will be included people of both sexes (50 years) with idiopathic PD, stages 1-3 in Hoehn &amp;&#xD;
      Yahr original; non-institutionalized and independent walking. It will be applied before and&#xD;
      after 12 weeks of intervention (period ON of medication): Survey about Knowledge, Attitudes&#xD;
      and Practice; Questionnaire of Accession; Unified Scale Evaluation of Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (UPDRS) - subscales II and III; and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39).&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into two groups: Group continued intervention (GIC) and&#xD;
      control group (CG). The GIC will have an meeting with individualized approach (physical&#xD;
      therapist, patient and companion) for guidance on home physical therapy exercises, using the&#xD;
      Manual Pró-Parkinson, then the participant will receive the manual with stretching exercises,&#xD;
      mobility, balance and strength, which will lead to your home as a way to guide their&#xD;
      activities; and receive weekly follow-up by phone calls (to remember the exercises, answer&#xD;
      questions and encourage the continued practice). GC may be attend presentations on home&#xD;
      exercises of the Pro-Parkinson's manual in the days of your query and have the same manual&#xD;
      without remote follow-up by phone calls, usual service procedure. Exercises are oriented to&#xD;
      be performed three times a week for 12 weeks and under the effect of anti-Parkinson&#xD;
      medication. This study will contribute new evidence on the effects of a rehabilitation&#xD;
      program available and inexpensive based on home exercises.&#xD;

      Type of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program-oriented home therapeutic exercises with individualized approach and weekly&#xD;
      monitoring of the physical therapist contributes to the improvement of signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of home therapeutic exercises oriented in people with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practice about home therapeutic exercises&#xD;
           oriented in the study population;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify adhesion and barriers related to exercise program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of home-based therapeutic exercise about daily activities, motor&#xD;
           exploration and the quality of life in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed of the nature and purpose of the study. Then those who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and wish to participate, sign the Consent Agreement and Informed (IC).&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the Pró-Parkinson Program at the Hospital das Clinicas,&#xD;
      Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Neurology Clinic, between December/ 2014 to&#xD;
      September/2015. Will be applicable before and after 12 weeks of intervention ( medication ON&#xD;
      period): Survey about Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice; Questionnaire of Accession; Unified&#xD;
      Scale Evaluation of Parkinson's disease (UPDRS) - subscales II and III; and Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39). Participants will be randomized into two groups: Group&#xD;
      continued intervention (GIC) and control group (CG). GIC- Initially, a physiotherapist,&#xD;
      member of the Pró-Parkinson Program and responsible for this research, guide and train the&#xD;
      individual patient and his companion about physiotherapy exercises present in an illustrative&#xD;
      manual of the Pro-Parkinson. Also, there are lectures about the therapeutic exercises in in&#xD;
      medical consultation day. The exercises should be performed in his home three times a week&#xD;
      (every other day) with a maximum duration of 60 minutes each session for 12 weeks and always&#xD;
      under the influence of anti-Parkinsonian medications (ON period of medication). After the&#xD;
      meeting, receive the manual, if not yet available, and a daily exercises. In the diary, the&#xD;
      participant or caregiver should write down the exercises, reporting the day, time, held all&#xD;
      or not and difficulties for subsequent control of the responsible researcher. Participants&#xD;
      will receive weekly calls from physiotherapist at the agreed time with the participant and /&#xD;
      or caregiver, to remind them of the exercises, answer questions and encourage them to&#xD;
      continue the practice. It is emphasized that if the participant and caregiver this are not&#xD;
      able to write in the diary, the data will be questioned by the researcher in his weekly phone&#xD;
      call, without prejudice to the control. Physiotherapist phone numbers will be available for&#xD;
      participants in the daily exercises. GC- participants and accompanying persons may attend the&#xD;
      lectures of the service (including the Physical Therapy) and have the same manual, without&#xD;
      the subsequent weekly follow-up phone calls, usual service procedure. The lectures take place&#xD;
      every Wednesday in day consultation, two meetings / month for the physiotherapy team. These&#xD;
      have a maximum duration of 40 minutes in which patients and caregivers are instructed and&#xD;
      trained to do the manual physical therapy exercises his home three times a week with a&#xD;
      maximum duration of 60 minutes each session and always under the influence anti-Parkinsonian&#xD;
      drugs (ON period of the medication). At the end of the talks, the manual is available. The&#xD;
      lectures are given by physiotherapists, properly trained, the Pro-Parkinson Program members.&#xD;
      The Pro-Parkinson manual, distributed in the program since 2012, covers chapters with&#xD;
      exercises and guidelines of medical areas, physiotherapy, speech therapy, occupational&#xD;
      therapy and dentistry. The physiotherapy section (page 10-21) includes stretching exercises,&#xD;
      mobility, balance and strength, plus the guidelines. It has general instructions for the&#xD;
      exercises; the sequence describing the same, self-explanatory illustrations and the number of&#xD;
      sets and reps / maintenance time to be realized. All exercises are designed so they could be&#xD;
      carried out independently and safely in the patient's home. Patients will be instructed to&#xD;
      make them with clothes that let free knees and sneakers or shoes (if there jump up to 2 cm)&#xD;
      that are attached to the ankle. The exercises will be supervised by the patient or caregiver,&#xD;
      own if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to the questionnaires, there may be the risk of embarrassment. To minimize the&#xD;
      same, the data collection will be held individually and enabling environment for data&#xD;
      confidentiality. If refuses to answer any question, no insistence, as well as any damage to&#xD;
      the participant. Pain, muscle discomfort or fatigue may occur during and after the exercises,&#xD;
      however, the patient will be advised to discontinue the exercises try a case considered&#xD;
      unbearable pain. To minimize these risks, the whole exercise program will be guided to be&#xD;
      held in range of motion and pain-free intensity for the safety. During the exercises, you can&#xD;
      also change the cardiorespiratory parameters such as blood pressure and respiratory rate. In&#xD;
      an attempt to minimize risk, will not participate in the study those who submit changes in&#xD;
      blood pressure levels and heart rate and respiratory considered beyond normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direction of this study will bring direct benefits to patients attending the service in&#xD;
      order to be a population with few resources to finance a rehabilitation treatment, or with&#xD;
      little or no access to such services as with patients in the state . This diagnosis of the&#xD;
      study population are described in Coriolanos et al. (2013) that describing the&#xD;
      epidemiological profile of patients with PD at HC/UFPE. Moreover, the results will contribute&#xD;
      to evidence-based therapeutic practice and the literary collection, fostering new studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study collections will be held at Pró-Parkinson Program at the Hospital das Clinicas,&#xD;
      Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Neurology Clinic, and each variable will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the responsible employees and physiotherapist, who will undergo a period of&#xD;
      training. Outcomes will be analyzed using statistical software SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL, USA). To verify the normality of the sample, the Shapiro-Wilk test is used. Upon&#xD;
      proof of normality, the results before and after the intervention will be compared within&#xD;
      groups, paired analysis, by means of the Wilcoxon test and intergroup, independent analysis,&#xD;
      using the Mann-Whitney test. To analyze the results of the Survey CAP and Adhesion, the&#xD;
      descriptive statistics from the frequency calculations will be made, high-low, median, mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation. The significance level is 0.05 on all analyses. Datas and images through&#xD;
      photographs will be stored on the personal computer of responsible physical therapist and&#xD;
      counselor, and there are two copies on CD compact disc/DVD. The responsibility of&#xD;
      confidentiality of data is the responsible physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size in Brazil: 28 (14 in the intervention group and 14 for control). To carry out the&#xD;
      sample size calculation, the investigators used the statistical program PASS (Power Analysis&#xD;
      and Sample Size), version 2005. After simulations, the investigators chose a minimum sample&#xD;
      size of 14 patients in the control group and 14 for the intervention group, totaling 28&#xD;
      patients. This number is capable of detecting, with a 82% test power and 5% significance&#xD;
      level, a reduction of 3 points in the PDQ-39 scale and UPDRS-Motor for the intervention group&#xD;
      compared with no reduction for the control group, using a one-tailed parametric or&#xD;
      non-parametric test for independent samples, considering the standard deviation of the&#xD;
      reduction on the order of 3 points to the two groups. For all calculations, the mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation parameters were expected based on studies Lun et al. (2005), Dereli and&#xD;
      Yaliman (2010), Navarro-Peternella and Marcon (2012), as well as clinical experience&#xD;
      Pró-Parkinson.&#xD;
