    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of&#xD;
      partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during sleep, leading to pauses of breathing&#xD;
      and arousals. Although previously considered as a local abnormality of the respiratory track,&#xD;
      it is nowadays recognized as a systemic disease and an important cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, since it is strongly associated with obesity (especially abdominal obesity) and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      Interestingly, recent hypotheses support that the metabolic syndrome pathology, including&#xD;
      insulin resistance, inflammation and oxidative stress may be involved in OSA pathogenesis.&#xD;
      The modification of lifestyle habits, e.g. in terms of diet and physical activity, is&#xD;
      currently explored as a mean of managing the disease in combination with the first line&#xD;
      treatment, i.e., the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep.&#xD;
      The available data support that weight loss, achieved through lifestyle modification,&#xD;
      effectively reduces the severity of OSA and improves the associated cardiometabolic disorders&#xD;
      in overweight or obese patients. However, studies exploring the potential effect of diet's&#xD;
      quality or other lifestyle habits (such as physical activity) on OSA severity, besides weight&#xD;
      loss, are currently lacking. Given that a Mediterranean dietary pattern, as well as other&#xD;
      lifestyle habits adopted by the populations in the Mediterranean region, have been proven&#xD;
      beneficial both for the prevention and the resolution of the metabolic syndrome and its&#xD;
      associated cardiometabolic diseases, the aim of the present randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      single-blind study is to implement an intensive intervention based on the Mediterranean&#xD;
      lifestyle (hypocaloric diet and 7 group lifestyle counselling sessions) and to evaluate its&#xD;
      potential benefits, compared with standard care (hypocaloric diet and written advice for&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle), in a sample of patients with OSA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent complete or&#xD;
      partial interruptions of breathing during sleep due to obstruction of the upper airways,&#xD;
      which leads to disturbances in gas exchange, hypoxia and consequent arousals. Beyond its&#xD;
      adverse impact on sleep duration, sleep quality, as well as the functionality and cognitive&#xD;
      function during the day (typical symptoms include fatigue, sleepiness, decreased reflexes,&#xD;
      impaired memory, etc.). OSA is currently recognized as a major cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality due to its strong association with obesity and cardiometabolic diseases, including&#xD;
      the metabolic syndrome (and its individual components, namely abdominal adiposity, impaired&#xD;
      fasting glucose, dyslipidaemia and hypertension), cardiovascular diseases and diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. According to epidemiological data, its prevalence ranges from 2% to 7% in the&#xD;
      general population (with a clear lead of obese middle-aged men), however it is estimated that&#xD;
      a large proportion of patients (70-80%) remain undiagnosed making the disease a major public&#xD;
      health challenge for the 21st century. Currently, the first line treatment for the management&#xD;
      of moderate-to-severe OSA or mild OSA accompanied by symptoms (such as daytime sleepiness and&#xD;
      cognitive disorders) and other diseases (such as hypertension and heart disease) is the&#xD;
      application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep, usually via a renal&#xD;
      mask. CPAP has been proven effective in alleviating the symptoms of the disease (e.g. pauses&#xD;
      of breathing during sleep and daytime sleepiness), however it is also characterized by high&#xD;
      rates of non-compliance and its effectiveness in improving cardiometabolic indices has not&#xD;
      yet been confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the strong relationship of OSA with obesity and its concomitant metabolic disorders, as&#xD;
      well as the aforementioned restrictions of the use of CPAP as the sole treatment for the&#xD;
      disease, lifestyle changes have currently emerged as a promising treatment for OSA. Indeed,&#xD;
      several interventional studies have investigated the effect of lifestyle changes on the&#xD;
      treatment of OSA, focusing primarily on weight loss - achieved through a hypocaloric diet,&#xD;
      either solely or in combination with exercise and lifestyle counselling - and the available&#xD;
      data support its effectiveness in reducing the severity of the disease and improving its&#xD;
      associated cardiometabolic disorders in overweight patients. However, studies exploring the&#xD;
      potential effect of diet's quality or other lifestyle habits (such as physical activity) on&#xD;
      OSA severity and associated disorders, besides weight loss, are currently lacking. Given that&#xD;
      a Mediterranean dietary pattern, as well as other lifestyle habits adopted by the populations&#xD;
      in the Mediterranean region, have been proven beneficial both for the prevention and the&#xD;
      resolution of the metabolic syndrome and its associated cardiometabolic diseases, the aim of&#xD;
      the present study is to implement an intervention based on the Mediterranean lifestyle and to&#xD;
      evaluate its potential beneficial effect on biochemical and clinical characteristics of a&#xD;
      sample of patients with OSA, compared with standard care. In addition, the superiority of a&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention based on the Mediterranean lifestyle to a dietary intervention based&#xD;
      only on the Mediterranean diet will be explored, in order to evaluate possible beyond-diet&#xD;
      benefits of the health-promoting lifestyle of the Mediterranean that also included reguiar&#xD;
      physical activity, adequate rest during the day, conviviality, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial. The study sample&#xD;
      will consist of adult (18-65 year old), overweight or obese (Body Mass Index &gt; 25 kg/m2)&#xD;
      patients with moderate or severe OSA (Apnea Hypopnea Index &gt; 15 events/hour) confirmed&#xD;
      through polysomnography at the Center of Sleep Disorders of the 1st Department of Critical&#xD;
      Care and Pulmonary Services of &quot;Evaggelismos&quot; General Hospital of Athens. At baseline,&#xD;
      patients will be informed in detail about the study and will give their written consent.&#xD;
      Then, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: (a) the control group, receiving&#xD;
      CPAP therapy and written general advice for a healthy lifestyle, (b) the Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      group (MDG), participating in a 6-month comprehensive weight-loss dietary intervention based&#xD;
      on the Mediterranean dietary pattern, and (c) the Mediterranean lifestyle group (MLG),&#xD;
      receiving the same intensive dietary intervention as the MDG in addition to other healthy&#xD;
      behaviours incorporated in the traditional lifestyle of the Mediterranean.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated in the two intensive intervention arms will attend a comprehensive&#xD;
      intervention, comprising seven 60-min group counselling sessions (up to 5 patients per group)&#xD;
      carried out in the laboratory of Clinical Nutrition &amp; Dietetics of Harokopio University of&#xD;
      Athens under the supervision of experienced clinical dietitians, conducted every two weeks&#xD;
      for the first 2 months and every month for the following 4 months until the end of the&#xD;
      6-month intervention. For both the MDG and the MLG, the intervention will aim at a 5-10%&#xD;
      weight loss during the 6-month period and an increase in the level of adherence to the&#xD;
      plant-based Mediterranean diet. Specifically, all food groups of the Mediterranean diet will&#xD;
      be targeted according to the pattern proposed in the Mediterranean diet pyramid (e.g.&#xD;
      increase in the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes, decrease in the&#xD;
      consumption of red meat and sweets, preference in olive oil as the main source of dietary&#xD;
      fat, prudent alcohol consumption, etc.), while beneficial culinary practices, as well as&#xD;
      seasonality and locality of food products consumed, will also be addressed. Patients&#xD;
      allocated in the MLG will additionally receive counselling on other lifestyle habits, with&#xD;
      emphasis on adopting a physically active lifestyle and achieving adequate rest during the day&#xD;
      (both night sleep and siesta nap), as parts of the healthy Mediterranean lifestyle. Dietary&#xD;
      or lifestyle counselling will be based on the goal setting theory, while motivational and&#xD;
      behavioural strategies will also be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of patients' clinical, laboratory and lifestyle characteristics will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline, at the end of the 6-month intervention and 1 year after the study&#xD;
      entry at the Center of Sleep Disorders of the 1st Department of Critical Care and Pulmonary&#xD;
      Services of &quot;Evaggelismos&quot; General Hospital of Athens. The evaluation will include: 1) brief&#xD;
      medical history assessment, 2) assessment of the severity of the disease through&#xD;
      polysomnography, 3) evaluation of insomnia through the Athens Insomnia Scale, 4) assessment&#xD;
      of daytime sleepiness through the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 5) evaluation of the quality of&#xD;
      life through the SF-36 questionnaire, 6) dietary assessment through a semiquantitative food&#xD;
      frequency questionnaire (data from the food frequency questionnaire will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      participants' food group and individual food and beverage consumption, as well as their&#xD;
      adherence to the Mediterranean diet through the Mediterranean Diet Score) and 24-hour dietary&#xD;
      recalls (data from the 24-h dietary recalls will be analysed in terms of energy, macro- and&#xD;
      micronutrient intake using the Nutritionist Pro, version 2.2 software, as well as of meal&#xD;
      frequency and patterns), 7) physical activity assessment through the International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire, 8) anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumference), 9) blood pressure measurement and 10) fasting blood sample and urine sample&#xD;
      collection for laboratory measurements (lipid profile, markers of glucose metabolism, markers&#xD;
      of liver function, inflammatory markers, markers of oxidative stress, etc.) using automated&#xD;
      analysers and/or commercial ELISA kits.&#xD;
