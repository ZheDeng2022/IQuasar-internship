  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With an increasingly ageing population the incidence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is&#xD;
      rising. With approximately one quarter of all PAD patients ultimately progressing to Critical&#xD;
      Limb Ischaemia (CLI), increased demands are being placed on vascular imaging to accurately&#xD;
      assess stenotic lesions. Early infrainguinal lesions (i.e. TASC A &amp; B) can be treated with&#xD;
      angioplasty+/- stenting and accurate assessment relies on the imaging gold standard of&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PAD often have concomitant co morbidities such as diabetes and chronic renal&#xD;
      impairment placing them at increased risk of developing contrast induced nephropathy (CIN)&#xD;
      when exposed to iodinated contrast media. High risk individuals with decreased eGFR &lt;60ml/min&#xD;
      have a risk of between 20-30% of developing CIN. They have increased morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      risks with a greater need for dialysis and prolonged in patient hospital stays. Ideally, the&#xD;
      investigators should be searching for ways to decrease the incidence of CIN. Animal studies&#xD;
      and more recently pilot human trials have shown that subjecting a remote vascular bed to a&#xD;
      brief ischaemic stress, followed by a period of reperfusion; in what has been termed remote&#xD;
      ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), may confer a protective benefit against the development of&#xD;
      CIN. This study aims to determine if RIPC can protect against CIN in patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective peripheral angiography for infrainguinal disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects between 3-10% of the population with prevalence&#xD;
      rates rising with age to 15-20% in patients over 70 [1]. Worldwide incidence rates are&#xD;
      rising, with the trend likely to persist with rising obesity and diabetes levels. Increasing&#xD;
      numbers of affected patients require angiography as either a diagnostic or a therapeutic&#xD;
      modality to improve peripheral blood flow and relieve the symptoms of CLI. The use of&#xD;
      iodinated contrast medium during either diagnostic or therapeutic procedures can lead to&#xD;
      contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) by direct toxic effects on renal tubular cells or by the&#xD;
      induction of renal ischemia. Contrast induced nephropathy is a leading cause of hospital&#xD;
      acquired acute kidney injury (AKI) and is defined as an acute deterioration in renal function&#xD;
      as defined by the relative increase in serum creatinine levels &gt;=25% or by a factor&#xD;
      &gt;=0.5mg/dl above baseline within 48 hours of administration of iv contrast in absence of&#xD;
      other causes of renal dysfunction [2],[3]. While the incidence of CIN in the general&#xD;
      population is only 2%, it rises in high risk patients to as high as 20-30% [4],[5]. Important&#xD;
      risk factors for the development of CIN include pre-existing impaired renal function,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, hypertension, increased age and congestive cardiac failure [5]. Depending&#xD;
      on the risks present varying percentages of patients will proceed to require temporary or&#xD;
      permanent dialysis, with inherently higher morbidity and mortality rates [5],[6],[7]. The&#xD;
      identification and appropriate management of these patients to prevent CIN is important to&#xD;
      decrease the associated accompanying morbidity and mortality in this patient cohort. Remote&#xD;
      ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been shown to confer benefit in both animal studies and&#xD;
      in patients undergoing coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large cohort study of 5787 patients with advanced PAD found that both moderate and severe&#xD;
      renal insufficiency were associated with increased odds of death. The 1 year mortality risk&#xD;
      was noted to be higher in patients with severe renal insufficiency (GFR&lt;30ml/min per 1.73m2)&#xD;
      (OR: 2.97 95%CI: 2.39-3.69) and they also tended to have a higher risk of presenting with&#xD;
      tissue damage (ischemic ulceration or gangrene) compared with individuals having normal renal&#xD;
      function (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 0.64-2.98) [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zaraca et al. in a recent systematic review reported on incidence of CIN of 9.2% in patients&#xD;
      undergoing vascular surgery [9]. Identifiable risk factors included age &gt;70yrs, high contrast&#xD;
      volume, pre exisiting renal disease and the use of antihypertensive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischaemic preconditioning is an endogenous mammalian mechanism whereby a brief period of&#xD;
      ischaemia and reperfusion confers resistance to subsequent prolonged ischaemic insults. First&#xD;
      observed in the canine heart, subsequent investigators noted that brief ischaemia in remote&#xD;
      organs e.g. skeletal muscle induced protection in key central organs e.g. the heart. This&#xD;
      remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) does not require direct interference with the target&#xD;
      organs' blood supply. It can be induced using blood pressure cuffs to produce brief episodes&#xD;
      of upper limb ischaemia and reperfusion. It confers protection upon numerous organs&#xD;
      simultaneously. RIPC reduces myocardial injury following aortic aneurysm repair, cardiac&#xD;
      surgery and angioplasty. It also reduces adverse ischaemic events up to six months following&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention, implying some medium-term effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date ischaemic conditioning has been applied primarily to the heart however animal studies&#xD;
      have shown pre conditioning to offer renal protection [11],[12]. Although direct application&#xD;
      of renal ischaemia is impractical, remote ischaemic conditioning applied prior to or during&#xD;
      angiography procedures may offer protection to the kidneys against CIN. Whittaker and&#xD;
      Przyklenk in 2011 explored this concept retrospectively using data from patients who had&#xD;
      undergone emergency angioplasty for ST elevation myocardial infarction [13]. The original&#xD;
      trial was a RCT which examined the protective effect of postconditioning on myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia [14]. The authors retrospectively examined if study patients treated with multiple&#xD;
      coronary balloon inflations had better renal function than patients not exposed to this&#xD;
      remote conditioning. They concluded that patients in the conditioning group received 25% more&#xD;
      contrast volume than the control group and showed no decline in renal function as&#xD;
      demonstrated by examination of glomerular filtration rate at day 3 post procedure in&#xD;
      comparison to the control group which saw a significant decline in renal function. Fikret et&#xD;
      al in 2012 in the Renal Protection Trial demonstrated a protective benefit with RIPC from the&#xD;
      development of CIN in high risk patients undergoing elective coronary angiography [15]. The&#xD;
      need for contrast-based procedures is rising, especially in vascular surgery with increasing&#xD;
      numbers of patients undergoing endovascular procedures, as is the incidence of post-contrast&#xD;
      renal failure, which has a reported mortality of 34% [16]. The potential use of RIPC&#xD;
      therefore to reduce the risk of kidney damage demands s further investigation in patients&#xD;
      with advanced peripheral arterial disease who are at an increased risk of developing CIN.&#xD;
