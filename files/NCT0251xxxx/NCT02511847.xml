  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      [Background]: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of expression of both&#xD;
      estrogen and progesterone receptor as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2&#xD;
      (HER-2). TNBC is characterized by distinct molecular, histological and unfavorable clinical&#xD;
      features despite the high rates of response to chemotherapy. Based on the above reasons, it&#xD;
      is important to emergently develop novel therapies and/or treatment strategies to increase&#xD;
      treatment efficacies and the survival rate of TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Rationale]: Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) and EGFR&#xD;
      mutation have been reported in TNBC and may therefore be a valid target for anti-tumor&#xD;
      therapy in TNBC. Afatinib (BIBW 2992) is an ErbB-family blocker that irreversibly inhibits&#xD;
      signaling from all relevant ErbB-family dimers. Afatinib has demonstrated preclinical&#xD;
      activity in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines and xenograft models of breast cancer,&#xD;
      and clinical activity in phase I studies. Based on the assumption that uncontrolled&#xD;
      ErbB-signaling is directly related to an increased oncogenic potential in TNBC, the studying&#xD;
      afatinib in the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC patients is important and provides a novel&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Aims] The primary endpoint is to evaluate the pathologic complete response of the&#xD;
      combination of afatinib and weekly paclitaxel in TNBC patients receiving neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment. The secondary endpoints are to evaluate the clinical response and safety of&#xD;
      afatinib with and without paclitaxel, and to explore the different afatinib-affecting&#xD;
      downstream molecular pathways as well as potential biomarkers predicting the response of&#xD;
      afatinib with and without paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Patients and methods]: Patients with TNBC (clinical T2-T3, N0-N1, M0; clinical T1-3, N1-2,&#xD;
      M0; or any T4a tumor) and received neoadjuvant treatment will included in this open, label,&#xD;
      multi-center phase II study. Our schema is as follows: (1) Afatinib 40 mg per day for 14&#xD;
      days, then evaluation, every subject will go into the following phase no matter whether she&#xD;
      had response or not (2) the following phase (the combination with afatinib and paclitaxel):&#xD;
      Afatinib 40 mg per day, day 1 to day 21, in combination with paclitaxel 80 mg/m² on days 1,&#xD;
      8, 15 in a 3-weekly course. In addition to the clinical assessment, we will evaluate the&#xD;
      potential predictive biological markers of activity of Afatinib with and without paclitaxel&#xD;
      and dynamic changes of molecular makers ([serum and tissue samples: before treatment, 2 weeks&#xD;
      after treatment, and operation timing]; potential molecules, such as EGFR, EGFR-signaling,&#xD;
      FGFR, FGFR-signaling, ERK, p53, NF-κB, and etc. were evaluated through the&#xD;
      immunohistochemical stains, mutation analysis, mRNA [RT-PCR], single nucleotide polymorphism&#xD;
      analysis, and FISH analysis). In addition, the genetic expression profiles will be compared&#xD;
      between afatinib-responsive and afatinib-unresponsive samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Expected Results]: The promising clinical activity, tolerable toxicity, and potential&#xD;
      biomarkers of afatinib with and without paclitaxel in TNBC patients receiving neoadjuvant&#xD;
      setting will be demonstrated. The results from this study can be used to conduct a larger&#xD;
      trial that would allow us to confirm or validate the hypotheses generated.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Primary Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of combination of afatinib and weekly paclitaxel as assessed by&#xD;
      pathologicalresponse in the residual tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Efficacy of afatinib as assessed by the ultrasound of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adverse effect of afatinib monotherapy and the combination of afatinib and weekly&#xD;
           paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlation between baseline potential biomarkers and radiological response of afatinib&#xD;
           monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Correlation between down- or up-regulation of potential biomarkers (in pre-treatment&#xD;
           biopsy and surgical specimen) and radiological response to afatinib and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify the pharmacodynamic biomarkers, the following translational researches will&#xD;
           be carried out on initial tumor biopsy and surgical specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the dynamic changes of circulating tumor cells and cell-free DNA after&#xD;
           afatinib monotherapy and after the combination of afatinib and weekly paclitaxel.&#xD;
