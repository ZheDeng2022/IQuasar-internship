  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate whether most closely HLA-matched&#xD;
      multivirus-specific T cell lines obtained from a bank of allogeneic virus-specific T cell&#xD;
      lines (VSTs) have antiviral activity against three viruses: EBV, CMV and adenovirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reconstitution of anti-viral immunity by donor-derived VSTs has shown promise in preventing&#xD;
      and treating infections associated with CMV, EBV and adenovirus post-transplant. However, the&#xD;
      time taken to prepare patient-specific products and lack of virus-specific memory T cells in&#xD;
      cord blood and seronegative donors, limits their value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative is to use banked partially HLA-matched allogeneic VSTs. A prior phase II study&#xD;
      at our institution using trivirus-specific VSTs generated using monocytes and EBV-transformed&#xD;
      B cells gene-modified with a clinical grade adenoviral vector expressing CMV-pp65 to activate&#xD;
      and expand specific T cells showed the feasibility, safety and activity of this approach for&#xD;
      the treatment of refractory CMV, EBV and Adenovirus infections. However, the production&#xD;
      process was lengthy, requiring 8-12 weeks, with exposure to biohazards (B95.8 EBV viral&#xD;
      strain and adenovector), while antigenic competition between different viral components&#xD;
      precluded increasing the spectrum of specificity beyond these three viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator have overcome these limitations and in the current trial, they will evaluate&#xD;
      whether rapidly generated, allogeneic most closely HLA-matched multivirus-specific VSTs,&#xD;
      activated using overlapping peptide libraries spanning immunogenic antigens from CMV,&#xD;
      adenovirus and EBV will be safe and produce anti-viral effects in allogeneic HSCT recipients&#xD;
      infected with one of more of the targeted viruses that are persistent despite conventional&#xD;
      anti-viral therapy. The study agent will be assessed for safety (stopping rules defined) and&#xD;
      antiviral activity.&#xD;

      Investigators evaluated the clinical utility of Multivirus VSTs in recipients of matched&#xD;
      related, matched unrelated, or haploidentical donor transplants. To date, 10 clinical-grade&#xD;
      multivirus-directed VSTs have been generated from donor PBMCs. These lines were polyclonal,&#xD;
      comprising both CD4+ (57±5%) and CD8+ (35±5%) cells and retained expression of the memory&#xD;
      markers CD45RO+CD62L+ (58±8%). Their specificity was dependent on the prior viral exposure of&#xD;
      the cell donor; 7/8 tested lines had activity against Adv,8/8 against CMV, 6/8 against EBV.&#xD;
      None of the lines reacted against recipient PHA blasts - indicating lack of alloreactive&#xD;
      potential in these rapidly generated lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators administered these multivirus-specific donor-derived VSTs to 3 allogeneic HSCT&#xD;
      recipients in a dose escalation study all on DL1 (5x106/m2). There were no immediate infusion&#xD;
      toxicities, and no de novo acute GvHD, demonstrating the in vivo safety of these mVST.&#xD;
      Further, antiviral efficacy has been observed in 1 patient with refractory CMV. In addition,&#xD;
      in a recently published paper from Baylor College of Medicien (Anapoulous et al, STM 2014)&#xD;
      they have treated VSTs manufactured with a similar methodology, but targeting 5 viruses&#xD;
      instead of 3 with specificity to BK virus and HHV6. In that study 10 patients were treated&#xD;
      with 4 on DL1 (5x10e6/m2), 4 on DL2 (1x10e7/m2) and 2 on DL3 (2x10e7/m2) and again saw no&#xD;
      immediate infusion toxicities, and no de novo acute GvHD, demonstrating the in vivo safety of&#xD;
      these mVST. Three patients received the cells as viral prophylaxis (days 38-43 post-HSCT) and&#xD;
      none developed viral infections at up to 3 months post-treatment. The other 7 patients&#xD;
      received the cells as treatment for one or more active infections between days 59-139&#xD;
      post-HSCT. Based on viral load measurements by day 42 post-infusion, the VSTs were successful&#xD;
      in controlling active infections with CMV (1 complete (CR) and 1 partial response (PR)), EBV&#xD;
      (2 CRs, including a case of frank PTLD); Adv (1 CR); HHV6 (1 CR); and BK (3 CR, 1 PR, 1NR).&#xD;
      Of note, 3 BK virus responders had tissue disease with severe hemorrhagic cystitis and all&#xD;
      had marked improvement or disappearance of hematuria following infusion. One patient&#xD;
      subsequently had an episode of transient but severe bladder pain in association with&#xD;
      inflammation seen on cytoscopy coincident with a 6 log fall in urine BK viral load. Only&#xD;
      non-responder was a patient with BK infection whose line lacked activity for this virus,&#xD;
      likely reflecting the serostatus of the donor. In addition, 3 patients subsequently&#xD;
      reactivated other viruses than those for which they were initially treated, but all cleared&#xD;
      these infections by week 12, without the requirement for additional cell infusions (CMV: 1CR;&#xD;
      EBV: 1CR; BK: 1CR; HHV6: 1CR). Finally, 1 patient received multivirus specific VSTs under a&#xD;
      single patient protocol as an emergency treatment for widespread and bulky&#xD;
      rituximab-resistant EBV-PTLD. Post VST treatment there was an immediate decline in the&#xD;
      patient's EBV viral load with complete and sustained resolution of PTLD, coincident with an&#xD;
      increase in circulating EBV-specific T cells. However, the profound anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      mediated by the rapidly-expanding EBV-directed T cells also produced a transient systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome, which was controlled with steroids and anti-TNFR antibody,&#xD;
      with no long term adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, infusion of donor-derived, multivirus specific VSTs generated with clinical grade&#xD;
      pepmixes and infused either prophylactically or as treatment for one or more viral infections&#xD;
      has been safe and is associated with the appearance of virus-reactive T cells in peripheral&#xD;
      blood that have been able to control infection with above mentioned viruses.&#xD;
