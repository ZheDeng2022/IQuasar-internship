    <textblock>
      In today's society, the search for keeping up with the appearance with no visible signs of&#xD;
      aging has become common. Therefore, many therapies to try to mitigate these senility markers&#xD;
      are present in specialized clinics. Such therapies seek grounding in the theories of how the&#xD;
      skin and its appendages respond to the aging process, causing this way, they can be created&#xD;
      ways to slow or minimize wrinkles and other consequences of this natural biological process.&#xD;
      However, this process can be accelerated by exposure to ultraviolet light such as to toxic&#xD;
      substances as well as tobacco, among others. The low-power laser and light emitted diode&#xD;
      (LED) characterized by being non-ablative light source, which means phototherapy which does&#xD;
      not cause physical damage to the epidermis, as the case of CO2 laser ablative and other&#xD;
      methods. This study has the purpose of comparing the effects of combined application of low&#xD;
      level laser with LED and LED action alone in facial rejuvenation. For this, the analysis of&#xD;
      these effects will be conducted through digital photography, blinded assessment and customer&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study seen the lack of studies on the subject chosen for a sample calculation&#xD;
      accurately be defined. This will be done by 32 volunteers, respecting the criteria for&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion previously cited by reading and signing the Informed Consent and&#xD;
      Clarified. The sample comprises a total of 30 subjects, divided randomly into two groups with&#xD;
      16 subjects in each. The first group will make use of both techniques in combined study:&#xD;
      Infrared Laser and Led Amber. The second group, in turn, will use only the Led Amber.These&#xD;
      will be allocated randomly and intervention will be simple blind.They will be held 10&#xD;
      sessions in individual applications, both group 1 (Laser and LED) and group 2 (LED) and&#xD;
      applications for two groups will occur once per week. Group 1 will make the application of&#xD;
      the two techniques on the same day session. Both will be applied in the following areas of&#xD;
      the face: chin / perioral, nasolabial folds, periorbital, frontal and glabellar region. Both&#xD;
      groups act as their own controls before starting the sessions, to ensure that the changes&#xD;
      observed in the skin is caused by the treatment of fact and not the environment. For this,&#xD;
      the volunteers will be accompanied during the first month, with completion of a photograph at&#xD;
      the beginning of the month to another month-end, as well as a questionnaire at the end of 30&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To monitor the results, will be held 4 shoots of the subjects in the study. The first session&#xD;
      will take place at the first meeting with the patients, who will undergo a 4-week follow-up&#xD;
      without using any methodology. After these four weeks, a new shoot will be held to determine&#xD;
      whether the environment was able to promote changes in the skin of patients or not. After&#xD;
      this, it will start to bare-sessions. After five sessions of treatment, a new picture for&#xD;
      monitoring will be held, and repeated this procedure at the end of treatment for so yes,&#xD;
      compare the images and get search results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To carry out the photos, there will be a standard procedure in order to maintain quality, the&#xD;
      angle and the light always the same, so that the results observed can be truthful fact.&#xD;
      Initially, the face of the patient will be cleaned, particularly aiming at the removal of&#xD;
      cosmetic and excess oil on the surface to be photographed. This will precede the photographic&#xD;
      record in at least 5 minutes so that friction marks and flushing fall apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, the patients with the prisoners hair (or using burrows), will be photographed&#xD;
      standing in front and lateral planes (both sides), parallel to the plane of the camera&#xD;
      sensor. To better guide them, will be applied on the floor marks with the positions of the&#xD;
      feet, to be followed.A camera mounted on the tripod, level and horizontal position, with the&#xD;
      105mm lens will be placed in proper height for framing the mouth, forehead and brows. The&#xD;
      framework of each area will follow the alignment of facial landmarks to the camera's&#xD;
      viewfinder grid in live view mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To photograph the brow area both iris will be aligned with the intersections between the line&#xD;
      dividing the room and the lower horizontal lines that divide the extreme vertical side rooms&#xD;
      of the grid. To shoot the mouth area &quot;Cheilion&quot; the two points will be aligned respectively&#xD;
      with the intersections between the line that bisects the grid and the lines that divide the&#xD;
      extreme horizontal side rooms. To photograph the area of the forehead (both sides) and the&#xD;
      &quot;Exocanthion&quot; and &quot;Otobasion Superious&quot; points will be aligned with the intersections between&#xD;
      the line that bisects the grid and the lines that divide the extreme horizontal side rooms.&#xD;
      The flash is mounted on the hot shoe of the camera, set in TTL mode with the driven diffuser&#xD;
      and will have its head directed forward. The camera will be displayed in manual mode, with&#xD;
      f5.6 aperture, shutter speed to 1/60 second and 200 ISO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the collection and collation, registration and randomization of the obtained&#xD;
      photographs, there will be the evaluation of research students, who will receive the photos&#xD;
      in random order and will have to put them in expected development order for a rejuvenation&#xD;
      treatment. After learning the correct order, there will quantify the improvements in fine&#xD;
      lines of the four areas chosen for analysis. In addition, two blind evaluators will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the project by analyzing the same way that researchers students.&#xD;
      The external evaluators will be the ones who will have knowledge of what method the person&#xD;
      was exposed. The evaluator will not know whether or not a placebo group in the study. Still,&#xD;
      it is important to consider that the designated evaluator will be a person with extensive&#xD;
      knowledge about the skin and possible treatments the same, so you can see exactly if there&#xD;
      were no improvements or the skin of the participants. The analysis of the photos will take&#xD;
      place in three steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slides with 3 or 4 photographs of each subject in random order (black and white photographs&#xD;
      to color hair, earrings, not to interfere in the result).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluator should classify the images in the order of 1-4, with 1 being the worst picture,&#xD;
      and 4 the best (relative expression lines, skin texture and brightness) (it is expected that&#xD;
      the treatment has left the skin better, so this sort order).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be received 4 slides pertaining to each subject, each containing the pictures of&#xD;
      the respective regions assessed: frontal, nasolabial, periorbital, glabellar. Along with&#xD;
      this, evaluators will be delivered to a table so that they can put the sort order of 1-4 each&#xD;
      presented slide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slide with a picture before starting treatment and the final photograph arranged&#xD;
      chronologically (photographs in black and white).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessor should note the first and last picture of each region of each treated patient (4&#xD;
      regions per patient) and classify the changes in one of the degrees of the scale below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0% = no change regarding the improvement of fine lines / wrinkles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1% - 25% = little change regarding the improvement of fine lines / wrinkles, difficult to&#xD;
      observe 25-50% = there has been a change regarding the improvement of fine lines / wrinkles,&#xD;
      but nothing extremely significant 50% or more = a change in relation to improvement of fine&#xD;
      lines / wrinkles is visible, the skin really improved considerably&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slides containing two images of each patient in a more central area of the face (Vintage&#xD;
      Photography).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluator will receive the slides containing a photograph before the start of treatment&#xD;
      and the last shot of each volunteer performed relating to a face of the central region. It is&#xD;
      the evaluator understand the following items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Voluntary skin had spots? Yes or no?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If stains showed there was a difference in the amount (uniformity) of the skin before&#xD;
           and after treatment? Yes or no?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, throughout this study of customer satisfaction questionnaires will be carried&#xD;
      out in order to monitor whether the patient is enjoying the treatment, it is believed that is&#xD;
      actually running (sorting qualitivamente the improvement of fine lines) and recommend this to&#xD;
      other people.Thus, the treatment becomes, in general, valuable, since it is known that on the&#xD;
      market, the transmission from one person to another feature of procedures that results is an&#xD;
      efficient form of this disclosure. Such tests will be done in the middle of treatment (5&#xD;
      sessions) and at the end of it (10 sessions) to compare whether there was a change of the&#xD;
      view in the meantime.&#xD;
