    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm, phase II trial of Olaparib for PDAC patients with&#xD;
      BRCAness. All study subjects will receive Olaparib in a dose of 300 mg p.o twice daily.&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until progression, intolerable toxicity or as per patient preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of Olaparib monotherapy in stage IV pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC)with BRCAness (BRCA-Breast Cancer susceptibility gene).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An open label, single arm, phase II trial of Olaparib for PDAC patients with BRCAness&#xD;
      (BRCA-Breast Cancer susceptibility gene).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with previously identified Loss of ATM (ATM serine/threonine kinase)by IHC OR-&#xD;
      Family history of BRCA-associated cancers: breast, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric or prostate&#xD;
      must be present in 2 or more first-degree relatives OR- Patients with previously identified&#xD;
      genetic aberrations that are associated with HRD will be eligible [e.g. somatic BRCA&#xD;
      mutation, Fanconi Anemia gene or RAD51(eukaryote gene) mutations].&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be retrospectively investigated for HRD(Homologous recombination repair&#xD;
      deficiencies) signature using transcriptome profiling and ATM expression and the results&#xD;
      correlated with PARPi (Polyadenosine 5'diphosphoribose [poly (ADP ribose)] polymerisation&#xD;
      INHIBITOR) response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive treatment with Olaparib tablets p.o 300 mg twice daily until&#xD;
      progression. Each treatment cycle is described as 28 days long. Patients will have tumor&#xD;
      assessments according to RECIST 1.1(Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) at&#xD;
      baseline. Patients will then be followed for the final analysis of OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be those patients with stage IV pancreas cancer previously treated for&#xD;
      metastatic disease. Patients must have received one prior therapy for the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic disease or refused chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following study entry, patients will attend clinic visits every two weeks for the first 4&#xD;
      weeks of treatment (Days 1 and 15,). Patients will then attend clinic visits every 4 weeks&#xD;
      whilst on study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should continue to receive study treatment until objective radiological disease&#xD;
      progression as per RECIST as assessed by the investigator and as long as in the&#xD;
      investigator's opinion they are benefiting from treatment and they do not meet any other&#xD;
      discontinuation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following discontinuation of study treatment, patients should be seen at 30 days post&#xD;
      discontinuation for the evaluations outlined in the study schedule. Patients will be&#xD;
      contacted in the 7 days following a specified date (data cut-off date) to capture survival&#xD;
      status at that point for each survival analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have tumor assessments according to RECIST at baseline and every 8 weeks&#xD;
      (±1week) up to 40 weeks and then every 12 weeks (±1 week) relative to date of enrolment until&#xD;
      objective radiological disease progression according to modified RECIST criteria. Ongoing&#xD;
      collection of site review tumor assessment is required and must be recorded in the electronic&#xD;
      case report form (eCRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient who discontinues study treatment for reasons other than objective radiological&#xD;
      progression should continue to undergo scheduled objective tumor assessments according to the&#xD;
      study schedule,in order to assess objective radiological progression of disease. Failure to&#xD;
      do so may result in bias to the study results.&#xD;
