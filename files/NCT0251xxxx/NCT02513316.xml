      Study I: CROMIS-2 (AF) Prospective cohort study of patients anticoagulated after&#xD;
      cardioembolic stroke An observational inception cohort study (n=1425) of patients throughout&#xD;
      the United Kingdom (UK) - (79 hospitals) started on best practice oral anticoagulant (without&#xD;
      prior use) for presumed cardioembolic ischaemic stroke due to non-valvular AF with follow up&#xD;
      for the occurrence of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and ischaemic stroke for an average of&#xD;
      two years. The main baseline exposures (risk factors of interest) are the presence of&#xD;
      cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and genetic polymorphisms in&#xD;
      candidate genes with potential functional relevance to ICH risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II: CROMIS-2 (ICH) Observational and genetics study of intracerebral haemorrhage The&#xD;
      investigators will also recruit 600 patients admitted to participating centres with ICH (with&#xD;
      a target of at least 300 anticoagulant-related ICH cases) and collect DNA to increase the&#xD;
      power of the genetic studies. The investigators will collect clinical and imaging data from&#xD;
      these ICH cases to investigate risk factors associated with anticoagulant-related ICH&#xD;
      compared to non anticoagulant-related ICH.&#xD;

      Background Over the last decade, increasing use of oral anticoagulants to prevent&#xD;
      cardioembolic ischaemic stroke due to atrial fibrillation (AF) in an ageing population has&#xD;
      led to a five-fold increase in the incidence of anticoagulant-related intracranial&#xD;
      haemorrhage (ICH) - a rare but unpredictable and catastrophic complication. Cerebral&#xD;
      microbleeds (CMBs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may predict ICH risk, as may genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms influencing brain small-vessel integrity or anticoagulation stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims To establish the value of CMBs and genetic factors in predicting symptomatic ICH&#xD;
      following best practice oral anticoagulation to prevent recurrent ischaemic stroke due to AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods CROMIS-2: Study I (AF) - Prospective, multicentre, inception cohort study in 1425&#xD;
      patients with ischaemic stroke due to AF started on best practice oral anticoagulation.&#xD;
      Patients will have genetic testing and standardized MRI including Gradient recalled Echo&#xD;
      (GRE) at baseline, with follow-up by postal questionnaire (and clinical assessment or medical&#xD;
      records surveillance after suspected events), and where possible there will be an in person&#xD;
      clinical assessment at 2 years. The investigators will compare the rate of symptomatic ICH&#xD;
      between CMB and CMB-free patients and test for associations with plausible candidate genes.&#xD;
      The investigators aim to develop and validate a risk model to predict symptomatic ICH&#xD;
      following best practice oral anticoagulation to prevent recurrent ischaemic stroke due to AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CROMIS-2: Study II (ICH) - An observational study of ICH investigating genetic, clinical and&#xD;
      radiological risk factors associated with anticoagulant-related ICH. The investigators will&#xD;
      recruit patients admitted to participating centres with ICH (with a target of at least 300&#xD;
      anticoagulant-related ICH cases) and collect DNA to increase the power of the genetic&#xD;
      studies. The investigators will collect clinical and imaging data from these ICH cases to&#xD;
      investigate risk factors associated with anticoagulant-related ICH compared to non&#xD;
      anticoagulant-related ICH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes A successful predictive model for ICH risk after best practice oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation for AF will help to determine whether genetic or CMB screening should be used&#xD;
      in clinical practice and future trials. New genetic, clinical and radiological risk factors&#xD;
      associated with anticoagulant-related ICH will be identified.&#xD;
