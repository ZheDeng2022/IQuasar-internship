  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early detection of viable residual tumor or early neoplastic recurrence represents a real&#xD;
      challenge in monitoring patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The locoregional recurrence rate is indeed high (up 40%) over the first two years of this&#xD;
      therapeutic method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional imaging methods such as CT and MRI appear limited in terms of sensitivity&#xD;
      because of the many post-treatment changes are fibrosis, tissue edema and the tissue&#xD;
      distortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET-CT 18F-FDG proves to be a non-invasive, reliable for the detection of residual tumor and&#xD;
      metastasis, even in the absence of clinical signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the acquired CT examination in the same time and in the same position that PET is&#xD;
      performed without iodinated contrast injection, used for anatomical identification and&#xD;
      attenuation correction of PET fused images. The patient usually has a second CT imaging,&#xD;
      centered on the neck with contrast injection iodized within the radiology department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no team has yet studied the interest of the PET-CT 18F-FDG coupled with a CT scan&#xD;
      with contrast injection iodized in the diagnosis of early recurrence in head and neck&#xD;
      malignancies while interest of the contrast agent injection has been demonstrated in ovarian&#xD;
      neoplastic recurrence research, pancreatic and colon.&#xD;
