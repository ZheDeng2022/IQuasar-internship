    <textblock>
      A malignant tumor has higher temperature than normal tissue and the temperature of the tumor&#xD;
      is dependent on the tumor growth rate. Thus tumor temperature is the universal indicator of&#xD;
      tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The temperature changes begin in the stage of atypical hyperplasia and increased&#xD;
      proliferation and this opens up the possibilities for detection of patients with high risk&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microwave radiometer (RTM-01-RES) allows measurement of temperature changes of internal&#xD;
      tissue at the depth of several centimetre and allows visualization of the temperature on the&#xD;
      thermogram and temperature field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is noninvasive and the measurement of internal temperature is based on receiving natural&#xD;
      electromagnetic radiation from the tissue in the gigahertz (GHz) frequency range. The device&#xD;
      is absolutely harmless and has no risk because it does not emit any radiation. It can be used&#xD;
      repeatedly as a method of monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microwave radiometry has successfully completed seven clinical trials of more than 1000&#xD;
      patients in different countries. Microwave device (RTM-01-RES) is used in more than 300&#xD;
      medical centers in 30 countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical technology of microwave radiometry is included in the nomenclature of medical&#xD;
      services in the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Health and is part of the standard of&#xD;
      care for patients with malignant tumors of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method of microwave radiometry is recommended by leading Russian mammalogists in the&#xD;
      National guidelines of breast care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to use the device in clinics in Scotland and later United&#xD;
      Kingdom (UK) for breast diagnosis and monitoring treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 3 months the investigators aim to examine 150 patients with breast cancer and 150&#xD;
      patients without cancer who will be the control group. The results of temperature measurement&#xD;
      will be compared with the results of histology, in particular, tumour cellulants p53&#xD;
      expression and other gene expression data for metabolic biomarkers and other tumor indicator.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of data will be performed. The device and initial training will be&#xD;
      provided by RES Company (device producer).&#xD;

      The temperature of a malignant tumour is a universal indicator of the growth rate of the&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor temperature can be used as a prediction of the benefit of individual therapies and in&#xD;
      monitoring the efficacy of breast cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The temperature of tissue around a malignant tumour is correlated with micro vessel density&#xD;
      (MVD) - the main indicator of angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A traditional infrared camera allows measurement of the temperature of the skin and the&#xD;
      breast tumor at a depth of several centimetres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that it is possible to detect thermal abnormality of internal tissues with&#xD;
      the help of measuring the natural electromagnetic radiation in microwave frequency range.&#xD;
      Microwave radiometer (RTM-01-RES) allows one to measure noninvasively any temperature changes&#xD;
      of internal tissue at the depth of several centimetres and visualize the internal temperature&#xD;
      on the thermogram and temperature field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was shown that the device can be used for detection of carotid temperature abnormalities&#xD;
      and the temperature of the carotid is a good correlation to the risk of stroke in the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today it is technically possible to obtain non-invasively the information concerning thermal&#xD;
      activity of the tumor and use this information for the prediction of individual therapies and&#xD;
      monitoring the efficacy of breast cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trials in Russia show that tumors with a low degree of malignancy have low&#xD;
      temperature changes and the tumor with high degree of malignancy have high temperature&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven clinical trials of (RTM-01-RES) with 1000 patients have shown that 90% of breast&#xD;
      malignant tumours have substantial temperature changes (the sensitivity is 85%-95%,&#xD;
      specificity 56%-75%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care for patients with malignant tumors of the breast is to use microwave&#xD;
      radiometry and this is recommended by leading Russian mammalogists in the National guidelines&#xD;
      of breast care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that the temperature of a malignant tumor is higher than a benign lesion and that the&#xD;
      temperature of more proliferative and thus poorer outlook cancers is greater than less&#xD;
      proliferative cancers, the aim is whether with the most up to date technology these&#xD;
      temperatures can be measured accurately on the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of such a device would be&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnostic - to help differentiate benign from malignant lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prognostic - to provide insight into the proliferation rate using a non-invasive test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Predictive of benefit - to show that changes in temperature predate changes in tumors&#xD;
           volume in patients treated with drug therapy initially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation is non-invasive. If it were possible to demonstrate benefit, then this&#xD;
      simple non-invasive test could have a useful role in assessing patients with breast lumps and&#xD;
      in particularly breast cancer.&#xD;
