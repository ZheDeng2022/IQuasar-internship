    <textblock>
      There is a need for people to take part in research studies to learn more about diseases and&#xD;
      how to treat them. The Registry for Asthma Characterization and Recruitment 2 (RACR2) will&#xD;
      create a database of participants with asthma and nasal allergies, or risk factors for these&#xD;
      conditions, who are potentially eligible for future Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC)&#xD;
      trials. The registry database will include assessments of various asthma and allergy&#xD;
      characteristics to achieve a more efficient, selective recruitment of these participants for&#xD;
      other protocols.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the Registry for Asthma Characterization and Recruitment 2 (RACR2) is to&#xD;
      create a database of participants who are potentially eligible for future Inner City Asthma&#xD;
      Consortium (ICAC) clinical research studies. The registry will provide an avenue to assess&#xD;
      various asthma and allergy characteristics, which will result in more efficient recruitment&#xD;
      for current and future ICAC protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be recruited via telephone or in person. Those deemed potentially&#xD;
      eligible for a current protocol or protocol in development may be invited to the clinic for&#xD;
      further data collection and assessments. This registry allows flexibility in selecting the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and data collection to match planned or upcoming ICAC protocols. At each&#xD;
      stage of data collection, participants may be discontinued, put on hold, or invited to&#xD;
      participate in further screening activities, depending on the likelihood that they will&#xD;
      qualify for a future protocol. Participants may opt to withdraw their information or&#xD;
      discontinue from the registry at any time, in person, by telephone, or in writing.&#xD;

        Subjects who reside within the metropolitan statistical area of the clinical site and have&#xD;
        clinician-diagnosed asthma, current symptoms of asthma, or risk factors for development of&#xD;
        asthma. The population may at times include participants without asthma, atopy, and&#xD;
        rhinitis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility criteria vary depending on recruitment needs for future ICAC protocols.&#xD;
        Participants with asthma and participants without asthma, atopy, and rhinitis may be&#xD;
        recruited at the same time or different times, depending on recruitment needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Certain characteristics or groups of characteristics within each criterion may be selected&#xD;
        for periods of time across clinical sites or at each individually participating clinical&#xD;
        site. For example, over a 6-month period, the Consortium could decide to recruit children&#xD;
        aged 6 through 12 years with diagnosed asthma who have asthma symptoms, have a history of&#xD;
        an asthma exacerbation, and reside in prespecified census tracts within the metropolitan&#xD;
        statistical area. During selective recruitment periods, individuals who meet broader&#xD;
        criteria may or may not be enrolled at the discretion of the Consortium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All participants must resides within the metropolitan statistical area that includes&#xD;
             the clinical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants with asthma are defined by having evidence of asthma. Evidence of asthma&#xD;
             is defined by meeting at least one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinician-diagnosed asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Asthma symptoms, history of an asthma exacerbation, or current use of asthma&#xD;
                  medication(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recurrent wheezing&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Wheezing apart from a cold&#xD;
&#xD;
             At times of selective recruitment, participants with asthma may be required to meet&#xD;
             more selective criteria above and may be required to meet one or more of the criteria&#xD;
             in risk factors for asthma. Evidence of risk factors for asthma is defined by meeting&#xD;
             at least one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Parental history of asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Eczema or atopic dermatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Reported allergies to pets, food, indoor allergens, or outdoor allergens&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Allergic sensitization by results of allergy skin testing or results of serum&#xD;
                  immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rhinitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants without asthma, atopy, and rhinitis must meet all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Negative history of an asthma diagnosis by a clinician&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Negative history of a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis or eczema by a clinician&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Negative history of a rhinitis diagnosis by a clinician&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) &gt;= 5% predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Negative prick skin-tests to any of a panel of indoor and outdoor allergens&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No current asthma as determined by the appropriate case report form&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No current chronic rhinitis/sinusitis as determined by the appropriate case&#xD;
                  report form&#xD;
&#xD;

             instructions, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency, type 1 diabetes, allergic&#xD;
             bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or any other chronic medical condition at the&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Is a foster child (not applicable if participant is able to provide consent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is unwilling to sign the written informed consent form if of age, or parent/legal&#xD;
             guardian is unwilling to sign the written informed consent if participant is not of&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Is unwilling to sign the assent form, if age appropriate&#xD;
