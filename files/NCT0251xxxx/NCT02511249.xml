  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While perinatal ischemic stroke is the most frequent form of childhood stroke, early&#xD;
      determinants of outcome remain poorly understood. Two main structural biases limit the&#xD;
      accuracy of most studies: heterogeneity of the population and short follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perinatal ischemic stroke includes several conditions that differ in pathophysiology and&#xD;
      timing of occurrence. Yet, it is not surprising that risk factors and outcome depend&#xD;
      primarily on the type of stroke. Age at evaluation also plays a major role after a neonatal&#xD;
      insult. Even though the original lesion is static and focal in perinatal stroke, its&#xD;
      consequences grow over time within the maturing brain and affect all fields of&#xD;
      neurodevelopment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the AVCnn study was to delineate the determinants, clinical and imaging&#xD;
      presentation, mechanism, and long term outcome of a category of perinatal stroke (neonatal&#xD;
      arterial ischemic stroke: NAIS). This led to the AVCnn cohort, which now gives us the&#xD;
      opportunity to regularly monitor a large cohort of children having suffered an NAIS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Between November 2003 and October 2006, a cohort of one hundred symptomatic term newborns&#xD;
      with AIS confirmed through early brain imaging has been constituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular contacts with the families and their local physician have been maintained since&#xD;
      enrollment. In 2010, families were asked through postal mail to participate in the 7 years&#xD;
      assessment (AVCnn7ans). Those who accepted were contacted by phone by the coordinators of the&#xD;
      study during the months preceding the child's seventh birthday and invited to attend a&#xD;
      presentation in person of the current project. This evaluation took place face-to-face for a&#xD;
      whole day in a medical setting close to the family residence. The evaluation team included a&#xD;
      neuropsychologist, a speech therapist and either a pediatric neurologist or a pediatric&#xD;
      physical and rehabilitation medicine practitioner.&#xD;
