  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether it is safe to administer a peptide vaccine in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. This study will also evaluate the effects of the combination of the peptide&#xD;
      vaccine and pembrolizumab on the immune system. The investigators will monitor these effects&#xD;
      by performing tests in the laboratory on participants' blood, a lymph node, and tumor&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with unresectable stage IIIB or IIIC melanoma, or stage IV metastatic&#xD;
             melanoma that have clinical or radiological evidence of disease. Subjects may have had&#xD;
             cutaneous, uveal, mucosal primary melanoma, or an unknown primary melanoma. Staging&#xD;
             must be confirmed by cytological or histological examination. Staging of cutaneous&#xD;
             melanoma will be based on the revised AJCC staging system&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ability to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ≥18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A subject may be naïve for immunotherapy agents or have received interferon-alpha,&#xD;
             ipilimumab or other CTLA-4 antibody, PD-1 antibody (or anti-PD-L1 antibody),&#xD;
             interleukin-2, or prior cancer vaccines other than the 6MHP vaccine. Patients who have&#xD;
             received a PD-1/PD-L1 antibody may be enrolled in either of the following settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A patient who has experienced progression of melanoma during that therapy or&#xD;
                  after having completed that therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A patient who fails to experience an objective clinical response (partial&#xD;
                  response or complete response by RECIST 1.1 criteria) after either 12 weeks of&#xD;
                  continuous anti-PD1 antibody or anti-CTLA4/anti-PD1 combination therapy, and is a&#xD;
                  candidate to receive pembrolizumab therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects will be required to have radiological studies to define radiologically&#xD;
             evident disease. Required studies include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chest CT scan,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abdominal and pelvic CT scan, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Head CT scan or MRI PET/CT fusion scan may replace scans of the chest, abdomen,&#xD;
                  and pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who have metastatic melanoma available for biopsy pretreatment and on day 22&#xD;
             must consent to having those biopsies. These metastases may be in nodes, skin, soft&#xD;
             tissue, liver, or other sites that can be accessed safely by needle biopsy, incisional&#xD;
             or excisional biopsy, with or without image guidance. The lesions to be biopsied must&#xD;
             be specified at study enrollment and not included as target lesions for RECIST&#xD;
             calculations. In instances where disease that is accessible to biopsy is limited,&#xD;
             archival tissue specimens collected after a subject's last systemic therapy may be&#xD;
             used for baseline measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects must have measurable disease in addition to the lesion(s) to be biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who have had brain metastases will be eligible if all of the following are&#xD;
             true:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Each brain metastasis must have been completely removed by surgery or each&#xD;
                  unresected brain metastasis must have been treated with stereotactic&#xD;
                  radiosurgery.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Subjects are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The most recent surgical resections or gamma-knife therapy for malignant melanoma must&#xD;
             have been completed ≥ 1 week prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
