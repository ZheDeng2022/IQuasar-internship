  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Granulation tissue, or excess tissue, forms around gastrostomy tube sites and is a common&#xD;
      problem seen in the pediatric surgery population. There is no standard treatment that has&#xD;
      been identified in clinical practice to treat granulation tissue effectively. Clinicians&#xD;
      prescribe treatments of varying nature to help treat this condition. By conducting this&#xD;
      study, the investigators hope to identify if there is any difference in the treatment groups&#xD;
      and if there is any superiority for one treatment over the other. The three arms in the study&#xD;
      are Silver Nitrate treatment, treatment with Kenalog, and Washcloth abrasion. Treatments will&#xD;
      continue over a period of three weeks, and the progress will be followed using surveys and&#xD;
      photographs.&#xD;

      Hypergranulation tissue surrounding gastrostomy tube sites in pediatric patients is a&#xD;
      significant problem. This tissue may cause drainage or bleeding that bothers patients and&#xD;
      parents. Numerous methods of treatment are used for treatment of hypergranulation tissue, but&#xD;
      no data exists to support one method of treatment over another. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      perform a prospective randomized trial of three different therapies (silver nitrate&#xD;
      cauterization, topical kenalog, and soapcloth abrasion) to identify the best treatment&#xD;
      modality. Participants will be followed via office visit at four and eight weeks after&#xD;
      initiation of therapy. Measurements of the granulation tissue and photographs will be&#xD;
      obtained pre treatment and at each post treatment visit. In addition parents will be asked to&#xD;
      fill out a pre and post treatment survey regarding improvement in symptoms. Investigators&#xD;
      plan to enroll 120 patients total with the intention of having 40 participants in each group.&#xD;

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Silver Nitrate</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Silver Nitrate is supplied in the form of pre-packaged applicator sticks to parents and patients. The concentration is 75% Silver Nitrate and 25% Potassium Nitrate. Application will be done 3 times a week for a period of 3 weeks.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Kenalog (Triamcinolone)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Kenalog is a topical corticosteroid that shares anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions.The dosage of Kenalog used in the study is 0.5%. Application is topical, and the frequency is 3 times a day for the 3 week trial period. FDA approved use of Kenalog in the treatment of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. It has not been studied whether Kenalog has any proven advantage over Silver nitrate in the treatment of granulation tissue, but it has been used for the treatment of granulation tissue at the gastrostomy site with good effect.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Washcloth Abrasion</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Washcloth abrasion will be done with regular soap and water applied to a washcloth. The granulation tissue will be gently washed and abraded once daily for three weeks.</description>
