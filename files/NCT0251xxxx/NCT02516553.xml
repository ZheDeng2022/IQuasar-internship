  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with different types of advanced cancer (solid tumours). The&#xD;
      study is also open to patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in whom previous treatment&#xD;
      was not successful. In some countries, adolescents who are at least 15 years old and who are&#xD;
      diagnosed with NUT carcinoma can also participate. No standard treatment exists for this rare&#xD;
      and aggressive form of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 894999 that people can&#xD;
      tolerate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BI 894999 is tested for the first time in humans. Participants take tablets once daily. The&#xD;
      study also tests whether participants can tolerate BI 894999 better when taken continuously&#xD;
      or with breaks in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from the treatment and can&#xD;
      tolerate it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors also regularly check the general health of the participants.&#xD;

             or by abiraterone or by enzalutamide or apalutamide. If the actual method of&#xD;
             castration is LHRH agonist or antagonist, the patient must be willing to continue the&#xD;
             use of LHRH agonist or antagonist during protocol treatment.&#xD;
