  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure is a risk factor for bad clinical events, such as heart failure, stroke,&#xD;
      kidney failure and death. This risk is much higher in those with 'resistant' hypertension, in&#xD;
      whom the blood pressure remains high despite more than 3 blood pressure medicines. Current&#xD;
      estimates of the proportion of individuals with resistant hypertension may be an&#xD;
      overestimate, since some of them are not actually adherent (i.e. not taking the medicines&#xD;
      they are prescribed). Methods to detect non-adherence, such as asking the patient, counting&#xD;
      pills, and getting records from pharmacy are not fool proof. Direct observed therapy (where&#xD;
      patients are administered medicines under observation by a health care personnel) is quite&#xD;
      useful to diagnose this, and is the standard of care in the Renal Hypertension Clinic, before&#xD;
      more tests and interventions (such as CT scans, renal angiogram) are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will measure the proportion of patients with resistant&#xD;
      hypertension who are non-adherent based on direct observed therapy, and follow them up to&#xD;
      examine the impact of this diagnosis.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fitting inclusion and exclusion criteria, after informed consent, will undergo the&#xD;
      direct observed therapy test in the hypertension unit (this is usual care in the unit, which&#xD;
      they will undergo even if they are not part of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Direct Observation Therapy (DOT) Test includes the following components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Administer and observe ingestion of usual morning antihypertensive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Monitor BP every 30 minutes, using 5 readings of an automated oscillometric BP device (&#xD;
           BP-TRU), until plateau affect achieved, defined as 3 consecutive cycles of BP readings&#xD;
           declining by less than 10 mmHg per cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Registered Nurse (RN) repeats standing BP prior to initiation of 24 hour Ambulatory&#xD;
           Blood Pressure Monitoring(ABPM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. RN initiates 24 hour ABPM&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will undergo an additional 24-hour ABPM test 1 month after the DOT&#xD;
      test is undertaken.&#xD;
