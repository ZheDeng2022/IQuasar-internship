  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for cancer or blood disorders&#xD;
      frequently develop gastrointestinal, metabolic and infectious complications related to&#xD;
      preparative high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation-related toxicity. Parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      (PN) with lipid emulsion is commonly required while gastrointestinal complications preclude&#xD;
      adequate oral or enteral intake. PN and lipids may increase the risk of metabolic and&#xD;
      infectious complications in HCT patients who are inherently immune compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has been linked to improvements in outcomes in&#xD;
      several populations. Provision of fish oil lipid emulsion (FOLE), rich in omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids, to children undergoing HCT is an innovative nutritional strategy that could mitigate&#xD;
      the metabolic and inflammatory side effects of HCT and its treatment. With its potential to&#xD;
      safely maintain essential fatty acid status, normalize blood lipids and alleviate the&#xD;
      inflammatory response to illness, the use of FOLE may reduce the risk of infections,&#xD;
      regimen-related toxicity, and other morbidities after HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, controlled pilot study is proposed to test the safety and tolerability of FOLE,&#xD;
      compared to standard lipid emulsion, in 20 children during hospitalization for HCT. Results&#xD;
      of this study will provide the preliminary data needed for a larger clinical trial examining&#xD;
      the effect of FOLE on important clinical outcomes in this population. This novel approach to&#xD;
      nutritional care of this high-risk group will advance clinical knowledge of the impact of&#xD;
      FOLE, and will support further investigation into nutritional adjuncts to pediatric cancer&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition (PN) is often necessary for children undergoing allogeneic allogeneic&#xD;
      bone marrow, cord, or peripheral blood stem cell (from any donor, including haploidentical&#xD;
      donor) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to avoid malnutrition and growth failure due&#xD;
      to the gastrointestinal toxicity associated with preparative myeloablative conditioning&#xD;
      regimens. Intravenous lipid emulsion is a required component of PN to provide energy and&#xD;
      essential fatty acids when oral or enteral intake is nil or minimal. Soybean oil lipid&#xD;
      emulsion (SOLE) is the standard lipid emulsion used in PN. Complications such as metabolic&#xD;
      instability, cholestasis, hypertriglyceridemia, and anorexia, which are common during HCT,&#xD;
      may also be attributable to the SOLE component of PN. Fish oil based lipid emulsion (FOLE) is&#xD;
      used in certain populations and is associated with improved outcomes, specifically in infants&#xD;
      with intestinal failure and PN associated cholestasis. It has been reported that&#xD;
      supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil emulsion may preserve lean body mass,&#xD;
      improve quality of life, and decrease length of hospital stay. Provision of FOLE to children&#xD;
      undergoing HCT is a novel and innovative strategy to potentially mitigate the metabolic and&#xD;
      inflammatory side effects of HCT and its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: The provision of FOLE is safe and well tolerated in children following HCT. Our&#xD;
      aims are to determine the safety profile (as measured by the number of grade 2 or higher&#xD;
      adverse events) and tolerability of intravenous FOLE (as measured by serum fatty acid&#xD;
      profiles) among children undergoing HCT compared to children receiving SOLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: The provision of FOLE is associated with reduced incidence of&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia in children following HCT, compared to children receiving SOLE and our&#xD;
      aim is to determine the number (and percentage) of subjects with fasting hypertriglyceridemia&#xD;
      during the trial. To explore trends in associations with other relevant outcomes, other&#xD;
      exploratory outcomes (inflammatory biomarkers, body composition measurements, and quality of&#xD;
      life indicators) will be assessed in both groups of children following HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, unblinded pilot study to test the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of FOLE, compared to standard SOLE, in children hospitalized for HCT with an&#xD;
      underlying hematologic malignancy or myelodysplasic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children cared for in the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood&#xD;
      Disorders Center and who will be admitted to BCH for allogeneic HCT will be enrolled (10&#xD;
      subjects in each arm). Patients will be included if they meet all of the entry criteria and&#xD;
      none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled subjects will receive standard transplant and medical care per HCT guidelines&#xD;
      and protocols. A baseline study visit will occur between 14 and 7 days prior to transplant&#xD;
      day (day 0). Regardless of enteral intake, at day 0, subjects will be randomized to either&#xD;
      control or experimental lipid infusion. The experimental group will receive FOLE and the&#xD;
      control group will receive SOLE beginning at day 0 of HCT. All patients, in both the control&#xD;
      and experimental groups, will receive standard nutritional care as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The energy goal for each patient will be the measured resting energy expenditure REE, or&#xD;
           the estimated energy expenditure determined and calculated by the clinical dietitian, to&#xD;
           be provided by oral, enteral, and/or parenteral energy intake. Intravenous lipids will&#xD;
           provide approximately 10 kcal/kg/day. Energy intake from other sources (oral intake,&#xD;
           enteral feeding, PN) will be titrated to meet the individualized energy goal, accounting&#xD;
           for the contribution from intravenous lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PN (i.e., dextrose/amino acids) will be initiated if oral or enteral energy intake&#xD;
           declines to less than estimated or measured (REE) for &gt;3-5 days, but no earlier than&#xD;
           &quot;day 0&quot; of the transplant course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amino acids in PN will be provided according to standard, age-adjusted estimations,&#xD;
           minus any contributions from oral or enteral protein intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipids will be provided to all enrolled subjects at 1 g/kg/day. On the first day of the&#xD;
           lipid infusion, lipids will be infused over 18 hours through a central or peripheral&#xD;
           venous line per standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A lipid panel will be obtained 4 hours after the 1st lipid infusion is completed and&#xD;
           while the subject is nil per os (NPO) for at least 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Should the subject have hypertriglyceridemia &gt;500 mg/dL with associated abdominal pain,&#xD;
           an amylase/lipase level will be drawn to screen for pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If required (or requested) and after tolerating day 1 of the initial 18-hour lipid&#xD;
           infusion, the lipid infusion rate may be changed and lipids may be infused over a range&#xD;
           of 8 to 20 hours if the rate does not exceed the maximal lipid infusion rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group will receive standard SOLE, a 20% lipid solution (Intralipid®, Baxter&#xD;
           Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experimental group will receive FOLE (Omegaven®, Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg&#xD;
           v.d.h., Germany), a 10% lipid solution. The experimental product, Omegaven®, will be&#xD;
           purchased from the manufacturer, stored in BCH Research Pharmacy, and labeled&#xD;
           appropriately. The experimental product will not be altered in any way from its original&#xD;
           manufactured state and may be infused in the same manner as standard SOLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After engraftment occurs (3 consecutive days with absolute neutrophil count &gt;500),&#xD;
           lipids will be discontinued at day 30, if clinically indicated, or when the patient is&#xD;
           ready for hospital discharge, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipid rates of 0.15 g fat/kg/hour have been associated with fat overload syndrome; all&#xD;
           rates are below this threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized demographic and clinical assessments of all study participants will be performed&#xD;
      via medical record review concomitant with the hospitalization and selected clinic visits.&#xD;
      Data will include medical record number, underlying diagnosis, type of donor, date of&#xD;
      transplant, date of birth, gender, conditioning and prophylactic medication regimens. Results&#xD;
      of routine laboratory tests (serum chemistries, blood cell counts) will be recorded twice&#xD;
      weekly. Essential fatty acid profiles, pediatric lipid panels, and inflammatory markers will&#xD;
      be assessed at specified intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight will be measured by an electronic digital scale accurate to 0.1 kg (same scale&#xD;
      used at all visits). Standing height will be measured by stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm&#xD;
      (same stadiometer used at all visits). Oral and enteral nutrient intake during the inpatient&#xD;
      admission period of the study will be evaluated through standard nursing documentation and&#xD;
      calorie counts. Daily calorie counts are routine practice in the HCT unit. Nutrient intake&#xD;
      will be tabulated from 24-hour recall at outpatient visits. The total enteral and oral intake&#xD;
      of calories, protein, carbohydrate, and fat will be calculated by nutrient analysis software&#xD;
      (ESHA Food Processor, ESHA Research, Inc., Salem, OR). Parenteral intake will be calculated&#xD;
      by the BCH pharmacy's specifications for PN, lipid emulsions, and intravenous fluid. The&#xD;
      Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Peds QL 4.0) Generic Core and SCT Modules are reliable,&#xD;
      validated tools for measuring health related quality of life in children and adolescents ages&#xD;
      2 to 18 with items specific to children who have had HCT. Separate parent and age-appropriate&#xD;
      child questionnaires that address similar questions regarding quality of life will be&#xD;
      administered at baseline, day +30, and day +100. Air-displacement plethysmography (ADP) is a&#xD;
      non-invasive, quick and accurate measure of body density. ADP (BOD POD, Cosmed USA, Concord&#xD;
      CA) will be used at specified intervals to estimate body composition (percent body fat and&#xD;
      percent lean mass) in subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual subjects will be withdrawn from the study if they develop:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. uncontrolled bleeding attributed to the use of Omegaven&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. persistent fasting hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride level &gt; 500 mg/dl on 3 separate&#xD;
           occasions, obtained 4 hours after the lipid infusion has been completed and while the&#xD;
           subject is NPO for at least 2 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. persistent essential fatty acid deficiency (triene:tetraene &gt;0.2 for 2 consecutive&#xD;
           measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. intolerance or allergy to the assigned lipid emulsion&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. parent or guardian request&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. principal investigator believes withdrawal is in the best medical interest of the&#xD;
           patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. baseline fasting (NPO for 2 hours) triglyceride level &gt; 500 mg/dL on 2 consecutive&#xD;
           measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study discontinuation will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. upon recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. two or more serious adverse events, occurring across different subjects, possibly or&#xD;
           probably related to study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events for each study arm will be tabulated and categorized by grade. Incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events will be presented graphically in a dot plot with each adverse event listed on&#xD;
      the vertical axis, incidence displayed as a percentage on the horizontal axis, with different&#xD;
      markers for each study. The primary endpoint, the number of adverse events that are grade 2&#xD;
      or higher, will be summarized as mean ± SD. Comparison of the primary endpoint across study&#xD;
      arms will be assessed by the two one-sided tests procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This consists of testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1o: μFOLE - μSOLE ≤ θ1 vs H1a: μFOLE - μSOLE &gt; θ1 H2o: μFOLE - μSOLE ≥ θ2 vs H2a: μFOLE -&#xD;
      μSOLE &lt; θ2. Equivalence will be declared only if both H1o and H2o are rejected, each at α =&#xD;
      0.05. This is equivalent to testing that the 1 - 2α confidence interval for μFOLE - μSOLE is&#xD;
      contained within the equivalence interval [θ1, θ2]. If the distribution of adverse events is&#xD;
      more skewed than expected, then a lognormal distribution will be assumed.&#xD;
