      Cancer of the gullet (oesophagus) is a lethal disease in which only 15% of patients survive 5&#xD;
      years once diagnosed. It is more common in men than women, and men appear to have a worse&#xD;
      prognosis. One suggestion for this gender difference is the sex hormone oestrogen, which&#xD;
      exerts its effect via oestrogen receptors. The role of oestrogen in breast cancer is well&#xD;
      described, and antioestrogen medication such as tamoxifen, which blocks oestrogen receptors&#xD;
      are in widespread and effective use. The role of oestrogen receptors in oesophageal cancer&#xD;
      however, is less well defined. Work conducted by the investigators, as well as another&#xD;
      research group in Australia showed that antioestrogens including tamoxifen, reduce&#xD;
      oesophageal cancer cell growth in the laboratory. To date, no studies have assessed the&#xD;
      effect of tamoxifen therapy on oesophageal cancer growth in humans. The investigators propose&#xD;
      a study to determine the effect of tamoxifen in patients with oesophageal cancer who aren't&#xD;
      undergoing surgery or chemotherapy. Patients will receive tamoxifen tablets daily for 4 weeks&#xD;
      after which time a biopsy (sample of cancer tissue) will be taken at gastroscopy (a flexible&#xD;
      camera that is passed into the mouth through the gullet into the stomach). The biopsy will be&#xD;
      compared with the biopsy taken at the time of diagnosis to determine if tamoxifen has had any&#xD;
      effect on cancer cell growth. If this study shows that tamoxifen does slow cancer cell growth&#xD;
      it could lead to a larger study of patients with oesophageal cancer taking tamoxifen for a&#xD;
      longer time period to determine if there is any clinical benefit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oesophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer worldwide, and the United Kingdom (UK),&#xD;
      has the world's highest incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The 5- year survival for&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with oesophageal cancer during 2010-2011 in England and Wales was 15%.&#xD;
      Ten- year survival for oesophageal cancer in the UK ranks the third lowest out of 20 common&#xD;
      cancers, and only one-third of patients are candidates for surgical resection at&#xD;
      presentation. Interestingly, oesophageal cancer is a male dominant disease with a male:&#xD;
      female ratio of 5:1 to 10:1. Most published epidemiological evidence has been unable to find&#xD;
      any differences in exposure to known risk factors of oesophageal cancer between the two&#xD;
      genders, and it has been suggested that oestrogen, which exerts its effect via oestrogen&#xD;
      receptors, could be responsible for the gender bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent work from the investigators Academic Unit (Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences,&#xD;
      University of Nottingham, Royal Derby Hospital, Derby), found increased expression of&#xD;
      oestrogen receptors in oesophageal cancer compared to matched normal mucosal samples, and&#xD;
      up-regulation of oestrogen receptors was associated with poor survival outcomes. This&#xD;
      association between oestrogen receptor expression and oesophageal cancer has also been&#xD;
      demonstrated in numerous other studies. The investigators research also showed that blocking&#xD;
      oestrogen receptors using highly selective antagonists (MPP and PHTPP) or the selective&#xD;
      oestrogen receptor modulators, tamoxifen and raloxifene significantly inhibited oesophageal&#xD;
      cancer cell proliferation in vitro (p &lt;0.05). Similar findings have been found by another&#xD;
      research group using tamoxifen and raloxifene. To date, there are no published studies&#xD;
      assessing the effect of tamoxifen in patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma in vivo. The&#xD;
      investigators propose an initial pilot study to determine the effects of short-term tamoxifen&#xD;
      on biological parameters in oesophageal cancer. Determination of any biological response will&#xD;
      potentially allow for a further phase I study to determine any clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological response to treatment will be assessed by immunohistochemistry using a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody to Ki67, a nuclear antigen present throughout the cell cycle (GI, S, G2&#xD;
      and M phases) of proliferating cells but absent in quiescent (GO) cells. The percentage&#xD;
      change of Ki67 expression in the oesophageal cancer biopsy tissue taken at diagnosis (pre-&#xD;
      tamoxifen), with the paired biopsy taken after 4 weeks of tamoxifen will provide information&#xD;
      the antitumor effect of tamoxifen on oesophageal cancer. Ki67 expression has been used as a&#xD;
      biomarker of tamoxifen therapy in numerous breast cancer studies on matched breast core&#xD;
      biopsy specimens or fine needle aspiration cytology specimens 20-36. Of the studies reviewed,&#xD;
      all reported a decrease in Ki67 expression, which was significant in 10 out of 18 studies&#xD;
      after a median of 28 days (range: 14 - 84 days) of 20mg/ day of tamoxifen, in a median of 51&#xD;
      patients (10 - 201 patients). The use of Ki67 as a biomarker of tamoxifen therapy has also&#xD;
      been used in a study of 24 patients with cervical cancer who received 80mg tamoxifen for 5&#xD;
      days. The study reported a drop in the median Ki67 Labelling Index from 5.6% in the pre-&#xD;
      tamoxifen biopsy tissue to 3.0% post- tamoxifen (P &lt; 0.001). The cervical cancer biopsy&#xD;
      samples used are similar in size to the oesophageal biopsies we will be using in this study,&#xD;
      and we are confident a measure of Ki67 expression is the most suitable biomarker available to&#xD;
      assess the biological response to tamoxifen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tamoxifen has been the gold standard endocrine treatment for oestrogen receptor positive&#xD;
      breast cancer for over 30 years, following FDA-approval by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration in 1977. It is estimated that more than 400,000 women are alive today as a&#xD;
      result of tamoxifen, and millions more have benefited from palliation and extended&#xD;
      disease-free survival. It was initially licensed for use in metastatic disease, followed by&#xD;
      use in the adjuvant setting, and has recently been commissioned for breast cancer&#xD;
      chemoprevention by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. A meta-analyses of&#xD;
      20 trials showed tamoxifen treatment was associated with a reduction in disease recurrence by&#xD;
      39%, and mortality by 30%. The hope is that patients with oesophageal cancer treated with&#xD;
      tamoxifen would have improved clinical outcomes similar to those observed in patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer. To observe such a clinical benefit patients would have to take tamoxifen for&#xD;
      an extended period of time like in breast cancer, where in the adjuvant setting, treatment is&#xD;
      for 5 years, which may be increased to 10 years for even further clinical benefit according&#xD;
      to evidence reported in two recent phase III trials. Currently, there is not enough evidence&#xD;
      available to justify a study of long-term tamoxifen in patients with oesophageal cancer, and&#xD;
      so this initial pilot study is to determine any biological response of oesophageal cancer to&#xD;
      short-term tamoxifen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its widespread use, the optimal in vivo therapeutic concentration range for tamoxifen&#xD;
      remains to be established because of a lack of dose-response studies, and a high degree of&#xD;
      inter-individual variability in steady-state levels of tamoxifen and its metabolites.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this study will receive 80mg of tamoxifen for the first 4 days followed&#xD;
      by 20mg/ day thereafter. This regimen was chosen to achieve a plasma steady state sooner than&#xD;
      4 - 16 weeks that it takes on the standard dose of 20mg/ day. Although there are no published&#xD;
      studies reporting the time steady state will be achieved with our exact loading dose regimen,&#xD;
      a study of patients with metastatic breast cancer reported a loading dose schedule of 80mg/&#xD;
      day for 7 days followed by 20 mg/ day thereafter, allowed steady-state values to be reached&#xD;
      in one week. Studies describing the pharmacokinetics of standard dose tamoxifen (10-30mg/&#xD;
      day), report steady state serum levels of 100ng/ml to 333ng/ml, levels sufficient to induce&#xD;
      oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell growth arrest in vitro. The loading dose of tamoxifen and&#xD;
      maintenance regimen proposed should be sufficient to observe the effect of cancer cell growth&#xD;
      in vivo as the plasma steady state levels achievable with such dose are of sufficient&#xD;
      concentration to inhibit oesophageal cell growth in the two in vitro studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A loading dose of 80mg/ day was chosen as it is the highest dose reported in the literature&#xD;
      which isn't associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events. Tamoxifen has been&#xD;
      used in infertility treatment for many years and is licenced for use in the UK for&#xD;
      anovulatory infertility with doses of up to 80mg/ day for 4 consecutive days. Numerous&#xD;
      studies report outcomes with doses of 20mg - 80mg/ day for 3 - 8 days, and no serious adverse&#xD;
      events such of thromboembolism or stroke have been reported. In addition to infertility&#xD;
      treatment, other studies of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (8 weeks), cervical cancer (5&#xD;
      days) and metastatic breast cancer (7 days) have reported outcomes with 80mg/ day and also do&#xD;
      not report any serious adverse events. A period of 4 days was chosen for the loading dose&#xD;
      regimen as it is already licensed for this duration in the UK and the majority of studies&#xD;
      reporting the safety of 80mg/ day are for this time period. Having reviewed the literature,&#xD;
      the investigators feel a loading dose regimen of 80mg/ day for 4 days is the highest safe&#xD;
      dose which will allow a plasma steady state to be achieved as quickly as possible, allowing&#xD;
      sufficient time to observe the biological effect of tamoxifen on oesophageal cancer, allowing&#xD;
      valid conclusions to be made. The rationale for the loading dose regimen is to limit the time&#xD;
      from recruitment (starting tamoxifen) to biopsy, ensuring patients are well enough to attend&#xD;
      for the gastroscopy, as it is well known that this cohort of patents experience a&#xD;
      deterioration in their quality of life.&#xD;
