    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is currently a major factor of morbidity and mortality, which poses a major&#xD;
      public health problem in developing countries but also, albeit to a lesser degree and for&#xD;
      different reasons, for industrialized countries. It is recognized that in countries &quot;of the&#xD;
      North&quot;, from 30 to 60% of hospitalized patients suffer from dénutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any case, it is covered by an imbalance between the contributions and needs; the two main&#xD;
      mechanisms are a delivery failure (fasting, ingesting difficulty ...) and / or increased&#xD;
      requirements (hypermetabolism ...). In cancer patients the Aero-Digestive Upper Airways&#xD;
      (VADS), this imbalance is even more pronounced than the two mechanisms exist and potentiate.&#xD;
      Patients included in this study are a population at risk, because of their therapeutic&#xD;
      containing at least radiotherapy. It is recognized that this form of therapy exposes dental&#xD;
      complications, mucous, saliva. These complications have a deleterious effect on the&#xD;
      nutritional status of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis, treatment and prevention of dénutritions have an important place in the&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies of this type of cancer because it is events whose incidence and morbid&#xD;
      consequences are high and for which there are appropriate nutritional treatments in most cas.&#xD;
      While the complete correction of malnutrition generally passes by the effective etiological&#xD;
      treatment of the causal pathology, therapeutic efficacy of the latter is often conditioned by&#xD;
      the nutritionnel state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these concepts, investigators wants to study the benefits of a diet followed&#xD;
      during the irradiation phase of patients with head and neck cancers and New treaties. We&#xD;
      propose a randomized, phase III, open, multicenter, to evaluate the impact of a dietary&#xD;
      consultation at home on the life quality of patients with head and neck cancer including&#xD;
      first therapeutic sequence involves radiotherapy more or less aware. The duration of the&#xD;
      study is 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the impact of a dietary consultation at home on the life&#xD;
      quality of patients with head and neck cancer including first therapeutic sequence involves a&#xD;
      more or less sensitized radiotherapy.&#xD;
