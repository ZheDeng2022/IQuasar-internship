      This is a prospective, multi-center study to evaluate the diagnostic performance&#xD;
      characteristics of the AminoIndex™ technology among patients at high risk for developing lung&#xD;
      cancer as compared with standard lung cancer screening and diagnostic procedures including&#xD;
      low-dose CT, high-dose CT, biopsy and histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll patients into one of three arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients with lung nodule(s) ≥ 6 mm but ≤ 35 mm that have been biopsied and diagnosed&#xD;
           with primary lung cancer who have not yet initiated treatment of any kind for their lung&#xD;
           cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients with lung nodule(s) ≥ 6 mm but ≤ 35 mm that have been biopsied and determined&#xD;
           to not be cancerous OR that have demonstrated no nodule growth for &gt; 2 years by repeat&#xD;
           CT imaging; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. patients at high-risk for lung cancer (per NLST guidelines) with no evidence or history&#xD;
           of lung cancer (negative LDCT/CT/X-ray).&#xD;

        Study will enroll sufficient subjects to yield a minimum of 60 subjects in Study Group 1,&#xD;
        30 subjects in Study Group 2 and 60 subjects in Study Group 3 - a total of 150 evaluable&#xD;
        study subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will be men&#xD;
        and women age ≥ 18 years for Group 1 and 2 and 55 - 79 years inclusive for Group 3. Group 3&#xD;
        study subjects must also meet NLST guidelines of being at high risk for lung cancer:&#xD;
        greater than or equal to a 30 pack year smoking history (equivalent of 1 pack per day for&#xD;
        30 or more years) and a current smoker or quit less than 15 years ago.&#xD;
