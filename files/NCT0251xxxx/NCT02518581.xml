    <textblock>
      The present study is an exploratory trial to establish a feasible DLW (doubly labelled water)&#xD;
      protocol for implementation in clinical trials conducted at Profil Institut für&#xD;
      Stoffwechselforschung, investigating treatment options for overweight and obesity in&#xD;
      populations with and without diabetic comorbidity. The study aims at the practical validation&#xD;
      of a 1-2-week DLW protocol in overweight and obese type 2 diabetic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) values as assessed by DLW will then be compared to (1) TEE as&#xD;
      calculated based on individual anthropometric measurements (including body composition) using&#xD;
      the Müller formula and the AEE (activity related energy expenditure) based on reported work&#xD;
      place and leisure time activities and (2) TEE as calculated from measured REE (resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure) as assessed by indirect calorimetry and the AEE based on information recorded by&#xD;
      the subjects in a physical activity diary and corresponding pedometer counts. Moreover, TEE&#xD;
      assessments will be repeated once (separated by 2-4 weeks) to determine intra-subject&#xD;
      variability / re-test reliability of the measurement.&#xD;

    <description>DLW (doubly labeled water) method measures isotope dilution spaces and elimination rates to assess total energy expenditure (TEE). After enriching the body water of a subject with DLW (2H and 18O), it is only necessary to collect urine samples at defined time points, usually over a period of 1-2 weeks, so that the measurement can be done in individuals able to engage in their typical habits without restrictions. The resulting TEE measurement represents an integral value over the measurement period.</description>
