  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major complications in patients with chronic&#xD;
      liver disease. The prognosis of HCC relies on the extent of disease at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
      Hence to detect cancer at an earlier stage, a regular surveillance test is important for the&#xD;
      subjects with a high risk of developing cancer. Current guidelines recommend a regular&#xD;
      surveillance using ultrasonography at a 6 month-interval. Ultrasonography is a non-invasive&#xD;
      and safe procedure, yet it is limited by the skills of the operator and it is often difficult&#xD;
      to differentiate cancer from regenerating nodules especially in atrophied cirrhotic liver.&#xD;
      According to a recent meta-analysis, the overall sensitivity and specificity of detecting&#xD;
      liver cancer using ultrasonography were both over 90%, however the sensitivity was decreased&#xD;
      to 60% in detecting early lesions in which surgery or liver transplantation is indicated. Of&#xD;
      note, addition of AFP to ultrasonography also failed to increase the sensitivity in detecting&#xD;
      small cancers. Taken together, there is a need to develop a new surveillance test with an&#xD;
      improved sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a retrospective study reported that CT or MRI showed a better sensitivity than&#xD;
      ultrasonography in detecting early liver cancer. However, performing CT as a surveillance&#xD;
      test is limited by frequent exposure to radiation and contrast-dye agent. Although MRI does&#xD;
      not have the risk of radiation-exposure, it is limited by the high cost. On the contrast,&#xD;
      non-contrast MRI offers a cost that is comparable to US and an absence of exposure to&#xD;
      radiation or contrast-dye agent, which suggests non-contrast MRI as a good alternative&#xD;
      surveillance tool for early detection of HCC. Therefore, in this prospective, randomized&#xD;
      trial, the investigators will investigate the usefulness of ultrasonography versus&#xD;
      non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging for surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
