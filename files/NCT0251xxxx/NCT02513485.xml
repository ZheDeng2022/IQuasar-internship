  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the changes that happen in the brain and the&#xD;
      body when a person is depressed. This study will determine if the level of inflammation in&#xD;
      the body is related to symptoms of depression, how well the person thinks, and how certain&#xD;
      brain regions communicate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytokines released by an activated immune system have been associated with decreased brain&#xD;
      dopamine and the development of depression. Biomarkers of inflammation, such as inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and acute-phase proteins like C-reactive protein (CRP), are elevated in a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients with mood and psychiatric disorders. The investigators&#xD;
      will study if administration of Levodopa (L- 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine [DOPA]-carbidopa,&#xD;
      250/25mg) to depressed patients with high inflammation will 1) increase corticostriatal&#xD;
      functional connectivity, and 2) improve objective measures of motivation compared to placebo.&#xD;
