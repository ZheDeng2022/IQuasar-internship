      This randomized clinical trial studies a geriatric assessment intervention in predicting&#xD;
      chemotherapy toxicity and vulnerabilities (or weakness) in older patients with cancer.&#xD;
      Assessing patients' functional status, comorbidities, psychological state, social support,&#xD;
      nutritional status, and cognitive function before treatment may help identify&#xD;
      vulnerabilities, improve care, and decrease chemotherapy side effects in older patients with&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify areas of vulnerability in older adults with cancer through the use of a&#xD;
      geriatric assessment, and to identify the potential referrals to an interdisciplinary team&#xD;
      based on geriatric assessment results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether the geriatric assessment driven interventions will lead to decrease&#xD;
      in grade 3-5 toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether the geriatric assessment driven interventions will lead to&#xD;
      improvement in the following outcomes: unplanned hospitalization, average length of stay&#xD;
      (ALOS), emergency visits, unplanned readmission rates, and advance directive completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether there is significantly better quality of life (QOL) and function in&#xD;
      the geriatric assessment intervention group compared to the standard of care group from start&#xD;
      of treatment to the follow-up timepoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the feasibility of delivering geriatric assessment driven interventions in&#xD;
      a community setting using telemedicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients follow an intervention plan created by the nurse practitioner (NP) using the&#xD;
      results of the geriatric assessment. The NP discusses the results of the assessment and&#xD;
      treatment recommendations with the patient. They also share the treatment plan, proposed&#xD;
      referrals, and specific vulnerabilities with the primary care physician and community&#xD;
      oncologist. Some patients complete the intervention plan via Telehealth, which uses&#xD;
      telecommunication technology to provide health services over a distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients follow a standard of care treatment plan at the discretion of the primary&#xD;
      oncologist. Beginning 6 months from the start of chemotherapy, patients undergo the geriatric&#xD;
      assessment as in Arm I. Some patients complete the standard of care treatment plan via&#xD;
      Telehealth.&#xD;
