      The purpose of this study is assess the effects of oncology treatment on ovarian reserve and&#xD;
      also to better understand the experiences, thoughts and feelings of women scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo chemotherapy/radiotherapy and seeking fertility preservation at Weill Cornell Medical&#xD;
      College (WCMC).&#xD;

      This will be a prospective, non-randomized, uncontrolled study examining the effects of&#xD;
      oncology treatments in women at risk for treatment induced ovarian failure. The investigators&#xD;
      will also assess and describe the emotional, reproductive and quality of life concerns of&#xD;
      newly diagnosed cancer patients referred for fertility preservation and determine the&#xD;
      physical, psychosocial and quality of life differences of cancer survivors who undergo&#xD;
      fertility preservation in comparison to those who choose not to or are unsuccessful in their&#xD;
      attempts to cryopreserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are scheduled to undergo chemotherapy and/or radiation and present for fertility&#xD;
      preservation consultation at The Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive&#xD;
      Medicine will be recruited for this study. All recruited patients (including those who&#xD;
      undergo cryopreservation of embryos, eggs or ovarian tissue, those who do not undergo&#xD;
      cryopreservation of embryos, eggs or ovarian tissue, and those who are unable to undergo&#xD;
      cryopreservation) will be evaluated at the following time points: T1: Before starting&#xD;
      chemotherapy initial consultation for fertility preservation; T2: Pre oncology treatment (eg&#xD;
      chemotherapy and/or radiation; T3: At six months to 1 year post chemotherapy; Patients will&#xD;
      subsequently have annual follow up visit for 3 years. The study involves two components: 1)&#xD;
      Assessment of biochemical and biophysical parameters of ovarian reserve. 2) Assessment of&#xD;
      psychosocial, reproductive and quality of life concerns of these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate biochemical and biophysical parameters of ovarian reserve in&#xD;
      these patients. Anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol&#xD;
      (E2) levels will be drawn. In addition, the ovaries will be examined and antral follicle&#xD;
      counts and ovarian volume will be measured on the same days that the hormone levels are drawn&#xD;
      (if appropriate). Subjects will be asked to keep a menstrual calendar diary from baseline&#xD;
      (pre-chemotherapy) and for 1 year post chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess and describe the psychosocial, reproductive and quality of life concerns&#xD;
      of these patients, a Quality of Life (QOL) survey will be completed pre and post chemotherapy&#xD;
      at time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1: At the time of pre-chemotherapy (initial consultation for fertility preservation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2: Pre chemotherapy/radiation treatment. Patients who have successful cryopreservation of&#xD;
      embryos or eggs will be asked to complete the survey on the day of embryo or egg&#xD;
      cryopreservation or before the start date of their initial chemotherapy treatment. Patients&#xD;
      who do not have successful cryopreservation of embryos or eggs will be asked to complete the&#xD;
      survey after receiving notification that the fertility preservation treatment is cancelled.&#xD;
      Patients who do not choose to cryopreserve embryos or eggs will be asked to fill out the&#xD;
      survey before the start date of their initial chemotherapy treatment. Participants will be&#xD;
      mailed or given a survey instrument and the data collected either in person, by mail, or by&#xD;
      telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T3: At six months to 1 year post chemotherapy, patients will be asked to complete the final&#xD;
      survey by phone or by mail. Systematic reminders (mail and phone) will be used to ensure&#xD;
      return of the surveys. Each study survey should take approximately 40-55 minutes to complete.&#xD;
      The domains assessed will include psychological functioning, reproductive and fertility&#xD;
      preservation concerns, relationship satisfaction, and quality of life prior to and following&#xD;
      potential fertility preservation and initial chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;
      Participants do not have to respond to any question that they choose not to answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Instruments: Quality of Life (QOL) survey-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Psychosocial History and Background Information Form&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptom Checklist (SCL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The Reproductive Concerns Scale (RCS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Impact of Events Scale (IES)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The Life Orientation Test (LOT-R)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and analyzed. This new data will help us establish a better&#xD;
      understanding of the effects of chemotherapy on total ovarian reserve and assist clinicians&#xD;
      caring for patients of reproductive age in counseling these patients. The findings of study&#xD;
      will also bring attention to the understudied area of fertility preservation and cancer&#xD;
      survivorship. The investigators propose that by studying the short and long-term psychosocial&#xD;
      impact of fertility preservation with comparison between those who undergo cryopreservation&#xD;
      with those who do not, the investigators will be able to assess if psychosocial changes occur&#xD;
      over time and identify points for future intervention.&#xD;
