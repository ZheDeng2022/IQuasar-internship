  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People infected with HIV often have cognitive dysfunction even if they are on antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) and have undetectable viral loads. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if&#xD;
      the addition of maraviroc (MVC) and dolutegravir (DTG) (which are two antiretroviral [ARV]&#xD;
      medications) to participants' existing ART regimens will improve participants' neurocognitive&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected people often have cognitive dysfunction (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder,&#xD;
      or HAND), which includes asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild neurocognitive&#xD;
      disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD), even if they are on ART and have&#xD;
      undetectable viral loads. In this study, researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      adding MVC and DTG to the current ART regimen of HIV-infected people with undetectable (&lt;50&#xD;
      copies/mL) plasma HIV-1 RNA who have mild to moderate neurocognitive impairment and who have&#xD;
      been on stable ART for at least 6 months prior to study entry. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate if the addition of MVC and DTG to participants' existing ART regimens will&#xD;
      improve participants' neurocognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three arms. All participants will remain on&#xD;
      their existing ART regimens; they will take their assigned study drugs in addition to their&#xD;
      ART regimen. Participants in Arm A will receive placebo for MVC and placebo for DTG.&#xD;
      Participants in Arm B will receive DTG and placebo for MVC. Participants in Arm C will&#xD;
      receive MVC and DTG. Study visits will occur at entry and Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96.&#xD;
      Visits may include physical examinations, blood collection, neurocognitive testing, pregnancy&#xD;
      testing, and questionnaires. Some participants may have an optional lumbar puncture&#xD;
      procedure. Participants will have to return for refills of study drugs on Weeks 36, 60, and&#xD;
      84.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA)&#xD;
                  test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western&#xD;
                  blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV&#xD;
                  and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. NOTE: The term&#xD;
                  &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved&#xD;
                  kit, which is required for all IND studies, or for sites located in countries&#xD;
                  other than the United States, a kit that has been certified or licensed by an&#xD;
                  oversight body within that country and validated internally. Non-US sites are&#xD;
                  encouraged to use US FDA-approved methods for IND studies. WHO (World Health&#xD;
                  Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines&#xD;
                  mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is&#xD;
                  different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid&#xD;
                  test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that&#xD;
                  is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (eg,&#xD;
                  indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA. OR&#xD;
&#xD;
