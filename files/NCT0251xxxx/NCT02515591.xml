      Validation study to use the disposable bronchoscopes in healthy volunteer research&#xD;
      bronchoscopies to ensure adequate sample and cell yield.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research bronchoscopies are traditionally performed using conventional flexible fibreoptic&#xD;
      bronchoscopes. The technique for obtaining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) from healthy&#xD;
      volunteers for research purposes has been developed by our group since 1999 and has been&#xD;
      performed in &gt; 1,000 subjects in the UK and Malawi including healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibreoptic bronchoscopy with BAL using manual hand held suction enables the removal of&#xD;
      non-adherent cells and lung lining fluid from the mucosal surface. In research environments,&#xD;
      BAL allows sampling of innate (lung macrophage), cellular (B- and T- cells), and humoral&#xD;
      (immunoglobulin) responses within the lung. Further applications include determining protein&#xD;
      and drug levels, with the latter being a key parameter in early phase 'lung tissue active'&#xD;
      drug development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BAL technique uses gentle hand-held suction of instilled fluid; this is designed to&#xD;
      maximize BAL volume returned, and to apply minimum shear force on ciliated epithelia in order&#xD;
      to preserve the structure and function of cells within the BAL fluid. This technique is also&#xD;
      intended to preserve viability to facilitate the growth of cells in ex vivo culture. The&#xD;
      research technique therefore uses a larger volume of warmed normal saline instillate&#xD;
      (typically in the order of 200 ml) and employs manual suction to reduce cell damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Royal Liverpool Hospital (RLBUHT) â‰¥120 healthy volunteer BALs have been performed.&#xD;
      Available data suggest that from 200 ml of instillate the following volume yields are&#xD;
      retrieved: mean 100-120 ml, median 120 - 125 ml with ~ 19% of BALs returning &lt;100 ml yield.&#xD;
      The preferable BAL volume yield is &gt;100 ml, a yield of &gt;150 ml is considered excellent;&#xD;
      yields &gt;170 ml have not been recorded. There is no linear relationship between the cell yield&#xD;
      and volume yield. Yields of &lt;100 ml are in our experience, more likely to lead to side&#xD;
      effects such as cough, chest pain and fever. Subjects with yields of &lt;100 ml are advised to&#xD;
      be recovered in the left lateral position to aid postural drainage of remaining instillate.&#xD;
      There have been no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported; and notably there have been no&#xD;
      post procedure hospitalisations or antibiotics required for suspected pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-use flexible intubation bronchoscopes are used throughout United Kingdom (UK) National&#xD;
      Health Service (NHS) trusts. They are predominantly used within the intensive care and&#xD;
      anaesthetic (theatre) setting for both emergency and elective airway intubation. The flexible&#xD;
      fibreoptic bronchoscope with sterile single-use disposable-sheath endoscope system has the&#xD;
      potential to be more cost-effective and reduce the risk, however negligible, of&#xD;
      cross-infection during the sterilisation procedure. Eliminating the need for high-level&#xD;
      disinfection processing between procedures reduces maintenance costs (equipment and staff),&#xD;
      and scope downtime and provides the flexibility more suited for research in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The content of this study proposal has been peer reviewed by two senior research associates&#xD;
      based in Malawi and the UK who have deemed the scientific review criteria to be sound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently many new drug and therapeutics discovery and development projects are blighted by&#xD;
      the absence of robust predictive pre-clinical models. For example, promising&#xD;
      anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs and drug combinations have been clinically trialled based on&#xD;
      current in vitro and in vivo models, only to find that they lack clinical efficacy; and&#xD;
      conversely effective anti-TB drugs such as linezolid had poor or modest efficacy in testing&#xD;
      usingin vitro and in vivo models. To mitigate these issues we have therefore developed&#xD;
      dynamic pharmacodynamic in vitro models based on high content imaging that are able to&#xD;
      measure macrophage intracellular tubercular growth and killing rates. Pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      and Pharmacokinetics (PK) modelling of these models more closely resemble clinical&#xD;
      measurements for known first line anti-TB; therefore we now wish to further develop this&#xD;
      platform into a more physiological model by using alveolar macrophages (AMs) obtained from&#xD;
      human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of using human AMs will be to compare the drug effects of known and new anti-TB&#xD;
      compounds in human AMs to other in vitro models. This work will enable us to obtain better,&#xD;
      more clinically relevant parameters to predict the outcome of drug dynamics. By using the&#xD;
      AMswe can assess how reliable our current model systems are, and assess considerations of&#xD;
      drug action in clinically relevant tissue samples. These cells can then be manipulated ex&#xD;
      vivo to desired clinical scenarios e.g. dual TB and HIV-infections monitoring TB responses&#xD;
      over time to a range of novel drugs and novel drug combinations. The outputs of these studies&#xD;
      will be used directly to inform new clinical trials on drug regimens.&#xD;
