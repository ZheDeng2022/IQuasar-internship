    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate arthroscopic treatments of recurrent anterior&#xD;
      shoulder instability. Functional outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic glenoid reconstruction&#xD;
      with bone graft will be compared to the gold standard, arthroscopic Bankart repair. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that arthroscopic anatomic glenoid reconstruction with bone graft&#xD;
      will provide better functional outcomes and decreased risk of recurrent&#xD;
      dislocation/subluxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single center, double blinded, randomized controlled trial performed in&#xD;
      Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The primary outcome measured will be the Western Ontario&#xD;
      Shoulder Instability (WOSI) score. Secondary outcomes will be subluxation, re-dislocation,&#xD;
      and range of motion. A minimum of 200 patients will be enrolled in the study as determined by&#xD;
      sample size calculation. Routine radiographs as well as a pre-operative CT with 3D&#xD;
      reconstruction and MRI are obtained for all patients. The patients will then undergo a&#xD;
      clinical examination and complete a variety of functional and quality of life surveys.&#xD;
      Randomization will be based on surgeon skill. Two groups (Bankart repair and anatomic glenoid&#xD;
      reconstruction) will be selected with 100 subjects each. Postoperatively, patients in both&#xD;
      groups will follow a standardized rehabilitation protocol. The patient will follow-up with&#xD;
      the attending surgeon at 2 weeks post-operatively for a wound check. At the 3, 6, 12, and 24&#xD;
      month visits the patient will again undergo the structured clinical examination conducted by&#xD;
      a physiotherapist who is blinded to the patients' treatment group. The patient will also&#xD;
      complete the questionnaires at each of these follow-up appointments. Complications, and&#xD;
      subluxation/dislocation events will be documented at each follow-up evaluation. On the basis&#xD;
      of a clinical examination and patient history, the surgeon will diagnose recurrent&#xD;
      instability and categorize it as a traumatic or atraumatic subluxation or dislocation.&#xD;

      Study Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the outcomes of arthroscopic treatments of&#xD;
      recurrent anterior shoulder instability. Arthroscopic bone grafting of the glenoid will be&#xD;
      compared to the gold standard, arthroscopic Bankart repair. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that arthroscopic anatomic glenoid reconstruction with bone graft will provide better&#xD;
      functional outcomes and decreased risk of recurrent dislocation and subluxation. The null&#xD;
      hypothesis is that there is no difference in change in WOSI scores between arthroscopic&#xD;
      anatomic glenoid reconstruction and the current standard treatment, arthroscopic Bankart&#xD;
      repair, at two years of follow up in patients with recurrent shoulder dislocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine if glenoid bone grafting provides superior&#xD;
      functional outcomes as determined by WOSI score to Bankart repair in patients with anterior&#xD;
      shoulder instability. This will be a single center, double blinded, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial of a minimum of 200 patients performed at the Halifax Infirmary, Queen Elizabeth II&#xD;
      Health Sciences Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The primary outcome measured will be&#xD;
      WOSI score. This is a validated measure assessing quality of life in patients with this&#xD;
      condition. Secondary outcomes will be subluxation, re-dislocation, strength and ROM, and&#xD;
      other validated functional outcome scores, including: the VR-12 questionnaire, the DASH&#xD;
      questionnaire, and the Marx Shoulder Activity Scale (appendix). The ISIS (instability&#xD;
      severity index score) (appendix) score will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) is a tool designed for self-assessment&#xD;
      of shoulder function for patients with instability problems. It is a disease specific quality&#xD;
      of life score. Its high sensitivity makes it able to monitor an individual patient's&#xD;
      progress. The WOSI score has good validity (0.768), a high degree of reliability (0.911), and&#xD;
      a high degree of responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) is a brief, generic, multi-use,&#xD;
      self-administered health survey comprised of 12 items. It has been shown to have high&#xD;
      internal consistency reliability (alpha &gt; .80) and high convergent validity for EQ-5D items&#xD;
      (r &gt; .56). . The instrument is primarily used to measure health-related quality of life, to&#xD;
      estimate disease burden, and to evaluate disease-specific benchmarks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DASH Outcome Measure is a 30-item, self-report questionnaire designed to measure physical&#xD;
      function and symptoms in people with any of several musculoskeletal disorders of the upper&#xD;
      limb. DASH stands for &quot;Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand.&quot; In a Norweigan study&#xD;
      examing those with shoulder conditions the reliability was shown to be 0.93 and Construct&#xD;
      validity was 0.75. The tool gives clinicians and researchers the advantage of having a&#xD;
      single, reliable instrument that can be used to assess any or all joints in the upper&#xD;
      extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Marx Shoulder Activity Scale is a short, easy to administer measure of shoulder activity&#xD;
      used to predict outcome of shoulder disorders. The activity rating is a numerical sum of&#xD;
      scores for five activities rated on a five-point frequency scale from never performed (0&#xD;
      points) to daily (4 points). The activity scale has excellent reliability (intraclass&#xD;
      correlation coefficient 0.92) and construct validity (r = 0.66). It can be completed quickly&#xD;
      and used in conjunction with patient-based measures of shoulder outcome to define patient&#xD;
      populations for cohort studies, and to assess activity level as a prognostic factor in&#xD;
      patients with shoulder disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ISIS is a simple scoring system based on factors derived from a pre-operative&#xD;
      questionnaire, physical examination and AP radiographs. It may help to distinguish between&#xD;
      patients who will benefit from an arthroscopic anterior stabilization using suture anchors&#xD;
      and those who will not. It has good reliability (r&gt;0.8). The score has high validity, as&#xD;
      patients with a score of six points or less have an acceptable recurrence risk of 10%, and&#xD;
      are therefore potentially good candidates for this procedure. By contrast, those patients&#xD;
      with more than six points have a recurrence risk of 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of both procedures will be monitored and any adverse events will be recorded.&#xD;
      Preoperative CT and MRI findings of bone loss will be compared with each other and also with&#xD;
      arthroscopic intra-operative measurements. The investigators hypothesize that arthroscopic&#xD;
      bone grafting of the glenoid provide superior functional outcomes as determined by WOSI score&#xD;
      compared to Bankart repair in patients with anterior shoulder instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 200 patients will be enrolled in the study as determined by a priori sample size&#xD;
      calculations. The sample-size calculation was based on the mean WOSI score (85 of 100;&#xD;
      standard deviation [SD] = 20) from a sample of 133 patients with traumatic anterior shoulder&#xD;
      instability who were followed postoperatively for a minimum of one year. An estimate of&#xD;
      change (10% change from the mean WOSI score) was used to ensure sufficient sample size and&#xD;
      power. With the use of a two-sided test, an Î± value of 0.05, and power of 0.90, the sample&#xD;
      size was determined to be eighty-six patients per group. This was inflated to one hundred&#xD;
      patients per group to account for an estimated 16.8% loss to follow-up (this value&#xD;
      demonstrated in a study with Canadian patients with similar characteristics as the target&#xD;
      population). Each of the five surgeons participating in the study see approximately 40&#xD;
      patients with this pathology per year, giving an estimated recruitment time of 200 patients&#xD;
      in one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria 2 or more documented incidences of anterior glenohumeral dislocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Uncontrolled diabetes (Hgb A1C &gt;7% Age 16-60 Prior surgery of affected&#xD;
      shoulder Pregnancy Multidirectional instability Posterior instability Paralysis of the&#xD;
      shoulder Cancer Severe systemic illness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with recurrent anterior shoulder instability who are referred to any of the&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeons at Halifax Infirmary or the Dartmouth General Hospital will be initially&#xD;
      seen by the research coordinator, who will confirm the diagnosis and screen patients for&#xD;
      study eligibility. Following a detailed discussion of the risks/benefits/alternatives of the&#xD;
      study, the patient will be provided with a copy of the informed consent to review if they&#xD;
      demonstrate interest in the study. If the patient then wishes to be enrolled in the study,&#xD;
      the surgeon or research assistant will obtain patient consent for the study according to the&#xD;
      Division of Orthopaedic Surgery and Capital District Health Authority (CDHA) institutional&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-operative period, there will be no additional time requirements for the patient,&#xD;
      with the exception of the informed consent process for the study. Routine radiographs&#xD;
      including an AP, axillary, and Y view of the shoulder as well as a pre-operative CT with 3D&#xD;
      reconstruction and MRI are obtained for all patients, as is the standard of care for patients&#xD;
      with recurrent shoulder instability. The patient will not be exposed to any additional&#xD;
      radiation above the usual standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will return to clinic to complete a pre-operative assessment and collection of&#xD;
      baseline data. Structured clinical examination will be conducted by a physiotherapist. and&#xD;
      consist of active and passive range of motion testing by goniometer as well as strength&#xD;
      testing by hand dynamometer. The patient will also complete baseline questionnaires ( WOSI&#xD;
      questionnaire, the VR-12 questionnaire, the DASH questionnaire, the Marx Shoulder Activity&#xD;
      Scale) and the ISIS score will be calculated. Any complications or events of dislocation or&#xD;
      subluxation will be recorded. Primary outcome will be WOSI score. Secondary outcome will be&#xD;
      subluxation/dislocation, and other quality of life measures and functional clinical&#xD;
      assessment (ROM and strength) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization For eligible patients who meet the inclusion criteria, the research coordinator&#xD;
      will obtain informed consent and randomly allocate patients to one of two surgical procedure&#xD;
      groups: Bankart repair or Bankart repair and anatomic glenoid reconstruction with allograft&#xD;
      bone. Randomization will be based on surgeon skill, with one surgeon (Dr. Wong) performing&#xD;
      the anatomic glenoid reconstruction, and four Surgeons (Drs. Trenholm, Coady, Urquhart, &amp;&#xD;
      Legay) performing Bankart repairs. Allocation will be determined through the use of&#xD;
      computer-generated, variable-block-size randomization and consecutively numbered opaque&#xD;
      envelopes. Patients will then meet the assigned surgeon, who will discuss the repair&#xD;
      technique in a typical clinical context, reconfirm eligibility, and address any patient&#xD;
      concerns regarding consent and randomization. The expertise-based randomization design&#xD;
      allowed the surgeons to perform their preferred surgical procedure. Two groups (Bankart&#xD;
      repair and anatomic glenoid reconstruction) will be selected with 100 subjects each. After&#xD;
      patients have been randomized, the treating surgeon will have final decision to exclude&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique A diagnostic arthroscopy is performed according to the method described by&#xD;
      Snyder (2003). The amount of glenoid bone loss and any Hill-Sachs lesions are visualized and&#xD;
      assessed according to a standardized protocol using a calibrated probe. This technique will&#xD;
      be as described by Burkhart. In his cadaveric study, he showed that the bare spot is almost&#xD;
      exactly in the center of the inferior glenoid, with very small standard deviations. A&#xD;
      calibrated probe is introduced through the posterior portal, and the distance from the bare&#xD;
      spot to the posterior glenoid rim is measured. The surgeon infers that the pre-dislocation&#xD;
      intact measurement from the bare spot to the anterior glenoid rim would have been the same as&#xD;
      the posterior measurement. The surgeon then uses the calibrated probe to measure the distance&#xD;
      from the bare spot to the anterior glenoid rim. Hill-Sachs lesions will also be measured and&#xD;
      documented with photography. Intraoperative photos and video will be recorded of this&#xD;
      technique, and the photographs will be reviewed by an independent observer. The measurement&#xD;
      will be quantified by the independent observer to remove any observer bias. Any bone loss is&#xD;
      identified, quantified, and compared with the pre-operative CT and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bankart Repair Arthroscopic Bankart repair procedures will be performed according to each&#xD;
      individual surgeon's usual technique. Procedures will be performed with the patient in the&#xD;
      lateral or beach-chair position. Repairs for associated or conjoined superior labral&#xD;
      anterior-to-posterior (SLAP) tears will be documented and performed at the surgeon's&#xD;
      discretion. Labral detachments will be repaired with the use of suture-anchor fixation and&#xD;
      arthroscopic tying techniques. Either two or three suture anchors will be used. Capsular&#xD;
      redundancy will be addressed with arthroscopic suture plication at the surgeon's discretion.&#xD;
      Surgeons will mobilize the capsulolabral tissue as deemed necessary. Surgical time and video&#xD;
      of the operation will be recorded, and photographs will be taken documenting any bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomic Glenoid Reconstruction The surgical technique was the lateral decubitus&#xD;
      all-arthroscopic anatomic glenoid reconstruction procedure for treatment of anterior shoulder&#xD;
      instability as described by Wong et al. (In press) The procedure is done in a semi-lateral&#xD;
      decubitus position that assists with optimal graft placement on the native glenoid. The&#xD;
      investigators utilize the cannulated Bristow-Latarjet Instability Shoulder System&#xD;
      (Depuy-Mitek, MA, USA). The surgical technique is identical to that of arthroscopic Bankart&#xD;
      repair with one additional step. Prior to insertion of anchors, one additional medal portal&#xD;
      is created for insertion of the bone graft. The distal tibia allograft is prepared; the&#xD;
      cannulated guide is attached and advanced through the rotator interval and secured with two&#xD;
      cannulated screws. Finally the Bankart repair is performed above the graft. Surgical time and&#xD;
      video of the operation will be recorded, and photographs will be taken documenting any bone&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will follow a standardized rehabilitation protocol as described by&#xD;
      The American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Therapists' Consensus Rehabilitation Guideline for&#xD;
      Arthroscopic Anterior Capsulolabral Repair of the Shoulder. Briefly, the protocol includes a&#xD;
      4-week period of absolute immobilization, a staged recovery of full range of motion over a&#xD;
      3-month period, a strengthening progression beginning at postoperative week 6, and a&#xD;
      functional progression for return to athletic or demanding work activities between&#xD;
      postoperative months 4 and 6. The patient will follow-up with the attending surgeon at 2&#xD;
      weeks post-operatively for a wound check. Then further follow-up appointments will be at 6&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 and 24 months, as per current clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 3, 6, 12, and 24 month visits the patient will again undergo the structured clinical&#xD;
      examination conducted by a physiotherapist who is blinded to the patients' treatment group.&#xD;
      The patient will be wearing clothing to cover all incisions, and will be given clear&#xD;
      instructions to not reveal to the assessor which group they were allocated to. This will be&#xD;
      monitored by the research assistant. The patient will also complete the WOSI, VR-12, Marx&#xD;
      Shoulder Activity Scale, and DASH questionnaires at each of these follow-up appointments.&#xD;
      Complications, and subluxation/dislocation events will be documented at each follow-up&#xD;
      evaluation. On the basis of a clinical examination and patient history, the surgeon will&#xD;
      diagnose recurrent instability and categorize it as a traumatic or atraumatic subluxation or&#xD;
      dislocation. Safety monitoring will be in place to document and review all adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two independent assessors blinded to the surgical treatment group will view the&#xD;
      intra-operative photos of measurement of glenoid size taken by each surgeon. The videos will&#xD;
      not be associated with any PHI and only identified by unique coding number. The distance from&#xD;
      the bare area to the anterior margin of the glenoid will be subtracted from the distance from&#xD;
      the bare area to the posterior margin of the glenoid. The resultant value will be identified&#xD;
      as the absolute anterior glenoid bone loss, and will be compared to the total diameter of the&#xD;
      glenoid to estimate percent of glenoid bone loss. Summary statistics for measured bone loss&#xD;
      will be recorded as mean +/- standard deviation, 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.&#xD;
      The measured bone loss will be compared to pre-operative diagnostic imaging estimates via&#xD;
      independent samples t-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures for each group will be reported as mean+/- standard deviation and 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval will be calculated. Two-Tailed T-tests will be computed for the WOSI,&#xD;
      VR-12, Marx Shoulder Activity Scale, and DASH scores, range of motion, and strength measures&#xD;
      comparing the 2 experimental groups at each time point. Repeated-measures ANOVA will be used&#xD;
      to perform a within-subjects analysis to assess differences in WOSI, VR-12, DASH, Marx&#xD;
      Shoulder Activity Scale scores, range of motion and strength within each group between time&#xD;
      points.&#xD;
