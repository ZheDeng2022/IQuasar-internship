      This study is a randomized parallel group controlled trial which aims to study the effects of&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation intervention on exercise capacity and quality of life in patients&#xD;
      with severe COPD as compared to standard medical care. The expected duration is one and a&#xD;
      half years with effect from 1st July, 2015 and will include 80 patients, 40 in each arm.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ranks among the top five causes of unnatural deaths in&#xD;
      India and its prevalence continues to increase. Widespread habit of smoking and the use of&#xD;
      biomass fuels have led to such a high prevalence of COPD. The loss of physical capacity and&#xD;
      the adverse psychosocial effects of the disorder contribute greatly to morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Medicines have a limited role in improving the lung functions and physical&#xD;
      capacity in patients with COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) aims to return the patient with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to the highest level of independent functioning.&#xD;
      This is achieved by providing individually tailored exercise training schedules, education&#xD;
      and psychosocial support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation has been defined by the American and the European Thoracic Societies&#xD;
      as &quot;a comprehensive intervention based on a thorough patient assessment followed by patient&#xD;
      tailored therapies that include, but are not limited to, exercise training, education, and&#xD;
      behavior change, designed to improve the physical and psychological condition of people with&#xD;
      chronic respiratory disease and to promote the long-term adherence to health-enhancing&#xD;
      behaviors.&quot; COPD is now considered a multi-systemic disease with frequent co-morbidities and&#xD;
      hence the optimal management of this complex group of patients requires integrated care&#xD;
      principles, pulmonary rehabilitation being the core component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often decrease their physical&#xD;
      activity because exercise can worsen dyspnea. The progressive deconditioning associated with&#xD;
      inactivity initiates a vicious cycle, with dyspnea becoming problematic at ever lower&#xD;
      physical demands. Pulmonary rehabilitation aims to break the cycle. Benefits of pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation include decreased dyspnea, improved health-related quality of life, fewer days&#xD;
      of hospitalization, and decreased health-care utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As yet, there are no controlled studies on the use and effectiveness of pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation in the Indian setting and the optimum training regimen. This study aims to&#xD;
      look at any improvements in the exercise capacity by means of objective incremental and field&#xD;
      exercise tests, quality of life using validated questionnaires, severity of dyspnea, lung&#xD;
      functions and nutritional parameters in patients who are diagnosed with severe forms of COPD&#xD;
      after they have undergone a structured exercise training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective • To assess the effect of structured outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      intervention on the six minute walk distance and health related quality of life in patients&#xD;
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To study the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) and anaerobic threshold (AT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung functions: measured by changes in FEV1 and FVC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression, Anxiety and Stress score (DASS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BODE (Body Mass Index, level of obstruction, level of dyspnea and exercise capacity)&#xD;
           index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometry: BMI and MUAC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized Controlled Study Selection of subjects: Patients who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease visiting the outpatient clinic of the&#xD;
      department of Pulmonary Medicine and Sleep Disorders Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with severe COPD based on spirometry (FEV1 below 50%) presenting to pulmonary&#xD;
           medicine outpatient clinic with modified medical research council (mMRC) grade 1 to 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who are willing to participate in the study Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on long term oxygen therapy or candidates for long term oxygen therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with severe orthopedic or neurological disorders limiting their mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise induced syncope&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unstable angina or recent MI (within 4 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed Cognitive or active psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidities: uncontrolled hypertension &gt;180/100&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent hospitalization for exacerbation within 6 weeks Sample size and location: 80&#xD;
           patients with diagnosed COPD presenting in the department of Pulmonary Medicine and&#xD;
           Sleep Disorders, who will be randomized to 40 patients in each arm based on simple&#xD;
           random sampling method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period: January 2015 to November 2017 Follow Up period: 8 weeks METHODOLOGY I. BASELINE&#xD;
      EVALUATION After initial screening on patients with COPD in terms of severity, feasibility&#xD;
      and commitment, patients who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized&#xD;
      using computer generated random numbers to intervention and control groups. A baseline chest&#xD;
      xray postero-anterior view (CXR-PA) view and a 12-lead electrocardiogram will be available&#xD;
      before enrollment in the study. All patients will undergo pulmonary function test (PFT),&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test using incremental cycle ergometry protocol (CPET), and six&#xD;
      minute walk test (6MWT), along with the baseline demographic history and other relevant&#xD;
      clinical information. CPET and 6MWT will be performed on two separate days. The six minute&#xD;
      walking distance, VO2max and maximum work output during cycling and Saint George Respiratory&#xD;
      Questionnaire will be recorded. Other nutritional parameters (mid-upper arm circumference,&#xD;
      skin fold thickness), Depression Anxiety Stress Score, dyspnea scale and body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) will also be calculated and recorded. The 6MWT will be performed in accordance with the&#xD;
      instructions of the American Thoracic Society, verbal encouragement will be given and the&#xD;
      distance recorded. All these will be repeated at the end of 8 weeks. Tests will be separated&#xD;
      by a minimum of one hour or until heart rate and oxygen saturation return to resting values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. RANDOMIZATION This will be done by using computer generated random numbers. III. EXERCISE&#xD;
      TRAINING After the initial baseline evaluation, patients will be enrolled into the pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation program at the rehabilitation centre located in the premises of the department&#xD;
      of pulmonary medicine and sleep disorders. The total duration of the program would be 12&#xD;
      weeks, with thrice weekly sessions of exercise training of minimum one hour duration.&#xD;
      Participants will complete a minimum of 10 minutes each of treadmill walking, cycling, upper&#xD;
      and lower limb resistance exercises at the 4 separated exercise stations located in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation clinic of the Department of Pulmonary Medicine and Sleep Disorders. Rest&#xD;
      period will be provided as required during the first 3 sessions. Second week onwards,&#xD;
      participants will be encouraged to perform continuous training with intensity targeted at&#xD;
      more than 60% of the maximum workload or till borg dyspnea scale of 4 to 6 is reached, with&#xD;
      maximum of 10 minutes of rest per session during which breathing retraining exercises will be&#xD;
      performed. It will then be followed by structured upper and lower limb strength exercises&#xD;
      (e.g. sit-to-stand, foot treadling, thigh strengthening). Strength training will commence by&#xD;
      performing one set of 8-12 repetitions of the exercise and progressed by increasing the&#xD;
      number of sets from one to three gradually, targeting BORG dyspnea and fatigue scale of 4 to&#xD;
      6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence with training will be defined as completion of at least 80% of training sessions.&#xD;
      All patients will be encouraged to perform daily activities such as walking and stair&#xD;
      climbing and structured upper and lower limb exercises at home. (Manual/handouts provided). A&#xD;
      diary will be provided to each of them to maintain daily symptoms and exercises at home.&#xD;
