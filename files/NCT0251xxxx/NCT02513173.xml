  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Segmental stabilization exercise has been shown to be effective in the rehabilitation of low&#xD;
      back pain (LBP). Due to the isometric nature of segmental stabilization exercise, manual&#xD;
      therapists use various verbal instructions to elicit lumbar multifidus muscle contraction.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to assess whether or not three verbal instructions would alter&#xD;
      muscle thickness of the lumbar multifidus differently in asymptomatic individuals and&#xD;
      patients with LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three verbal instructions were selected for this study: (1) swell the muscle underneath the&#xD;
      transducer, (2) draw your belly button in towards your spinal column, and (3) think about&#xD;
      tilting your pelvis but without really doing it. Lumbar multifidus muscle thickness was&#xD;
      determined using parasagittal ultrasound imaging. Measurements of muscle thickness were&#xD;
      collected at rest and during verbal instructions from 21 asymptomatic adults and 21 patients&#xD;
      with LBP. Percent changes of muscle thickness during contraction and at rest were compared&#xD;
      between groups and across verbal instructions.&#xD;

      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants were English-speaking adults 18 years of age or older. Additional&#xD;
      criteria for asymptomatic healthy adults included no existing low back pain (LBP) and no LBP&#xD;
      in the past year. Additional criteria for patient participants included existing LBP near the&#xD;
      L5-S1 level with an average pain intensity score ≥ 2/10 (numeric pain rating scale of 0-10, 0&#xD;
      being no pain, 10 being unbearable pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for all participants included previous low back surgery, systemic joint&#xD;
      disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), cancer of the lower quadrant, neurological disorders,&#xD;
      allergic reaction to ultrasound gel, or inability to obtain testing positions (prone lying).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants were informed of the risks, benefits and procedures of the study, they&#xD;
      were asked to sign a written consent form approved by the TWU Institutional Review Board -&#xD;
      Dallas. Eligible participants were asked to complete an intake form, asking them about their&#xD;
      age, gender, and past medical history. For participants with existing LBP, they were asked&#xD;
      about their pain location, duration, intensity, and nature of their existing LBP and their&#xD;
      LBP history. The height and body weight of each participant were taken to determine the body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI). BMI has been shown to be a factor affecting muscle size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Index (OSW) questionnaire was used to determine an&#xD;
           individual's perceived disability and function limitation due to his/her low back pain.&#xD;
           The OSW questionnaire has been shown to be reliable and valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Sonosite M-Turbo ultrasound scanner (Sonosite, Inc., Bothell, WA) was used to measure&#xD;
           muscle size of the lumbar multifidus. A curvilinear transducer (3-5 MHz) will be used to&#xD;
           take transverse images of segmental lumbar multifidus at the L5-S1 segment. If the&#xD;
           patient has multiple painful segments, the most painful segment will be imaged. The most&#xD;
           common painful segments are L4-5 or L5-S1 in patients with LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The ImageJ software (free download from the NIH website) was used to determine muscle&#xD;
           thickness off-line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US Image Acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants was lying in prone on an examination table with their arms on the sides. A&#xD;
      pillow was placed under the participant's abdomen to flatten the lumbar lordotic curve and an&#xD;
      inclinometer was placed on the lumbosacral junction to ensure the lumbar curve ≤10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The right side of asymptomatic healthy adults and the painful side of patients with low back&#xD;
      pain were imaged. The spinous processes of the right L5-S1 or the painful segment were&#xD;
      identified by palpation and marked with an erasable pen. Next, the spinous process was&#xD;
      verified using US imaging. Transverse images of the segmental multifidus muscle were captured&#xD;
      by placing the transducer horizontally on the spinous process of the target segment. The&#xD;
      transverse image of segmental lumbar multifidus was taken 3 times &quot;at rest&quot; and 3 times&#xD;
      during muscle activations of the lumbar multifidus. Activation of lumbar multifidus was&#xD;
      achieved by asking participants to generate a slow gentle sustained (isometric) contraction&#xD;
      of the lumbar multifidus using 3 different verbal instructions without moving their spine or&#xD;
      pelvis. Participants held each contraction for 3-5 seconds. The order of 3 verbal&#xD;
      instructions was given in a random order to minimize the learning and fatigue effects.&#xD;
      Therefore, each participant performed a total of 9 lumbar multifidus muscle contractions&#xD;
      during each testing session. Prior to taking ultrasound images, the anatomy and location of&#xD;
      the lumbar multifidus muscle were explained and shown to participants using a model and&#xD;
      pictures. Next, the following 3 verbal instructions were used to generate a multifidus&#xD;
      contraction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathe in and out and:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Without moving your spine, try to &quot;swell&quot; the muscle underneath the transducer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Without moving your spine, draw your spinal column in toward your belly button.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Attempt to elongate your spine by drawing the muscles in your back up toward your head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were asked to return one week later, the procedure was repeated. The order&#xD;
      of verbal instructions also was randomized in the 2nd session.&#xD;
