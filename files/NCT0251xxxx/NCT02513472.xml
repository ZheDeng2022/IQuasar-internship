  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of eribulin mesylate in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in participants with mTNBC previously treated with 0 (stratum&#xD;
      1) or 1 to 2 (stratum 2) lines of systemic anticancer therapy (cytotoxic or targeted&#xD;
      anticancer agents) in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1b part will evaluate the safety and tolerability of eribulin mesylate in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab. Approximately 6 participants may be enrolled in the Phase 1b&#xD;
      part of the study. The Phase 2 part will evaluate the tumor objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      when treated with eribulin mesylate in combination with pembrolizumab in all participants and&#xD;
      will also evaluate ORR in stratum 2 participants and compare with the historical response&#xD;
      rate of pembrolizumab monotherapy 10 percent (%) in participants with mTNBC previously&#xD;
      treated with &gt;=1 line of prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Approximately 170&#xD;
      mTNBC participants (including participants in Phase 1b who are on RP2D level) will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Phase 2.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From date of first dose of study drug administration to date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first or up to data cutoff date of 31 July 2019 (up to approximately 3 years 11 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using independent imaging review (IIR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. BOR of CR and PR was confirmed by a subsequent CR assessment and CR or PR assessment, respectively at least 4 weeks later. CR: disappearance of all measurable, non-measurable lesions and no unequivocal new lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter (mm). PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD and there are no unequivocal new lesions, and no progression of non-target disease.

    <time_frame>From date of first dose of study drug administration to date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first or up to data cutoff date of 31 July 2019 (up to approximately 3 years 11 months)</time_frame>
    <description>CBR was defined as the percentage of participant, who had BOR of CR, PR, or durable stable disease (dSD) (&gt;=24 weeks). CBR was assessed by IIR based on RECIST 1.1.

             Baseline prolonged QT interval/corrected QT interval ([QT/QTc], example, a repeated&#xD;
             demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;500 millisecond [ms]).&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any other excipients of the eribulin&#xD;

             any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Scheduled for major surgery during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
             The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in the study at 18 investigative sites in the United States. Results are reported in this result summary at primary completion date (31 July 2019). A total 258 participants were screened and enrolled, of which 91 were screen failures and 167 were treated. RP2D is recommended Phase 2 dose.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>As planned, data is reported based on Stratum 1 (No prior treatment with systemic anticancer therapy) and 2 (prior 1 to 2 lines of systemic anticancer therapy) due to better estimating efficacy data for Stratum 2. All participants enrolled in Phase 1b and treated on RP2D level were pooled with the participants in Phase 2 for efficacy analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using independent imaging review (IIR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. BOR of CR and PR was confirmed by a subsequent CR assessment and CR or PR assessment, respectively at least 4 weeks later. CR: disappearance of all measurable, non-measurable lesions and no unequivocal new lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter (mm). PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD and there are no unequivocal new lesions, and no progression of non-target disease.
