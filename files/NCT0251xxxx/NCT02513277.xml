  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with learning (intellectual) disabilities have more health problems than the rest of&#xD;
      the populationÍ¾ they are less likely to access help and have lifestyles that may increase&#xD;
      their risk of getting diabetes (for example, poor diet and lack of physical activity). People&#xD;
      with learning disabilities may also be prescribed drugs or have certain medical conditions&#xD;
      (such as Down's syndrome) which can make their chances of getting diabetes greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is a long-term condition, which can cause damage to the eyes, heart, kidneys, nerves&#xD;
      and feet. Impaired glucose regulation happens when sugar levels in the blood are higher than&#xD;
      normal but are not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. People with impaired glucose&#xD;
      regulation are more likely to develop diabetes, heart disease and stroke in the future. If&#xD;
      people with impaired glucose regulation make changes to their lifestyle (diet and exercise)&#xD;
      they can prevent or delay getting diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to screen people with learning disabilities for diabetes and&#xD;
      impaired glucose regulation. The investigators also want to find out the best way to give&#xD;
      people with learning disabilities some education around healthy lifestyles (for example,&#xD;
      eating and exercise) to help with prevention of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators also aim to develop a lifestyle education programme that is&#xD;
      suitable for use in this population and test whether it is feasible and acceptable.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background -Adults with learning (intellectual) disabilities tend to have more health&#xD;
      problems than the general population and are less likely to access help. Additionally,&#xD;
      evidence suggests that due to a combination of lifestyle factors (e.g. poor diet, lack of&#xD;
      physical activity), associated medical problems, and certain types of prescribed medication,&#xD;
      people with learning disabilities may be at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Our overall aim is to undertake a programme of research that improves&#xD;
      our knowledge and understanding of screening for impaired glucose regulation and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes in a population with learning disabilities, and to develop a lifestyle education&#xD;
      programme for prevention of type 2 diabetes that is suitable for use in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING PROGRAMME&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim - The main programme of work consists of a large diabetes screening programme. The&#xD;
      primary aim of the screening study is to evaluate the feasibility and clinical and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of a screening programme for identifying undiagnosed type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      impaired glucose regulation that is suitable for use in a population with learning&#xD;
      disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods - A variety of approaches will be used to recruit people to the screening study:&#xD;
      General practices will be approached first for participation in this study. If the practice&#xD;
      does not agree, then the investigators will seek to approach eligible people on the&#xD;
      Leicestershire Learning Disabilities Register. Learning disabilities consultants will also&#xD;
      approach people face to face when attending for outpatient clinic appointments. Additionally,&#xD;
      if individuals with learning disabilities (and/or their carer) contact the STOP Diabetes team&#xD;
      to express an interest in the study, they will be given an invitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers will be asked to attend an appointment(s) where consent will be obtained and&#xD;
           biomedical and demographic data collected. The consent process and data collection will&#xD;
           be staged and people may need to attend between one to three appointments to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People who are found to have type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose regulation will be&#xD;
           asked to see their GP for care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At every stage, reasonable adjustments will be made to take into account people's&#xD;
           communication needs and decision making capacity. This may include involving a carer or&#xD;
           a&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A STRUCTURED EDUCATION PROGRAMME&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of additional work being carried out alongside the screening study are to: (1)&#xD;
      develop a lifestyle education programme to meet the needs of a population with learning&#xD;
      disabilities and impaired glucose regulation or high risk of diabetes; (2) assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of collecting outcome measures for participants with learning disabilities before&#xD;
      and 3-months after they attend the education programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods - People approached to take part will be people who took part in the screening study&#xD;
      and (1) gave their consent to be approached to take part in further phases of the research&#xD;
      programme, and (2) were found to be at increased risk of developing diabetes according to&#xD;
      their screening results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Interviews to inform curriculum development:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews will be conducted with a sample of people with mild/moderate learning&#xD;
           disabilities, their carers and healthcare professionals. Findings from the interviews&#xD;
           will help inform development of an initial curriculum and education program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of initial curriculum and obtaining feedback:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As part of the development work the education programme will be piloted with at least&#xD;
           two groups of 6 - 8 people plus carers. Feedback will be collected from some of the&#xD;
           people who attend the education sessions and any necessary changes made to the&#xD;
           curriculum. These cycles of piloting, collecting feedback and modifying the programme&#xD;
           will be repeated until the education programme developed is &quot;fit for purpose&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of programme with collection of before and after measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following initial development, testing and refinement of the curriculum, the education&#xD;
           programme will be delivered with another sample of participants and the feasibility of&#xD;
           collecting pre and post intervention outcome measures will be tested. The investigators&#xD;
           anticipate delivering the programme to up to two groups of 6 - 8 people plus carers.&#xD;
           Data will be collected at baseline and 3-months (12 weeks) following delivery of the&#xD;
           final education session. Data and may include: physical activity and sedentary behaviour&#xD;
           (as measured by accelerometer); body weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure&#xD;
           and dietary intake (fruit and vegetables). Uptake of the education programme&#xD;
           (attendance) and retention at 3-months follow-up will also be explored. This phase will&#xD;
           be subject to modification depending on the findings from prior iterations and any&#xD;
           problems encountered.&#xD;
