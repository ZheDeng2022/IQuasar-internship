  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms&#xD;
      of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the&#xD;
      ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation&#xD;
      of the ocular surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lubricin is a mucin-like glycoprotein originally discovered in synovial fluid, as a secreted&#xD;
      product of cells that line the joint tissues, which is present at the surface of articular&#xD;
      cartilage and it has been investigated on its roles at the ocular surface, in normal and&#xD;
      pathologic conditions such as dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to assess the tolerability, safety and efficacy of Lubricin eye&#xD;
      drops solution administered over 4 weeks versus sodium hyaluronate (Na-HY) eye drops solution&#xD;
      in subjects with moderate dry eye.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye, or keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a chronic inflammatory condition of the ocular&#xD;
      surface that may cause severe symptoms and visual impairment. The 2007 international dry eye&#xD;
      workshop (DEWS) defined the disease as follows: &quot;Dry eye is a multifactorial disease of the&#xD;
      tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear&#xD;
      film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased&#xD;
      osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lubricin is a mucin-like glycoprotein originally discovered in synovial fluid, as a secreted&#xD;
      product of cells that line the joint tissues, which is present at the surface of articular&#xD;
      cartilage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro studies have shown that lubricin in saline buffer acts as a lubricant between&#xD;
      various surfaces, as well as in synovial fluid, providing evidence that lubricin is a&#xD;
      principal lubricating protein in joints. Besides the lubricating property, lubricin has been&#xD;
      shown to exert anti-adhesive action, strain energy dissipation, and a protective effect on&#xD;
      underlying cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lubricin has been investigated on its roles at the ocular surface, in normal and pathologic&#xD;
      conditions such as dry eye. In fact, Lubricin is a natural human protein with most potent&#xD;
      lubricant and anti-adhesive properties present on the ocular surface and on meibonian gland.&#xD;
      The presence of this protein at the ocular surface was first described by the team of&#xD;
      Sullivan D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the available preclinical lubricin studies may be an important barrier to the&#xD;
      development of corneal and conjunctival epitheliopathies in dry eyes and its use as a novel&#xD;
      lubricating and anti-adhesive eye drop is under investigation in this clinical investigation.&#xD;
      This clinical investigation has been designed to demonstrate that a Lubricin 150 µg/ml eye&#xD;
      drop formulation is non-inferior to the currently most-widely used ocular surface lubricant&#xD;
      sodium hyaluronate 0.13% in improving signs and symptoms in patients with moderate dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now, there are no known anticipated adverse events associated with the use of lubricin,&#xD;
      anyway the occurrence of side effects cannot be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It must be considered that topical treatment with lubricin or hyaluronic acid could cause&#xD;
      local irritation or allergic reactions. There are no known contraindications to the use of&#xD;
      lubricin or hyaluronic acid eye drops. All examinations and assessments that will be carried&#xD;
      out during this study are non-invasive, are commonly used in the management of subjects with&#xD;
      dry eye and pose no risk to the subjects. There are no known contraindications to the use of&#xD;
      lubricin or hyaluronic acid eye drops. No data are available about the embryo and fetal&#xD;
      toxicity, therefore the experimental treatment will not be allowed to pregnant women or&#xD;
      nursing mothers and women of childbearing potential not using appropriate birth control&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
