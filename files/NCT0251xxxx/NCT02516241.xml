      MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) Monotherapy and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) in Combination with Tremelimumab&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center, global Phase III study to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy and safety of MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) monotherapy and MEDI4736&#xD;
      (Durvalumab) in combination with tremelimumab versus SoC (cisplatin + gemcitabine or&#xD;
      carboplatin + gemcitabine doublet) first-line chemotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with&#xD;
      histologically or cytologically documented, unresectable, Stage IV transitional cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (transitional cell and mixed transitional/non-transitional cell histologies) of the&#xD;
      urothelium (including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra) and to allow&#xD;
      sufficient flexibility for Investigators and patients to select the agents that reflect their&#xD;
      normal clinical practice and national guidelines. The patients enrolled in the study will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1:1 to receive treatment with combination therapy, monotherapy, or SoC&#xD;
      (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine, based on cisplatin eligibility).&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) or MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) with&#xD;
      tremelimumab, or treated with SoC until progressive disease (PD) is confirmed, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity occurs, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for up to 2 years.&#xD;

All the 5 subscales (PWB (0-28), FWB (0-28), EWB (0-24), SWB (0-28), and BlCS(0-48)) are summed as the FACT-BL total score (range 0-156), while the sum of PWB, FWB and BICS constitutes the FACT-BL TOI (range 0-104).&#xD;
NFBlSI-18 (range 0-72) is based on the scores of 16 items (GP4, C2, BL1, GP3, GE6, GE1, C6, BL5, GF5, GP2, GP1, GP6, C3, GP5, GF3, GF7) and 2 extra items &quot;I feel weak all overall&quot; and &quot;I feel light-headed (dizzy)&quot;. The range of each item is 0-4.&#xD;

    <description>the change from baseline in the following total/index scores will be evaluated as secondary endpoints: FACT-BL TOI (refer to as TOI), FACT-BL Total score, and NFBlSI-18 score.&#xD;
All the 5 subscales (PWB (0-28), FWB (0-28), EWB (0-24), SWB (0-28), and BlCS(0-48)) are summed as the FACT-BL total score (range 0-156), while the sum of PWB, FWB and BICS constitutes the FACT-BL TOI (range 0-104).&#xD;
NFBlSI-18 (range 0-72) is based on the scores of 16 items (GP4, C2, BL1, GP3, GE6, GE1, C6, BL5, GF5, GP2, GP1, GP6, C3, GP5, GF3, GF7) and 2 extra items &quot;I feel weak all overall&quot; and &quot;I feel light-headed (dizzy)&quot;. The range of each item is 0-4.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients eligible or ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Cisplatin&#xD;

          -  Active infection including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;

             mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent • Steroids as premedication for&#xD;

        <title>Number of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) Response to Durvalumab, Safety Analysis Set - ADA Evaluable Patients</title>
        <description>Serum Samples will be measured for the presence of ADAs and ADA-neutralizing antibodies for Durvalumab using validated assays. Tiered analysis will be performed to include screening, confirmatory, and titer assay components, and positive-negative cut points previously statistically determined from drug-naïve validation samples will be used. Persistently positive is defined as having at least 2 post-baseline ADA positive measurements with at least 16 weeks (112 days) between the first and last positive measurements, or an ADA positive result at the last available assessment. Transiently positive is defined as having at least one post-baseline ADA positive measurement and not fulfilling the conditions for persistently positive. The category may include patients meeting these criteria who are ADA positive at baseline.</description>

        <description>Serum Samples will be measured for the presence of ADAs and ADA-neutralizing antibodies for Tremelimumab using validated assays. Tiered analysis will be performed to include screening, confirmatory, and titer assay components, and positive-negative cut points previously statistically determined from drug-naïve validation samples will be used. Persistently positive is defined as having at least 2 post-baseline ADA positive measurements with at least 16 weeks (112 days) between the first and last positive measurements, or an ADA positive result at the last available assessment. Transiently positive is defined as having at least one post-baseline ADA positive measurement and not fulfilling the conditions for persistently positive. The category may include patients meeting these criteria who are ADA positive at baseline.</description>

        <description>the change from baseline in the following total/index scores will be evaluated as secondary endpoints: FACT-BL TOI (refer to as TOI), FACT-BL Total score, and NFBlSI-18 score.&#xD;
All the 5 subscales (PWB (0-28), FWB (0-28), EWB (0-24), SWB (0-28), and BlCS(0-48)) are summed as the FACT-BL total score (range 0-156), while the sum of PWB, FWB and BICS constitutes the FACT-BL TOI (range 0-104).&#xD;
NFBlSI-18 (range 0-72) is based on the scores of 16 items (GP4, C2, BL1, GP3, GE6, GE1, C6, BL5, GF5, GP2, GP1, GP6, C3, GP5, GF3, GF7) and 2 extra items &quot;I feel weak all overall&quot; and &quot;I feel light-headed (dizzy)&quot;. The range of each item is 0-4.&#xD;
Higher score represent worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in FACT-BL (Derived NFBlSI-18 Score, FACT-BL TOI, and FACT-BL Total Score) by MMRM Analysis, PD-L1-Low/Negative Analysis Set -Durvalumab + Tremelimumab Combination Therapy vs SoC and Durvalumab Mono Therapy vs SoC</title>
        <description>the change from baseline in the following total/index scores will be evaluated as secondary endpoints: FACT-BL TOI (refer to as TOI), FACT-BL Total score, and NFBlSI-18 score.&#xD;
All the 5 subscales (PWB (0-28), FWB (0-28), EWB (0-24), SWB (0-28), and BlCS(0-48)) are summed as the FACT-BL total score (range 0-156), while the sum of PWB, FWB and BICS constitutes the FACT-BL TOI (range 0-104).&#xD;
NFBlSI-18 (range 0-72) is based on the scores of 16 items (GP4, C2, BL1, GP3, GE6, GE1, C6, BL5, GF5, GP2, GP1, GP6, C3, GP5, GF3, GF7) and 2 extra items &quot;I feel weak all overall&quot; and &quot;I feel light-headed (dizzy)&quot;. The range of each item is 0-4.&#xD;
Higher score represent worse</description>
        <time_frame>At baseline then every 8 weeks until second progression/death, whichever comes first. Assessed up to the data cut-off date (27JAN2020, a maximum of 5 years).</time_frame>
        <population>The PD-L1-Low/Negative analysis set will include the subset of patients in the FAS whose PD-L1 status is PD-L1-Low/negative as defined by an Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay developed by Ventana as:&#xD;
