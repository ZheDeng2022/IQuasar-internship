      This is an open-label, staggered dose-escalation, cohort expansion study that will enroll&#xD;
      subjects at multiple study sites in the United States of America (USA) and Australia. The&#xD;
      study will consist of two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low dose (100 mg) CC-90001 administered orally once daily (QD) for 12 continuous weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High dose (200 mg) CC-90001 administered orally QD for 12 continuous weeks. The high&#xD;
           dose (200 mg) CC-90001 arm will not start until at least three subjects complete a&#xD;
           minimum of 2 weeks of low-dose CC 90001 and the low dose treatment arm is determined not&#xD;
           to meet the study dose escalation stopping criteria (Figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in a Screening (up to 4 weeks prior to treatment), a 12 week&#xD;
      Treatment Phase, and a 4-week Follow-up visit. Subjects will be screened for eligibility.&#xD;
      Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at&#xD;
      Screening will return to the study site on Day 1 for assessments and to begin administration&#xD;
      of a QD dose of CC 90001, according to the dose level in which the subject is enrolled. Three&#xD;
      subjects will initially be enrolled to receive low dose CC-90001 (100 mg QD), and will be&#xD;
      evaluated for all scheduled assessments through 12 weeks of treatment. Once a total of three&#xD;
      subjects have completed the Week 2 visit, a decision to continue the study at the high dose&#xD;
      level (200 mg QD) will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the criteria for escalation to the high dose (CC-90001 200 mg QD) are met, the low dose&#xD;
      (CC-90001 100 mg QD) subjects will remain on low dose (CC-90001 100 mg QD) and six additional&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled at the high dose level (CC-90001 200 mg QD). If one of the three&#xD;
      subjects at the low dose (CC-90001 100 mg QD) experiences an event that meets the individual&#xD;
      subject dose stopping criteria, another three subjects will be enrolled in the low dose arm.&#xD;
      Dose escalation to the high dose (CC-90001 200 mg QD) will not occur if two or more of the&#xD;
      six subjects meet the individual subject dose stopping criteria. All subjects (low and high&#xD;
      dose) will remain on CC-90001 for a total of 12 weeks unless an individual subject&#xD;
      experiences an event that meets any of the individual subject stopping criteria. In addition,&#xD;
      the dose of CC-90001 may be reduced CC-90001 200 mg QD to CC-90001 100 mg QD) for an&#xD;
      individual who meets any of the individual subject dose reduction criteria. If two or more&#xD;
      subjects in the high dose (CC-90001 200 mg QD) arm experience an event that meets the&#xD;
      individual stopping criteria, the 100 mg QD dose arm may be repeated in three additional&#xD;
      subjects, or the study may be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at Screening, Day 1, and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 (a&#xD;
      Follow-up visit). Blood and urine samples will be collected at specified times for clinical&#xD;
      safety laboratory assessments, pharmacokinetic analysis (how the drug affects the body), and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic analysis (how the body affects the drug). Safety will be monitored throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

                  and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study medication. A FCBP is&#xD;

                  24 consecutive months (ie, who has had menses at any time in the preceding 24&#xD;
                  consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. All FCBPs must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Day 1. Any FCBP&#xD;
                  who engages in activity in which conception is possible must use two forms of&#xD;
                  contraception simultaneously while on CC-90001 and for at least 28 days after&#xD;
                  taking the last dose of CC-90001: one highly effective form (ie, hormonal,&#xD;

                  form (latex condom or any nonlatex condom NOT made of natural [animal] membrane&#xD;
                  [eg, polyurethane], diaphragm, sponge). If one highly effective form of&#xD;

                  used, ie, latex condom or any nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural (animal)&#xD;
                  membrane [eg, polyurethane] with either of the following: sponge with spermicide&#xD;
                  or diaphragm with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Female subjects that are postmenopausal (defined as 24 months without menses&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days preceding&#xD;
                  the first dose of CC-90001 administration, or five half-lives of that&#xD;
                  investigational drug, if known (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subjects who are part of the clinical staff personnel or family members of the&#xD;
                  study site staff.&#xD;
