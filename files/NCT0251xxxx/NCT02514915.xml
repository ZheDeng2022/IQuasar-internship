  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this research study is to determine the efficacy of giving pre-operative&#xD;
      radiosurgery to patients pending resection of a brain metastasis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have a brain metastasis surgically resected have very high local rates of&#xD;
      disease relapse, and so the standard of care is to give either whole brain irradiation or&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery to the resection cavity in order to prevent disease recurrence.&#xD;
      Stereotactic radiosurgery generally offers a more favorable side effect profile than whole&#xD;
      brain irradiation, but targeting a surgical resection bed can be a challenge, as post&#xD;
      surgical changes make it more difficult to distinguish residual tumor from scar, and much of&#xD;
      the dose ends up being focused on the center of the resection cavity, where there are no&#xD;
      substantial tumor cells.&#xD;

    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) is a quality of life (QOL) assessment tool used in patients with primary brain tumors. Questionnaires include the FACT-General (FACT-G), a core questionnaire used to determine the more general domains of QOL among all cancer patients and the FACT-Brain (FACT-Br) which assesses brain-tumor related QOL issues. There are 50 items covering the following domains of QOL: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and disease specific concerns. Patients are asked to indicate the presence/severity of certain issues/symptoms on a scale of 0 - 4 (a 5-point Likert Scale). High scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
