      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Influenza is a common viral infection. But it can be deadly for some people. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn more about how the body fights this virus. They want to study this in people&#xD;
      who have recently been infected with influenza. They hope this can help them create more&#xD;
      effective influenza vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn about long-term changes in the body s immune system after influenza infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People who have completed a previous LID Clinical Studies Unit influenza challenge study&#xD;
      and are willing to have samples stored for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be asked to visit the clinic every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During each visit, participants will have blood drawn from an arm vein using a needle&#xD;
           and a syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a medical history and physical exam and vital signs performed.&#xD;
           This will include blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, temperature, weight, and&#xD;
           finger-measured blood oxygen. They will answer questions about any medicines taken and&#xD;
           possible recent illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants have symptoms of influenza, they may have a sample taken from the nose.&#xD;
           A small &lt;TAB&gt;amount of salt water will be sprayed into the nostril with a squeezable&#xD;
           container. The salt water will then run out of the nose and into the container. Or the&#xD;
           inside of the nose will be wiped with a swab that is&#xD;
&#xD;
      similar to a Q-tip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Participants will complete a health questionnaire once a month on a secure website.&#xD;
      Participants may also give their responses over the telephone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Circulating anti-influenza antibodies are an important factor in predicting clinical illness&#xD;
      and severity in those infected with influenza. Specific antibodies against influenza include&#xD;
      proteins targeting hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Lifelong immunity does not&#xD;
      occur with influenza, either from natural infection or from vaccination. Due to the antigenic&#xD;
      variation of Influenza A, individuals may become infected multiple times with the same&#xD;
      subtype of influenza and even with the same strain. In the setting of natural infection and&#xD;
      vaccination, antibody titer levels can persist initially, but then wane over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our previous challenge studies, measurements of antibody responses have been focused&#xD;
      solely on the acute infection period up to 2 months after initial infection. Long-term&#xD;
      changes in immunity have not been investigated. The challenge setting gives us the unique&#xD;
      ability to follow individuals from a specific, known and well-characterized exposure/illness&#xD;
      to measure long-term changes in antibody titers from a pre-exposure baseline. This study&#xD;
      could offer unique insight into how anti-influenza antibody titers change over time naturally&#xD;
      and in response to other infections and life events. This type of controlled study has never&#xD;
      been done and we believe monitoring titers long-term will help us better understand&#xD;
      protective correlates of influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this natural history study, we will follow individuals who have undergone influenza&#xD;
      challenge or have been naturally infected with influenza to evaluate changes in&#xD;
      anti-influenza antibody titers over a 2-year period. Subjects will be followed for symptoms&#xD;
      of influenza-like illness (ILI) and other changes in clinical status through quarterly&#xD;
      clinical evaluations with blood draws. Monthly questionnaires will be used to follow subjects&#xD;
      in between visits.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Completion of participation in an LID Clinical Studies Unit influenza challenge&#xD;
                  study or current or prior participation in an LID natural history study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Willing to have samples stored for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CO-ENROLLMENT GUIDELINES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants may be co-enrolled in other research studies. This will be addressed on a&#xD;
        case-by-case basis with the approval of the principal investigator (PI) or associate&#xD;
        investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If a participant enrolls in another influenza challenge study, the participant will be&#xD;
        removed from this study. The participant can re-enroll in this study after completion of&#xD;
        the influenza challenge study and will be followed for two years following completion of&#xD;
        the most recent influenza challenge study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any condition or event that, in the PI s opinion, may substantially increase the risk&#xD;
        associated with study participation or compromise the study s scientific objectives.&#xD;
        Conditions that exclude a subject are considered to be unlikely, but an example would&#xD;
        include a newly diagnosed medical condition that may alter a participant s immune system&#xD;
        and make it unsafe to obtain scheduled blood samples for research purposes.&#xD;
