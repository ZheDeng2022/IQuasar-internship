  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is defined as &quot;An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or&#xD;
      potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.&quot; In particular, chronic pain&#xD;
      has significant impact on health care cost and socio-economic aspects of the society. It is&#xD;
      clear that the development of effective chronic pain management is paramount in reducing the&#xD;
      significant socio-economic burden of this common healthcare problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the difficulties in measuring outcomes in chronic pain patients is the subjective&#xD;
      nature of pain. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) was developed in 1975 with the aim of&#xD;
      quantifying the subjective pain experiences of patients. Since then it has become one of the&#xD;
      major assessment tools in evaluation of chronic pain patients during the course of&#xD;
      treatments. The Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) developed in 1987 has further&#xD;
      refined pain descriptors into &quot;sensory&quot; and &quot;affective&quot; domains, and incorporating the Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS) for easier administration in hospitals and clinics. The validity and&#xD;
      reliability of both the original English and translated versions of MPQ and SF-MPQ have been&#xD;
      well demonstrated. The latest version of Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2)&#xD;
      included descriptive terms for neuropathic pain which expanded the scope of coverage on&#xD;
      chronic neuropathic pain patients. It has also been evaluated in cancer pain patients.&#xD;
      Translated versions of SF-MPQ-2 showed good reliability and validity. Therefore the&#xD;
      investigators devised this study to (1) translate SF-MPQ-2 into Traditional Chinese-Cantonese&#xD;
      (C-SF-MPQ-2) suitable for use in Hong Kong patients, (2) examine the validity, reliability&#xD;
      and psychometric properties of this translated version in Hong Kong patients.&#xD;

      Objectives of this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To validate the C-SF-MPQ-2 among chronic pain patients in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the validity, reliability and psychometric properties of the C-SF-MPQ-2 as&#xD;
           an assessment tool for measuring pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design Prospective non-randomized trial with self-administered questionnaire in chronic&#xD;
      pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study will be carried out in 2 phases (I and II). Phase I refers to the&#xD;
      translation process and phase II refers to the validation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this study will be carried out at 2 pain centres (Hong Kong West Cluster Pain&#xD;
      Management Centre and Kowloon East Cluster Pain Management Centre), approvals from Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of Hong Kong West Cluster and Kowloon East Cluster will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (I) Translation of the original English version of SF-MPQ-2 into Traditional&#xD;
      Chinese-Cantonese version (C-SF-MPQ-2) Forward translation shall be done by one pain&#xD;
      specialist and one lay person with linguistic background. Both shall be native&#xD;
      Chinese-Cantonese speaker with proficiency in English. Each translator shall produce a&#xD;
      translated version independently. Afterwards the principle investigator will co-ordinate with&#xD;
      both translators to come up with one commonly agreed translated version (version 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Backward translation shall be done by one pain specialist who is a native English speaker&#xD;
      with proficiency in Chinese-Cantonese (version 2). This will be compared to the original&#xD;
      questionnaire. The principle investigator will discuss with all the translators on any&#xD;
      discrepancy between version 2 and the original version and make necessary adjustments to&#xD;
      version 1 to produce a revised version (version 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translated version 3 will then be tested on 5 randomly selected chronic pain patients&#xD;
      from both pain management centres. They shall be native Chinese-Cantonese speakers. Consent&#xD;
      will be obtained beforehand. An interviewer will inquire whether patients have any difficulty&#xD;
      on completing the questionnaire or have any suggestions with regard to the translated terms.&#xD;
      Any adjustments shall be made after receiving feedback from the interviewer to produce the&#xD;
      finalized version (C-SF-MPQ-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (II) Validation of C-SF-MPQ-2 A total of 220 chronic pain patients will be recruited for the&#xD;
      process of validation. After obtaining consent, basic demographic information including age,&#xD;
      sex, pain diagnosis and duration, education level, co-existing medical problems and&#xD;
      employment status will be recorded. The C-SF-MPQ-2 will then be administered to patients. For&#xD;
      the construct validity, the Chinese versions of Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (SF-36),&#xD;
      ID-Pain and Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) will be administered at the same time. For the&#xD;
      test-retest reliability, the C-SF-MPQ-2 will be administered again after 2 weeks at the pain&#xD;
      management centres during which patients should not receive any alternation in their pain&#xD;
      management or intervention. Patients' data privacy and confidentiality will be ensured during&#xD;
      the entire process of study.&#xD;
