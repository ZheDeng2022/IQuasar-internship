    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well docetaxel works when given with or without&#xD;
      ascorbic acid in treating patients with prostate cancer that has spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is a water-soluble vitamin that may&#xD;
      help inhibit the growth of cancer cells. It is not yet known whether docetaxel works better&#xD;
      when given with or without ascorbic acid in treating prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the proportion of metastatic prostate cancer patients with a prostate specific&#xD;
      antigen (PSA) decline of &gt;= 50% over 8 cycles of docetaxel with ascorbic acid (Arm A) versus&#xD;
      docetaxel with placebo (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the proportion of adverse events (fatigue, nausea, bone pain, and anorexia)&#xD;
      experienced by metastatic prostate cancer patients receiving either docetaxel with ascorbic&#xD;
      acid (Arm A) versus docetaxel with placebo (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer and compare between treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the proportion of high grade serious adverse events (fatigue, nausea, bone&#xD;
      pain, and anorexia) in patients with metastatic prostate cancer and compare between treatment&#xD;
      arms during 8 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the proportion of high grade serious adverse events (all types) in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic prostate cancer and compare between treatment arms during 8 cycles of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess changes in quality of life measures as assessed by the Functional Assessment of&#xD;
      Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the proportion of metastatic prostate cancer patients requiring docetaxel dose&#xD;
      reductions and compare between treatment arms during 8 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether ascorbic acid alters docetaxel exposure and compare between treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine peak and trough ascorbic acid levels. III. As a pharmacodynamic measure of&#xD;
      oxidant injury in vivo, measure F2-isoprostanes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 and ascorbic&#xD;
      acid IV thrice weekly. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and placebo IV over 60 minutes&#xD;
      thrice weekly. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
