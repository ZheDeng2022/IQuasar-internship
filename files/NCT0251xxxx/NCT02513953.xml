      Objective:To present an extremely rare site of occurrence of endometriotic cyst in the layers&#xD;
      of Broad Ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient:A 32 yrs.old woman,married 4 yrs.,presented to OB-GY Dept.with acute,gnawing pain in&#xD;
      lower abdomen and history of sub-fertility.Diagnostic Laparoscopy and pelvic ultrasound were&#xD;
      performed in emergency.Oblong cyst structure,41x21x23mm in the left adnexa,away from ovary&#xD;
      and uterus was identified and excised by Four Port laparoscopic interventional surgery.&#xD;

      Endometriosis is the second most common finding in the pelvis of females in their&#xD;
      reproductive age, frequently associated with primary infertility. Endometrioma, within layers&#xD;
      of broad ligament has been reported, but only in four cases, so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contributing factors in the etiopathogenesis of endometriosis and endometriomas are&#xD;
      retrograde menstrual flow, metaplasia, genetic predisposition, lymphatic/ vascular&#xD;
      distribution, immune dysfunction and environmental influences. Etiopathogenesis of&#xD;
      endometriosis is still poorly understood, the main theories being embryonic, migratory and&#xD;
      immunologic. Embryonic theories suggest that endometriosis develops from the remnants of&#xD;
      wolffian ducts or the Mullerian ducts or may develop from the metaplasia of the peritoneal or&#xD;
      the ovarian tissue. Migratory theories suggest transportation of endometrial tissue to&#xD;
      distant places via fallopian tubes or, lymphovascular structure and subsequent implantation&#xD;
      as the cause of endometriosis. Immunologic theory implies that altered immune response may&#xD;
      help in ectopic endometrial implantation. However, all these mechanisms may act&#xD;
      synergistically and not in exclusion of each other. Endometrial alterations in the eutopic&#xD;
      endometrium have also been demonstrated in women with endometriosis. These alterations&#xD;
      involve progesterone receptors co - activator, Hic - 5 resulting in resistance to&#xD;
      progesterone. Endometriosis commonly involves ovaries, POD, uterosacral ligaments and&#xD;
      rectovaginal septum, all within the pelvis. This accounts for the retrograde menstruation&#xD;
      being the most popular theory of pathogenesis for endometriosis. But endometriosis may&#xD;
      develop at many unusual locations incl. abdominal wall, urinary system, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      system, thorax, inguinal canal, large muscular or in few cases, within the layers of broad&#xD;
      ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometriosis, within the layers of broad ligament presents with classical symptoms of pelvic&#xD;
      endometriosis, triad of chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. Our patient, under&#xD;
      reporting, presented with throbbing pain in lower abdomen. Other descriptions of pain being&#xD;
      gnawing pain or dragging pain to the legs. Compared to women with superficial endometriosis,&#xD;
      those with deep disease are more likely to report dyschezia. All the four cases of&#xD;
      endometriosis of broad ligament reported so far, had one or more of these symptoms, the most&#xD;
      common being episodic or continuous in low abdomen. All these cases reported were 27 - 34yrs&#xD;
      old. Although, endometriosis is strongly associated with infertility no association between&#xD;
      broad ligament endometrioma and infertility has been reported so far. Previously reported&#xD;
      cases have been either parous or nulliparous females not desirous of childbearing, our&#xD;
      patient under reporting, is the first case being reported as a female presenting with&#xD;
      subfertility. This association needs to be explored in future because apart from localized&#xD;
      endometrioma, there were no other locations of endometriosis anywhere in the pelvis, in&#xD;
      ovarian fossa, in POD or anywhere else. Could it be that implantation is the prerequisite in&#xD;
      endometriomas causing infertility? Complete excision of cyst wall is preferred over drainage&#xD;
      and ablation. The female patient was posted for operative laparoscopy in the post - menstrual&#xD;
      period. Four port laparoscopy was preferred to visualize oblong cystic structure, measuring&#xD;
      4x3cms within the layers of left mesosalpinx. A small incision was applied on the most&#xD;
      prominent part of the cyst on the posterior leaf of mesosalpinx and thick chocolate fluid was&#xD;
      suctioned out. Cystectomy was performed, dissecting the cyst wall from the leaves of&#xD;
      mesosalpinx, using harmonic. Posterior leaf of mesosalpinx was repaired with three&#xD;
      interrupted sutures using vicryl no.1. Through peritoneal lavage with normal saline was&#xD;
      given. Patient was discharged on the same day after uncomplicated post - operative period.&#xD;
