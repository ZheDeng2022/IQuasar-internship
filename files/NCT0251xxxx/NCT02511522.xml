  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether one dose of palliative radiation therapy directed&#xD;
      to the liver in combination with standard BSC might help to reduce liver pain/discomfort due&#xD;
      to cancer when compared to getting standard BSC alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for liver cancer pain or discomfort like yours is known as best&#xD;
      supportive care (BSC) and includes pain-relieving medicines called analgesics. This type of&#xD;
      treatment can help in some cases; however, some analgesics require a healthy liver to work&#xD;
      properly. This means that there are many patients who have a hard time managing their liver&#xD;
      cancer pain/discomfort with BSC alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sometimes radiation therapy is given in the &quot;palliative&quot; setting meaning it is designed to&#xD;
      treat the pain/discomfort and not necessarily to shrink or eliminate the tumour. Palliative&#xD;
      radiation therapy is often given when patients have painful bone tumours, but is not yet&#xD;
      widely used to treat liver pain/discomfort. Palliative radiation therapy is usually given in&#xD;
      smaller amounts and less frequently than other kinds of radiation therapy.&#xD;

                  washout on multiphasic computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
                  (MRI) in the setting of cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B or C without cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Largest burden of cancer in the liver is confirmed with CT scan or MRI corresponding&#xD;
             to the clinically painful area done within 120 days prior to randomization.&#xD;

             locally advanced cancer (at least one lesion &gt; 10cm, vascular invasion, or multiple&#xD;
             lesions with at least one &gt; 6cm) involving the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the investigator's opinion, patient is unsuitable for or refractory to standard&#xD;
             local and regional therapies. For example:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HCC unsuitable for resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemo&#xD;
                  embolization (TACE) or radical intent, ablative dose stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
                  therapy (SBRT);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Colorectal carcinoma metastases unsuitable for resection, RFA or radical intent,&#xD;
                  ablative dose SBRT (e.g. SBRT, &gt; 30 Gy in 5 fractions, may be an option for up to&#xD;
                  3 metastases &lt; 5cm each, or up to 5 metastases &lt; 3 cm each).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unsuitable for, high risk for, or refractory to, standard systemic chemotherapy or&#xD;
             targeted therapy (e.g. sorafenib).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient reports moderate or severe pain/discomfort prior to the baseline evaluation&#xD;
             and this pain is considered &quot;stable&quot; over a period of up to 7 days prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Definition of moderate pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient reports level of 4-6 (on a BPI scale from 0 to 10) pain or discomfort &quot;at its worst&#xD;
        in the past 24 hours&quot;, occurring in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, the upper&#xD;
        abdomen and/or referred to the right shoulder, attributable to liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Definition of severe pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient reports level of 7-10 (on a BPI scale from 0 to 10) pain or discomfort &quot;at its&#xD;
        worst in the past 24 hours&quot;, occurring in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, the&#xD;
        upper abdomen and/or referred to the right shoulder, attributable to liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Definition of &quot;stable&quot; pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must show moderate or severe &quot;stable&quot; pain by reporting a score of 4 or greater (on&#xD;
        2 separate days within the 7 day period prior to randomization) with the difference of&#xD;
        these scores being 0, 1, 2 or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient reports moderate or severe pain (i.e. pain score is 4 or higher). This&#xD;
             baseline score must also be stable compared to the most recent pre-baseline pain score&#xD;
             with the difference between these scores being 0, 1, 2, or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood work obtained within 14 days prior to randomization as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 70 g/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt; 25 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.0 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  INR &lt; 3;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin &lt; 2.5 UNL (except for subjects with Gilbert's Disease who are eligible&#xD;
                  despite elevated serum bilirubin level)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST or ALT &lt; 10 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-3 within 14 days&#xD;
             of Randomization (see Appendix II).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older at the time of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing to complete the Pre-Baseline Pain/Discomfort Questionnaire and the&#xD;
             Pain/Discomfort and Medication Questionnaire in English, French or other validated&#xD;
             language (please contact the HE.1 Study Coordinator). The baseline assessment must be&#xD;
             completed within required timelines prior to randomization. Unwillingness to complete&#xD;
             the Pre-Baseline Pain/Discomfort Questionnaire and Pain/Discomfort and Medication&#xD;
             Questionnaire will make the patient ineligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is able (i.e. sufficiently fluent) and willing to complete the QoL&#xD;
             questionnaires in English, French or other languages in which the FACT-Hep is&#xD;
             available. The baseline assessment must be completed within required timelines prior&#xD;
             to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability (illiteracy in languages listed above, loss of sight, or other equivalent reason)&#xD;
        to complete the questionnaires will not make the patient ineligible for the study. However,&#xD;
        ability but unwillingness to complete the QoL questionnaires will make the patient&#xD;
        ineligible for QoL assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is not pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant or planning on fathering a&#xD;
             child in the next 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women/men of childbearing potential must have agreed to use a highly effective&#xD;
        contraceptive method. A woman is considered to be of &quot;childbearing potential&quot; if she has&#xD;
        had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. In addition to routine&#xD;
        contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual celibacy and&#xD;
        surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention)&#xD;
        defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or&#xD;
        vasectomy/vasectomized partner. However, if at any point a previously celibate patient&#xD;
        chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive&#xD;
        measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive&#xD;
        measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test to determine eligibility as part&#xD;
        of the Pre-Study Evaluation; this may include an ultrasound to rule-out pregnancy if a&#xD;
        false-positive is suspected. For example, when beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is high&#xD;
        and partner is vasectomized, it may be associated with tumour production of hCG, as seen&#xD;
        with some cancers. Patient will be considered eligible if an ultrasound is negative for&#xD;
        pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and&#xD;
             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrolment in&#xD;
             the trial to document their willingness to participate;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Investigators must ensure the&#xD;
             patients randomized on this trial will be available for complete documentation of the&#xD;
             treatment, adverse events, and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working&#xD;
             days of patient randomization (earlier is preferred).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy to the upper abdomen that would result in substantial overlap of&#xD;
             the irradiated volume (e.g. &gt; 50% of liver receiving &gt; 24 Gy in 2 Gy equivalent dose);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior selective internal radiotherapy directed to the liver or hepatic arterial&#xD;
             yttrium therapy, at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cholangitis or acute bacterial infection requiring intravenous antibiotics within 28&#xD;
             days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographic evidence of intrabiliary cancer within the common or main branches of the&#xD;
             biliary system, &lt; 4 months prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child-Pugh score greater than C10 (a score of C10 is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy or TACE administered within the past 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Targeted therapy (e.g. Sorafenib) received within the past 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plans for chemotherapy, targeted therapy or TACE in the next 4 weeks.&#xD;
