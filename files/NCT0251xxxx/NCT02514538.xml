  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paracetamol's solubility is achieved by adding to the excipient sodium salts, either as&#xD;
      bicarbonate, carbonate or citrate. As the relationship between salt and hypertension is well&#xD;
      known, due to the sodium content it has raised a hypothesis that may interfere with the&#xD;
      control of that risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the effect on blood pressure of&#xD;
      effervescent paracetamol compared to non-effervescent, in hypertensive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, crossover, open, phase IV clinical trial,&#xD;
      which compares the effect of two different formulations of paracetamol (effervescent or&#xD;
      non-effervescent tablets) in the blood pressure of hypertensive patients after 3 weeks&#xD;
      treatment (coded EUDRACT 2010-023485-53). The washing time between the two periods is&#xD;
      approximately 1 week (minimum 3 days)&#xD;

      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be hypertensive patients over 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with degenerative joint disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  which regularly need analgesic treatment. They must submit BP in the consultation lower&#xD;
           than 150 and 95 mmHg or lower than 135 and 85 mmHg if they have associated&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease (stroke, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease) or&#xD;
           diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They can't receive pharmacological antihypertensive treatment, or this must be stable and&#xD;
      unchanged in the last month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to osteoarticular disease, they should have a degree of mild to moderate pain,&#xD;
      with a score between 1 and 4 on a visual analog scale (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the change in mean daytime, night-time (sleep) and 24-hour systolic&#xD;
      BP, measured by ABPM, from baseline at 3 weeks of treatment in both periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in systolic BP measured in the clinic at the end of 3-week follow-up respect&#xD;
           baseline in both periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour, daytime and night-time (sleep) diastolic BP measured by ABPM: change from&#xD;
           baseline at 3 weeks of treatment in both periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in diastolic BP measured in the clinic at the end of 3-week follow-up respect&#xD;
           baseline in both periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients maintaining clinical BP under 140 and 90 mmHg at the end of each&#xD;
           period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Degree of pain assessed by visual analog scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consumption of rescue medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapeutic compliance&#xD;
