      Endometriosis, one of the most common diseases of women during their reproductive period.,&#xD;
      may present a chronic disabling disease with major impact on women's life. Therapeutic&#xD;
      options are limited and recurrence of disease symptoms is frequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study investigates the quality of life and several risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of endometriosis as well as satisfaction with medical support in a minimum of 600&#xD;
      women with different stages of endometriosis and the same number of control women matched for&#xD;
      age (± 3 years) and nationality. To evaluate specific features of endometriosis-associated&#xD;
      pain a second group of 100 women with chronic abdominal/pelvic pain not related to&#xD;
      endometriosis is investigated. Recruitment takes place in different university clinics, and&#xD;
      districts hospitals in Switzerland, Germany. And Austria. Control women i.e. women without&#xD;
      any evidence for endometriosis presenting for annual routine gynaecological controls are&#xD;
      collected at the same places.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A composition of different internationally validated questionnaires as well as specific&#xD;
      questions on dealing with endometriosis is used to collect information on the quality of life&#xD;
      and potential risk factors for endometriosis. Questions on sexuality and partnership are also&#xD;
      distributed to women's partners. All diagnosis of endometriosis and classification of ASRM&#xD;
      (American Society for Reproductive Medicine) disease stages are based on woman's medical&#xD;
      charts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With a prevalence of 7-10% endometriosis is one of the most common diseases of women during&#xD;
      their reproductive period. There is a broad range of clinical symptoms of endometriosis,&#xD;
      which may vary between an incidental asymptomatic finding and a chronic severely painful&#xD;
      disease. Symptoms are nearly independent from disease stage and current therapeutic options&#xD;
      do not permit to reliably reduce symptoms to an acceptable level. Independent from the&#xD;
      therapy chosen, about 20% of women re-develop clinical symptoms in the first year and another&#xD;
      50% within a period of five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The currently provided medical support concentrates on surgical and medical i.e. hormonal&#xD;
      options. Although it seems evident that endometriosis-associated pain will have a serious&#xD;
      impact on the daily life of women attaint and there is a broad literature on the effect of&#xD;
      other chronic pain diseases on patients' lives, comparable data for endometriosis are rare.&#xD;
      Also, support models to allow women to integrate a chronic endometriosis into their daily&#xD;
      life are currently lacking. To provide a reliable basis for the development of better&#xD;
      holistic support models, the current study collects data on different aspects of the quality&#xD;
      of life in a minimum of 600 women with different stages of endometriosis and a minimum of 600&#xD;
      control women matched for age (± 3 years) and nationality. To evaluate which features of the&#xD;
      quality of life are specific for endometriosis a second control group of 100 women with&#xD;
      chronic abdominal/pelvic pain not related to endometriosis is investigated. Recruitment takes&#xD;
      place in different university clinics, and districts hospitals in Switzerland, Germany and&#xD;
      Austria. Control women i.e. women without any evidence for endometriosis presenting for&#xD;
      annual routine gynaecological controls are collected at the same places.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A composition of different internationally validated questionnaires as well as specific&#xD;
      questions on dealing with endometriosis is used to collect information on the quality of life&#xD;
      and potential risk factors for endometriosis. The questionnaire includes basic&#xD;
      socio-demographic data, life style parameters, a general as well as gynaeco-obstetric history&#xD;
      including detailed questions on the diagnosis, treatment and current symptoms of&#xD;
      endometriosis. In addition questionnaires on pain (modified version of the Brief Pain&#xD;
      Inventory (BPI), Pain Disability Index (PDI), resources (SOC), stress perception (PSQ20),&#xD;
      professional development, satisfaction with medical support, adverse childhood experiences&#xD;
      (modified version of the childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ), daily life, partnership&#xD;
      (Partnerschaftsfragebogen, PFB), sexuality (modified version of the Brief Index of Sexual&#xD;
      Functioning and Global sexual functioning) and anxiety/depression (PHQ, GAD) have to be&#xD;
      completed by study participants. Socio-demographic questions, questions on partnership as&#xD;
      well as on the estimated impact of endometriosis on partnership /sexuality were also given to&#xD;
      study participants' partners. In addition to the current quality of life potential risk&#xD;
      factors for the development of endometriosis e.g. traumatic childhood experiences are&#xD;
      evaluated as well as satisfaction with medical support are evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All diagnosis of endometriosis and classification of ASRM disease stages are based on woman's&#xD;
      medical charts.&#xD;
