      Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness on tissue response of the new nutritional supplement made&#xD;
      of Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins (OPCs) in induced gingivitis after 21 days of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: A double-blind randomized controlled prospective clinical trial was&#xD;
      carried out on 20 patients divided into an experimental group treated with the OPCs pill and&#xD;
      a control group treated with placebo, after fulfilling the selection criteria. Patients had&#xD;
      to come 4 times during the study to register the Silness and Loe and Gingival Bleeding index,&#xD;
      plaque index, inflammatory crevicular fluid study (IL6) and changes in brightness of the&#xD;
      gingiva. No complementary hygiene methods were allowed during the 21 days.&#xD;

      Material and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of 21 days of duration was&#xD;
      conducted among 20 volunteer students of Dentistry of the University of Sevilla. No previous&#xD;
      studies have been found in the literature, so 20 subjects were determined for the pilot study&#xD;
      to test our hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Sevilla. Prior&#xD;
      to participation, the purpose and procedures were fully explained to all patients and all&#xD;
      participants gave written informed consent in accordance with Helsinki declaration. The study&#xD;
      was designed, conducted, analysed and reported according to guidelines for Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice. The study was approved by the Clinical Trials.gov Protocol Registration and Results&#xD;
      System with the number XXXXYY. The protocol can be accessed if necessary in&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was carried out between September 2013 until January 2104. The recruitment started&#xD;
      on September and the Baseline date took place on October 2013. After the 21 days follow-up,&#xD;
      data was treated obtaining the results on January 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the pre-screening visit the Medical and Dental histories were taken and the screening was&#xD;
      carried out base don the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were: subjects&#xD;
      older than 18 years, male or female, good general health, a minimum of 20 teeth (teeth that&#xD;
      have gross caries, were crowned or extensively restored, orthodontic banded, abutments, or&#xD;
      third molars were not included in the tooth count), signed informed consent before study&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were as follows: Periodontal disease, defined as 4 mm and / or positive&#xD;
      bleeding on probing; Pregnant or breastfeeding; Subjects with fixed or removable prosthesis;&#xD;
      Tumor pathology in oral cavity; Use of antibiotics during 2 months period prior to the start&#xD;
      of the trial; Hypersensitivity to red fruits in general; Xerostomia; Active Smoker;&#xD;
      Contagious-infectious pathologies; Pathology with severe systemic repercussions; Any other&#xD;
      judgment of the investigator if he believes endangers or risk to the subject participant;&#xD;
      Subjects with phenylketonuria or allergy to aspartame; Use of any oral hygiene product for&#xD;
      the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single examiner determined assessment of patient eligibility for the study and enrolment of&#xD;
      patients into trial. Patients eligible for the study were individually randomly assigned to&#xD;
      Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins Nutritional Supplement treatment or Placebo groups by an&#xD;
      informatics programme by LACER S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was double-blind. The examiner and the patient did not know into which group were&#xD;
      assigned. Results were treated by another examiner who knows which patients belonged to the&#xD;
      experimental or placebo group. The masking process was established by a number assignation to&#xD;
      each patient in the study, the treatment was externally the same to the patient and examiner&#xD;
      to not allowed knowing to which group belonged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients had to take the experimental or placebo treatment each night after dinner and after&#xD;
      rinse with water. The pill was maintained in the mouth until complete dissolution. Drink or&#xD;
      eat was not allowed during 30 minutes after taking the treatment. The experimental treatment&#xD;
      consisted on 90mg exocian cran 408 (equivalent to 36 mg OPC) and 120 mg of Vitamin C, while&#xD;
      the placebo group was composed of the same organoleptic substance but free of active&#xD;
      ingredients. Both were similar in appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline stage of the trial a tartar removal was carried out in each patient and&#xD;
      enough medication for the entire study plus a patient diary and instructions for its correct&#xD;
      fulfilment were given. Inflammatory crevicular fluid (IL6) and the brightness of the gingiva&#xD;
      were registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two evaluation visits were performance on the day 14 and 21 after the baseline for an oral&#xD;
      clinical examination and to register the Silness and Löe Index, the Gingival Bleeding index,&#xD;
      the Turesky plaque index, inflammatory crevicular fluid study (IL6) and changes in brightness&#xD;
      of the gingiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silness and Löe index&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six teeth were examined according to Ramfjord criteria (16-21-24-36-41-44 ). Four surfaces of&#xD;
      each tooth were examined, making a total of 24 measurements taken. These measurements were&#xD;
      performance with a periodontal probe by the same examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival Bleeding index&#xD;
&#xD;
      A periodontal probe was used to make this index. The values established for the examination&#xD;
      are found below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 - Absence of inflammation. 1 - Mild inflammation, slight change in colour and no gingival&#xD;
      edema. No bleeding on probing. 2 - Moderate inflammation, redness, edema and gingival&#xD;
      hypertrophy. Bleeds to probe (after 10 seconds). 3 - Severe inflammation, marked redness and&#xD;
      hypertrophy. There may be ulcerations. Tends to spontaneous bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Turesky Plaque Index&#xD;
&#xD;
      The buccal surfaces of anterior teeth were examined using a mouthwash of basic fuchsine as&#xD;
      developing agent plaque and a numerical scoring system from O to 5 was established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0: There is no plaque 1: Independent streaks of plaque in the cervical margin of the tooth.&#xD;
      2: thin continuous band of plaque (up to 1mm) at the cervical margin. 3: Band greater than&#xD;
      one millimetre wide, but covers less than one third of the crown. 4: The plate covers third&#xD;
      but not more than two thirds of the crown. 5: The plate covers two thirds or more of the&#xD;
      crown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory crevicular fluid study (IL6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crevicular fluid samples were collected from interdental areas (lingual, buccal, mesial, and&#xD;
      distal) of six teeth distributed by the four quadrants (16, 21, 24, 36, 41 and 44) by 5&#xD;
      strips of pressed paper 2cm long, especially for crevicular fluid. The impregnation time for&#xD;
      each patient was 5 seconds and immediately inserted into 0.5ml Eppendorf microtubes with 50ul&#xD;
      saline at 4 ° C for preservation. The sample transport to the biological laboratory was in a&#xD;
      refrigerator, being stored frozen at -80°C at the laboratory until being processed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the investigator sproceeded to analyse the concentration (pg/ml) of interleukins 6&#xD;
      present in each sample using panels 96 well bioplex brand Luminex®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brightness of the Gingiva&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brightness of the gingiva was taken to identify possible changes in the gingival colour.&#xD;
      The reddening of the gingiva accompanies the inflammation of the tissue, which is a factor&#xD;
      that may help to differentiate inflammatory changes at this level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The luminosity of the gingiva was registered with Micro SpectroShadeTM MHT Optic Research AG.&#xD;
      This instrument is designed for taking dental colour. However, besides including colour&#xD;
      guides, the SpectroShadeTM has the ability to measure the brightness of any colour, not just&#xD;
      shades of white. The change in the colour of the gingiva was observed within the same patient&#xD;
      measuring the reference colour for each patient in the same point in each evaluation visit&#xD;
      and being able to compare the change in the coloration of the same point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Data Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of the data was performed using the SPSS statistical program. A similar&#xD;
      database to Notebook Data Collection was created. For each variable a minimum and maximum&#xD;
      range and the name of the variable and its values defined. The data are presented as the mean&#xD;
      ± standard deviation of the measurements, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-square test was performed to qualitative variable, T-student to the quantitative&#xD;
      variable, after the Kolmogorov Smirnov to assure the normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by The Ethical Committee, and all examinations and treatments were&#xD;
      performed with the consent of the subjects and according to the guidelines Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki.&#xD;
