  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measurement of the cardiac output is one of the important hemodynamic monitoring tools in&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. It helps determine the type of medications needed to maintain optimal&#xD;
      hemodynamic status in the entire perioperative period. Thermodilution method using pulmonary&#xD;
      artery catheter is considered has the gold standard for the measurement of cardiac output.&#xD;
      Investigators would like to compare the most popular minimally-invasive devices used to&#xD;
      measure cardiac output using arterial waveform: LiDCO Rapid and TEE with the thermodilution&#xD;
      method at various phases of the cardiac surgery.&#xD;

      Measurement of the cardiac output is one of the important hemodynamic monitoring tools in&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. It helps determine the type of medications needed to maintain optimal&#xD;
      hemodynamic status in the entire perioperative period. Thermodilution method using pulmonary&#xD;
      artery catheter is considered has the gold standard for the measurement of cardiac output,&#xD;
      however over the past 10 to 15 years it has been questioned about its safety and efficacy.&#xD;
      There has been a surge in recent years of less invasive devices capable of measuring cardiac&#xD;
      output by various means, including bioimpedance, transpulmonary thermodilution, transthoracic&#xD;
      and transesophageal echocardiography, and arterial waveform analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a variety of devices currently available for cardiac output measurement by&#xD;
      arterial-waveform analysis. These devices have been compared to each other, and to the&#xD;
      pulmonary artery catheter as the gold standard. However, the companies manufacturing these&#xD;
      devices have made software upgrades that they believe improves their performance. No studies&#xD;
      have been performed comparing the uncalibrated arterial waveform based cardiac output&#xD;
      measurement device,LiDCORapid since the software upgrades. In addition to baseline cardiac&#xD;
      output measurements, Investigators intend to study the effect of volume loading (by&#xD;
      trendelenburg position), sympathetic stimulus (incision), a vasodilated state (15 minutes&#xD;
      after separation from CPB) and chest closure on cardiac output measured by the three&#xD;
      different techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to cardiac output the investigators would like to measure stroke volume ,Systemic&#xD;
      Vascular Resistance, stroke volume variation with LiDCO . The main purpose is to validate the&#xD;
      accuracy of measurements by these two minimally-invasive methods in comparison with&#xD;
      thermodilution method in various hemodynamic states.&#xD;
