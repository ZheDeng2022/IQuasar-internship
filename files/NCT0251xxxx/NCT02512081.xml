      This will be an exploratory study, using semi-structured interviews to explore patients'&#xD;
      experiences of undergoing investigations for Sciatica (leg pain referred from the lower&#xD;
      back). Interviews will be analysed based on an Interpretative Phenomenological Approach&#xD;
      (IPA).The end product of analysis will be a detailed account of patients' experiences&#xD;
      supported by direct quotes.The intention is that this account will help health-care providers&#xD;
      to understand patients' experiences and to plan and provide Sciatica care that is effective,&#xD;
      evidence based and acceptable to patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sciatica (leg pain referred from the lower back) is a common problem that causes significant&#xD;
      pain and disability. Many patients experience lasting symptoms that do not respond to pain&#xD;
      relief or physiotherapy. This group of patients are commonly managed by Spinal Specialists&#xD;
      who help determine the best treatment approach and consider if investigations are required.&#xD;
      In the United Kingdom (UK), clinical guidelines suggest that imaging for Sciatica is only&#xD;
      appropriate for patients who are considered likely to need surgery or when the cause is&#xD;
      suspected to be serious such as cancer or infection. Patients who do not meet the criteria&#xD;
      for investigations express frustration when clinical tests and opinion alone are used to&#xD;
      diagnose and treat Sciatica. Some patients are unable to accept that investigations are not&#xD;
      required and loose confidence in treatment. If Sciatica is to be managed effectively, the&#xD;
      treatment offered must be acceptable to and successfully negotiated with patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little research is currently available regarding patients' expectations or experiences of&#xD;
      undergoing investigations for Sciatica. The aim of this study is to explore the experience of&#xD;
      patients who have undergone investigations for Sciatica, to gain an understanding of how&#xD;
      patients experience investigations as part of their overall management of Sciatica.This study&#xD;
      specifically explores the experiences of patients whose Sciatica is likely to be caused by&#xD;
      nerve root involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be exploratory, based on an Interpretative Phenomenological Approach (IPA).&#xD;
      Up to 15 patients who have undergone investigations for Sciatica will be interviewed using a&#xD;
      semi-structured format. Patients will be recruited from one National Health Service (NHS)&#xD;
      Trust on the South Coast of England. Interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim&#xD;
      and analysed thematically, based on an IPA approach. The end product of analysis will be a&#xD;
      detailed account of patient's experience of investigations, supported by direct quotes. The&#xD;
      intention is that this account will help health-care providers to understand patients'&#xD;
      experiences and to plan and provide Sciatica care that is effective, evidence based and&#xD;
      acceptable to patients.&#xD;
