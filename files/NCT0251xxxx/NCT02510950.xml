  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early clinical development paradigm for chemotherapeutic agents has significantly&#xD;
      influenced the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines. However, there are major&#xD;
      differences between these two classes of therapeutics that have important implications for&#xD;
      early clinical development. Specifically, the phase 1 concept of dose escalation to find a&#xD;
      maximum-tolerated dose does not apply to most therapeutic cancer vaccines. Most therapeutic&#xD;
      cancer vaccines are associated with minimal toxicity at a range that is feasible to&#xD;
      manufacture or administer, and there is little reason to believe that the maximum-tolerated&#xD;
      dose is the most effective dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent article from the biostatistics literature, Simon et al. write that &quot;the initial&#xD;
      clinical trial of many new vaccines will not be a toxicity or dose-ranging trial but rather&#xD;
      will involve administration of a fixed dose of vaccine … in most cases the dose selected will&#xD;
      be based on preclinical findings or practical considerations. Using several dose levels in&#xD;
      the initial study to find the minimal active dose or to characterize the dose-activity&#xD;
      relationship is generally not realistic&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with these recommendations, the general philosophy of the phase 1 clinical trial&#xD;
      is to facilitate a prompt preliminary evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy. The proposed clinical trial will test a&#xD;
      fixed dose of vaccine. There is considerable experience with the synthetic long peptide&#xD;
      vaccine platform. The synthetic long peptide vaccine platform has an excellent safety&#xD;
      profile, and the optimal dose appears to be based on practical considerations (solubility of&#xD;
      the peptide). The dose to be tested in the proposed clinical trial is consistent with other&#xD;
      similar cancer vaccine trials that have been recently completed or are currently ongoing. The&#xD;
      sample size (n=10) will provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the vaccine.&#xD;
