  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of injecting ones own&#xD;
      Schwann cells to augment sural nerve autografts after a severe, non-lacerating injury to the&#xD;
      sciatic nerve has occurred.&#xD;

      The secondary purpose of this research project is to evaluate whether transplanted Schwann&#xD;
      cells can enhance recovery of sensory and motor function. Emergency expanded access for a&#xD;
      single patient was granted, as the patient was an ideal candidate for sural nerve repair&#xD;
      augmented by autologous Schwann cells which could be harvested from a relatively small&#xD;
      segment of sensory nerve. The cells were expanded using cell culture techniques and placed&#xD;
      along with the sural nerve grafts wrapped by an FDA approved collagen matrix (Duragen). This&#xD;
      study is being conducted at the Jackson Memorial and the University of Miami health systems.&#xD;
      As a research subject the patient will be in this study for a total of 5 years from the date&#xD;
      receiving Schwann cell transplant augmentation of sural nerve autografts.&#xD;
