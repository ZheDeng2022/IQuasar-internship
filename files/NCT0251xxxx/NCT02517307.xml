  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about what causes insulin resistance. It has been&#xD;
      suggested that proper breakdown of fat into energy (oxidation) in the body is important to&#xD;
      allow insulin to keep blood sugar in the normal range. The investigators want to know if&#xD;
      having one of the fatty acid oxidation disorders could have an influence on insulin action.&#xD;
      Fatty acid oxidation disorders are genetic disorders that inhibit one of the enzymes that&#xD;
      converts fat into energy. The investigators will study both normal healthy people and people&#xD;
      with a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the effects of disordered mitochondrial&#xD;
      fatty acid oxidation on insulin resistance in humans. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been&#xD;
      implicated in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes during excess dietary&#xD;
      fat intake and from increased release of endogenous free fatty acids , such as occurs in&#xD;
      obesity. Controversy exists, however, as to whether this insulin resistance results from&#xD;
      intrinsic defects in mitochondrial energy utilization or from abnormalities resulting from&#xD;
      excess free fatty acid flux, as well as the role that subsequent accumulation of cellular&#xD;
      metabolic intermediates play in impaired insulin signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these controversies, the investigators will study a unique population of patients&#xD;
      with inherited defects in each of the three mitochondrial enzymes in the fatty acid oxidation&#xD;
      pathway: 1) very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD); 2) trifunctional protein (TFP,&#xD;
      which includes long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD)); and 3) medium-chain&#xD;
      acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). These proteins are required for the oxidation of sequentially&#xD;
      shorter fatty acids . The investigators will test the hypothesis that intrinsic defects in&#xD;
      mitochondrial function involving oxidation of long-chain, but not medium-chain, fatty acids&#xD;
      are sufficient to prevent intralipid-induced insulin resistance.&#xD;
