    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics of paracetamol, amoxicillin and&#xD;
      talinolol in morbid adipose subjects before as well as shortly after and about one year after&#xD;
      proximal Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and to measure messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)&#xD;
      expression and protein content of duodenal and/or jejunal drug metabolizing enzymes (eg.&#xD;
      cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase (UGTs)) and&#xD;
      drug transport proteins (e.g. P-glycoprotein, MRP2, OATPB, PEPT) before and during the&#xD;
      operation and about one year after proximal RYGB.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intestinal drug absorption appears to be a very complex process characterized by&#xD;
      gastrointestinal transit, disintegration of dosage forms, drug dissolution within the&#xD;
      intestinal lumen, active and passive uptake processes, mucosal metabolism (e.g. by cytochrome&#xD;
      P450 (CYP), UGT, sulfotransferase (SULT) enzymes) and efflux transport by several adenosine&#xD;
      triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) transporters as P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance&#xD;
      associated protein (MRP) 2 or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Along the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, the upper small intestine (i.e. duodenum, proximal jejunum)&#xD;
      represents the main site for absorption of nutrients and drugs offering an appropriately&#xD;
      large absorption area of nearly 200 m². Within this bowel segment, there is a high expression&#xD;
      of several physiological relevant uptake carriers for nutrients as carbohydrates (e.g.&#xD;
      GLUTs), fatty acids (MCTs, FATs), peptides (PEPTs), sterols (NPC1L1) and bile acids (ASBT)&#xD;
      which are exclusively located in the small intestine. Furthermore, it is now well established&#xD;
      that there is a high intestinal expression of phase I &amp; II metabolizing enzymes as well as&#xD;
      drug efflux transporters being responsible for the high first-pass metabolism of many&#xD;
      compounds like cyclosporine, nifedipine, midazolam or statins. Apparently, there is a&#xD;
      distinct expression gradient along the small intestine (e.g. decreasing levels of P-gp and&#xD;
      CYP3A4 but increasing for MRP2). On the other side, the colon features only negligible&#xD;
      amounts of enzymes and active uptake and elimination carriers. Therefore, the extent of drug&#xD;
      absorption from the bowel is mainly dependent on the intestinal site of drug liberation and,&#xD;
      thus, dependent on the administered dosage form, the physicochemical properties of the drug&#xD;
      and the individual physiological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the fact, that under physiological circumstances there is only a low expression of&#xD;
      P-gp in the upper parts of the gut (i.e. duodenum and jejunum), a functional &quot;absorption&#xD;
      window&quot; is created which enables the preferable absorption of drugs in these proximal region&#xD;
      of the small intestine. This is also supported by the markedly higher surface area of the&#xD;
      upper small intestine compared to distal segments. It was shown that cyclosporine and&#xD;
      talinolol were increasingly less absorbed when delivered into deeper regions of the human&#xD;
      intestine. Since both compounds are well established P-gp substrates, this site-dependent&#xD;
      absorption phenomenon seems to be caused by the decreasing expression levels of intestinal&#xD;
      P-gp counteracting drug uptake into enterocytes. Additionally, it was reported that the&#xD;
      effective permeability of atenolol, metoprolol, cimetidine and furosemide was markedly lower&#xD;
      in the ileum compared to the jejunum in healthy subjects. These data verified that drug&#xD;
      absorption in the lower intestine is less effective than in upper parts which seems to be of&#xD;
      outstanding relevance for compounds with predominately duodenal and jejunal absorption (fast&#xD;
      release dosage form) and P-gp substrates as ß-lactam antibiotics, furosemide, cyclosporine,&#xD;
      talinolol and digoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, in subjects after massive dissection of the proximal small intestine or after&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, absence of this main intestinal absorption area leads to&#xD;
      malabsorption of nutrients (e.g. protein, fat soluble vitamins, minerals and trace elements&#xD;
      as iron) and is expected to affect the oral bioavailability of drugs with &quot;absorption window&quot;&#xD;
      in the proximal small intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, by which the stomach, the duodenum and parts of the jejunum&#xD;
      are dislocated from the continuous intestinal passage of the chyme, is the surgical gold&#xD;
      standard option to treat morbid adipositas. The method was shown to reduce significantly body&#xD;
      weight and obesity-related co-morbidity. Today, this surgical intervention is the most&#xD;
      frequently used bariatric surgery (USA: approximately 150.000/year) and its application is&#xD;
      still increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its widely use and the well documented risk of nutrient deficiencies, only very&#xD;
      little is known about the pharmacokinetic consequences and intestinal adaptation mechanisms&#xD;
      in these patients who are often subjected to multiple drug therapy. It was assumed that the&#xD;
      reduced intestinal surface area and the reduced time to drug disintegration and dissolution&#xD;
      caused by accelerated intestinal transit in these patients are associated with lowered&#xD;
      intestinal drug absorption. Additionally, this could be affected by the reduced production of&#xD;
      gastric hydrochloric acid by lowering the solubility in case of alkaline drugs. However, it&#xD;
      is possible that compensatory processes by other bowel segments could improve drug absorption&#xD;
      which could mean that drugs are still adequately absorbed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From patients with resection of lower intestinal segments (i.e. distal jejunum, ileum, colon)&#xD;
      in consequence of Crohn´s disease or ulcerative colitis, the so-called small bowel syndrome,&#xD;
      it is known that the pharmacokinetics of drugs as digoxin, cyclosporine, cimetidine and&#xD;
      levothyroxine is markedly influenced in form of distinctly reduced intestinal absorption.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it was assessed that time-dependent adaptation processes occur in these patients&#xD;
      to compensate for the lost of function of the dissected tissue. Therefore, the dependency on&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition is decreasing or even full intestinal autonomy will occur. The variety&#xD;
      of changes is complex and dependent on the status of the underlying disease, the existing&#xD;
      surface area and its functional integrity. These complex adaptation processes are caused by&#xD;
      many growth factors, cytokines and hormones (e.g. peptide tyrosine tyrosine (YY), insulin&#xD;
      like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), glucagon-like peptide (GLP-2), NT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most data on adaptive processes in the gastrointestinal tract after dissection of intestinal&#xD;
      segments are obtained in animal experiments. These data, however, are not predictive for the&#xD;
      situation in man. With regard to the situation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, there&#xD;
      is no information on how drugs are absorbed after bypassing the stomach, duodenum and parts&#xD;
      of the jejunum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, pharmacokinetics of three probe drugs (talinolol, paracetamol and amoxicillin) and&#xD;
      intestinal expression of intestinal drug metabolizing enzymes (eg. CYP3A4, UGTs) and drug&#xD;
      transport proteins (eg. P-gp, MRP2, OATPB, PEPT) before, shortly after (7 days) and one year&#xD;
      after the gastric and intestinal bypass surgery in patients with morbid adipositas will be&#xD;
      measured. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) was chosen because it is rapidly and completely&#xD;
      absorbed from all parts of the gut. Appearance in blood describes the site of drug&#xD;
      dissolution within the intestine. Talinolol represents a well established P-gp substrate&#xD;
      which absorption is limited by this multidrug transporting protein. Finally, amoxicillin acts&#xD;
      as a probe drug for active uptake which is mediated by the peptide transporter PEPT which is&#xD;
      predominately expressed in the small intestine and responsible for active H+-coupled uptake&#xD;
      of ß-lactam antibiotics and ACE inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that bioavailability of talinolol and amoxicillin will be significantly&#xD;
      decreased after the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery compared to the situation before&#xD;
      surgery. One year after the surgical intervention, adaptation processes in expression of drug&#xD;
      metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters are expected which at least in part compensate for&#xD;
      the decrease in bioavailability of the probe drugs.&#xD;
