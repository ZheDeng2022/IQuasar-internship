  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the Stimwave Spinal Cord&#xD;
      Stimulator (SCS) System for treatment of chronic pain&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective study in which subjects will receive a Freedom SCS System&#xD;
      and to receive stimulation at a frequency between 5 Hz to 1500 Hz . Enrollment will continue&#xD;
      until 49 subjects have been implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have chronic back or back and leg pain refractory to standard medical treatment&#xD;
      associated with Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS). Subjects will be followed for a 6-month&#xD;
      period after a maximum one-month trial period. At the end of 6 months follow-up, all subjects&#xD;
      will assess the outcomes of their appointed therapy and continue with long-term use of the&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulators will be placed at the following sites to target the painful area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Epidural Space midline covering vertebrae levels T8 through T11 (one stimulator placed at&#xD;
      the top of T8 and the second stimulator placed at the middle of T9). Paresthesia mapping will&#xD;
      be utilised to determine the optimal location for stimulation of the painful area.&#xD;
