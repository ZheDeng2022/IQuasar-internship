    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to investigate whether low energy shockwave therapy (LE-SWT) can&#xD;
      preserve kidney function in diabetic patients. Participants in this study will receive LE-SWT&#xD;
      treatment 6 times over 3 weeks. The treatment is non-invasive and has no known side effects.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that LE-SWT induces angiogenesis. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that chromium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) renal clearance remains stable or&#xD;
      increases in treated patients. Furthermore, kidney biopsy should show no signs of damage to&#xD;
      the tissue and possibly neo-vascularization. In this project, the investigators shall also&#xD;
      investigate LE-SWT effect on urinary markers of tubular damage and urinary nitric oxide&#xD;
      indices. Patients' self-reported quality of life will be assessed using Short Form 36 version&#xD;
      2 (SF-36v2) Health Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an 18-months follow-up on patients. Only patients between 18-65 years old with&#xD;
      moderate chronic kidney failure from diabetes will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is an interventional prospective study. 30 patients with moderate kidney failure&#xD;
      will be recruited from the Department of Endocrinology, Odense University Hospital, Denmark.&#xD;
      LE-SWT treatment will be performed in the ambulatory of Department of Urology. Patients will&#xD;
      be hospitalized for 1 day in the Department of Nephrology when kidney biopsy is taken (two&#xD;
      times in study period).&#xD;

      1.0 Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Definitions of chronic kidney disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) of the National Kidney Foundation&#xD;
      (NKF) defines chronic kidney disease as either kidney damage or a decreased glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 for 3 or more months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whatever the underlying etiology, the destruction of renal mass with irreversible sclerosis&#xD;
      and loss of nephrons leads to a progressive decline in GFR. The different stages of chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease form a continuum in time. In 2002, K/DOQI published its classification of the&#xD;
      stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Kidney damage with normal or increased GFR (&gt;90 mL/min/1.73 m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Mild reduction in GFR (60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: Moderate reduction in GFR (30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 4: Severe reduction in GFR (15-29 mL/min/1.73 m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 5: Kidney failure (GFR&lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Epidemiology&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a rising incidence and prevalence of kidney failure with poor outcomes and high&#xD;
      costs. The Third National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES III) estimated that the&#xD;
      prevalence of chronic kidney disease in adults in the United States was 11% (19.2 million).&#xD;
      The prevalence of chronic kidney disease stages 1-4 increased from 10% in 1988-1994 to 13.1%&#xD;
      in 1999-2004. This increase is partially explained by the increase in the prevalence of&#xD;
      diabetes and hypertension, the two most common causes of chronic kidney disease. Data from&#xD;
      the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) show that the prevalence of chronic renal failure&#xD;
      increased 104% between the years 1990-2001 and incidence rates have risen 30 % between 1992&#xD;
      and 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic nephropathy is one of the most devastating complications of diabetes. It remains the&#xD;
      leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD), accounting for 44% of ESRD incident cases in&#xD;
      the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Etiology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The single most important factor responsible for the increasing incidence of CKD is diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. Renal affection includes albuminuria, hypertension and a decline in kidney&#xD;
      function. Blood pressure control, which is difficult to achieve in diabetics, is mandatory&#xD;
      for long term prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Prognosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with chronic kidney disease might progress to ESRD. The rate of the progression&#xD;
      depends on the underlying diagnosis, on the successful implementation of secondary preventive&#xD;
      measures and on the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every age, patients with ESRD on dialysis have significantly increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality when compared with non-dialysis patients and individuals without kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical care of patients with chronic kidney disease usually focus on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delaying or halting the progression of chronic kidney disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treating the pathologic manifestations of chronic kidney disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no treatments are available to reverse the effects of CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that Low Energy Shockwave Treatment improves or&#xD;
      stabilizes renal function in diabetic patients - thereby potentially reducing patients'&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that Low Energy Shockwave Therapy (LE-SWT) performed on&#xD;
      diabetic patients' kidneys with the MODULITH SLX-F2 lithotripter:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increases glomerular function measured by chromium-EDTA clearance at 3, 6, and 18 months&#xD;
           post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stimulates Nitric Oxide (NO) release measured as increased levels of NO metabolites,&#xD;
           nitrate and nitrite, and cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP) in patients' spot urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does not cause increased urinary levels of markers for tubular and glomerular damage,&#xD;
           i.e. Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) and albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Induces angiogenesis and prevents fibrosis in kidney tissue as shown by kidney biopsy&#xD;
           histology. Furthermore, LE-SWT protects from destruction of the glomerular basal lamina&#xD;
           as revealed on electron microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Improves self-reported quality of life measured by using the Short Form 36 version 2&#xD;
           (SF-36v2) health survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Causes no clinical side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators test the hypothesis in an interventional study where 30 diabetic patients&#xD;
      with moderate chronic kidney failure are to be treated with 6 sessions of LE-SWT on kidneys&#xD;
      over 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 LE-SWT treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lithotripter: Treatment is carried out using the MODULITH SLX-F2 with B+W or Colour Doppler&#xD;
      Ultrasound System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient lies on supine position during treatment, no need for analgesia as the energy&#xD;
      level of the treatment is very low. Kidney will be localised in line ultrasound (no x-ray&#xD;
      exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3000 shocks at a frequency of 4 Hz are applied to each kidney, per session. The kidney will&#xD;
      be divided into three treatment areas including 1000 shock waves applied to each treatment&#xD;
      area. Patients will receive 2 sessions per week for 3 weeks. Shock wave therapy takes&#xD;
      approximately 15 minutes for each kidney. Total treatment time per session is approximately&#xD;
      40 minutes (including 10 minutes for preparation and ultrasound localisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do not expect there will be any significant ethical problems with this&#xD;
      study. Treatment with extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) for kidney stones, using 10&#xD;
      times the energy, has been used for more than 25 years worldwide. No kidney damage has been&#xD;
      reported after these treatments except for a hematoma if the patient was given anticoagulant&#xD;
      treatment. Participants will be closely monitored clinically including blood and urine tests.&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be measured after each treatment and at the specified time schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies are planned, including chromium-EDTA clearance measurement, renography, and a kidney&#xD;
      biopsy. The renal biopsy is done at the Department of Nephrology, Odense University Hospital,&#xD;
      and will be performed after the department's approved instructions and, besides the risk of&#xD;
      bleeding, is not associated with any greater risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chromium-EDTA clearance is associated with a minor radiation dose. The injected tracer&#xD;
      contains a small amount of radioactivity, which results in a radiation dose equivalent to the&#xD;
      absorption of a standard X-ray of the lungs. According to the Health Board regulation&#xD;
      directives, this corresponds to 0.1 mSv, or what is equal to 1/10 of background radiation.&#xD;
      The background radiation is the radiation dose man receives annually from the environment&#xD;
      (for example space, earth, air, drinking water and food).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renography is also associated with a minor radiation dose. Radioactive dose is 0.7&#xD;
      millisievert (mSv). Load is decreased when radioactive agent is excreted in urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have no immediate benefits of participation apart from a possible improvement of&#xD;
      their renal function. Patients are informed both orally and in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 Informed consent and patient rights&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before inclusion into the project, the patient should provide written consent to participate&#xD;
      in this clinical project after he/she has been informed both orally and in writing in a&#xD;
      comprehensive way on the experimental important details, risks and drawbacks. The patient is&#xD;
      also given the patient information and a copy of the signed consent form and an individual&#xD;
      schedule for the project. Potential participants are recommended to have a third party&#xD;
      present during the information process. They are advised that they are entitled to&#xD;
      consideration before a final decision is taken and that the consent at any time can be&#xD;
      withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient must consent in writing. The given written and oral information and the patient's&#xD;
      consent are confirmed by the principal investigator Sune Møller Jeppesen and patient&#xD;
      single-handed dated signatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator shall not undertake any study specifically required only for this clinical&#xD;
      project before obtaining valid informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' names will be kept secret. Patients will be identified for assessment and&#xD;
      documentation of the patient number allocated to them at the start. Patients are informed of&#xD;
      confidentiality and patient rights through participation information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The signed informed consent forms remain with the investigator. The investigator is required&#xD;
      to have these forms inspect on request. The investigator will keep a list containing the&#xD;
      patients' numbers and names so that their records - if desired - could be provided at a later&#xD;
      date. Both consent forms and the list of patient numbers must be kept for 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 Perspectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perspective of this study is to show that LE-SWT is a harmless treatment for CKD that&#xD;
      will improve the degree of nephropathy. LE-SWT is a non-invasive and non-painful treatment&#xD;
      and procedure is easy to perform. Currently, no treatment is available to reverse the effects&#xD;
      of diabetic CKD and only long-term medical intervention may halt progression of the disease.&#xD;
      Considering morbidity and mortality of affected diabetic patients and health care costs of&#xD;
      CKD, there is a demand to explore new therapies for CKD. Given the simplicity of LE-SWT, the&#xD;
      investigators believe there is a potential that treatment could be cost effective even for&#xD;
      modest results although such analysis is beyond the scope of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.0 Publication policy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this project are intended published in international and national medical&#xD;
      journals. Principal investigator Sune Møller Jeppesen will be first author and Professor Lars&#xD;
      Lund last author on the articles. Other participants will rank according to international&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
