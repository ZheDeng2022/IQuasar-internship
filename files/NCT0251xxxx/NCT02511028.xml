      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Contrast agents help things show up better on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if the drug ferumoxytol is a good contrast agent. They want to&#xD;
      determine that it does not cause prolonged MRI changes in the brain and to see if it helps&#xD;
      identify inflammation in multiple sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn how ferumoxytol can be used to image inflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults ages 18 70 who have MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers ages 18 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 5 clinic visits over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, neurological exam, and blood draw.&#xD;
           Full clinical measures will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a 7 tesla brain MRI scan that may include gadolinium contrast&#xD;
           agent. The MRI is a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field. The participant will lie&#xD;
           on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During visit 2, ferumoxytol with be given through a catheter (a thin plastic tube) that&#xD;
           is inserted with a needle into a vessel in the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Participants will then have a 7 tesla MRI scan of the brain..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each of the next 3 clinic visits, participants will have a 7 tesla brain MRI and have&#xD;
           blood drawn. The MRIs may include gadolinium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a full neurologic exam at these visits. At the final visit, full&#xD;
           clinical measures will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have more MRI scans if a 6-month MRI shows ferumoxytol still in the&#xD;
           brain.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this pilot study are to (1) demonstrate the safety of ferumoxytol, a United&#xD;
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug used in the treatment of iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia, as a contrast agent for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as&#xD;
      determined by a lack of long-term signal change in healthy volunteers (HV) and people with&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (MS); (2) determine if ferumoxytol enhancement can be detected in MS&#xD;
      lesions on 7-tesla (T) MRI; and (3) examine the spatial and temporal enhancement patterns of&#xD;
      ferumoxytol compared to patterns seen with gradient-echo imaging and gadolinium contrast in&#xD;
      MS lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 10 HVs and up to 10 participants with MS will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a series of brain MRIs on a 7 T scanner. MRI will be before&#xD;
      (baseline) and 0-8 hours, 24-96 hours, 1 month, and 6 months following ferumoxytol&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is change in gradient-echo T2-weighted signal (derived from an MR&#xD;
      sequence sensitive to paramagnetic agents such as iron) in the globus pallidus, a known brain&#xD;
      iron reservoir, 6 months following ferumoxytol administration. Thus, we will determine if&#xD;
      ferumoxytol induces long-lasting brain signal intensity changes in HV and MS. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures are: (1) the number, location, and qualitative morphology of ferumoxytol,&#xD;
      gradient-echo phase, and gadolinium-enhanced MS lesions and how these lesions change over&#xD;
      time; and (2) quantitative estimates of change in iron concentration by determining R2 (=&#xD;
      1/T2) relaxation rate within MS lesions, normal appearing white matter, normal appearing gray&#xD;
      matter, and other iron-rich regions within the brain before and after ferumoxytol injection.&#xD;
