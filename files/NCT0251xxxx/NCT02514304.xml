  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter, two component observational and standardized case-control&#xD;
      study is to evaluate risk factors of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with a prospective&#xD;
      3-month and 12-month follow-up to examine outcomes and their possible causes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antithrombotic therapies are effective for prevention of cardiovascular (CV) events but cause&#xD;
      bleeding. Emerging evidence indicates that extra-cranial bleeding is just as important as&#xD;
      myocardial infarction as a marker of risk for subsequent non-fatal and fatal CV events, but&#xD;
      this issue has not been prospectively studied. If the association between bleeding and CV&#xD;
      events is causal, prevention of bleeding, by targeting the risk factors, and prevention of&#xD;
      the complications of bleeding, by targeting the causal pathways, could substantially reduce&#xD;
      the burden of bleeding-related CV events. Progress in developing these approaches has been&#xD;
      limited by a knowledge gap. Known risk factors do not fully explain bleeding risk and the&#xD;
      investigators do not understand the mechanisms linking bleeding with adverse outcome and&#xD;
      whether the association is causal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-half of bleeds that lead to CV events in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy arise&#xD;
      in the GI tract. INTERBLEED plans to explore risk factors for GI bleeding, and outcomes after&#xD;
      GI bleeding, in this well-circumscribed and important group using a case-control design with&#xD;
      prospective 3 month and 12 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives are to: (1) identify risk factors for GI bleeding and estimate their&#xD;
      population attributable risk; (2) determine the risk of non-fatal and fatal CV events and&#xD;
      functional outcomes after GI bleeding; and (3) explore the possible mechanisms linking GI&#xD;
      bleeding with CV outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERBLEED will recruit 2500 case-control pairs from centres in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil,&#xD;
      China, Ireland and the Netherlands. Data will be collected on patient characteristics,&#xD;
      medical history and, in cases, the work-up, management and outcomes after bleeding. The&#xD;
      INTERBLEED results will help to develop new approaches to reducing the burden of&#xD;
      bleeding-related CV events.&#xD;
