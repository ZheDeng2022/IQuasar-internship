      This is a 2-part, Phase 1 FIH study with Phase 1a designed to determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in subjects with metastatic cancers with a human&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) test result that is in situ hybridization (ISH)&#xD;
      positive (+) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or 2+, and Phase 1b designed to assess&#xD;
      anticancer activity and safety in three expansion cohorts: two different advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer expansion cohorts (namely, for tumors that test as HER2 ISH positive or IHC3+ and for&#xD;
      tumors that test as HER2 ISH negative with IHC 2+), and one advanced gastric cancer expansion&#xD;
      cohort (for tumors that test as HER2 ISH positive or IHC3+).&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Life expectancy &gt;12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. BMI is between 18 to 32 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;

             subject. Subjects whose tumor tissue local laboratory results are HER2 ISH positive or&#xD;
             IHC3+ must have been previously treated with a HER2 targeting therapy (e.g.&#xD;
             trastuzumab, in the country or region where such therapies are available and part of&#xD;
             standard of care), or have failed SOC therapy. Subjects who have been previously&#xD;
             treated with a HER2 targeting therapy such as trastuzumab or ado-trastuzumab emtansine&#xD;
             are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Disease measurability: Phase 1a: measureable or non-measureable disease; Phase 1b:&#xD;
             disease must be measureable (per RECIST v1.1) (subjects with non-measureable disease&#xD;
             are not eligible for Phase 1b).&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Tumor tissue local laboratory HER2 testing results (clinical pathology report) based&#xD;

             ISH HER2 assay. Pre-screening for HER2 is allowed only for subjects with breast and&#xD;
             gastric cancer, where applicable. Subjects with other types of cancer must have&#xD;
             previously tested for HER2 status by HER2 IHC or ISH assay. 1) Phase 1a: ISH positive&#xD;

             ULN in subjects with liver metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Adequate renal function assessed by serum creatinine within reference lab normal&#xD;
             limits and creatinine clearance (by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology [CKD-EPI]&#xD;
             Collaboration equation) ≥60 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Adequate cardiac function as assessed by cardiac troponin I within normal range; left&#xD;
             ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50% or institutional lower limit of normal; cumulative&#xD;
