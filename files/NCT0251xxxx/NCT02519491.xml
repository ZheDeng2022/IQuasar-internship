      Accessing the arteries of the heart through the blood vessels of the wrist is becoming&#xD;
      increasingly popular. By obtaining access via the artery in the arm as opposed to the groin,&#xD;
      there is less risk of complications and improved patient satisfaction. However, using the&#xD;
      wrist can cause blockage of the artery after the procedure. If there is too little blood flow&#xD;
      from a second artery that supplies the hand, this could result in significant injury.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to test these blood vessels in the wrist prior to having this&#xD;
      procedure. The best way to evaluate these arteries involves the use of ultrasounds but this&#xD;
      takes a long time and is expensive. Therefore, the artery is usually evaluated with a&#xD;
      clinical test known as the modified Allen's test, which relies on the doctor watching the&#xD;
      flushing of the hand during compression of the artery. Currently smart phones with cameras&#xD;
      are able to assess blood flow by passing light through the skin and watching differences in&#xD;
      brightness. This may be a better way to assess the arteries in the hand as it is less&#xD;
      subjective than simply watching the flushing of the hand. This study aims to assess the&#xD;
      ability of an iPhone application in determining whether there is sufficient blood flow&#xD;
      through the arteries of the wrist and comparing it to the clinical test commonly used.&#xD;

      Over the past decade, the transradial approach to cardiac catheterization has emerged as the&#xD;
      preferred method of angiography and intervention. There have been several observational and&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials which have shown an association between transradial access and&#xD;
      reduced risk of bleeding and other vascular complications, increased cost-effectiveness,&#xD;
      improved patient satisfaction, and a mortality benefit in high-risk patient populations.&#xD;
      However, this technique does carry risks of complications including radial artery occlusion,&#xD;
      non-occlusive radial artery injury, radial artery spasm, hand ischemia, pseudoaneurysm,&#xD;
      radial artery perforation, nerve damage, arteriovenous fistulisation, and bleeding. Radial&#xD;
      artery occlusion is the most commonly noted complication and the clinical impact is unclear.&#xD;
      In individuals with intact collateral palmar circulation from the ulnar artery, the&#xD;
      individual is usually asymptomatic and do not require further intervention. However, if an&#xD;
      individual lacks adequate collateral circulation, that individual is at risk of hand ischemia&#xD;
      and loss of tissue or function necessitating surgical intervention or, ultimately,&#xD;
      amputation. Thus, it is common practice to assess competency of the collateral palmar&#xD;
      circulation prior to transradial cardiac catheterization to mitigate the risks associated&#xD;
      with this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard for assessment of radial artery patency is colour Doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging of the artery. This gold standard allows for direct, objective assessment of arterial&#xD;
      patency and competency through direct visualization of blood flow. The use of pre-procedural&#xD;
      ultrasound remains both labour and resource intensive and hence is not feasible for practical&#xD;
      use, therefore a physician must rely on clinical assessment of collateral circulation. This&#xD;
      has been traditionally evaluated through use of the modified Allen's test (MAT), a technique&#xD;
      performed at the bedside as part of the pre-procedural physical examination. More recently,&#xD;
      the introduction of plethysmography and pulse oximetry have been utilized to theoretically&#xD;
      provide a more objective measure of assessing collateral circulation, though these too are&#xD;
      limited by the available resources. Given the ever increasing prevalence of smart phones,&#xD;
      this study aims to address the utility and feasibility of an iPhone application in&#xD;
      determining adequacy of collateral palmar circulation. Should this iPhone application provide&#xD;
      superior diagnostic accuracy, it could quickly become an alternative method of providing an&#xD;
      objective measure of collateral palmar circulation rather than relying on the subjective MAT.&#xD;

    <description>The Modified Allen's Test (MAT) will be performed in a well-lit room on both of the participant's hands. This technique will involve compression of both the radial and ulnar arteries by the investigator to assess patency of the contralateral artery. The participant will then be asked to clench and open their hand several times. The participant will then be asked to maintain their hand in an open position. The investigator will then release the compression over the ulnar artery and observe for palmar blush. The length of time to achieve maximal palmar blush will be recorded. This technique will then be repeated by maintaining compression over the ulnar artery and releasing of the compression over the radial artery.</description>
