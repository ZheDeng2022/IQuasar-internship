      Protocol title: Effect of acute alcohol consumption on the activity of major cytochrome P450&#xD;
      enzymes, NAT2 and P-glycoprotein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The study is mainly conducted to evaluate the effect of acute alcohol consumption&#xD;
      on the activity of the most important drug metabolising cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2,&#xD;
      CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, intestinal CYP3A4, hepatic CYP3A4, NAT2 and on the activity of the&#xD;
      drug transporter p-glycoprotein (intestinal and renal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study should also provide basis for a planned clinical study on interactions caused by&#xD;
      chronic alcohol intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Single center, open-label, two-way, cross-over study with randomly allocated&#xD;
      sequences Test-Reference or Reference-Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is not a clinical drug study according to the German Drug Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical phase: Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers: 16 healthy male and female subjects are planned for completion in accordance with&#xD;
      the protocol, i.e. with evaluable/analysable data for all periods and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical centre: Department of Pharmacology, Clinical Pharmacology Unit (KPH), University of&#xD;
