  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to compare three articulation options in terms of osteolysis, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, clinical and radiographic outcomes (Oxford Hip score (OHS) and Harris Hip score&#xD;
      (HHS) and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the purpose of the study is also to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      patients who received G7 Acetabular system in conjunction with Echo BiMetric stem in primary&#xD;
      total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;

      DESIGN: Prospective 3 Arm Randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE:To compare three commonly used contemporary bearings in Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA).&#xD;
      In addition, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the G7 Cups and Echo BiMetric Stem&#xD;
      in THA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Osteolysis, clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      intraoperative/surgical data, implant positioning, survivor ship, and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION: 360 hips (240 will have CT scan for analysis of osteolysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY: Patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION: All patients will be followed at 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 year postoperatively.&#xD;
      Assuming the enrollment will be completed 18 months. The total study duration will be 11.5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY GROUPS/TREATMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - G7 Metal-on-Polyethylene (MoP) (Arcom XL) + Echo BiMetric Group 2 - G7&#xD;
      Metal-on-Polyethylene (MoP) (E1) + Echo BiMetric Group 3 - G7 Ceramic-on-Ceramic (CoC) + Echo&#xD;
      BiMetric The study's primary efficacy endpoint will include the difference in osteolytic&#xD;
      volume at 5 years postoperatively measured by Computertomografi (CT) scan.&#xD;
