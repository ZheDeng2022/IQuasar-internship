      This is a study of ARQ-761 (beta-lapachone) with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced (metastatic, unresectable, or recurrent) pancreatic cancer that has&#xD;
      not been treated with gemcitabine.&#xD;

      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information (age, gender, race, ethnic origin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam and review of your past and present medical history including any&#xD;
           surgeries a and/or infections;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs (temperature, pulse, respirations, blood pressure); height, weight;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concurrent medications (medications whether prescribed or over-the counter that you have&#xD;
           taken or are currently taking);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance Status (how well you are able to perform daily activities)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of any side effects that you may have experienced or may be experiencing before&#xD;
           receiving the study drug and medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be collected for routine lab tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy Test (if you are a woman of child-bearing potential)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiologic evaluation (review of any CT scans you may have had)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A CT scan (chest/abdomen/pelvis) is a special test that produces an image of your body&#xD;
           using a. small amount of radiation. The image shows the body tissues and structures in&#xD;
           three dimensions (3-D).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG), a tracing of the electrical activity of the heart;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen saturation (measures how much oxygen the blood is carrying)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy for correlative studies - if archived tumor specimen cannot be obtained, you will&#xD;
           need to undergo a fresh biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of a Quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit may last approximately 1-2 hours. Visits that included radiologic evaluation may&#xD;
      last longer, approximately 2-3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 2 week lead-in monotherapy of ARQ-761 - they will receive the current dose of ARQ761&#xD;
           alone&#xD;
&#xD;
           o The amount of ARQ-761 that will be given to you will depend on the time at which you&#xD;
           are enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Afterwards the 28-day cycle of combination treatment of ARQ-761 along with gemcitabine&#xD;
           (1000 mg/m2) + nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) will begin&#xD;
&#xD;
