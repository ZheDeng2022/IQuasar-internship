    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving romidepsin before and after a&#xD;
      stem cell transplant in combination with fludarabine and busulfan can help to control&#xD;
      leukemia or lymphoma. Researchers also want to learn the highest tolerable dose of romidepsin&#xD;
      that can be given with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of this combination and the safety of giving romidepsin after a stem cell&#xD;
      transplant will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Romidepsin is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of CTCL in patients who have received at least 1 systemic (affecting the whole&#xD;
      body) therapy before. Busulfan and fludarabine are FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      for use with a stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the combination of romidepsin, busulfan, and fludarabine to treat the type of&#xD;
      leukemia or lymphoma you have is considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Parts and Study Drug Dose Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will start Part 1 of the&#xD;
      study. During Part 1, you will receive the study drugs before having a stem cell transplant.&#xD;
      If the disease is well controlled after the transplant and you are still eligible, you will&#xD;
      start Part 2. During Part 2, you will continue to receive romidepsin. The study treatments&#xD;
      given in each part are described in more detail below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of romidepsin you receive will depend on when you join this study. The first group&#xD;
      of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of romidepsin is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of fludarabine. Busulfan dose levels are&#xD;
      explained below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration and Transplant (Part 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The days before you receive the stem cell transplant are called minus days. The day you&#xD;
      receive the stem cell transplant is called Day 0. The days after you receive the stem cell&#xD;
      transplant are called plus days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days -13 and -12, you will receive busulfan by vein over 3 hours. Blood (about 1 teaspoon&#xD;
      each time) will then be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing up to 11 times over the 11&#xD;
      hours after the first busulfan dose. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body&#xD;
      at different time points. The study staff will tell you more about the PK testing schedule.&#xD;
      The test results will help the doctor decide what dose of busulfan you will receive during&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A heparin lock line will be placed in your vein before the PK testing to lower the number of&#xD;
      needle sticks needed for these draws. If for any reason it is not possible for the PK tests&#xD;
      to be performed, you will receive the standard dose of busulfan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -7, you will be admitted to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -6 through -3, you will receive romidepsin by vein over 4 hours, fludarabine by vein&#xD;
      over 1 hour, and then busulfan by vein over 3 hours. PK testing up to 11 times over 11 hours&#xD;
      will also be performed on Day -6 if the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are going to be receiving a transplant from a matched unrelated donor, you will also&#xD;
      receive antithymocyte globulin (ATG) by vein over 4 hours on the 3 days before the&#xD;
      transplant. This drug is designed to further weaken your immune system to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      rejecting of the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning on Day -2, you will receive tacrolimus by vein over 24 hours every day until you&#xD;
      are able to take it by mouth. Tacrolimus is designed to weaken the immune system and lower&#xD;
      the risk of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD - a reaction of the donor's immune cells against&#xD;
      your body). Once you are able to take tacrolimus by mouth, you will take it every day for&#xD;
      about 3 months, or until the doctor thinks it is safe to stop taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0, you will receive the donor's stem cells by vein. The infusion will last anywhere&#xD;
      from about 30 minutes to several hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days +1, +3, +6, and +11, you will receive methotrexate by vein over about 15 minutes.&#xD;
      Methotrexate is also designed to weaken the immune system and lower the risk of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will be given other standard drugs to help lower the&#xD;
      risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for more information about how the drugs&#xD;
      are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Romidepsin Maintenance Therapy (Part 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting between Day +28 and Day +100, if you are eligible for Part 2 based on the disease&#xD;
      status, you will continue to receive romidepsin by vein over 1 hour once or twice a month.&#xD;
      You may receive the doses at MD Anderson or at an oncologist's office close to where you&#xD;
      live. The study doctor will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a baseline test at the beginning of the study (within 7 days before starting romidepsin),&#xD;
      blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for comparison purposes to learn if and how&#xD;
      romidepsin may affect the disease and your immune system. If a bone marrow aspirate will be&#xD;
      performed at this time, additional bone marrow aspirate will be collected for testing to see&#xD;
      how romidepsin may have affected the disease and your immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain in the hospital for as long as the doctor thinks is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever your doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 tablespoons) and/or urine will be&#xD;
      collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About Â½-1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 8 tablespoons) will be drawn to see how well the transplant has taken and&#xD;
           to learn if and how romidepsin may have affected the disease and your immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or other&#xD;
           site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a&#xD;
           large needle. Additional bone marrow aspirate will be collected for testing to see how&#xD;
           romidepsin may have affected the disease and your immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above tests/procedures may be performed sooner, if your doctor thinks they are needed.&#xD;
      You may also have additional tests if your doctor thinks they are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before your first dose of romidepsin in Parts 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to learn if and how romidepsin may have&#xD;
           affected the disease and your immune system. Part of this blood sample will be used for&#xD;
           a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Part 2, every 2 weeks (before each dose of romidepsin), blood (about 4&#xD;
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Part of this blood sample will be used for a&#xD;
      pregnancy test if you can become pregnant. This may be repeated more often, if your doctor&#xD;
      thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Part 2, once a month:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 participants may have the blood tests done before each romidepsin dose and monthly&#xD;
      EKGs and physical exams performed either at MD Anderson or your local oncologist's office. If&#xD;
      they are performed locally, the results should be sent to the study staff. You will need to&#xD;
      return to MD Anderson to have tests and procedures performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after the&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 4 doses of romidepsin in Part 1. You may also receive chemotherapy on&#xD;
      certain days between Day -13 and Day -3, and the stem cell transplant on Day 0. In Part 2,&#xD;
      you may receive up to 24 cycles of romidepsin maintenance therapy as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits. After 1 year, you&#xD;
      will have routine follow-up with your transplant doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be taken off study early if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, if the&#xD;
      disease gets worse or comes back, if intolerable side effects occur, if you have graft&#xD;
      failure (the transplanted cells do not grow), or if you are unable to follow study&#xD;
      directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If for any reason you want to leave the study early, you must talk to the study doctor. It&#xD;
      may be life-threatening to leave the study after you have started to receive the study drugs&#xD;
      but before you receive the stem cell transplant because your blood cell counts will be&#xD;
      dangerously low.&#xD;
