      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Malaria is a severe infection caused by a parasite. People can get malaria if a mosquito&#xD;
      that carries the parasite bites them. Although malaria does not occur in the United States,&#xD;
      many people in Africa, Asia, and South America do get malaria. In some cases, malaria can&#xD;
      cause death. In 2013 alone, 584,000 people died due to malaria. Researchers want to find ways&#xD;
      to prevent and treat malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To find out if combining live, infectious malaria parasites (known as Sanaria PfSPZ&#xD;
      Challenge) and two FDA approved drugs that kill malaria parasites (pyrimethamine [PYR] and&#xD;
      chloroquine [CQ]) is safe and can provide people protection against malaria. The Sanaria&#xD;
      PfSPZ Challenge has been used in other studies without significant side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy people ages 18-50 who weigh less than 170 pounds and are not pregnant or&#xD;
           breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No history of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not currently enrolled in a clinical trial that involves a research drug or vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have not traveled to an area with high malaria transmission within the last 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Never diagnosed with malaria in the past&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be in 1 of 4 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a combination of injections and drugs. What combination they&#xD;
           will receive will depend on what group they are in. This combination of injections and&#xD;
           drugs may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Injections of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge (live, infectious malaria parasites) into a&#xD;
                vein&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FDA approved antimalarial drug called chloroquine (CQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FDA approved antimalarial drug called pyrimethamine (PYR)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FDA approved antimalarial drug called Malarone&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The study will last approximately 3-7 months (depending on which group participants&#xD;
                are in).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be up to 68 study visits for three groups. One group will have up to 27 study&#xD;
           visits. During the study visits, participants may have:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history review&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Electrocardiogram (ECG): soft electrodes will be placed on the skin. A machine will&#xD;
                record the heart s electrical signals to evaluate heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medication given in the clinic under direct observation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Injection of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge into a vein&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will receive a diary, thermometer, and ruler to record their body&#xD;
                temperature and any symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human studies have shown that immunization by the bite PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes under drug&#xD;
      coverage with chloroquine, an approach called chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites (CPS),&#xD;
      infection treatment vaccination (ITV), or chemoprophylaxis vaccination (CVac) can provide&#xD;
      high level, long term protection against homologous controlled human malaria infection&#xD;
      (CHMI). The Sanaria PfSPZ-CVac approach duplicates this with an injectable sporozoite (SPZ)&#xD;
      regimen (aseptic, purified, cryopreserved SPZ). In both approaches, whether mosquitoes or a&#xD;
      syringe are used for SPZ administration, when chloroquine is used as the chemoprophylactic&#xD;
      agent, transient, limited, asexual erythrocytic stage (AES) parasitemia develops. However,&#xD;
      exposure to liver stage parasites only, without having any parasites completing liver stage&#xD;
      development and entering the blood, thereby reducing the potential to induce blood stage&#xD;
      immunity, likewise has been shown in animal studies to induce protective immunity upon&#xD;
      subsequent challenge with homologous parasites, indicating that the transient parasitemia is&#xD;
      not integral to inducing protection. To achieve this requires a different partner drug&#xD;
      regimen that includes activity against liver stage parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our approach, using PfSPZ-CVac with pyrimethamine (PYR), will assess this in humans. This&#xD;
      phase 1 study will investigate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and protective&#xD;
      efficacy following liver stage only parasite exposure of direct venous inoculation (DVI) with&#xD;
      aseptic, purified, cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites (Sanaria PfSPZ&#xD;
      Challenge), under chloroquine and pyrimethamine chemoprophylaxis, to induce stage specific&#xD;
      sterile protection. By adding pyrimethamine chemoprophylaxis to chloroquine, liver stages&#xD;
      will develop but should be killed before merozoites are released into the blood stream. The&#xD;
      subjects will thus be exposed only to liver stage parasites (qPCR and blood smear negative).&#xD;
      With this strategy, we will determine if protective immunity can develop without exposure to&#xD;
      AES parasites and additionally whether it will minimize clinical symptoms associated with&#xD;
      blood stage exposure. The timing of the pyrimethamine dose is critical to ensure the efficacy&#xD;
      of pyrimethamine as causal prophylaxis, yet still allow for maximal antigenic exposure of&#xD;
      liver-stage parasites to the host. An additional potential benefit of preventing AES&#xD;
      parasitemia is the elimination of the immunosuppression associated with AES parasitemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be the first step in establishing a new regimen for the PfSPZ-CVac approach,&#xD;
      exposure to liver stage parasites without subsequent blood stage parasites, assessing&#xD;
      protection against homologous CHMI. In future trials, the two-drug regimen can be assessed&#xD;
      for protection against heterologous Pf infection and longevity of protection. The results of&#xD;
      the study will contribute to understanding the targets and mechanisms of immunity against Pf&#xD;
      malaria infection.&#xD;

    <description>Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge are aseptic, cryopreserved P.falciparum sporozoites used for CHMI trials, produced by the biotechnology company; Sanaria Inc. In brief, manufacture includes the production, under traditional environmental conditions, of eggs from a colony of A. stephensi mosquitoes housed in a controlled environmental chamber. The sporozoites are purified, counted, and, at a specified concentration, cryopreserved. Cryopreservation commences with the addition of cryoprotective additives to the purified sporozoites to produce the Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge product. Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge is dispensed into screw-cap vials containing 15,000, 50,000, or 100,000 PfSPZ in a 20 L aliquot. Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge is stored in liquid nitrogen vapour phase at 140 (Infinite)C to -196 (Infinite)C.</description>
