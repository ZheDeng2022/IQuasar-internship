  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation protocol to determine the feasibility of co-administration of&#xD;
      RRx-001 and nivolumab. Immune surveillance is an endogenous mechanism to cause remission of&#xD;
      neoplastic growth. Epigenetic agents like RRx-001 are associated not only with enhanced gene&#xD;
      transcription and restored expression of silenced genes but also with increased expression of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory mediators, upregulation of PD-L1 on tumor cells and de-repression of&#xD;
      antigens that promote immune recognition of tumors. It is hypothesized that RRx-001, will&#xD;
      prime or sensitize to immune checkpoint therapy targeting PD-1 interaction with nivolumab.&#xD;

      This is an open-label dose escalation study, consisting of the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1) Screening Period (Up to 16 days): Eligibility for the study will be determined by&#xD;
           Screening tests, physical examination/medical history, and fulfillment of eligibility&#xD;
           criteria. Potential participants are required to provide written informed consent prior&#xD;
           to the performance of any study specific Screening procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2) Treatment Period (Day 1 to 57): Between 15 and 45 eligible male and female adult&#xD;
           subjects will receive weekly RRx-001 for a total of nine doses and every other week&#xD;
           nivolumab for a total of 5 doses (odd cycles) or 4 doses (even cycles). Study medication&#xD;
           (RRx-001 and nivolumab) will be administered intravenously at the study center. The&#xD;
           Treatment Period will end following the last dose of nivolumab. Subjects will attend the&#xD;
           study center weekly for on-study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3) Follow-up Period: Subjects that have completed nivolumab dosing will undergo a&#xD;
           follow-up assessment monthly, up to 100 days, for the emergence of delayed toxicity with&#xD;
           particular attention to delayed immune related toxicities.&#xD;
