    <textblock>
      Given the advances in Atrial Fibrillation (AF) management and the availability of new&#xD;
      European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, there is a need for the systematic&#xD;
      collection of contemporary data regarding the management and treatment of AF in the member&#xD;
      ESC countries. It is now nearly 10 years since the last European registry of AF management&#xD;
      was undertaken (as part of the ESC Euro Heart Survey programme), and a new registry was&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;

      Given the advances in Atrial Fibrillation (AF) management and the availability of new&#xD;
      European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, there is a need for the systematic&#xD;
      collection of contemporary data regarding the management and treatment of AF in the member&#xD;
      ESC countries. It is now nearly 10 years since the last European registry of AF management&#xD;
      was undertaken (as part of the ESC Euro Heart Survey programme), and a new registry was&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New guidelines on the management of AF have recently been published by the ESC, but it&#xD;
      remains unclear how often clinicians adhere to them. Since the last Euro Heart survey, a&#xD;
      change in management strategy has necessitated an update on prevalent management practices in&#xD;
      AF. This is influenced by clinical availability of catheter ablation as a routine procedure&#xD;
      and new antiarrhythmic drugs, and also by developments in stroke thromboprophylaxis and&#xD;
      medical therapy options. Under the EURObservational Research Programme (EORP), an AF ablation&#xD;
      sentinel pilot registry was launched in 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survey of AF management under the EORP programme will enable a timely assessment of the&#xD;
      uptake of the new ESC guidelines, allow monitoring of implementation and uptake of catheter&#xD;
      ablation, new antithrombotic drugs and new antiarrhythmic agents, and will inform about&#xD;
      outcomes related to guideline-adherent management of AF.&#xD;

             made.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The qualifying episode of AF should have occurred within one year before the date of&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AF is the primary or secondary diagnosis, i.e. the current admission / visit may be&#xD;
             due to other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients need not be in AF at the time of enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed Patient Inform Consent if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No ECG/Holter with AF recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only atrial flutter recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The qualifying episode of AF occurred more than one year before the date of baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are already included in the ESC Atrial Fibrillation Long-Term registry if&#xD;
