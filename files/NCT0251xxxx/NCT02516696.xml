    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, phase III study to investigate the efficacy of combination&#xD;
      therapy with an induction phase utilizing a combination clarithromycin (Biaxin®),&#xD;
      lenalidomide (Revlimid®), dexamethasone (Decadron®), in multiple myeloma patients who are&#xD;
      newly diagnosed and require treatment when compared to patients who receive lenalidomide and&#xD;
      dexamethasone alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research study is for men and women with newly diagnosed, previously untreated multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. The purpose of this study is to observe the how well the different combinations of&#xD;
      study drugs work as therapy for patients with newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible,&#xD;
      previously untreated multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be done in two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BiRd Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clarithromycin 500mg PO twice daily on days 1-28 for a 28-day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide 25mg PO daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone 40mg PO will be given on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rd Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide 25mg PO daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone 40mg PO will be given on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated in 28-day cycles and may continue treatment as long as they are&#xD;
      responding to therapy and not experiencing unacceptable side effects or disease progression.&#xD;
      There will be an evaluation at the end of each cycle. Participants will be in the study until&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
