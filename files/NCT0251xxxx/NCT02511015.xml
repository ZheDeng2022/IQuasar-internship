      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Parkinson s disease is a disease of the nervous system that affects movement. People&#xD;
      usually get it in their 70s or 80s. Early onset Parkinson s disease (EOPD) begins before the&#xD;
      age of 50. Researchers think EOPD may be caused by a mutation in a gene. They want to study&#xD;
      the genetic causes so they can find therapies for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand the genetic causes of EOPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults ages 18 80 with a history of EOPD. Their family members, who do not have&#xD;
           Parkinson s disease, can join as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers ages 18 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with EOPD and their relatives will be screened with a review of medical&#xD;
           records. Healthy volunteers will have medical history, physical exam, and blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relatives may send blood samples to NIH to test for mutations in genes that are linked&#xD;
           to Parkinson s disease. They may have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be asked to return to clinic for another visit that can last up to 2&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During this visit, participants will have blood taken from a vein in the arm via a&#xD;
           needle stick.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may give a sample of their skin. The skin on the arm or leg will be numbed&#xD;
           and a small skin punch biopsy will be taken with a special needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some cells from the blood or skin sample may be grown in a lab to establish cell lines.&#xD;
           The cells may also potentially be genetically modified to make stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers may perform genetic analysis on the samples to compare them to EOPD patient&#xD;
           samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of subjects with the degenerative Parkinson's Disease (PD) present in the 7th&#xD;
      and 8th decades of life. In contrast, this neurologic disease can present within the first 5&#xD;
      decades of life. This early onset presentation is more likely to have a direct genetic cause&#xD;
      relative to the etiology of the degenerative form of the disease. Our understanding of the&#xD;
      genetic causes of early onset Parkinson's Disease (EOPD) may help us find therapies for both&#xD;
      the genetic and degenerative illnesses. Data from our laboratory and others show that genetic&#xD;
      mutations associated with EOPD, disrupt cellular stress-response programs. These&#xD;
      perturbations, in turn, impair cell-repair process, which is hypothesized to increase&#xD;
      susceptibility to dopaminergic neuron degeneration linked to EOPD and degenerative PD. At the&#xD;
      same time, patients with EOPD have a variable age of onset (spanning from 8 years to 41 years&#xD;
      in the subjects in our cohort) and disease penetrance (severity of symptoms). The hypothesis&#xD;
      we propose to test is whether the number and allele distributions of EOPD susceptibility gene&#xD;
      mutations account for the variable age of onset and disease penetrance. This hypothesis will&#xD;
      be tested in this natural history protocol by genotyping subjects with EOPD to define their&#xD;
      genetic defects and to explore the cellular reparative function in these individuals using&#xD;
      peripheral blood cells, skin biopsy derived fibroblasts and induced pluripotential stems&#xD;
      cells derived from these subjects. In parallel, the phenotype of these subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the NINDS Parkinson's Clinic. Together, these data should advance our insight&#xD;
      into the genotype-phenotype in EOPD pathophysiology.&#xD;

        Subjects that develop symptoms of Parkinson Disease within the first 5 decades of life&#xD;
        would be enrolled onto this protocol. Additionally, subjects previously enrolled on&#xD;
        protocol 12-H-0084 may also be enrolled on this protocol. Age (+/- 5 yrs) and gender&#xD;
        matched healthy volunteers will be recruited as controls for this protocol. Controls will&#xD;
        be recruited via web advertisements. An email advertisement will also be sent out via the&#xD;
        NIH LISTSERV to aid in the recruitment of healthy volunteers. A list of healthy volunteers&#xD;
        may also be requested from the NIH Office of Patient Recruitment. Family member controls&#xD;
        without clinical evidence of Parkinsonism may be recruited as controls for index research&#xD;
        subjects.&#xD;
