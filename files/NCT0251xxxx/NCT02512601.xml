    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate whether, in a standardised cohort of patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate PTS, monitored for a sufficiently long follow-up period, quality of life measured by&#xD;
      generic instruments and disease-specific instruments evolves favourably in this patient&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective: to evaluate the evolution of quality of life in general and in the specific&#xD;
      context of the disease of patients who have experienced an episode of deep-vein thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT), are affected by post-thrombotic syndrome, are subject to compression therapy and&#xD;
      receive an additional standard venoactive agent (sulodexide 15 mg twice daily during 6&#xD;
      months).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic venous insufficiency, or chronic venous disease (CVD), after prior deep-vein&#xD;
      thrombosis (DVT), is diagnosed as post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). It has been calculated that&#xD;
      PTS occurs in between 20% and 50% of patients after an episode of DVT, even after having&#xD;
      received optimal anticoagulant treatment, and this disorder usually consolidates in the first&#xD;
      2 years after the acute thrombotic episode. The presentation of PTS varies from mild symptoms&#xD;
      or clinical signs to severe presentations in approximately 10% of cases, including chronic&#xD;
      pain in the limbs that limits activity and ability to work, untreatable oedema and ulcers in&#xD;
      the legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cornerstone of the treatment of consolidated PTS is compression treatment, especially in&#xD;
      the form of elastic compression stockings, and frequent elevation of the leg, despite the low&#xD;
      level of evidence, but these measures require the strictest possible therapeutic compliance&#xD;
      on the part of the patient. There is still little evidence that &quot;venoactive&quot; agents are&#xD;
      effective in PTS symptoms; nevertheless, the use of medications in PTS is very widespread. In&#xD;
      a study by González- Fajardo et al., the use of compression stockings is described in 75% of&#xD;
      patients and, in a study by Lozano -Sánchez et al., their use is described in 62% of&#xD;
      patients. In the latter study, venoactive drugs were used in approximately 90% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis, staging, prognosis and evolution of the severity of the various entities&#xD;
      grouped together under the heading of CVD, including PTS, are based mainly on scales and&#xD;
      scoring systems. Objective evaluation of CVD severity tends to be based on the &quot;clinical,&#xD;
      etiologic, anatomic and pathophysiologic&quot; (CEAP) clinical classification, the Venous Clinical&#xD;
      Severity Score (VCSS) and the Villalta score. Nevertheless, at the present time it is&#xD;
      recognised that the assessment of severity does not necessarily coincide with the perception&#xD;
      that patients themselves have of their quality of life, which is estimated with generic&#xD;
      questionnaires (such as the abbreviated 36-item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire Short&#xD;
      Form (SF-36) and disease-specific questionnaires (such as the Venous Insufficiency&#xD;
      Epidemiological and Economic Study questionnaire (VEINES-QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies used some of these scales, usually more than one. All the studies agree that&#xD;
      patients with PTS have a lower QoL than those without PTS, and this is shown by both generic&#xD;
      and specific instruments. Nonetheless, the population examined in the studies was extremely&#xD;
      heterogeneous with respect to use of compression treatment, use of drugs and duration of&#xD;
      observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem that remains to be solved is whether the therapeutic measures applied lead to a&#xD;
      change in the QoL measured by generic and disease-specific instruments over a relatively long&#xD;
      treatment period. Achieving favourable changes in patients' perception of quality of life&#xD;
      remains fundamental for therapeutic compliance and for a suitable physician-patient&#xD;
      relationship in the treatment of any chronic disease, and therefore in PTS. This matter can&#xD;
      be properly examined, first, in a cohort of patients that is as standardised as possible with&#xD;
      respect to the stage and seriousness of the disease and the use of compression treatment and&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standardisation of the stage and seriousness of the disease, as well as the means of&#xD;
      standardising the compression treatment, can be achieved with appropriate inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. As pharmacological treatment is generally administered, sulodexide was&#xD;
      chosen for purposes of standardisation. This is a venoactive treatment with antithrombotic,&#xD;
      profibrinolytic and endothelium-protective activity, already being used in PTS patients with&#xD;
      favourable results. The guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery, the American Venous&#xD;
      Forum and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) include it among the recommended&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments, along with compression, for patients with manifest chronic venous&#xD;
      disease. Standardisation of the determination of QoL is envisaged using the generic&#xD;
      questionnaire SF-36 and the disease-specific questionnaire VEINES-QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, this study aims to evaluate whether, in a standardised cohort of patients with&#xD;
      mild to moderate PTS, monitored for a sufficiently long follow-up period, quality of life&#xD;
      measured by generic instruments and disease-specific instruments evolves favourably in this&#xD;
      patient profile. If this is the case, a different approach to the treatment of the disease&#xD;
      will be necessary.&#xD;
