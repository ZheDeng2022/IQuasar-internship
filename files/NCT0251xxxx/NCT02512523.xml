    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, active control, parallel group, exploratory phase 4 study&#xD;
      to compare the effect of teneligliptin versus sitagliptin on glucose variability when added&#xD;
      on to metformin in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients with in adequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus who&#xD;
      have been on metformin (1,000 mg or above) for 8 weeks at least or longer and randomly add&#xD;
      teneliglipin (20 mg/day) or sitagliptin (100 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring will be checked before and after 4-week administration of teneliglipin or&#xD;
      sitagliptin together with mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Other efficacy and safety&#xD;
      parameters will be also assessed.&#xD;
