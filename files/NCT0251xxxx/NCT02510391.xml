    <textblock>
      This nonrandomized pilot study is investigating the efficacy of a modularized treatment for&#xD;
      anxiety in children ages 3-7 years old. Eligibility is determined at a baseline assessment,&#xD;
      followed by a second baseline assessment one month later. The treatment protocol,&#xD;
      Parent-training Intervention for Preschoolers with Anxiety (PIPA), is flexible and allows for&#xD;
      individualized treatments based on a treatment algorithm, ensuring that sessions address the&#xD;
      most pressing clinical needs of each child. Treatment consists of weekly 60-minute sessions&#xD;
      delivered over the course of 12 weeks. Symptom change is tracked weekly during brief phone&#xD;
      assessments and a post-treatment assessment will occur following the final treatment session,&#xD;
      approximately 12 weeks after starting treatment. Finally, all participants will complete two&#xD;
      follow-up assessments, occurring 1-month and 6-months after the final treatment session.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early childhood mental illness is a growing public health concern, and can persist into&#xD;
      adolescence and adulthood if left untreated. Anxiety disorders are among the most common&#xD;
      psychiatric illnesses in preschool aged youth and place youth at significantly higher risk&#xD;
      for anxiety, depression, substance abuse, conduct problems, and diminished&#xD;
      academic/occupational and social/relational functioning later in life. Accordingly, there is&#xD;
      increasing emphasis on early identification and intervention, before symptoms become&#xD;
      entrenched to mitigate a trajectory towards longstanding impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, empirically supported treatments for preschoolers with anxiety are limited.&#xD;
      The few studies to date have tended to focus on relatively homogeneous samples whose symptoms&#xD;
      resemble those in adults (e.g., worries and fears). Anxiety can present in similar ways to&#xD;
      adult anxiety, however can also present more broadly in young children. Young children with&#xD;
      anxiety may also present with extreme rigidity, sensory hypersensitivity,&#xD;
      'meltdowns'/emotional dysregulation/temper tantrums, ritualistic/routine oriented behavior,&#xD;
      and oppositional behavior in some context. By focusing narrowly, treatments have not been&#xD;
      adapted for the full range of anxiety presentations in early childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the proposed study evaluates a modular, parent-driven psychotherapy developed for&#xD;
      preschool aged youth (3-7 years) with diagnostic levels of anxiety, as well as anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms dimensionally. The treatment program, Parent-training Intervention for Preschoolers&#xD;
      with Anxiety (PIPA), is based on empirically supported behavioral and parent-training&#xD;
      principles as well as the investigators' recently published pilot study of preschoolers with&#xD;
      obsessive compulsive disorder. Sixty youth will be treated during the study. PIPA focuses on&#xD;
      exposure and response prevention therapy (E/RP) in the context of behavioral parent training,&#xD;
      each of which have efficacy in youth with anxiety, including high functioning autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorders (ASD). Certain parenting responses (e.g., overprotection, critical responding,&#xD;
      accommodation of anxiety symptoms and avoidance) have been implicated in the etiology and&#xD;
      maintenance of pediatric anxiety disorders and, in addition to E/RP, this intervention will&#xD;
      target behavioral parent training and unhelpful parenting practices to support long-term&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this study will investigate one surrogate biomarker of anxiety in young&#xD;
      children, fear conditioning (or more specifically, resistance to extinction). Behavioral&#xD;
      treatment of anxiety, including the proposed PIPA intervention, relies on principles of&#xD;
      extinction. Children and adults with anxiety disorders have been shown to have poorer fear&#xD;
      extinction; however, there are few studies in young children examining this phenomenon. The&#xD;
      potential to understand fear extinction in young children has implications for improving&#xD;
      treatment efficacy and altering the negative trajectory of youth with anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility will be determined at a baseline assessment. A second baseline assessment will&#xD;
      occur one month later for those that qualify. This assessment will be used to control for&#xD;
      symptom change due to the natural passage of time. Treatment will be delivered over 12 weeks&#xD;
      and will include weekly 60-minute sessions. A brief phone call with an assessor each week&#xD;
      will be used to track symptom change during treatment, and a post-treatment assessment will&#xD;
      be conducted following the final treatment session, approximately 12 weeks later. Follow-up&#xD;
      assessments will occur 1-month and 6-months following the final treatment session.&#xD;

    <description>Parent-training Intervention for Preschoolers with Anxiety (PIPA) is a behaviorally based modular treatment program for emotional and behavioral problems in young children. 12 sixty minute sessions will be delivered weekly. This intervention employs a modular format following a treatment algorithm in which therapy modules are selected by the therapist and supervisor on a session-by-session basis to address the most pressing clinical needs. Minimum session requirements for parent training/education and fear hierarchy/exposure are set to insure adequate dose of core exposure and response prevention for anxiety across cases.</description>
