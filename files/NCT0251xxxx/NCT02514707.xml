      1. INTRODUCTION: 1.1. Disease Setting/Patient Population: Advances in HIV antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) have dramatically reduced mortality from HIV, primarily because of the&#xD;
      reduction in deaths attributable to AIDS defining conditions such that a person receiving&#xD;
      state-of-the-art ART may now expect to live 25 years and potentially longer. However the&#xD;
      number of deaths attributable to causes not conventionally considered to be HIV related is&#xD;
      increasing with up to 50% of all patients with HIV die from causes considered unrelated to&#xD;
      HIV. Thus, management of HIV now involves the treatment of chronic diseases with the&#xD;
      possibility of near normal life expectancy, but often with multiple co morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Background and Rationale: Cardiovascular risk in patients on ART Metabolic&#xD;
      complications, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and altered fat distribution (loss&#xD;
      of subcutaneous fat and a relative increase in central fat), are common in adults infected&#xD;
      with HIV who are receiving ART. These complications may increase these patients' risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Recent studies suggest that some types of ART may be associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease, a cause for concern given that people living with&#xD;
      HIV may take ART for decades. The mechanisms causing an increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease are unclear, but it has been suggested that it may relate to dyslipidemia, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, diabetes mellitus, inflammation, impaired fibrinolysis, factors specific to&#xD;
      antiretroviral medications, or combinations of these factors. Grinspoon and Carr further&#xD;
      speculate that both HIV and ART might be associated with many of these risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From observational data the evidence linking ART and cardiovascular disease has pointed&#xD;
      specifically to PIs as a class since they may promote the formation of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      lesions, and other NRTI specific agents (abacavir, didanosine). However up to date the role&#xD;
      of abacavir remain controversial. All potential cardiovascular risk factors, including&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, weight, and&#xD;
      family history, should be assessed. Ideally glucose levels and fasting lipid levels should be&#xD;
      checked annually in all HIV patients on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal disease The use of combination, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) since the&#xD;
      mid-1990s has resulted in significant and sustained reductions in morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      from HIV infection, including significant declines in HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). At&#xD;
      the same time, however, a variety of ART-related renal side effects have been noted,&#xD;
      including proteinuria and renal tubular damage, interstitial nephritis, nephrolithiasis, and&#xD;
      overall declines in glomerular filtration rate. Kidney function has been estimated to be&#xD;
      abnormal in up to 30% of HIV-infected patients. In addition, other metabolic complications&#xD;
      such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension may also contribute to renal dysfunction over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Sub- Saharan Africa, including Uganda, tenofovir has been included as one of the&#xD;
      recommended drugs for first line regimens, due to its comparable efficacy to other first-line&#xD;
      regimens containing stavudine, zidovudine or abacavir, and has the additional advantage of&#xD;
      low toxicity and availability as a once-daily, fixed-dose generic formulation. Yet concerns&#xD;
      regarding its renal tubular toxicity remain especially on its use in resource-limited&#xD;
      settings where clinical detection of renal impairment is difficult in. Early stages of renal&#xD;
      dysfunction can be are assessed through laboratory monitoring of creatinine and glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate. Current guidelines contraindicate TDF use when creatinine clearance (CrCl)&#xD;
      falls below 50 ml/min unless dose reductions are made. If TDF is to be implemented in&#xD;
      resource-limited settings where numbers requiring antiretroviral therapy are high but access&#xD;
      to laboratory services are scarce, these monitoring protocols may need to be further&#xD;
      simplified. Ideally in order to monitor patients for renal toxicity, It is recommended that&#xD;
      urinalysis for proteinuria is performed routinely and creatinine clearance calculated; co&#xD;
      morbidities that may contribute to elevated risk of kidney disease should be also closely&#xD;
      monitored. Data from the DART trial, a prospective randomized clinical trial conducted in an&#xD;
      African setting, showed a low (1.3%) rate of severe renal impairment through 96 weeks, with&#xD;
      no difference in TDF-containing and non TDF-containing regimens. Similarly data from a&#xD;
      routine program setting (Lesotho) shows that renal toxicity due to tenofovir is rare and&#xD;
      mild.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late mortality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter cohort study from Europe and North America reported that already after 4 years&#xD;
      on ART the cumulative incidence of non-AIDS-related deaths exceeded that of AIDS-related&#xD;
      deaths. The most frequent non-AIDS causes of death were non-AIDS malignancy (11.8%), non-AIDS&#xD;
      infection (8.2%), cardiovascular disease (7.9%, of which 40% were myocardial&#xD;
      infarction/ischemic heart disease and 18% stroke), violence (7.8%, including suicide,&#xD;
      substance abuse, and homicide/accident/unspecified), and liver disease (7.1%, of which 55.8%&#xD;
      were hepatitis related). The most frequent sites for non-AIDS malignancies were respiratory&#xD;
      tract or intrathoracic organs (36.7%); digestive organs and peritoneum (28.7%); lip, oral&#xD;
      cavity, and pharynx (6.0%); and skin (4.7%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little information is available on patients on ART for a long term period from Sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa. Particularly no information is available on long term complications of ART and non&#xD;
      HIV related events. Although data is available from resource rich settings, this information&#xD;
      may not be applicable to Sub-Saharan Africa due to the different antiretroviral treatment&#xD;
      drugs used and ART monitoring strategies, different HIV subtypes, as well as different&#xD;
      ethnicity and endemic diseases.&#xD;
