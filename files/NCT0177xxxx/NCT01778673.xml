      Background: Although fractures of the distal radius are the most common skeletal injury, the&#xD;
      utility of the available classification systems to predict fracture stability is limited. We&#xD;
      studied if cortical comminution and intra-articular involvement can assess instability in&#xD;
      fractures of the distal radius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A prospective multicenter study was conducted. Distal radius fractures in 417&#xD;
      skeletally mature patients (428 fractures) were studied. Fractures were divided into&#xD;
      osteoporotic or non-osteoporotic according to age of the patients. Antero-posterior and&#xD;
      lateral plain radiographs determined if the fractures were minimally displaced or displaced.&#xD;
      The fracture patterns were evaluated depending on the presence and the site of cortical&#xD;
      comminution and intra-articular involvement according to a new classification system&#xD;
      (Buttazzoni classification). Minimally displaced fractures were treated with cast&#xD;
      immobilization. Displaced fractures underwent closed reduction with subsequent cast&#xD;
      immobilization. Radiographs were obtained after reduction, at 10-14 days and after 3 months.&#xD;
      Displacement was classified as primary instability, secondary instability or late&#xD;
      instability. Endpoints were union of the fracture or re-displacement. Results: Volarly&#xD;
      comminuted fractures (Buttazzoni 4) displaced in 96 %, intra-articular fractures (Buttazzoni&#xD;
      3) in 72%, dorsally comminuted fractures (Buttazzoni 2) in 73% and non-comminuted (Buttazzoni&#xD;
      1) in 16 % of the cases. One third of the initially minimally displaced fractures did not&#xD;
      maintain acceptable alignment. All initially displaced volarly comminuted fractures were&#xD;
      unstable. In both initially displaced and minimally displaced fractures, cortical comminution&#xD;
      and intra-articular involvement were predictive for primary, secondary and late instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: Cortical comminution and intra-articular involvement seem to be valuable&#xD;
      instruments for assessing stability at initial presentation of distal radius fractures. Level&#xD;
      of Evidence: Level I, prospective multicenter study. Prognostic study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Between the 1st of October 2009 and the 30th of September 2011 patients with DRF at two&#xD;
      teaching hospitals were invited to participate in a prospective study. Patients between 15&#xD;
      and 74 years, with closed physes of the distal radius and ulna were included. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were dementia, previous fracture to the ipsilateral wrist, open fracture, other&#xD;
      concomitant or existing damage or injury to the wrist, Galeazzi fracture, rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, alcohol or drug abuse and neurologic impairment. All patients underwent&#xD;
      radiographic examination with frontal and lateral views centered on the wrist in neutral&#xD;
      rotation. The radiographs were classified by the doctor on-call who had the needed&#xD;
      information about the classification system available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undisplaced or minimally displaced fractures (will be called minimally displaced throughout&#xD;
      this article) were immobilized in a Plaster-of-Paris (PoP) slab from distal to the elbow to&#xD;
      proximal to the MCP-joints with the wrist in a neutral position. Displaced fractures were&#xD;
      reduced under hematoma-block local anesthesia, immobilized with PoP slab and then&#xD;
      radiologically re-examined. In cases of re-displacement at post-reduction x-ray, the&#xD;
      fractures were registered as primary instability and further treated according to the&#xD;
      guidelines of the treating department. Both if the fracture was minimally displaced and if&#xD;
      reduction was successful radiographic examination was performed after 10-14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If still acceptable at 10-14 days, the fractures were treated in PoP slab for totally 4-6&#xD;
      weeks. If the fracture at follow up had displaced, it was registered as secondary instability&#xD;
      and further treatment was discussed. After 3 or more months radiographs were again obtained&#xD;
      to confirm union and final position of the fracture. Fractures with an acceptable position at&#xD;
      10-14 days which later mal-united were registered as late instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If reduction to an acceptable position was not achieved initially or was lost at the 10-14&#xD;
      days control this was considered to be the end-point for this particular fracture in this&#xD;
      study. Thus all fractures that entered and finished this study can either be considered to&#xD;
      have been stable i.e. went to union in an acceptable position without operation, or were&#xD;
      fractures that at one point or another showed that they were so unstable that an acceptable&#xD;
      position could not be established or kept with conservative means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptable position To define acceptable and non-acceptable positions we used specific&#xD;
      radiographic criteria. We measured volar inclination, radial tilt, ulnar variance and any&#xD;
      eventual intra-articular step-off. It is considered that elderly people tolerate more&#xD;
      displacement than younger people (6,10). Some authors have made an arbitrary definition,&#xD;
      considering females above 49 years and males above 59 years as osteoporotic. Therefore; we&#xD;
      have divided the patients into two groups, one &quot;younger&quot; below and one &quot;elderly&quot; above these&#xD;
      ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the &quot;elderly&quot; we accepted volar inclination up to 20°, dorsal tilt up to 10° and radial&#xD;
      tilt of 10° or more. For the &quot;younger&quot; we accepted volar inclination up to 15°, dorsal tilt&#xD;
      up to 10° and radial tilt of 15° or more. Up to 2 mm. of ulnar variance and less than 2 mm.&#xD;
      of intra-articular step-off were acceptable in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The Fischer's exact test was used to compare each pair of class. To correct for&#xD;
      multiple comparisons the p-values from the Fischer's exact test was corrected with Benjamini&#xD;
      Hochberg correction. IBM SPSS 20 was used for most analysis, except for the Fischer exact&#xD;
      with the correction where R, version 2.15 (http://www.r-project.org), was used with package&#xD;
      fmsb. A p-value &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. The false-discovery-rate for&#xD;
      the Benjamini-Hochberg correction was set as 0.05.&#xD;
