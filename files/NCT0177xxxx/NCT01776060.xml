      The goal of this study is to enroll 100 participants with Primary Progressive Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis (PPMS) that have joined the MURDOCK Study Horizon 1.5 (Duke IRB Pro00011196) and&#xD;
      the Multiple Sclerosis cohort (Duke IRB Pro00023791). All 100 participants will complete a&#xD;
      biannual collection of a follow up questionnaire and blood/urine collection for a period of 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

      Unlike Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) or Secondary Progressive Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis (SPMS) in which patients experience a remission or lessening of their symptoms,&#xD;
      Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) is characterized by progression of disability&#xD;
      from onset, with no, or only occasional and minor, remissions and improvements. The age of&#xD;
      onset for the primary progressive subtype is later than for the relapsing-remitting, but&#xD;
      similar to mean the age of progression between the relapsing-remitting and the secondary&#xD;
      progressive - around 40 years of age. Because of its prevalence, RRMS represents the largest&#xD;
      basis for basic and clinical MS research. Therefore, drugs have primarily been developed to&#xD;
      slow disease progression in RRMS and SPMS patients. No treatment has been proven successful&#xD;
      in treating primary progressive MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MURDOCK-MS collection represents a unique opportunity to carry out detailed biomarker&#xD;
      research on PPMS patients and, to the knowledge of this investigator and his colleagues in&#xD;
      the field, would represent an exceptional cohort that is not available elsewhere in the US or&#xD;
      the rest of the world. Aside from first in disease sampling, the serial, biannual collection&#xD;
      of samples from PPMS patients would not only permit the identification of 'omic profiles that&#xD;
      can be compared and contrasted to those from RRMS patients in a parallel study, but it would&#xD;
      also allow the generation of 'omic markers of disease progression. This progressive etiology&#xD;
      would provide valuable insight into PPMS development and may also shed light on SPMS&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

        Participants must enroll in the MURDOCK Study Horizon 1.5 (Pro00011196) as well as the&#xD;
        Multiple Sclerosis cohort (Pro00023791) in order to participate in this biannual collection&#xD;
        of a follow up questionnaire and blood/urine collection for participants who have Primary&#xD;
        Progressive MS. The biannual collection will continue for 5 years. Those participants with&#xD;
        PPMS who are already enrolled in the MURDOCK Study Horizon 1.5 and Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
        cohort will be contacted via phone to assess interest in the PPMS study. New participants&#xD;
        with PPMS who enroll into the Horizon 1.5 study and Multiple Sclerosis cohort will be asked&#xD;
        during the time of enrollment if they would like to participate in the PPMS study as well.&#xD;
