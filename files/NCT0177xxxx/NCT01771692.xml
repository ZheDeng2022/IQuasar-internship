  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fixed braces (appliances) are used to straighten the malalignment of teeth. There has been a&#xD;
      lot of research into the factors that can affect the speed of alignment of teeth but there&#xD;
      has been very little research on how different techniques of wire attachment to the brace&#xD;
      (ligation) can affect this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomised clinical trial of 100 patients aims to compare the speed of alignment of the&#xD;
      lower (mandibular) front teeth (incisors) using two different techniques over a period of 12&#xD;
      weeks. Both techniques use the conventional small elastic rings (modules) that are placed&#xD;
      over each metal square (bracket) but they will be tied in a different configuration for each&#xD;
      group. We will also observe any differences in the distances between the corresponding teeth&#xD;
      either side of the lower jaw for each group and the bracket failure rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research protocol has been devised by Rachel Little (Specialty Registrar in&#xD;
      Orthodontics), under the supervision of Mr David Spary (Consultant in Orthodontics) and Dr&#xD;
      Ashish Dhopatkar (Head of Orthodontics, Birmingham Dental School).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study I intend to find out whether friction plays a part in lower incisor alignment&#xD;
      by comparing different ligation techniques. If I can show that the speed of alignment is&#xD;
      affected by different techniques, this will be an important finding for orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine whether increased friction caused by ligation with figure of&#xD;
      eight modules effects the speed of lower incisor alignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 orthodontic patients (n=50 per group) who have attended a new patient clinic at Burton&#xD;
      Hospital and who require correction for the malalignment of their teeth with a fixed&#xD;
      appliances will be selected. Potential participants will be invited to take part in the study&#xD;
      and will be given verbal and written information. If they agree to participate, written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained. All patients will be competent and capable of making the decision.&#xD;
      All patients in this study will be under 16 years of age, and so parental/legal guardian&#xD;
      consent will be obtained. The patients will be able to withdraw from the study at any time,&#xD;
      should they not wish to continue participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to either the conventional module group (figure of O)&#xD;
      or the figure of 8 module group, following consent for participation in the trial.&#xD;
      Randomisation will use the method of block randomisation. Allocation will be undertaken by a&#xD;
      non-clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to use the study models (replica of the patient's teeth made out of plaster) from&#xD;
      the pre treatment records as the baseline data then take an additional mould (impression) of&#xD;
      the lower teeth only at each of the participants normal orthodontic appointments at six and&#xD;
      twelve weeks after the appliances have been put on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements required will be taken from these study models using digital callipers,&#xD;
      after the impressions have been cast in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Improved appearance and function of the teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth decay and gum disease (this can be prevented with good oral hygiene and low sugar&#xD;
           intake)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breakages&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapse (if retainers are not worn after the fixed appliances are removed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Root shortening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study models that will be analysed will be stored in the patient's model box along with&#xD;
      their notes in a locked office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At no point during this research will personal details be disclosed to any persons not&#xD;
      directly involved with providing orthodontic care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflict of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No conflict of interest is known or expected to arise during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A summary sheet of the findings of this study will be made available to participants on&#xD;
      request.&#xD;
