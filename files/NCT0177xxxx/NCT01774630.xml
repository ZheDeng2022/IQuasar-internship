  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic neoplasm characterized by the reciprocal&#xD;
      translocation t(9;22). The resulting oncoprotein, bcr-abl is an essential trigger for growth&#xD;
      and survival of leukemic cells. In the past decade, the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      (TKI) imatinib (IM or Glivec©) has been the standard of care for patients with CML, inducing&#xD;
      durable responses. However, requiring continuing IM indefinitely and the ability of IM to&#xD;
      eradicate the CML clone was uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a small proportion of patients, IM can induce complete molecular response (CMR) defined by&#xD;
      the disappearance of the bcr-abl transcript in conventional quantitative RT-PCR. The question&#xD;
      whether or not these patients are cured and can discontinue drug therapy has been assessed by&#xD;
      Mahon and coll, in the STIM study. He demonstrates that IM can be safely discontinued in&#xD;
      patient with a CMR of at least 2 year duration and all patients who relapsed after IM&#xD;
      discontinuation mainly did it in the first 6 months and responded to reintroduction of&#xD;
      imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nilotinib is a rationally designed second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor with improved&#xD;
      target specificity over imatinib. Its efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients who&#xD;
      are resistant or intolerant to imatinib as well as patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP led&#xD;
      to the registration in second and first line treatment of CML-CP patients. Nilotinib produces&#xD;
      even faster and deeper responses with more occurrence of CMR than does Imatinib.&#xD;
      Consequently, one can assume that a more potent drug such nilotinib could induce deeper and&#xD;
      sustained CMR allowing longer period off treatment than IM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this pilot trial is to assess if Nilotinib can rescue STIM patients in&#xD;
      molecular relapse after IM discontinuation and to provide an estimation about duration of CMR&#xD;
      after nilotinib discontinuation in 2nd line therapy among patients experiencing 2 years of&#xD;
      stable CMR with nilotinib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with CML included in STIM trials, stopped their treatment by imatinib because the&#xD;
      signal was not detectable. In case of reappearance of this transcript Bcr-Abl, the patient&#xD;
      relapses. The trial Nilo Post STIM is suggested to the patient to assess if Nilotinib can&#xD;
      rescue STIM patients in molecular relapse after IM discontinuation and to provide an&#xD;
      estimation about duration of CMR after nilotinib discontinuation in 2nd line therapy among&#xD;
      patients experiencing 2 years of stable CMR with nilotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment/strategy for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CML history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Confirm molecular relapse after discontinuation of imatinib (quantitative RT-PCR on&#xD;
                two consecutive assessments from peripheral blood samples)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Nilotinib 300mg BID for 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Premature treatment discontinuation while on study: primary or secondary resistance&#xD;
                progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis, AE (to be defined later).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In case of unsatisfactory response: transcript stability or increase on two&#xD;
                consecutive PCR: nilotinib blood monitoring, and nilotinib dose escalation up to&#xD;
                400mg BID will be proposed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Discontinuation at 2 years for patients who resumed confirmed CMR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up while on treatment with nilotinib:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical exam, basic laboratory parameters, monthly during the first 3 months then&#xD;
                every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Centralized quantitative RT-PCR for Bcr-Abl monthly for 6 months then every 3&#xD;
                months for 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Follow AE management guidelines for nilotinib reduction/interruptions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up after nilotinib discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients in confirmed molecular relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Physical exam, event collection, basic laboratory parameters (including&#xD;
                     glycemic and lipid profile) every 2 months during the first year then every 3&#xD;
                     months&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Hematology and centralized quantitative RT-PCR monthly the first year then&#xD;
                     every 3 months for 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients without confirmed molecular relapse will take another treatment (dasatinib&#xD;
                for example) and will stop their follow-up in the trial&#xD;
