  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although DIPG is not curable, re-irradiation with a modest total dose and short treatment&#xD;
      time provides good palliation of symptoms, improves quality of life, delays disease&#xD;
      progression and has minimal and manageable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At progression, full radiological and clinical documentation necessary including a&#xD;
      neurological exam by a neurologist will be done. Progressive patients will be referred to&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30.6 Gray (Gy) will be applied in 1.8 to 2Gy fractions in conformal radiation to tumor bed.&#xD;
      Radiation will be done in standard accelerators and according to standard guidelines used in&#xD;
      treatment for all brain tumor patients.&#xD;

    <description>clinical progression: close follow up including biweekly neurological assessments to evaluate for clinical progression. any onset of a new neurological deficit or deterioration of an existing deficit will require follow up within one week. persistent deficit will be considered clinical progression.&#xD;
progression on imaging: MRI will be done every 3 months. tumor growth of &gt;25% will be considered disease progression</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age:1 year-22 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient/parent consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of DIPG based on short classic history, clinical signs (long tract signs,&#xD;
             cranial nerve deficits and ataxia) and classic MRI features (more than 2/3 of the&#xD;
             tumor is located within the pons and tumor encompasses more than 60% of the pons)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A patient will be eligible for reirradiation if progression is diagnosed following a&#xD;
             period of at least 4 months of stable disease after first irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Progression may be either clinical (new neurological deficit or worsening of an old&#xD;
             deficit in two separate physical examinations) or radiological (tumor growth of &gt;25%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Radiation necrosis post first irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unstable vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Less than X months since previous irradiation&#xD;
