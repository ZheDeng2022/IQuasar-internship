  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to measure zinc status and related proteins in patients with&#xD;
      Thalassemia who have or do not have diabetes. The secondary aim will be to explore the effect&#xD;
      of zinc supplementation on glucose metabolism in patients with thalassemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Thalassemia major (Thal) require frequent blood transfusions and are at risk&#xD;
      for iron overload. High tissue iron increases the risk of various endocrinopathies, including&#xD;
      diabetes, as well as cardiovascular disease, and infections due to the formation of free&#xD;
      radicals. This systemic condition of oxidative stress elicits an antioxidant response to&#xD;
      reduce tissue damage. Zinc is an important component of that response because it can compete&#xD;
      with iron for multiple cellular binding sites and, therefore, reduce the redox-cycling of&#xD;
      iron and minimize iron-mediated oxidation of lipids, proteins, and DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Thal patients with chronic hepatic iron overload, tissue zinc redistribution is likely to&#xD;
      be persistent. This could create an unbalanced tissue zinc distribution with excessive&#xD;
      amounts in the liver and deficient levels in other tissues altering zinc-dependent functions,&#xD;
      such as growth, skeletal development, immunity, and glucose regulation. There is a rich body&#xD;
      of literature focused on the 'diabetogenic effects' of altered zinc status which will be&#xD;
      reviewed herein. Our group has recently shown that supplementation with 25 mg/d of zinc can&#xD;
      improve bone density in patients with Thal. This provides evidence for a functional zinc&#xD;
      deficiency, which may also affect other whole body zinc functions, such as insulin secretion&#xD;
      and glucose homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that hepatic iron overload induces a sub-clinical inflammatory response&#xD;
      that alters the expression of MT and zinc-transport proteins leading to hepatic zinc&#xD;
      sequestration, and an associated zinc-depletion in other tissues. Marginal zinc depletion in&#xD;
      turn leads to increased oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and altered glucose homeostasis&#xD;
      and insulin secretion. This proposal will focus on cross-sectional differences in markers of&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis and zinc status in diabetic and non-diabetic Thal patients, combined with&#xD;
      a short- term zinc supplementation to explore the effect on glucose and insulin homeostasis.&#xD;
