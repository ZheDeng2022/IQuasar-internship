      This research study is an imaging pilot study. Imaging pilot studies explore the potential&#xD;
      benefit of one imaging approach compared to another clinically accepted approach. Such&#xD;
      studies serve to understand how feasible an approach may be and whether it is worth pursuing&#xD;
      in formal and larger clinical trials. Researchers of this study believe that simultaneous&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging will offer&#xD;
      additional imaging information to improve cancer detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI and PET are two tests that allow us to take pictures of the body and &quot;look inside&quot; the&#xD;
      body without surgery. The MRI scanner uses a powerful magnet to make a picture of the body.&#xD;
      The PET scanner makes pictures by using special dyes that &quot;light up&quot; inside the body. PET&#xD;
      scans use radiation, similar to the radiation in a standard x-ray. We routinely use both&#xD;
      tests to diagnose various types of cancer. As of now, the combination of PET and computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) has been considered a standard of care imaging approach for various cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, MRI and PET tests were done separately. Now there is a new type of test&#xD;
      called MR-PET that combines both MRI and PET test results. This scanner uses both MRI and PET&#xD;
      tests at the same time. We would like to find out if the MR-PET scanner can produce better&#xD;
      and clearer images (pictures) of tumors and information about them inside of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new MR-PET scanner is approved by the US FDA. However, some of the computer programs&#xD;
      that tell the machine how to acquire and combine the test results are new and experimental.&#xD;
      Experimental means that some of the computer programs are not approved by the FDA. This means&#xD;
      that they can only be used in research studies. The MR-PET scanner has been previously used&#xD;
      in a few human participants.&#xD;

      If you agree to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some tests and&#xD;
      procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to&#xD;
      be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part&#xD;
      in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may&#xD;
      or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include a medical history, blood&#xD;
      tests and a urine pregnancy test. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in&#xD;
      the research study, you will be able to undergo a one time MR/PET imaging session on the same&#xD;
      day you are scheduled for a PET/CT. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not&#xD;
      be able to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will verify that your doctor has ordered a standard PET/CT scan as part of your regular&#xD;
      medical care. You will have that PET/CT scan at teh main MGH Boston campus. As part of the&#xD;
      PET/CT scan, you will have an injection of a radioactive material into your vein. The&#xD;
      radioactive material consists of glucose (sugar) that has been labeled as radioactive. Your&#xD;
      own doctor, the radiologist performing imaging and/or the PET/CT staff will explain this type&#xD;
      of scan to you in more detail. You will be asked to sign a separate consent form for that&#xD;
      PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT scanning can make pictures of structures inside the body because the injected&#xD;
      radioactive material &quot;lights up&quot; on the pictures. This shows us details of organs, tissues,&#xD;
      blood vessels, and other structures in your body. The radioactive material breaks down and&#xD;
      leaves your body gradually through the urine. It takes about a day for the radioactive&#xD;
      material to exit your body completely. You will not receive an additional injection of&#xD;
      radioactive material for this MR-PET study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have the standard PET/CT procedures and the study MR-PET scans on the same day.&#xD;
      After you have the PET/CT scan, you will travel to the MGH Charlestown facility for the study&#xD;
      MR-PET scan. It takes about 15 minutes to travel between the main MGH campus and the MGH&#xD;
      Charlestown facility. Although you must fast (no eating or drinking) before the PET/CT scan,&#xD;
      you do not have to fast before the MR-PET scan. You will be able to have a snack before the&#xD;
      scan, if you wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the MR-PET Procedure: We will ask you some standard questions to make sure that you&#xD;
      can safely have an MRI. It is important that you take off anything that contains metal, such&#xD;
      as jewelry, piercings or zippers. You may need to put on a hospital gown. We will also ask&#xD;
      you to empty your bladder before the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask you to lie down on a narrow table. The table will slide you into the center of&#xD;
      the very large MRI scanner, which is shaped like a tunnel. The tunnel is a little wider than&#xD;
      your body. You will need to lie very still during the scanning process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to help hold your head still, we may place foam pillows under and around your head.&#xD;
      The scanner makes loud banging and beeping noises when making pictures, so we will give you&#xD;
      earplugs or headphones to protect your ears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The top and sides of the tunnel will be close to your face and body, which can make some&#xD;
      people uncomfortable. If you have ever experienced a fear of small spaces (claustrophobia),&#xD;
      please tell the MRI staff. You will be able to hear and speak to the research staff at all&#xD;
      times during the scan. We can stop the scan at any time, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, we will make some pictures of your brain and/or whole body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PET scan will take place at the same time as the MRI scan using our new MR-PET scanner.&#xD;
      You will not need another injection of radioactive material for our MR-PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During scanning, we may ask you to do some activities with your hands, look at pictures,&#xD;
      listen to some sounds, or do other things. We will make pictures of your brain during these&#xD;
      activities to test different settings on the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your study scans are complete, your time in the study will be over. The whole testing&#xD;
      session will take up to one and a half hours. You may feel a little bit tired afterwards, so&#xD;
      you can rest a bit before leaving the scanning area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be in this research study for about up to one month-this includes the waiting period&#xD;
      until pathology results from the surgery are back. Your actual participation in the study&#xD;
      will only involve that one day when you receive both the PET/CT and PET/MR.&#xD;
