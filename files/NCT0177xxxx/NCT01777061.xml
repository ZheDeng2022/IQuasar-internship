  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When evaluating prostate cancer patients for recurrent disease, computed tomography (CT), and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both highly sensitive methods for detecting lymph nodes,&#xD;
      but are not specific as to whether the lymph nodes are malignant or benign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While positron emission tomography (PET) utilizing radioactive glucose (FDG) has&#xD;
      revolutionized staging, restaging, and monitoring response to therapy in many prevalent&#xD;
      cancers such as breast, colorectal, esophageal, head and neck, lung, lymphoma, and melanoma,&#xD;
      findings with prostate cancer have proven less sensitive because prostate cancer has a lower&#xD;
      avidity for glucose. A newer PET isotope, utilizing acetate that is incorporated into the&#xD;
      cell membrane of rapidly proliferating cells, has shown greater sensitivity than FDG in&#xD;
      detecting prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the clinical effectiveness of utilizing [11C]Acetate PET scans in&#xD;
      identifying recurrent prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FDG-PET imaging uses a form of radioactive glucose (18-fluoro-deoxyglucose or FDG), which&#xD;
      allows the measurement of glucose metabolic rate of any tissue in the body. The most&#xD;
      prevalent tumors have a glucose avidity that is typically greater than 2.5 times the avidity&#xD;
      of benign tissue. Therefore, FDG-PET is able to discriminate between benign lymph nodes and&#xD;
      those containing metastases, and similarly between scar tissue and recurrence of tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, prostate cancer is only minimally glucose avid, and therefore, FDG-PET is much&#xD;
      less effective in staging prostate cancer. The current FDA-approved imaging agent for&#xD;
      prostate cancer is a monoclonal antibody specific for prostate cancer cells, capromab&#xD;
      pendetide, labeled with a long-lived radionuclide [111]Indium that is used to image the&#xD;
      patient over a six day period. However, recent data show that another PET&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical, [11C]Acetate (which has been FDA approved for years for cardiac&#xD;
      imaging), is avidly taken up by prostate metastasis and is more sensitive than either&#xD;
      [111]Indium capromab pendetide or FDG-PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the clinical effectiveness of utilizing [11C]Acetate PET scans in&#xD;
      identifying recurrent prostate cancer and aim to find at what PSA levels it is most&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
