      It is well known that being overweight or obese increases the risk of health problems, and&#xD;
      that many people find it difficult to maintain a healthy weight. Worryingly the rise in&#xD;
      obesity is greater in women than in the male population. One possible reason for this is that&#xD;
      some women gain too much weight during their pregnancy and find it difficult to lose this&#xD;
      weight after the birth of their baby. For example, women who gain more weight than&#xD;
      recommended during pregnancy have been shown to be more likely to carry excess that weight at&#xD;
      1 and 15 years after pregnancy, compared to women who gained the recommended amount of&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no evidence-based guidelines in the UK for how weight should be managed&#xD;
      during pregnancy. For these reasons, it is really important that we understand the factors&#xD;
      affecting weight management before, during and after pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is therefore to find successful approaches to help women manage&#xD;
      their weight before, during and after pregnancy. This will be completed by understanding the&#xD;
      knowledge, attitudes, experiences and expectations of women during and after pregnancy and to&#xD;
      identify the factors (e.g. diet, physical activity, poor social network etc.) which influence&#xD;
      body weight. This will enable us to suggest better strategies for promoting healthy weight&#xD;
      changes during and after pregnancy.&#xD;

      Obesity in women of reproductive age is a major factor facing primary and secondary&#xD;
      healthcare provision, with half of women of childbearing age in the UK classified as&#xD;
      overweight or obese (The Information Centre, 2008). The prevalence of obesity in pregnant&#xD;
      women living in Nottingham City is estimated to be 18.4%, (Wilcox, 2011), compared to 15.5%&#xD;
      in England as a whole (Heslehurst et al., 2010). Being overweight or obese during pregnancy&#xD;
      increases the risk of morbidity and mortality attributed to a range of pregnancy-related&#xD;
      complications (Galtier et al, 2008), with 49% of maternal deaths occurring in overweight or&#xD;
      obese women (Cantwell et al., 2011). Women who are overweight or obese at conception are more&#xD;
      likely to develop hypertensive or diabetic complications, to develop thrombosis, and to&#xD;
      deliver macrosomic babies (Ramachenderan et al, 2008). Associated with this are increased&#xD;
      rates of delivery complications, postpartum haemorrhage and caesarean section (Galtier et&#xD;
      al., 2008), with obese women at greater risk of anaesthetic complications. There is also a&#xD;
      greater risk of infections (Metwally et al, 2007). Risks posed to the baby include congenital&#xD;
      abnormalities such as spina bifida and oral clefts (King, 2006), and an increased risk of&#xD;
      childhood obesity and adult metabolic syndrome (Galtier et al, 2008). The societal and&#xD;
      economic impact of obesity during pregnancy is therefore life-long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excessive weight gain during pregnancy has little positive effect on foetal growth and&#xD;
      pregnancy duration (Scholl et al, 1995) and is associated with a similar range of adverse&#xD;
      outcomes as described above (Guelinckx et al., 2008). It is also associated with a greater&#xD;
      probability of post-partum weight retention. Linn√© et al (2004) showed that both normal&#xD;
      weight and overweight/obese women who gained excessive weight were more likely to have&#xD;
      retained more weight 1 and 15 years after pregnancy, compared to women who gained the&#xD;
      recommended amount of weight during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the US Institute of Medicine recommends lower pregnancy weight gain ranges for&#xD;
      overweight and obese women (IOM, 2009), there are currently no UK evidence based guidelines&#xD;
      outlining an appropriate BMI-specific weight gain (NICE, 2009). The current UK guide for&#xD;
      weight gain is 10 - 12.5kg for all women (DoH, 2009). There is concern expressed that women&#xD;
      are not being informed of the risks associated with obesity during pregnancy, or of the&#xD;
      importance of a safe weight gain during pregnancy (NICE, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study on the views of health professionals highlighted the issue that dietary information&#xD;
      is often ad-hoc, and that advice is not linked with weight management (Heslehurst et al,&#xD;
      2007). Wiles (1998) found that above average weight women felt they didn't receive relevant&#xD;
      weight management information. NICE (2010) recommended that there was need for research to&#xD;
      find effective and cost effective approaches to help women manage their weight before, during&#xD;
      and after pregnancy, including those from disadvantaged, low income and minority ethnic&#xD;
      groups. In order to develop better strategies for promoting healthy weight changes in this&#xD;
      population, it is important to understand the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, experience&#xD;
      and expectations of pregnant women during and after pregnancy in relation to their body&#xD;
      weight and the behavioural factors which influence body weight. However, there is a paucity&#xD;
      of research in this field. A recent systematic review (Campbell, et al, 2008) identified just&#xD;
      8 studies, (in the UK since 1990, with the most recent being conducted in 2004), into the&#xD;
      views and attitudes to diet, physical activity and weight gain in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Childbearing may affect attitudes towards body image and this psychological dimension of&#xD;
      weight is also important in understanding postpartum weight retention. Relatively few studies&#xD;
      have investigated the effects of risk factors on weight retention in postpartum women.&#xD;
      Gaining this intelligence from representative population groups is necessary for the&#xD;
      selection and development of effective strategies to aid the development and commissioning of&#xD;
      services and pathways to help address maternal obesity and post partum weight management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The primary risk factor for retaining weight in the postnatal period is excessive&#xD;
      gestational weight gain (Linne et al., 2002). However, a number of other factors have been&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of weight retention, including high pre-pregnancy body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), primiparity, short duration of breastfeeding, stopping smoking, high dietary&#xD;
      energy intake and low physical activity (Gunderson et al., 2000; Gore et al., 2003; Siega-Riz&#xD;
      et al., 2004). Childbearing may also affect attitudes towards body image and this&#xD;
      psychological dimension is important in understanding postnatal weight management.&#xD;
      Understanding the effects of these risk factors on antenatal weight management is challenging&#xD;
      and relatively few studies have attempted investigation of these relationships. Much of the&#xD;
      data is inconclusive or focused on the effect of weight loss on other endpoints, such as&#xD;
      lactation or infant growth (Dewey et al., 1994; Lovelady et al., 2000). Thus, the principal&#xD;
      research objective of this project is to conduct a feasibility study to explore women's&#xD;
      expectations and experiences of antenatal weight management and retention, and to use this to&#xD;
      identify predictors of excessive weight gain during pregnancy and weight retention up to one&#xD;
      year postpartum. Women will be recruited from antenatal clinics at Queens Medical Centre&#xD;
      (Nottingham University Hospitals, NG7 2UH) at either 12 or 20 weeks of pregnancy. Parameters&#xD;
      of interest will be investigated at recruitment whilst attending the antenatal clinic (12 or&#xD;
      20 weeks of pregnancy), at follow up during pregnancy by postal questionnaire (20 and 32&#xD;
      weeks of pregnancy), and at follow up during the postnatal period (2 weeks, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      after birth). The questionnaires will assess women's expectations for weight change during&#xD;
      and after pregnancy, their experiences of antenatal care and knowledge of recommendations,&#xD;
      and their diet and levels of physical activity. The participants will be women of all ages,&#xD;
      sociodemographic backgrounds and bodyweights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE Purpose: The study has a clear purpose to explore women's expectations and&#xD;
      experiences of antenatal weight management and retention, and to identify predictors of&#xD;
      excessive weight gain during pregnancy and weight retention up to one year postpartum. It is&#xD;
      imperative that these research questions are addressed in order to provide the knowledge&#xD;
      required to develop appropriate intervention strategies. This study has been designed to&#xD;
      address these research questions in a direct and focused manner, by using a combination of&#xD;
      tools to collect the relevant information (questionnaire to explore women's expectations and&#xD;
      experiences, food frequency and physical activity questionnaires). The ultimate aim is that&#xD;
      the data collected will be used to develop intervention strategies to help women reach and/or&#xD;
      maintain a healthy weight during the pregnancy and postnatal periods, thus reducing the risk&#xD;
      of postpartum obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE The principal research objective is to conduct an exploratory,&#xD;
      observational, mixed-methods study to assess women's expectations for weight change during&#xD;
      and after pregnancy, their experiences of antenatal care and knowledge of recommendations,&#xD;
      and their diet and levels of physical activity, and to use this information to identify&#xD;
      predictors of weight change during pregnancy and the postnatal period that could usefully be&#xD;
      targeted as part of an intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine what expectations women have with regards to weight change during pregnancy&#xD;
           and the postpartum period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the sources of information which shape the expectations of women in relation&#xD;
           to pregnancy-related weight change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether the following factors are associated with weight change in&#xD;
           pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Pre-pregnancy weight and body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Diet and dietary habits during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Physical activity during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Pregnancy related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore whether the following physiological factors predict weight change in&#xD;
           post-partum women:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Pre-pregnancy weight, pregnancy weight change and postpartum weight&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Diet and dietary habits during pregnancy and postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Physical activity during pregnancy and postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Breastfeeding, mixed or formula feeding, time of weaning&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify whether the following psychological factors result in weight retention in&#xD;
           post-partum women:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Weight expectations&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Body weight and shape concerns&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Weight loss self-efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Body satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Weight loss outcome expectancies&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be pregnant women at 12 or 20 weeks pregnancy attending the 12 and&#xD;
             20 week antenatal scanning clinics at the Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be able to give informed consent- Participants will be over the age&#xD;
             of 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be able to read English - due to the nature of the study we will not&#xD;
             be able to print the questionnaires in various languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be of any sociodemographic backgrounds, bodyweights and parity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who do not feel that their literacy or English language skills will&#xD;
             enable them to complete the questionnaires will be offered the opportunity to have one&#xD;
             of the research team read the questions and fill in the answers for them. Whilst doing&#xD;
             this and being sensitive to literacy and language issues, the nature of this&#xD;
             feasibility study means that the research team will not offer an interpreting service&#xD;
             or produce documents in languages other than English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be excluded from the postnatal phase of the study if they deliver&#xD;
             their baby prematurely (before 37 weeks of gestation) or do not give birth to a live&#xD;
             baby. These exclusions are required, as premature birth or fetal loss/still birth&#xD;
             would be expected to have an impact on psychological and physiological aspects linked&#xD;
             to weight management which are not relevant to our specific research objectives.&#xD;
             Information on birth outcome will be gained by accessing hospital records, and only&#xD;
             women who have given birth to a live baby after 37 weeks of gestation will be&#xD;
             contacted by the study team in the postnatal period.&#xD;
