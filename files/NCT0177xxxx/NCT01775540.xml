  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was to evaluate the healing action on the eye surface of the artificial tear&#xD;
      Systane® ULTRA as compared to two other eyedrops: Maxidex and Saline solution. Dry eye&#xD;
      disease leads to inflammation of the eye surface and treating dry eyes with artificial tears&#xD;
      may lead to reduction in this inflammation and improvement of symptoms and signs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For all patients who present to the office with a history of dry eyes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Consent forms will be obtained from every patient. Informed consent will be discussed&#xD;
           with the patient in detail. Every topic will be addressed separately. All risks,&#xD;
           benefits, and alternatives will be discussed. Patient will be allowed to ask questions,&#xD;
           and all questions will be answered. The assessment will be made after that conversation,&#xD;
           whether or not the patient understood the consent as described above. Each subject will&#xD;
           be allowed as much time as needed to review and sign the consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All patients will be asked to fill out the Ocular Surface Discomfort Index (OSDI)&#xD;
           questionnaire to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria. If patients score meets&#xD;
           eligibility requirements a general and ocular history will be taken. (Time: 10 min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A pregnancy test will be given to all female subjects of child bearing age. A standard&#xD;
           eye exam will be performed to rule out any other ocular pathology besides refractive&#xD;
           error. This allows for confirmation that all study subjects have dry eye disease.&#xD;
           Topical fluorescein and lissamine dye will be used to record staining on the cornea and&#xD;
           conjunctiva of subjects as well as the tear film break-up time (TFBUT). Both of these&#xD;
           dyes are used as standard-of-care in eye exams around the country. TFBUT will first be&#xD;
           determined through application of sodium fluorescein onto the eye using DET strip.&#xD;
           Following triplicate evaluation of TFBUT in each eye, ocular staining will be determined&#xD;
           with liquid fluorescein and lissamine dyes administered in liquid form. (Time 15 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients will be given Alcon questionnaires to fill out, inquiring about past&#xD;
           treatments, daily symptoms and distress associated with their dry eye disease. (Time:15&#xD;
           minutes) This also serves as a waiting period for some of the dye to wash out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Using a graduated disposable 5 µl microcapillary tube (Wiretol-Micropipettes, Drummond&#xD;
           Scientific Co., Broomall, PA, USA) up to 5 µl of tears / eye will be collected from the&#xD;
           inferior temporal tear meniscus of each participant, without corneal anesthesia, taking&#xD;
           care to ensure that the lid margin and corneal surface were not touched. A maximum of 5&#xD;
           minutes will be allowed per eye for collection of minimal 5 uL of tear. Tears will be&#xD;
           immediately dispensed into pre-labeled Eppendorf tubes and placed on dry ice until&#xD;
           transferred to -80oC for storage. (Time: 10 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A technique known as Impression Cytology (IC) will be used to isolate epithelial cells&#xD;
           from the conjunctiva. Anesthetic drops will be administered to each eye before the&#xD;
           procedure. Blunted forceps are used to gently press a piece of filter paper against the&#xD;
           patient's conjunctiva. The paper is gently lifted off, and sent to the Mount Sinai&#xD;
           Laboratory for analyses. (Estimated collection time: 15 minutes). A total of 6 pieces&#xD;
           per patient (3 pieces per eye) will be collected on each scheduled visit. For HLA-DR&#xD;
           analysis, 2 pieces from each eye will be held at room temperature in a vial containing&#xD;
           fixative until assay. The remaining 1 piece from each eye will be pooled together in one&#xD;
           vial for RT-PCR assays in the following order: (1) immediately merged into a pre-labeled&#xD;
           Eppendorf tube with 600 µL of TriZol Reagent; (2) Vortex for 30 seconds; (3) sealed with&#xD;
           Saran Wrap; (4) transfer to -80C for storage until assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Measurement of Intraocular pressure using Tonopen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. As a part of the substudy we intend to treat patients with Systane ULTRA®, Maxidex,&#xD;
           (both of which are FDA approved ophthalmic solutions), or the saline solution placebo.&#xD;
           Subjects will be assigned to one of the three groups as per randomization sequence and&#xD;
           the corresponding eye drop will be dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The patient's response to treatment will be assessed after approximately 4 weeks (+/- 5&#xD;
           days) using the same diagnostic tests in order to assess the sensitivity of these&#xD;
           diagnostic tests to detect the response to medical treatment of dry eye disease. In&#xD;
           addition to baseline and 4 week visits, safety evaluations will be performed at a 2 week&#xD;
           (+/- 5 days) visit. All the procedures done during the baseline visit will be repeated&#xD;
           except pregnancy test, tear collection and impression cytology.&#xD;
