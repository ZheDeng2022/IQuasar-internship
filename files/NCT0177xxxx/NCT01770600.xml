  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is dedicated to achieving a better understanding of how the brain processes&#xD;
      information. Specifically, the investigators are studying cognitive function, thought&#xD;
      process, and impulsivity in people with and without suicidal thoughts. You are being asked to&#xD;
      participate in a research study to learn how the use of a medication, risperidone, improves&#xD;
      your symptoms of depression. Specifically the investigators are studying the effectiveness of&#xD;
      reducing the thought of suicide and other symptoms of severe depression. Risperidone is&#xD;
      approved by FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania, and clinical practice&#xD;
      suggests that it might benefit patients with major depressive disorder. During clinical&#xD;
      trials with 2607 patients, risperidone was proved to be safe. This is a pilot study to test a&#xD;
      new indication of risperidone for treatment of severe depression. The study medication will&#xD;
      be given in addition to usual psychiatric care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men and women between the ages of 19-64, who have a diagnosis of major depressive disorder,&#xD;
      and are currently in a severe depressive episode with suicidal thoughts, are eligible to&#xD;
      participate in this voluntary research study. A control group will consist of men and women&#xD;
      between the ages of 19-64 who have a diagnosis or major depressive disorder and are currently&#xD;
      in a severe depressive episode but are not having suicidal thoughts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit, appropriate demographic, medical, and psychiatric data will be&#xD;
      collected, including a diagnostic assessment and an assessment of the severity of your&#xD;
      depression. You will be asked to complete several pen and pencil questionnaires to learn more&#xD;
      about your current state of mind. This evaluation will take approximately two hours. If you&#xD;
      qualify for the control or assessment group, you will be asked to meet with researchers again&#xD;
      at 2, 4 and 6 days after your initial evaluation. If you qualify for the study group, you&#xD;
      will be randomly (like the flip of a coin) assigned by a computer to receive either&#xD;
      risperidone (1-2 mg/day) or placebo once a day by mouth. You will take the study medication&#xD;
      for 5 nights in addition to your standard of care antidepressant prescribed by your doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty participants will enter a double-blind study, which means that neither you nor your&#xD;
      doctors will know which study medicine (risperidone or placebo) you are receiving. If&#xD;
      medically necessary, the medication information will be released so your doctor can find out&#xD;
      what medicine you were randomly assigned to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a follow-up evaluation (either in the hospital or returning for an office&#xD;
      visit) at Day 5. At this visit, you will be evaluated by a psychiatrist and will be asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires designed to assess the effect of the study medications on your&#xD;
      symptoms. At this visit you will also be asked about possible side effects and how you are&#xD;
      tolerating the medicine. These visits should take approximately one hour each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening and the end of the five day treatment, additional neuropsychological&#xD;
      evaluations will be administered to assess your progress. These additional assessments will&#xD;
      take approximately one hour to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the control group will receive no study related medications and will not return&#xD;
      for a follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information for Women of Childbearing Potential or Men Fathering a Child Because risperidone&#xD;
      may affect mother's milk or a developing fetus, breast-feeding and pregnant women are not&#xD;
      allowed to take part in the study. Women who can become pregnant must take a pregnancy test&#xD;
      before the start of the study. Unless they cannot have children because of surgery or other&#xD;
      medical reasons, men and women must have been using an effective method of birth control&#xD;
      before starting the study. Effective birth control includes birth control pills, patch, IUD,&#xD;
      condom, sponge, diaphragm with spermicide, or avoiding sexual activity that could cause&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional functional MRI(fMRI) brain Sub-study&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 participants will participate in the fMRI sub-study, which will include a 5 day open-label&#xD;
      trial of risperidone. An fMRI scan will be done prior to receiving study drug and 5 days&#xD;
      later. During this fMRI, a picture of your brain will be obtained. The fMRI procedure&#xD;
      requires you to lie still on a narrow table with a circular scanner around your head. The&#xD;
      fMRI scan takes approximately 40 minutes. Two of the neuropsychological assessments will be&#xD;
      administered during the scan. Sub-study participants will complete a computer-based version&#xD;
      of the tasks that will be performed during the fMRI scan prior to the brain imaging session.&#xD;
      This is necessary to ensure you understand the tasks you will be performing while the imaging&#xD;
      is taking place. Electing not to participate in this sub-study will not jeopardize&#xD;
      participation in the drug trial. A neurologist, Dr. Lawrence Ver Hoef will review the MRI&#xD;
      scans for incidental findings.&#xD;
