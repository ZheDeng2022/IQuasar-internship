    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective paper is to make a comparison between laparoscopic and&#xD;
      opening approaches in ventral hernia repair, taking into account absence of recurrence in&#xD;
      long - time (5 years), results centered at patient, especially satisfaction with expectations&#xD;
      and improvement of normal physical activity, morbidity that particular form must include&#xD;
      chronic pain, adjusted mortality through co-morbidities and, finally, prospective expenses,&#xD;
      related to both effectiveness and utility&#xD;

      Population: 130 patients, diagnosed with clinic and radiologic (abdominal wall CT scan)&#xD;
      ventral hernia, were recruited, after expressing their willingness, for either laparoscopic&#xD;
      or laparotomy repair to be conducted at Infanta Elena Hospital, Huelva (Spain), between&#xD;
      January 2005 and October 2008. Recruitment criteria were: patients above 18 years old,&#xD;
      diagnosed with primary or incisional ventral hernia, including recurrent ones, featuring a&#xD;
      prior-to-operation estimated size from 20 to 225 cm2. Exclusion criteria included type 4 or 5&#xD;
      of ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologist), to suffer from a disease limiting lifespan to&#xD;
      less than 2 years, cirrhotic ascites, emergency surgery or any complication as intestinal&#xD;
      obstruction, strangulated hernia, peritonitis, local or systemic infection, failure of&#xD;
      patient to ensure an at least 2 years follow-up or abandonment protocol. Every patient was&#xD;
      fully informed and signed his willingness. Defect sizes were estimated and classified&#xD;
      following Chevrel Classification. Patients were assigned a randomly generated number (see&#xD;
      validated and published tables), meaning both laparoscopic or open repair, and informed same&#xD;
      morning of operation. All operations were conducted by experienced surgeons. Protocol was&#xD;
      approved by Local Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were given an heparin prophylactic dose to prevent thromboembolic events evening&#xD;
      prior to operation-day, as well as 1500 mg cefuroxime intravenous (IV) during anesthetic&#xD;
      induction (in case of allergy, 600 mg of clindamycin IV + 80 mg of gentamicin IV). Also,&#xD;
      evening before intervention-day all patients filled in survey (SF-36 questionnaire). Skin was&#xD;
      prepared with an alcoholic solution of clorhexidine. Surgical pain was treated with magnesium&#xD;
      metamizole (2gr IV each 6 hours). Upon patient request, 100 mg of tramadol IV was added (a&#xD;
      maximum amount of 400 mg). Every patient was encouraged to hang around as soon as possible&#xD;
      and be on a diet 8 hours after surgery, supplying oral treatment from then onwards. On&#xD;
      discharge, patients were recommended wearing an abdominal binder for a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic repair: Pneumoperitoneum was performed to 12 mmHg after placement first 12 mm&#xD;
      trocar at level of umbilicus in anterior axillary line. Subsequently are placed two 5 mm&#xD;
      auxiliary trocars. In all cases we explore entire abdominal wall for other defects not&#xD;
      detected preoperatively. Herniary contents and sac are reduced releasing adhesions with&#xD;
      diathermy or harmonic scalpel. Defects are repaired with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)&#xD;
      patch (Dual Mesh; W.L Gore and Associates, FlagstaV, AZ USA) with double crown fixation as&#xD;
      technique of Carbajo et al, ensuring exceed 3 cm edge of defect, using 5mm tackers (Protack,&#xD;
      Autosuture; Tyco Healthcare, USA), reducing intrabdominal pressure to 8 mmHg. Not abdominal&#xD;
      drainage was used. Skin was closed with metal staples. All operations were performed by&#xD;
      experienced surgeons, over than 40 laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open repair: Incision was made over hernia defect, reducing herniary contents by opening sac&#xD;
      if it is necessary. We made 4 cm soft tissue flaps around edge of defect depending on&#xD;
      available healthy fascial tissue. In all cases we use Chevrel technique with fascial closure&#xD;
      using anterior rectus sheath with continuous and absorbable suture and placement of&#xD;
      polypropylene mesh (Parietene, standart polypropylene mesh, Covidien, Norwalk, CT) in an&#xD;
      onlay position fixed with polypropylene suture. We used one or two suction drains below&#xD;
      subcutaneous flap which was sutured with absorbable suture, and metallic skin staples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      A given follow-up was always conducted by same researcher before hospital discharge, after 30&#xD;
      days, 60 days, a year and once a year thereafter. All postoperative reports were analyzed&#xD;
      with aim of finding protocol deviations or intraoperative complications. At hospital&#xD;
      follow-up, before discharge, complications were actively looked (seroma, hematoma, wound&#xD;
      infection, prolonged ileus, urinary retention and medical complications such as stroke,&#xD;
      respiratory failure, arrhythmia, deep vein thrombosis, adverse drug reaction or pneumonia),&#xD;
      hospital stay was achieved and onset of walking. Patient-centered outcomes analyzed were pain&#xD;
      measured by visual analogue scale (VAS), addition to daily physical activity, analysis of&#xD;
      quality of life related to health by surveys after 2 and 5 days (CVP-CG questionnaire) and&#xD;
      difference between preoperative values, at 3 months and 12 months of physical and mental&#xD;
      construct by survey (SF-36 questionnaire). At follow-up after discharge several facts were&#xD;
      taken as exhibiting a satisfactory evolution, among them absence of hernia recurrence&#xD;
      (defined as clinic examination and radiologic non-defect abdominal wall), absence of symptoms&#xD;
      related to disability (chronic pain, intermittent ileus, trocar site hernia, fistula, abscess&#xD;
      or prosthesis extrusion) and also absence of readmission or reoperation due to hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expenses spent in ventral hernia repair were calculated from viewpoint of funder (health&#xD;
      costs), taking into account only direct expenses and discarding indirect and intangible ones,&#xD;
      as nearly all patients were economically assisted during convalescence period. Euro currency&#xD;
      was used and a prospective approach to costs analysis was employed, following&#xD;
      cost-opportunity method. As in-hospital expenses following variables were used materials,&#xD;
      such as prosthesis, sutures, trocars, drainages and other surgical instruments; preoperative,&#xD;
      anesthetics and postoperative medication (included recommended at discharge); operation room&#xD;
      personnel cost and hospital wards; cost of diagnostic tests performed and consumption of&#xD;
      hospitality. Installation costs, equipment inventoried and cost of warehousing and inventory&#xD;
      management of consumables were neglected. As extra-hospital costs following items were&#xD;
      included: personnel and materials used in medical visits and cures, drugs not prescribed,&#xD;
      travel costs in medical transports, totality of which generated as a consequence of&#xD;
      convalescence period (up to 60 days). Finally, expenses produced by a new hospital stay or&#xD;
      reoperation because of complicated issues within two years after hernia repair were&#xD;
      estimated, according to direct hospital costs at the beginning of study and further added to&#xD;
      hospital expenses. As expenditure variable we use average patient cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 130 patients was considered in order to detect differences in morbidity or&#xD;
      an increase in hospital stays of 20%, assuming a type I error of 5%, powder of 80%, with&#xD;
      losses of 10% and 2% crosslinking. To confirm normality Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was employed.&#xD;
      Discrete variables are presented as percentage and confidence intervals of 95% and were&#xD;
      compared through either Pearson test or Fisher exact test. Quantitative variables are&#xD;
      depicted as mean values and standard deviations confidence intervals 95% using Student's t&#xD;
      test. In all cases analysis was by intention of treat including in laparoscopic group those&#xD;
      patients that required conversion to laparotomy. Also, an incremental cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      analysis with confidence intervals of 95% was conducted, following Fieller theorem, and for&#xD;
      sensibility analysis inversion cross-point was taken (threshold analysis). As efficiency&#xD;
      measure a clinic profit analysis was carried out by means of a composite analysis that&#xD;
      integrates absence of recurrence, readmission, reoperation or disability. As an indirect&#xD;
      measure of utility is used values obtained from questionnaires (HRQOL -Health Related Quality&#xD;
      Of Life), assuming standard mean response in case of SF-36 and mean response standardized by&#xD;
      standard deviation of difference in case of CVP-CG instruments between two types of repairs&#xD;
      as well as effect size between preoperative value and postoperative one in case of SF-36.&#xD;
      choice of measurement of HRQOL as a measure of utility was made under requirement that in&#xD;
      absence of clinically relevant differences in mortality, recurrence or morbidity, a&#xD;
      clinically relevant difference in HRQOL is a preference by patient and thus a choice between&#xD;
      treatment alternatives. A minimum significance level of 0.05 was assumed. Every analysis was&#xD;
      conducted by blinded statistician through statistical package (SPSS statistical program,&#xD;
      version 11.5, SPSS Inc, Chicago).&#xD;
