    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to learn how different doses of LY2624803 affect sleep in healthy&#xD;
      people. The study has four treatment periods. Participants will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      LY2624803, another sleeping pill, or placebo in each treatment period. The study will last&#xD;
      approximately 1 month for each participant.&#xD;
