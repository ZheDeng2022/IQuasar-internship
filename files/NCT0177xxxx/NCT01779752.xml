  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In human, the cerebral cortex forms a network of vestibular cortical areas which functional&#xD;
      role remains unknown. In patients with localised cortical lesions the investigator has&#xD;
      previously demonstrated that the parieto-temporal cortex could regulate the inertial&#xD;
      component of the vestibulo-ocular (VOR) responses whereas more ventral regions including the&#xD;
      temporo-occipital cortex would be associated with gain regulation of these VOR responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's main purpose is to investigate the modalities of vestibular integration in&#xD;
      these posterior parieto-temporal et temporo-occipital cortical regions. Thus, by using&#xD;
      repetitive ttranscranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) the investigator will induce a&#xD;
      transitory inhibition of one of these 2 cortical regions and register its effect on VOR&#xD;
      responses. Based on theta burst stimulation (TBS) paradigm, the investigator will stimulate&#xD;
      the region of interest by applying on the scalp repetitive burst (at 50 HZ) during 44sec.&#xD;
      Then, during the consecutive cortical inhibition lasting for the 15 minutes poststimulation,&#xD;
      the investigator will record the subject's VOR responses. The VOR gain will be calculated and&#xD;
      the time constant and phase will provide an estimation of the inertial component of the VOR&#xD;
      responses. The healthy subjects recruited on the basis of inclusion criteria during medical&#xD;
      examination will be divided into two groups of 20 subjects each depending of their sites of&#xD;
      stimulation, temporo-parietal or temporo-occipital. Each subject will perform three&#xD;
      experimental sessions (of 1h in average each) separated by at least one week and&#xD;
      corresponding to : (1) the right cortical stimulation, (2) the left stimulation and (3) the&#xD;
      vertex stimulation serving as the control session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TMS paradigm is used in routine in hospital and research field and had very few negative&#xD;
      consequences (mainly transitory and occasional headache).&#xD;
