      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and therapeutic effects of transplantation&#xD;
      of escalating doses of autologous cultured mesenchymal bone marrow stromal cells secreting&#xD;
      neurotrophic factors (MSC-NTF), in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIa prospective, open label, dose-escalating, three patient-group clinical&#xD;
      study, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of autologous cultured&#xD;
      mesenchymal bone marrow stromal cells secreting neurotrophic factors (MSC-NTF), as a potent&#xD;
      treatment for patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) at the early disease stages.&#xD;
      This study is a single center trial. It is anticipated that the study will be conducted at&#xD;
      the Department of Neurology &amp; Laboratory of Neuroimmunology, at the Hadassah Hebrew&#xD;
      University Medical Center, Jerusalem in Israel. In addition, ALS patients could also be&#xD;
      referred to the clinical site above by other medical centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to study&#xD;
      enrollment. Patients diagnosed as early stage ALS disease with duration of less than 2 years.&#xD;
      ALS patients identified as &quot;predisposed&quot; will be approached and requested to sign an Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form (ICF). Overall, 14 patients will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will start with the lowest dose (94x106 cells) and the dose will be increased to&#xD;
      the next medium and high dose (141x106 and 188x106 respectively), for the next patients group&#xD;
      only following safety analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of patient screening period prior to enrollment into this study is&#xD;
      in-between two weeks up to 2 days prior to the study enrollment day during visit 2&#xD;
      (verification of compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria including clinical laboratory&#xD;
      results). Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and will be observed for every&#xD;
      month during a &quot;run in period&quot; of 3 months for determination of the progression rate of the&#xD;
      disease (allowing a time window of ± 5 days for all visits). During the &quot;run in period&quot; after&#xD;
      about 6 weeks following enrollment, patients of both study groups will undergo a Bone Marrow&#xD;
      Aspiration (BMA) procedure and MSC-NTF cells will be produced from the bone marrow aspirate&#xD;
      based on Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd proprietary method. On the last &quot;run in period&quot;&#xD;
      visit, patients will undergo the treatment and MSC-NTF will be transplanted by IM+IT to the&#xD;
      early ALS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the MSC-NTF transplantation patients will be observed on a monthly basis for a post&#xD;
      treatment follow up period of 6 months (allowing a time window of ± 5 days for all visits).&#xD;
      Treatment safety, adverse events and exploratory parameters, to establish ALS progression&#xD;
      rate assessment of the disease will be recorded throughout the duration of the &quot;run in&#xD;
      period&quot; and the post treatment follow up period.&#xD;
