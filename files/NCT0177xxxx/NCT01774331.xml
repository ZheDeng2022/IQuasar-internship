      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Demonstrate the utility of a new electronic data capture (EDC) system (CareExchange™) using&#xD;
      infusion nurse measured physical, quality of life (QOL), respiratory, and disability&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) dose effects measured outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in IVIg dose and timing effects measured outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in patient status is reflected in measured outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the value to physicians from infusion nurse collected outcomes data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify types of patients by response to IVIg therapy (i.e. natural or poor&#xD;
           responders).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in response rate to IVIg therapy by disease state and demographics.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, observational evaluation of immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy in consenting&#xD;
      adult and assenting pediatric subjects who receive infusion services from BriovaRx Infusion&#xD;
      Services, (Formerly AxelaCare Health Solutions, LLC). Subjects meeting all inclusion criteria&#xD;
      who have provided informed consent/assent for trial participation will have validated,&#xD;
      physician-prescribed, and standard-of-care outcome measures recorded during normal home&#xD;
      infusion visits. Collected data will be de-identified and aggregated into cohorts of like&#xD;
      diagnosis for trend analysis.&#xD;
