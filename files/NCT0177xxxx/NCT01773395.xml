      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention, in this&#xD;
      case, the GVAX vaccine, works in preventing your MDS, CMML, or AML from relapsing after your&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the vaccine is still being&#xD;
      studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the side&#xD;
      effects it may cause, and if the vaccine is effective. It also means that the FDA has not yet&#xD;
      approved the vaccine for your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are being asked to participate in this trial because you have advanced myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome (MDS), Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Your&#xD;
      doctor has determined that you are a candidate for an allogeneic stem cell transplant as&#xD;
      treatment for your MDS/CMML/AML. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a standard treatment&#xD;
      for MDS/CMML/AML. It can be effective because the cells from your donor (also known as the&#xD;
      graft) could form a new immune system that can fight against the MDS/CMML/AML cells in your&#xD;
      body. This is also known as the &quot;graft-versus-leukemia&quot; or &quot;GVL&quot; effect. In patients with&#xD;
      advanced MDS, CMML, or AML that is not in remission at the time of transplantation, as in&#xD;
      your case, relapse remains the number one cause of transplant failure. As such, this clinical&#xD;
      trial is designed to assess whether adding a leukemia vaccine early after transplantation&#xD;
      could stimulate donor cells to fight your cancer and improve transplant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have discovered that GVAX, a&#xD;
      vaccine made from the patient's own cancer cells engineered to produce a protein called&#xD;
      GM-CSF, can be effective in stimulating a powerful immune response specific to that cancer.&#xD;
      GM-CSF is a naturally occurring hormone in the body that helps the immune system fight&#xD;
      infections and diseases. The GVAX vaccine is made in the laboratory by using a virus (called&#xD;
      adenovirus, which has been modified so it cannot cause illness) to insert the GM-CSF gene&#xD;
      into tumor cells. The cells are then irradiated, which prevents them from being able to grow,&#xD;
      before being administered to patients in a series of vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous phase I clinical trial using this GVAX vaccine in patients with MDS/AML after&#xD;
      allogeneic transplantation demonstrated that the GVAX vaccine is safe, and the survival&#xD;
      outcomes were encouraging. The current randomized phase II study will investigate this&#xD;
      vaccine further and gather more information to assess the activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you participate in this research study, you will be &quot;randomized&quot; to receive either GVAX&#xD;
      vaccination or placebo (a saline solution) vaccination. Randomization means that you are put&#xD;
      into a group by chance. It is like flipping a coin. There is a 50% chance that you will&#xD;
      receive the GVAX vaccine and a 50% chance you will receive placebo. Neither you nor your&#xD;
      transplant doctor(s) will know which you will be receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this trial is to assess if there will be a difference in the percentage&#xD;
      of cancer free survivors in the vaccinated vs. placebo group at 18 months after transplant.&#xD;

      This trial can be divided into four phases: 1) Pre-Transplant; 2) Allogeneic Transplant; 3)&#xD;
      Vaccination; and 4) Post-Vaccination Follow-Up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Pre-Transplant After signing the consent form you will undergo some screening tests&#xD;
      to find out if you can be in this research study. These tests include a medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, performance status, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, blood tests,&#xD;
      tuberculosis skin test, HLA antibody test, pregnancy test, urine test, ECHO, MUGA or RVG to&#xD;
      measure heart function, chest x-ray, pulmonary function tests and dental consult. If these&#xD;
      tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will be enrolled&#xD;
      on the trial and randomized to receive either the GVAX vaccine or the placebo vaccine after&#xD;
      your transplant. After enrolling in the study you will undergo additional research procedures&#xD;
      including a blood draw and leukemia cell collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Allogeneic Transplant The transplant phase of the study will begin when you are&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital to receive the chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. In the week&#xD;
      before you receive the stem cells, you will be treated with chemotherapy. The combination of&#xD;
      chemotherapy given before the donor cells are infused is called the conditioning regimen. The&#xD;
      chemotherapy conditioning is given to suppress your immune system so that the donor blood&#xD;
      stem cells will not be rejected after transplantation. The chemotherapy may also reduce the&#xD;
      number of MDS/CMML/AML cancer cells in your body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the condition regimen will include 2 chemotherapy drugs: busulfan (twice a day&#xD;
      or four times a day for 4 days) and fludarabine (once daily for 4 days). Depending on your&#xD;
      age and other clinical factors, your transplant doctor will decide whether you receive a&#xD;
      higher or lower dose of busulfan. Between 1-2 days after you finish the chemotherapy, you&#xD;
      will receive the blood stem cell or marrow from your donor. This is given as a transfusion&#xD;
      through a central intravenous line (IV usually placed in your chest or arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Just prior to and immediately following the infusion of stem cells, you will receive&#xD;
      medications to help prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a common complication of&#xD;
      transplant where your donor's immune cells attack your body. The medications you will receive&#xD;
      to prevent GVHD will include Tacrolimus and Methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be closely monitored as per standard transplant care after your stem cell&#xD;
      transplant. If you received the higher dose chemotherapy conditioning, you will stay in the&#xD;
      hospital for an average of about 3-4 weeks. If you received the lower dose conditioning&#xD;
      transplant, your hospital admission for transplant may be shorter depending on your clinical&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your stem cell infusion, you may receive daily injections of a medication called&#xD;
      rhGM-CSF, or Leukine, to help your white blood cells to recover faster. You may receive this&#xD;
      medication for up to 2 weeks. You will also be given antiviral and antibiotic medications to&#xD;
      prevent infections as per standard practice after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 20 to 30 days after your stem cell infusion you will have a physical examination,&#xD;
      routine blood work and a blood draw for future immune tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 30 to 60 days after your transplant you will return to clinic for a visit that will&#xD;
      include a physical examination, routine blood work, a blood draw for future immune tests and&#xD;
      a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate to assess your MDS/CMML/AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Vaccination You may begin receiving the GVAX or placebo vaccination between 30 to 60&#xD;
      days following your transplant, provided your blood counts have recovered, and you do not&#xD;
      have any severe side effects from the transplant. If by day 61, your blood counts have not&#xD;
      recovered sufficiently, or if you have developed side effects or GVHD from the transplant,&#xD;
      and do not meet the conditions necessary to start the vaccination portion of this trial, then&#xD;
      you will not receive any vaccinations and you will be removed from the study. You will&#xD;
      continue to receive standard post transplant care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are able to begin the vaccinations between day 30-60 after your transplant, the GVAX&#xD;
      or placebo vaccine will be administered as an injection under and into the skin on your&#xD;
      forearms or thighs, 6 times over a period of 9 weeks. The first 3 vaccinations will be&#xD;
      administered once a week for 3 consecutive weeks and the last 3 vaccines will be given once&#xD;
      every other week over 6 weeks. All vaccinations will be given either as an inpatient or&#xD;
      outpatient in the clinic. On the days you are receiving vaccination, you may have to wait&#xD;
      several hours in the clinic while the laboratory makes final preparations on the&#xD;
      vaccine/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this 9 week period of vaccination, you will continue to be followed by your doctor at&#xD;
      least on a weekly basis to monitor for any transplant or possible vaccine side effects.Two to&#xD;
      three days after the first and fifth vaccinations, we would encourage you (but do not require&#xD;
      you) to return to the clinic to have a skin biopsy of the GVAX/Placebo vaccination site,&#xD;
      especially if there is redness or swelling in the area. This will allow researchers to assess&#xD;
      whether your new immune system is reacting to the injected leukemia cells under the&#xD;
      microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, we will also be drawing your blood on a regular basis to&#xD;
      evaluate immune cells and the effect that the vaccinations may have on your new immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you tolerate the vaccinations well, and do not have GVHD or any severe side effects from&#xD;
      the transplant or the vaccinations, you will complete a total of 6 vaccines. However, your&#xD;
      vaccination may be terminated earlier if you develop any side effects (from transplant or&#xD;
      vaccination) that do not resolve/improve after 2 weeks, if you develop GVHD that requires&#xD;
      steroid treatment, or if your MDS/CMML/AML relapses and you need to receive more treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: Post Vaccination Follow-UP About 1 month after your last vaccination, you will have&#xD;
      a physical examination, blood work, immune bloods and bone marrow biopsy and aspirate to&#xD;
      assess the status of your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be followed at an appointment 6, 9, 12 and 18 months following your transplant with&#xD;
      physical examinations, blood work and immune bloods. At the 12 and 18 month visit you will&#xD;
      have a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate to assess the status of your AMLCMML//MDS.&#xD;
