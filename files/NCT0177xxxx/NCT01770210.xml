    <textblock>
      In western societies hypercholesterolemia is one of the major and independent factors that&#xD;
      predispose to cardiovascular disease and death from them. According to the clinical study&#xD;
      ATTICA, conducted during the years 2001-2002, in which randomized 1514 men and 1528 women,&#xD;
      rates of hypercholesterolemia observed in a sample of urban population was 39% for men and&#xD;
      37% women . The prevalence in the corresponding U.S. epidemiological study NIANES was 52% for&#xD;
      men and 49% women. The relationship between cholesterol, lipid-lowering therapy and risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease appears to be quite clear in the secondary prevention trials, the 4S&#xD;
      (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study), CARE (Cholesterol And Recurrent Events) and LIPID&#xD;
      (Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease) which showed the benefits of&#xD;
      lowering LDL cholesterol in patients with coronary artery disease. Despite these remarkable&#xD;
      results, studies were secondary prevention as a major shortcoming, the lack of patients with&#xD;
      acute coronary events. This gap came to cover the study MIRACL (Myocardial Ischemia Reduction&#xD;
      with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering). In MIRACL study , atorvastatin 80 mg was evaluated in&#xD;
      3,086 patients (atorvastatin n = 1.538, placebo n = 1.548), acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
      (myocardial infarction without Q-wave or unstable angina). Treatment was initiated during the&#xD;
      acute phase after hospital admission and lasted for a period of 16 weeks. Treatment with&#xD;
      atorvastatin 80 mg / day increased the latency of the combined primary endpoint, defined as&#xD;
      death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or angina&#xD;
      with objective evidence of myocardial ischemia requiring admission to hospital, indicating a&#xD;
      risk reduction of 16% (p = 0,048). This was mainly due to a 26% reduction in&#xD;
      re-hospitalization for angina with objective evidence of myocardial ischemia. The other&#xD;
      secondary endpoints were not statistically significant by themselves (total: placebo: 22.2%,&#xD;
      Atorvastatin: 22.4%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins by reducing coronary syndromes, it appears that contribute to reducing the incidence&#xD;
      of cardiovascular diseases. This is exactly what was observed in 4S, in which the incidence&#xD;
      of chronic heart failure (CHF) during follow-up was 10.3% for those who received placebo and&#xD;
      8.3% in the simvastatin group, a finding which translates 19% reduction in heart failure (P&#xD;
      &lt;0,015) nationwide with the appearance episode (event) CV.&#xD;

      Determination of cardiovascular risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the assessment of cardiovascular risk remains incomplete, can identify indicators that&#xD;
      measure risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Framingham Risk Score: Includes age, sex, total and HDL-CHOL, and levels of blood&#xD;
           pressure (can underestimate the risk in some patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PROCAM Risk Score: also includes triglycerides, fasting glucose tolerance and family&#xD;
           history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reynolds Risk Score: Includes family history and levels of hsCRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Greek Score (www.hearts.org / greece). People with low risk The Framingham Risk Score&#xD;
           shows &lt;10% chance of cardiovascular disease over the next 10 years. Dealing mainly with&#xD;
           healthy dietary intervention or drugs when the levels of LDL-CHOL&gt; 190 mg / dL or&#xD;
           atherogenic index (T-CHOL/HDL-CHOL)&gt; 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication is necessary in individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia to reduce the LDL&#xD;
      CHOL &lt;100 mg / dL. For this reason, a careful family history taking physical examination. The&#xD;
      Reynolds Risk Score may reclassify their low-risk patients at higher risk individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons moderate risk This group includes mostly middle-aged people. The Framingham Risk&#xD;
      Score shows 10-19% chance of cardiovascular disease over the next 10 years. However, a&#xD;
      positive family history and high hsCRP (if available) can modify the level of risk. These&#xD;
      people need to change my lifestyle for 3 months, but may then be necessary pharmacological&#xD;
      lipid-lowering therapy in people with at least two major risk factors and levels of LDL-CHOL&gt;&#xD;
      130 mg / dL. The administration of lipid-lowering therapy in people with levels of LDL-CHOL&#xD;
      100-129 mg / dL is recommended for people with multiple cardiometabolic risk factors&#xD;
      (visceral obesity, prediabetes, hypertension, etc.). The increase of atheromatic index (&gt; 5)&#xD;
      and the presence of high (&gt; 2 mg / L) levels of CRP (if available) are also indications for&#xD;
      lipid lowering regardless of the levels of LDL-CHOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major risk factors: age&gt; 45 years (men),&gt; 55 years (women), positive family history of&#xD;
      premature cardiovascular disease [in the presence of major vascular events in first degree&#xD;
      relatives &lt;55 years (men), &lt;65 years (women)], hypertension , HDL-CHOL &lt;40 mg / dL, smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals at high risk The Framingham Risk Score shows&gt; 20% chance of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease over the next 10 years. At-risk individuals include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Individuals with documented atherosclerotic disease (coronary artery disease, stroke, a&#xD;
      significant degree of carotid stenosis, peripheral arterial disease, intermittent&#xD;
      claudication, or aneurysm of the abdominal aorta).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. All type II diabetic patients and patients with type I diabetes individuals older than 40&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. People with chronic kidney disease with glomerular filtration (GFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1, 73 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these individuals need intensive lifestyle modification and direct administration lipid&#xD;
      lowering medication such as statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the above that one epidemiological study nature that has the purpose of&#xD;
      observing and recording the progress of patients after their exit from a cardiology clinic or&#xD;
      hospital unit because the acid after a cardiovascular event has clinical relevance.&#xD;
      Compliance with medical instructions, achieving treatment goals for lipids by the addition of&#xD;
      atorvastatin and personalized medicine practice are open field study. So this will be the&#xD;
      subject of this study in order to highlight the clinical significance of atorvastatin in&#xD;
      achieving the objectives of lipids (mainly LDL-CHOL) in blood plasma of &quot;sensitive&quot; of this&#xD;
      group of patients in the Greek population, as possible representative (qualitatively and&#xD;
      quantitatively)sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyslipidemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lipids of the human body is cholesterol (useful for the synthesis of cell membranes,&#xD;
      hormones adrenal and gonads, and is a component of bile, the liver secretes) and&#xD;
      triglycerides (serve as fuel and energy storage in adipose tissue ). The dyslipidemias are&#xD;
      disorders (quantitative or qualitative) of the metabolism of lipoprotein particles (LDL,&#xD;
      chylomicrons, HDL, VLDL) that transport lipids in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categories dyslipidemias - Primary dyslipidemias&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most significant primary lipid disorders are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Chylomicronemia (congenital or acquired): ↑ TRG → risk of acute pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Familial Hypercholesterolemia a Homozygous (1/1.000.000 people): ↑ LDL CHOL b&#xD;
           heterozygous (1/500 people): ↑ LDL CHOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mixed hyperlipidaemia Familial mixed (1/300 people): ↑ LDL-CHOL, ↑ TRG, ↓ HDL-CHOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Familial hypertriglyceridemia (1/2.000 people): ↑ TRG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Familial decrease in HDL CHOL: ↓ HDL CHOL. Typically in patients with primary&#xD;
           dyslipidemia needed medication. - Secondary dyslipidemias&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with abnormal lipid parameters of must exclude secondary dyslipidemias, ie&#xD;
      disorders of lipid metabolism caused by diseases or drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diabetes&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Chronic kidney disease nephrotic syndrome-&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Obesity&#xD;

&#xD;
      Statins - Atorvastatin&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cornerstone of treatment of dyslipidemia are statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before initiation of lipid lowering requires the identification of lipid parameters {total&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and calculated LDL cholesterol [from the equation&#xD;
      LDL-CHOL = total cholesterol - (triglycerides / 5 + HDL cholesterol)]} after fasting 12 - 14&#xD;
      hours, while the determination of glucose levels of TSH (to exclude underlying&#xD;
      hypothyroidism) and transaminases (AST / ALT) and CPK to control the undesirable effects.&#xD;
      Repeat determination of these parameters in patients who achieved their goals of treatment 2&#xD;
      times a year or when changing the therapeutic regimen. Repeat laboratory tests (lipid control&#xD;
      effectiveness and liver enzymes and CPK for security control) after 12 weeks: a reason to&#xD;
      discontinue treatment if ALT&gt; 3 times the upper normal range or CPK&gt; 5 times the upper normal&#xD;
      range or in patients with myalgias. It should be noted that not necessitate interruption of&#xD;
      treatment with statins or deferral of treatment in individuals with small increases in&#xD;
      transaminases or CPK, while in these patients should be seeking other underlying causes of&#xD;
      elevated liver and muscle enzymes. The choice of drug and dosage depend on the percentage&#xD;
      change in HDL-CHOL necessary to achieve the objectives. Statins are usually the evening&#xD;
      before bedtime the night. The lipid-lowering therapy is therapy for life, and most&#xD;
      importantly, the patient adherence to treatment. It should be noted that doubling the dose of&#xD;
      a statin results in additional reduction of HDL-CHOL (LDL) cholesterol by 6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of treatment is to reduce HDL-CHOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non HDL-CHOL (= T-CHOL - HDL-CHOL), proposed as a secondary target of lipid lowering&#xD;
      mainly in people with high triglycerides. The target for the non HDL-CHOL is 30 mg / dL&#xD;
      higher than the target for the HDL-CHOL. The decrease in triglycerides (&lt;150 mg / dL) and&#xD;
      increased HDL-CHOL (&gt; 40 mg / dL for men and&gt; 50 mg / dL for women) is considered desirable&#xD;
      targets mainly lipid lowering in diabetic patients and in patients with cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      factors. Has also been suggested as a target of treatment to reduce the atheromatous index&#xD;
      (T-CHOL/HDL-CHOL &lt;4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atorvastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol,&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and triglycerides in adults, adolescents and children aged&#xD;
      10 years and older with primary hypercholesterolaemia, including heterozygous familial&#xD;
      hypercholesterolaemia combined (mixed) hyperlipidemia (type IIa and IIv by Fredrickson), when&#xD;
      response to diet and other nonpharmacological measures is inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atorvastatin is also indicated to reduce total cholesterol and LDL - cholesterol in adults&#xD;
      with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering&#xD;
      treatments (eg LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is also used to prevent cardiovascular events in adult patients who are thought to have a&#xD;
      high risk for a first cardiovascular event, as an adjunct to correction of other risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme&#xD;
      responsible for the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a&#xD;
      precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. The triglycerides and cholesterol in the liver&#xD;
      are incorporated into very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and released into the plasma for&#xD;
      delivery to peripheral tissues. The low density lipoprotein (LDL) is formed from VLDL and is&#xD;
      catabolized primarily through receptor high affinity to LDL (LDL receptor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atorvastatin lowers cholesterol levels and lipoprotein plasma inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase&#xD;
      and then the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the liver and increase the number of LDL&#xD;
      receptors on the surface of liver cells which uptake and catabolism of LDL. Atorvastatin&#xD;
      reduces LDL production and the number of particles of LDL. H atorvastatin causes profound and&#xD;
      sustained increase of LDL receptor activity, in combination with a beneficial change in the&#xD;
      quality of the circulating particles of LDL. Atorvastatin effectively reduces LDL-C in&#xD;
      patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a group of patients who do not&#xD;
      usually respond to lipid-lowering medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atorvastatin in a dose-response study, was shown to reduce the concentration of T-CHOL (30% -&#xD;
      46%), the LDL-CHOL (41% - 61%), apolipoprotein B (34% - 50%) and triglycerides (14% - 33%)&#xD;
      while producing variable increases HDL-CHOL and apolipoprotein A1. These results are so&#xD;
      consistent in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, non-familial forms&#xD;
      of hypercholesterolemia and mixed hyperlipidemia, including patients with&#xD;
      noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been found that the decrease of the values of total cholesterol, LDL-CHOL and&#xD;
      apolipoprotein B reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality thereof.&#xD;
