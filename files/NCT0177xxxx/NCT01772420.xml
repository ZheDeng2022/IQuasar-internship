      This phase II trial studies how well lenalidomide and eltrombopag olamine works in treating&#xD;
      patients with symptomatic anemia in low or intermediate myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;
      Lenalidomide may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from&#xD;
      growing. Eltrombopag olamine may increase the number of white blood cells and platelets found&#xD;
      in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Giving lenalidomide and eltrombopag olamine may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the rate of hematologic improvement of the eltrombopag (eltrombopag&#xD;
      olamine)/lenalidomide combination (as per Modified International Working Group [IWG]&#xD;
      criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the time to hematologic improvement. II. To evaluate the duration of&#xD;
      hematologic improvement III. To evaluate the effect of combination treatment on platelet&#xD;
      counts, platelet transfusions and bleeding events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the frequency of bone marrow response (complete response [CR] + partial&#xD;
      response [PR]) and cytogenetic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the relationship between mutations in bone marrow stem cells and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate the relationship between various stem and progenitor alterations and&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients with platelet counts &gt;= 50,000 receive lenalidomide orally (PO) daily or&#xD;
      every other day (QOD) on days 1-21. If platelet counts fall below 50,000, patients&#xD;
      discontinue lenalidomide and receive eltrombopag olamine PO daily or QOD until platelet count&#xD;
      is maintained above 50,000 for 2 weeks. Patients then resume lenalidomide PO daily or QOD. If&#xD;
      platelets fall below 50,000 again, patients receive eltrombopag olamine as before. When&#xD;
      platelet counts are maintained above 50,000 for 2 weeks, patients resume lenalidomide&#xD;
      concurrently with eltrombopag for all subsequent courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients with platelet counts &lt; 50,000 receive eltrombopag olamine PO daily or QOD on&#xD;
      days 1-28 until platelet counts is maintained above 50,000 for 2 weeks. Patients then receive&#xD;
      treatment as in Arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then every 12 months for 5 years.&#xD;

          -  Patients must have International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) categories of low-&#xD;
             or intermediate-1-risk disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have symptomatic anemia untransfused with hemoglobin =&lt; 9.5 g/dL within&#xD;
             8 weeks of registration or with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependence (i.e., &gt;=&#xD;
             2 units/month) confirmed for a minimum of 8 weeks before randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have IPSS score determined by cytogenetic analysis prior to&#xD;
             randomization; patients with cytogenetic failure and =&lt; 10% marrow blasts will be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be off all disease modifying therapy for MDS for 28 days prior to&#xD;
             initiation of study treatment; patients may receive hydrocortisone prophylactically to&#xD;
             prevent transfusion reactions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have documented iron deficiency; all patients must have documented&#xD;
             marrow iron stores; if marrow iron stain is not available, the transferrin saturation&#xD;
             must be &gt;= 20% or a serum ferritin &gt;= 100 ng/100 mL or soluble transferring receptor &lt;&#xD;
             5 mg/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding; females of childbearing potential should&#xD;
             have 2 negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL); the first test&#xD;
             should be performed within 10-14 days, and the second test within 24 hours prior to&#xD;
             prescribing lenalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of reproductive potential must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as&#xD;
             required in the Revlimid REMS® program; able to take aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily as&#xD;
             prophylactic anticoagulation (patients intolerant to acetylsalicylic acid [ASA] may&#xD;
             use warfarin or low molecular weight heparin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must agree to use 2 methods&#xD;
             of an accepted and effective method of contraception and counseled on the potential&#xD;
             teratogenic effects of lenalidomide; effective contraception must be used by patients&#xD;
             for at least 4 weeks before beginning lenalidomide therapy, during lenalidomide&#xD;
             therapy, during dose interruptions and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of&#xD;
             lenalidomide therapy; reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a&#xD;
             history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy or because the patient has been&#xD;
             postmenopausal naturally for at least 24 consecutive months; two reliable forms of&#xD;
             contraception must be used simultaneously unless continuous abstinence from&#xD;
             heterosexual sexual contact is the chosen method; females of childbearing potential&#xD;
             should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed;&#xD;
             sexually mature females who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been&#xD;
             postmenopausal naturally for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., who have had menses&#xD;
             at some time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) are considered to be females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential; it is not known whether CC-5013 (lenalidomide) is present in&#xD;
             the semen of patients receiving the drug; therefore, males receiving CC-5013&#xD;
             (lenalidomide) must always use a latex condom during any sexual contact with females&#xD;
             of childbearing potential even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has signed and dated informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prothrombin time (PT/international normalized ratio [INR]) and activated partial&#xD;
             thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be within 80 to 120% of the normal range at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             Heart Association [NYHA] grade III/IV), or arrhythmia known to increase the risk of&#xD;
             thromboembolic events (e.g. atrial fibrillation), or subjects with a corrected QT&#xD;
             interval (QTc) &gt; 450 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients determined to be at increased risk of arterial or venous thrombosis by the&#xD;

             chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test) at screening or pre-dose on day 1&#xD;

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             longer) preceding the first dose of study medication&#xD;
