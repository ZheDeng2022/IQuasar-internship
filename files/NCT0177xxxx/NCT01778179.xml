    <description>This assessment was made using a narrowband reﬂectance spectrophotometer (Mexameter MX18®, Courage-Khazaka, Germany). The measurement is based on absorption/reflection. The probe of the Mexameter® MX 18 emits three specific light wavelengths. A receiver measures the light reflected by the skin. As the quantity of emitted light is defined, the quantity of light absorbed by the skin can be calculated. The melanin is measured by two specific wavelengths (red: 660 nm and near infrared: 880 nm) chosen to correspond to different absorption rates by the pigments.&#xD;
The quantification of melanin is presented as a value that varies from 0-999. The higher the value, the larger is the amount of melanin on the skin.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Melanin Levels</title>
        <description>This assessment was made using a narrowband reﬂectance spectrophotometer (Mexameter MX18®, Courage-Khazaka, Germany). The measurement is based on absorption/reflection. The probe of the Mexameter® MX 18 emits three specific light wavelengths. A receiver measures the light reflected by the skin. As the quantity of emitted light is defined, the quantity of light absorbed by the skin can be calculated. The melanin is measured by two specific wavelengths (red: 660 nm and near infrared: 880 nm) chosen to correspond to different absorption rates by the pigments.&#xD;
The quantification of melanin is presented as a value that varies from 0-999. The higher the value, the larger is the amount of melanin on the skin.</description>
