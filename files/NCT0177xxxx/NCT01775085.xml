  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two types of groups for breast cancer survivors: a&#xD;
      Meaning-Centered Group and a Discussion Group. Many breast cancer survivors seek help to deal&#xD;
      with the emotional burden of having gone through the cancer experience. Participation in&#xD;
      groups offering support often helps cancer survivors cope with stressors of life after having&#xD;
      had cancer by giving them a place to express their feelings. The &quot;Meaning-Centered Group&quot; is&#xD;
      intended to teach breast cancer survivors how to maintain or even increase a sense of meaning&#xD;
      and purpose in their lives after treatment for cancer. The &quot;Discussion Group&quot; is intended to&#xD;
      help breast cancer survivors cope by giving them a place to get support from other breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to compare the benefits of these two types of group approaches for&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors. The study is also testing the benefits and feasibility of conducting&#xD;
      the groups virtually using a telephone and computer.&#xD;

    <description>DG is a standardized, manualized group developed by the MSKCC Psychiatry Service and utilized in a similar form in our completed and ongoing RCTs of MCGP. Based on models described by Rogers and Bloch, the essential components include reassurance, explanation, education, encouragement, and permission for expression. The process emphasizes Rogerian concepts (e.g., empathic understanding) and avoids techniques that are not exclusively supportive. The content focuses on education about here-and-now topics relevant to BCS (e.g., maintaining and eliciting social support, financial strains, return to work, physical symptom management), allowing emotional expression and discussion of difficult topics.</description>
