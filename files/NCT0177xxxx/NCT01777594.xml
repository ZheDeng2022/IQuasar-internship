  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common type of cancer worldwide and the&#xD;
      third most common cause of death from cancer. Sorafenib is the only approved therapy for&#xD;
      treatment of advanced HCC, and there is a need to identify more drugs that are beneficial for&#xD;
      these patients without unacceptable side effects. Prodrug chemotherapy is an approach in&#xD;
      which an inactive non-toxic agent is administered to the patient and gets activated within&#xD;
      the body at specific locations, resulting in a higher concentration of the cytotoxic form at&#xD;
      a tumor location while avoiding general side effects. G-202 (mipsagargin) is an example of&#xD;
      prodrug chemotherapy. It is activated by Prostate Specific Memory Antigen (PSMA), which is&#xD;
      expressed by some cancer cells and in the blood vessels of most solid tumors, but not by&#xD;
      normal cells or blood vessels in normal tissue. It is believed that activation of the prodrug&#xD;
      G-202 will allow the drug to kill cancer cells. This study will evaluate the activity and&#xD;
      safety of G-202 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have progressed after taking&#xD;
      sorafenib. The study will evaluate clinical activity and safety of G-202 administered by&#xD;
      intravenous infusion on three consecutive days of a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
