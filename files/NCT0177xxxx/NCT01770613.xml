      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of human allogeneic&#xD;
      mesenchymal bone marrow cells (aMBMC) administered intravenously to subjects with ST Segment&#xD;
      Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite&#xD;
      continuing advances in various treatment options. In developed countries, ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease causes more than 50% of all cardiovascular deaths. It is estimated that one in three&#xD;
      or approximately 80 million American adults have one or more types of CVD, with approximately&#xD;
      38.1 million of those estimated to be 60 years of age or older. The data was extrapolated to&#xD;
      the United States population in 2006 from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&#xD;
      (NHANES) 2005-2006 data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality data show CVD as the underlying cause of death (including congenital cardiovascular&#xD;
      defects) accounting for 35.3% (864,480) of all 2,448,017 deaths in 2005, or one of every 2.8&#xD;
      deaths in the United States. CVD total deaths (1,372,000 deaths in 2005) accounted for about&#xD;
      56% of all deaths in 2005. Nearly 2,400 Americans die of CVD each day, an average of one&#xD;
      death every 30 seconds. CVD claims about as many lives each year as cancer, chronic lower&#xD;
      respiratory diseases, accidents, and diabetes mellitus combined (NCHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell transplantation has the potential to repair and improve cardiac function, thus&#xD;
      helping to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality rates. Preclinical data from a&#xD;
      variety of animal studies demonstrated the capacity for skeletal myoblasts to engraft, form&#xD;
      myotubules, and enhance cardiac function after transplantation into infarcted myocardium. The&#xD;
      underlying sequela of the post infarcted left ventricle often includes massive damage to the&#xD;
      cardiomyocyte. The left ventricle remodeling (dilation) and dysfunction is thought to be&#xD;
      irreversible. The development of treatments that will regenerate its musculature and vascular&#xD;
      components is now considered a main therapeutic challenge. Preliminary human studies focusing&#xD;
      on subjects with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated successful myoblast transplantation&#xD;
      into the post infarction scar. Another study demonstrated the benefits of stem cell therapy&#xD;
      on ventricular function and profusion. Dib et. al., demonstrated the survival, feasibility,&#xD;
      and safety of autologous myoblast transplantation and suggests that stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      offers a potential therapeutic treatment for end-stage heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different&#xD;
      indications. These clinical trials demonstrated the safety of allogeneic mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cell treatment. Allogenic mesenchymal bone marrow cells can be isolated from bone marrow.&#xD;
      They are the primary cells used in tissue engineering expressing multiple cell types. Tissue&#xD;
      engineering is very promising, generating hope that reconstruction of organs and repair&#xD;
      diseased and damaged tissue may be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two major types of aMBMC, hematopoetic (mononuclear) and stromal MSCs. Stromal&#xD;
      MBMC, the cell type to be used in this study, proved to be more effective in reestablishing&#xD;
      profusion as they secreted additional cytokine factors associated with angiogenesis. The&#xD;
      multilineage potential of stromal MSCs, their ability to elude detection by the host immune&#xD;
      system and even down regulate T-cell response allows for allogeneic multiple stem cell&#xD;
      therapeutic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occlusion of the left main or left anterior descending artery causes irreversible injury to&#xD;
      the cardiomyocytes in as little as 20 minutes. The goal of therapy in ischemic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      is to limit damage in the following areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limit infarct size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevent reperfusion injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevent excessive fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reestablish function of hibernating cardiomyocytes in peripheral zone area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preserve wall motion (prevent arrhythmia and functional contractile deterioration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevent post infarct ventricular remodeling and left ventricular dilation It is well&#xD;
           accepted that dilated cardiomyopathy mortality rates are 50% within 5 years of&#xD;
           diagnosis. If we can preserve and restore cardiac function as measured by ejection&#xD;
           fraction, preserving left ventricular integrity would increase subject quality of life&#xD;
           as well as longevity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An IV study administering adult allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to 53 subjects&#xD;
      following AMI showed excellent safety, reduction in arrhythmias, improvement in functional&#xD;
      status and increased ejection fraction. The availability of &quot;off the shelf&quot; allogeneic stem&#xD;
      cells will allow for an easily adjustable dose (getting enough cells in the autologous model&#xD;
      is often a problem) for each individual subject. The ease of IV administration will make stem&#xD;
      cell therapy more cost effective and safer to administer than the current catheter models.&#xD;
      This study protocol will expand on the safety and efficacy of aMBMC in subjects suffering&#xD;
      from ischemic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
