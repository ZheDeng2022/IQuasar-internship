    <textblock>
      Due to the development of neonatal intensive care the number of surviving premature infants&#xD;
      increased significantly. The immature brain undergoes a fair amount of external stimuli,&#xD;
      which have a great impact on later cognitive development. Increasingly data show, that a&#xD;
      delayed emergence of sleep-wake-cycling in newborns can be the first sign of brain injury.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that clearly defined sleep states can be identified from 31-32 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation onwards. But a few studies show, that also extremely premature infants already show&#xD;
      cyclical variations of the background pattern within amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG= a&#xD;
      time-compressed, simplified EEG) and conventional EEG. This might resemble early&#xD;
      sleep-wake-states and their presence correlates to the integrity of the central nervous&#xD;
      system, although no clearly defined &quot;sleep states&quot; according to the classical definition can&#xD;
      be identified. Complex EEG analysis needs the use of automated methods to exclude personal&#xD;
      bias and to ensure gestational age specific data analysis. The newly developed NLEO algorithm&#xD;
      was specially designed for EEG analysis of premature infants. Conventional EEG within this&#xD;
      study will be analyzed visually and with the automated algorithm. In our research project we&#xD;
      will study the emergence of Sleep-wake-cycling in extremely premature infants and its impact&#xD;
      on their neurodevelopmental outcome prospectively. The different sleep and wake states will&#xD;
      be derived from analysis of the conventional Video-EEG, aEEG and polysomnographic&#xD;
      measurements. Visual analysis will include assessment of amplitudes and frequencies as well&#xD;
      as the latencies and durations of EEG-Bursts and Interburst intervals. The automated&#xD;
      NLEO-algorithm will be firstly used for comparison with above described visual analysis and&#xD;
      secondly to find regions of interest involved in the organization of these early sleep&#xD;
      states. The aim of this study is first to understand and analyze in detail the emergence of&#xD;
      sleep-wake cycling including its disturbances in premature infants and to compare automated&#xD;
      NLEO algorithm to conventional visual analysis methods. Secondly to correlate&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome to the emergence of sleep-wake-cycling.&#xD;

      General description - Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to development of intensive care the number of surviving premature infants increased&#xD;
      significantly.Delayed emergence of sleep-wake-cycling in newborns can be the first sign of&#xD;
      brain injury. Clearly defined sleep-states can be identified from 32 weeks of gestation&#xD;
      onwards. Few studies show, that extremely premature infants (&lt;26 weeks of gestation) may&#xD;
      already show early sleep-states. In our project we are aiming to study the emergence of&#xD;
      sleep-wake-cycling in extremely premature infants, prospectively collecting&#xD;
      electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Premature infants &lt;29 weeks of gestation will be included&#xD;
      and measured for a 3 hour period every second week with conventional and amplitude-integrated&#xD;
      EEG. New analytical methods (automatic neonatal EEG algorithm) will be used and compared to&#xD;
      conventional visual analysis. In an international and interdisciplinary cooperation between&#xD;
      physicians, electrophysiologist and mathematicians we will be able to deduct conclusions&#xD;
      providing important prognostic information for patient, parents and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      State of the art and scientific challenge Increasingly data show, that a delayed emergence of&#xD;
      sleep-wake cycling in newborns can be the first sign of brain injury and is associated to&#xD;
      later adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Due to increasing survival rates among the very&#xD;
      premature population the prevention from later neurological deficit currently becomes even&#xD;
      more important. Rates of cerebral palsy and ouvert cerebral lesions (cystic periventricular&#xD;
      leukomalacia and peri/intraventricular haemorrhage) are decreasing, but the incidence of&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental impairment remains high in preterm infants. This is explained by the&#xD;
      understanding of different mechanisms in brain injury (for example inflammation, oxidative&#xD;
      stress, impaired connectivity) and results in mainly cognitive impairment (1). Therefore&#xD;
      greater attention needs to be directed toward preterm neonatal populations to better&#xD;
      understand brain adaptation both with and without medical complications. Neurophysiologic&#xD;
      surveillance is necessary in these infants to adequately asses cerebral function and is&#xD;
      difficult within this population by clinical aspects only. Conventional EEG is today´s gold&#xD;
      standard for neurophysiologic diagnosis. Nevertheless it is not suitable for continuous&#xD;
      recording since it is producing large data volumes which cannot be assessed directly at the&#xD;
      bedside. In an effort to solve this problem, various methods of reducing and compressing the&#xD;
      EEG signal have been developed, the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), being one of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergence of sleep-wake-cycling The concept of state during early brain ontogenesis of the&#xD;
      preterm infant is controversial. It is generally accepted that patterns representing sleep in&#xD;
      preterm infants are highly variable and less organized than patterns described for full-term&#xD;
      infants. Well organized sleep states do not appear before 31 weeks of gestation and are not&#xD;
      well established until 36 weeks postconceptional age. However several researchers have&#xD;
      questioned this assumption based on studies of sleep in preterm infants (4-7). They support&#xD;
      that rudimentary state differentation might be present as early as 26 weeks of gestation. In&#xD;
      our study from 2001 we observed cyclical variations of EEG background activity resembling&#xD;
      early sleep-wake cycles as early as at 24/25 weeks of gestation (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurophysiological methods - amplitude-integrated EEG For early identification of infants at&#xD;
      high risk and to optimize treatment, it is mandatory to have access to a reliable validated&#xD;
      diagnostic method with excellent predictive value for later neurodevelopmental outcome. The&#xD;
      aEEG is a readily available, informative and reliable technique for continuous non-invasive&#xD;
      monitoring of brain activity even in extremely premature infants. Our research group has more&#xD;
      than ten years of experience using of the amplitude-integrated EEG and it is a simple method&#xD;
      for continuous bedside monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit setting. Our group has&#xD;
      recently shown aEEG has a predictive value for later outcome in preterm infants and can&#xD;
      therefore be used as an early prognostic tool for neurodevelopmental outcome (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have found emerging sleep-wake cycles as early as 24-25 weeks of gestation in&#xD;
      neurologically healthy premature infants. On the contrary premature infants with&#xD;
      intraventricular haemorrhage exhibited a significant delay in emergence of their sleep-wake&#xD;
      cycles, on average with 32 weeks of gestation (8). We know that at this early age the&#xD;
      development of intercellular connections of the brain and synaptic branching is still in&#xD;
      development and that these processes take place mainly during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurophysiological methods - conventional EEG Conventional visual classification of the EEG&#xD;
      signal of different brain regions has been the standard of analysis since the 1960s when&#xD;
      first neonatal recordings were performed. Today more than 80% of extremely premature infants&#xD;
      between 24-28 weeks of gestation survive. Within the analysis of EEG signal there has been a&#xD;
      growing need for more reliable automatic methods, being suitable for this specific&#xD;
      population. New nomenclature has emerged specifically for the premature population such as&#xD;
      spontaneous activity transients (SATs), which constitute the most salient feature on EEG&#xD;
      during the preterm period (9-11).These spontaneous bursts of activity, which are related to&#xD;
      the excitatory role of GABAergic transmission during early development not only characterize&#xD;
      the premature EEG, but have been linked to the development of intracortical connections and&#xD;
      neuronal wiring. SATs constitute of a very slow activity (0,1-0,5 Hz), with nesting activity&#xD;
      at several higher frequencies. This activity represents the organization and development of&#xD;
      thalamo-cortical connections, when neurons migrate from the subplate into the cortical plate&#xD;
      in the primary sensory cortices. The cooperation with a finnish expert on the field within&#xD;
      this study, who is experienced with automated EEG algorithm analysis will allow even further&#xD;
      analysis of the emergence of early sleep-wake-cycling as allows only conventional, visual&#xD;
      analysis of the EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as we know this would be the first study to evaluate in detail the emergence of&#xD;
      sleep-wake-cycles in preterm infants using different methods and the first study, trying to&#xD;
      identify the role of SATs in the development of sleep organization in extremely premature&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions/ Objectives/ Hypotheses We plan to conduct a prospective single-center&#xD;
      cohort trial with an international cooperation in order to analyze the emergence of&#xD;
      sleep-wake rhythm in very premature infants in detail using conventional video-EEG and&#xD;
      amplitude-integrated EEG monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First objective of the study will be a detailed description of early sleep states, to analyze&#xD;
      which cortical regions and deeper structures are responsible and involved in their&#xD;
      development and describe the sequence of their emergence and study these EEG features in a&#xD;
      prospective &quot;healthy&quot; cohort with no drug bias or pathology. (Infants should show no&#xD;
      neurological disease and not use any neurologically active medication during analysis) Second&#xD;
      objective of the study will be to analyze the feasibility of automated conventional EEG&#xD;
      analysis using the NLEO-based algorithm (nonlinear energy operator) designed for the&#xD;
      automated detection of SATs in premature infants and to correlate the results with the&#xD;
      different sleep-wake-states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third aim of the study is to compare the two methods (automated versus visual analysis) in&#xD;
      order to develop evidence based analysis for early sleep-stage development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth aim of the study is to correlate sleep organisation to later neuromotor and&#xD;
      cognitive outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Video-EEG Polysomnography in combination with aEEG information is a reliable tool to&#xD;
           identify sleep development even in extremely premature infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Early sleep-wake cycles appear from early gestation onwards in healthy premature&#xD;
           infants. They can be distinguished visually as well as automatically by NLEO algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The onset of sleep-wake cycles and their regular cyclicity in extremely premature&#xD;
           infants are a good indicator of normal brain function and intact brain development,&#xD;
           reflecting maturing neural networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Early sleep-wake cycles and their development do have an impact on later&#xD;
           neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcome in premature infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological approaches&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients During a study period of 36 months consecutively all infants born below 29 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation who are admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this study. Approvement of the local ethics committee has already be obtained (EK-Nr.&#xD;
      67/2008) and written parental consent will be acquired for each patient. At least 3 hours of&#xD;
      sleep monitoring will be performed every second week until 36 weeks of gestation using&#xD;
      conventional video-EEG and aEEG. Thus there will be six different timepoints of data&#xD;
      acquisition: 24-25; 26-27; 28-29; 30-31; 32-33 and 34-35 weeks of gestation. The first&#xD;
      measurement will be performed during the first week of life after stabilization of clinical&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) The aEEG is recorded as a single channel EEG from biparietal&#xD;
      surface disk electrodes using a CFM 6000 (Olympic Medical, USA). The obtained signal is&#xD;
      filtered, rectified, smoothed and amplitude-integrated before it is written out or digitally&#xD;
      available on the monitor at a slow speed (6 cm/h), directly at the bed side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracings are evaluated visually and classified according to the method previously described&#xD;
      by Hellström-Westas et al. (12) Descriptive analysis of the background activity of the aEEG&#xD;
      tracings will be done by dividing each trace in 10-minute epochs. These 10-minute epochs wil&#xD;
      be classified into five pattern categories (&quot;continuous pattern&quot;, &quot;discontinuous pattern&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;burst suppression pattern&quot;, &quot;low voltage activity&quot; and &quot;flat trace&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of sleep-wake-cycles and seizure activity will be described seperately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of the different patterns and the length of quiet-sleep and active&#xD;
      sleep/wakefulness will be calculated for the entire aEEG trace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional EEG and Video-Polysomnography For the assessment of conventional EEG we will use&#xD;
      the Micromed System-Plus program. The Video-EEG will be evaluated according to the methods&#xD;
      previously published by Ludington-Hoe/Scher (4,6). EEG signals are registered from electrodes&#xD;
      located on Fp1, C3, T3, O1, Fp2, C4, T4, O2 according to the International 10-20 System of&#xD;
      electrode placement adapted for recording of neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Quiet Sleep&quot; is defined as a discontinuous pattern in all channels, where low amplitude&#xD;
      (&lt;20µV) bursts (bursts are defined as a distinct occurrence of cerebral activity with a slow&#xD;
      component and associated faster activity) are often present and they are approximately 2-10s&#xD;
      long (=Interburst Interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beginning and the end of such a &quot;discontinuous EEG-Segment&quot; is to be marked and the&#xD;
      Bursts and Interburst-intervals and its amplitudes and frequencies will be described in&#xD;
      detail. They will be measured 20x in a 10min representative EEG epoch and data will be&#xD;
      averaged. Also clinical data like body movements, eye movements, heart rate and respiratory&#xD;
      rate will be measured 20 x in a 10min representative EEG epoch and data will be averaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Active sleep&quot; is defined as a continuous EEG-activity lasting longer than 60s. Similarly&#xD;
      amplitudes and frequencies of the bursts and interburst intervals will be measured as well as&#xD;
      the above mentioned clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Wakefulness&quot; is defined electrophysiologically identical to the definition of &quot;active&#xD;
      sleep&quot;, differences can only be determined according to the behaviour analysis noted on the&#xD;
      video recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Indeterminate sleep&quot;: EEG-segments, which do not fully meet the definitons above and last&#xD;
      longer than &gt;30s will be classified into &quot;indeterminate sleep&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Arousals&quot; are defined as sudden asynchronuous changes within the EEG-pattern during a sleep&#xD;
      state, with associated body movements, muscle activity and eye-openings which last shorter&#xD;
      than 30s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral states will be classified by Videomonitoring according to Holditch-Davies (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quiet waking state is defined by eyes being open or opening, low motor activity and even&#xD;
      respiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active waking is defined by eyes being open, crying, fussing and generalized motor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active sleep is defined as eyes being closed, uneven respiration and intermittent rapid eye&#xD;
      movements (REM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quiet sleep is defined as eyes beingt closed and even respiration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automated EEG analysis - NLEO algorithm The NLEO-based algorithm for automated detection of&#xD;
      spontaneous activity transients (SATs; also called bursts) will also be used to analyze the 8&#xD;
      channel EEG data. The algorithm consists of feature extraction and a classification&#xD;
      algorithm, with the idea that every sample of the EEG will be automatically characterized as&#xD;
      either SAT or inter-SAT based on a detection that uses Nonlinear Energy Operator&#xD;
      transformation (NLEO). This methodology has been implemented for adults previously, but it&#xD;
      was recently adapted further for preterm EEG signals by the Vanhatalo group in Helsinki&#xD;
      (9-11). The newly revised algorithm was shown to agree well with an expert visual&#xD;
      classification. SAT detection can be used to calculate cumulative (or time-varying)&#xD;
      percentage of SATs, the length of the inter-SAT interval and the number of SATs per minute.&#xD;
      In the context of the present study, this approach has offered a possibility to design&#xD;
      algorithms for an automated and objective assessment of SWC. Our core interest is the&#xD;
      endogenous cyclicity of the EEG pattern, which will be further analyzed with the automated&#xD;
      software, where SATs, their spatial characteristics and their regulation will be&#xD;
      characterized. The NLEO enables to analyze the spatial characteristics of these oscillations&#xD;
      in different sleep-stages in the developing brain of the premature infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cranial Ultrasound All infants will be routinely assessed using cranial ultrasound&#xD;
      examinations every week until the 32th week of gestation and after that every second week.&#xD;
      Pathologies such as periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and intraventricular haemorrhage&#xD;
      (IVH), or other appearing abnormalities will be documented and followed up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental follow up All study patients will be involved in our neonatal follow up&#xD;
      program to assess their neurodevelopmental outcome. Neurodevelopmental outcome will be&#xD;
      assessed at 1,2 and 3,5 years of age by assessment of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development&#xD;
      II and at the age of 5,5 years by Kaufmann´s Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) and&#xD;
      Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI) done by an experienced&#xD;
      staff (developmental psychologist and pediatrician).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bayley Scales will be classified as normal when psychomotor (PDI) and mental&#xD;
      developmental index (MDI) scores were &gt; 85; K-ABC and VMI will also be considered normal when&#xD;
      &gt; 85 (within 2 standard deviations of reference values) and severely impaired when &lt; 70&#xD;
      (below 3 standard deviation variance Cerebral Palsy will be defined as a nonprogressive&#xD;
      central nervous system disorder characterized by abnormal muscle tone in at least one&#xD;
      extremity and abnormal control of movement or posture and was defined due to location as&#xD;
      hemiplegia, diplegia and tetraplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other included outcome variables will be visual and acoustic impairment, where any form of&#xD;
      abnormality will be included (need of glasses/hearing aid, as well as blindness/deafness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also detailed information regarding environmental and social and perinatal risk factors will&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Occurrence and duration of different amplitude-integrated EEG pattern&#xD;
      (=continuous, discontinuous patterns) will be given as percentages and descriptively compared&#xD;
      to already published reference values. Occurrence and duration of above described&#xD;
      conventional EEG features (=quiet sleep, active sleep and indetermined sleep) and its&#xD;
      established detailed components (duration and amplitudes and frequencies of bursts and&#xD;
      interburst intervals) will be given as means per 10 minute epochs. In another step EEG&#xD;
      activity will be correlated to neurodevelopmental outcome by Pearson´s correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the following factors: &quot;percentage of continuous pattern&quot;, &quot;percentage of&#xD;
      discontinuous pattern, &quot;percentage of burst suppression pattern&quot;, , &quot;occurrence of&#xD;
      sleep-wake-cycling at aEEG&quot;, occurrence of seizure activity&quot;, &quot;mean amplitude of burst&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;mean amplitude of interburst interval &quot;, &quot;mean frequency of burst&quot;, &quot;mean frequency of&#xD;
      interburst interval&quot;, &quot;appearance of Delta Brush&quot; ,&quot;appearance of Theta Bursts&quot;, &quot;mean heart&#xD;
      rate&quot;, &quot;mean respiratory rate&quot;, &quot;occurrence of rapid eye movements&quot; and &quot;mean of body&#xD;
      movements&quot; on neurodevelopmental outcome will be estimated in a multinomial regression model&#xD;
      and ANOVA in SPSS Statistics Version 17.0 for Windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P-values lower than 5% will be considered as indicating significance. Classification of the&#xD;
      conventional EEG and video-polysomnography will be done by two of the authors (K.K and Z.R)&#xD;
      and interrater reliability (Cohen´s Kappa) will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of SAT epochs by NLEO-based detector will be assessed, by using sample by sample&#xD;
      method. This aims to verify the comparability to prior studies (10) that used EEG signals&#xD;
      from EEG amplifiers with different specifications. In the next phase, the NLEO-based indexes&#xD;
      will be compared to visual classification (either raw EEG or aEEG trend) by using an&#xD;
      epoch-based comparison and by using time series methods in cases where both (the index and&#xD;
      visual classification) output time series with comparable features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results/deliverables Project success will be measured by inclusion of 60-80&#xD;
      patients, measuring their aEEG and Polysomnography as described above and their&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental follow-up at least at the age of two years corrected age, allowing&#xD;
      statistical analysis as described above.&#xD;
