  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United&#xD;
      States with older age being a primary risk factor. The number of adults greater than age 65&#xD;
      years will almost double to 70 million by 2030, therefore identifying therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      for treating or preventing age-related disorders in humans is of major biomedical importance.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular aging, defined as a reduction in vascular and cardiac functions with normal&#xD;
      aging, occurs even in the absence of CVD risk factors and overt CVD. A key feature of&#xD;
      cardiovascular aging is stiffening of the large elastic central arteries such as the aorta.&#xD;
      This is important because aortic stiffness directly contributes to clinical problems such as&#xD;
      increased blood pressure, reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, and thickening of the heart&#xD;
      muscle. Therefore, these clinical consequences are hypothesized to mediate a substantial&#xD;
      proportion of the increase in CVD risk in older adults. However, effective drug treatments&#xD;
      for aortic stiffness are not currently available and the biological reasons (mechanisms)&#xD;
      involved in causing aortic stiffening remain undefined. In addition, the inability of smaller&#xD;
      blood vessels to relax, impairment of the heart to relax during the filling phase of the&#xD;
      heart cycle (i.e., diastole), and increased blood pressure variability, have all been linked&#xD;
      to aortic stiffness. Furthermore, chronic low-grade inflammation with advancing age has been&#xD;
      proposed to be a common mechanistic link (i.e., biological reason) between these reductions&#xD;
      in cardiovascular function in older adults. Therefore, the investigators propose that&#xD;
      inflammation could be a novel therapeutic target to treat cardiovascular aging in older&#xD;
      adults. Our central hypothesis is that inflammation mediates the age-related deterioration in&#xD;
      cardiovascular functions observed with advancing age through the development of oxidative&#xD;
      stress (i.e., imbalance between damaging oxygen free radicals vs. protective antioxidants).&#xD;
      Our hypothesis predicts that chronic inhibition of inflammation with Salsalate, an&#xD;
      FDA-approved anti-inflammatory drug similar to aspirin that is used to treat rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis pain and known to inhibit the 'master' regulator of inflammation in the cell (i.e.,&#xD;
      nuclear factor kappa B), will improve cardiovascular function in older adults. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesize that the mechanism for the improvement in cardiovascular&#xD;
      function during inhibition of inflammation will be by suppressing oxidative stress. To test&#xD;
      our hypothesis, the investigators will randomize older healthy adults (age 50-79 years) to 3&#xD;
      g/day of salsalate or placebo (i.e., pill with inactive substance) pills for 4 weeks and have&#xD;
      cardiovascular function measured at baseline and again after 4 weeks.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To measure aortic wall stiffness and circulating biomarkers of oxidative stress during&#xD;
      both acute (IV) intravenous infusions of saline and then the antioxidant vitamin C at&#xD;
      baseline and after 4 weeks of salsalate or placebo in healthy older adults. Hypothesis 1:&#xD;
      Inhibition of inflammation in older adults will decrease aortic wall stiffness in part by&#xD;
      reductions in oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To measure brachial artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) and circulating&#xD;
      markers of oxidative stress during acute intravenous infusions of saline and then the vitamin&#xD;
      C at baseline and after 4 weeks of salsalate or placebo in healthy older adults. Hypothesis&#xD;
      2: Inhibition of inflammation in older adults will improve vascular endothelial vasodilatory&#xD;
      function in older adults in part by reductions in oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To measure left ventricular (LV) diastolic relaxation and filling dynamics and&#xD;
      circulating markers of oxidative stress during both acute intravenous infusions of saline and&#xD;
      then vitamin C at baseline and after 4 weeks of Salsalate or placebo in healthy older adults.&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Inhibition of inflammation in older adults will improve LV diastolic function&#xD;
      in part by reductions in oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: To measure 24-hour pressure variability and short-term baroreflex&#xD;
      sensitivity before and after 4 weeks of oral Salsalate or placebo treatment in older adults.&#xD;
      Exploratory hypothesis: Inhibition of inflammation in older adults will improve&#xD;
      cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation in older healthy adults.&#xD;
