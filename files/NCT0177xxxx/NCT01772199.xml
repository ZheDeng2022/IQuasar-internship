  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to assess whether&#xD;
      GSK239512 can enhance lesion remyelination in subjects with Relapsing Remitting Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis (RRMS). Subjects with RRMS on stable background treatment with either Avonex&#xD;
      (Interferon-beta1a) or Copaxone (Glatiramer Acetate) are eligible to participate. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between placebo and GSK239512, and will continue to be&#xD;
      managed with their current standard of care therapy (Copaxone or Avonex). The total treatment&#xD;
      period is 48 weeks, including a standard 4 week titration period and 44 week maintenance&#xD;
      treatment period (which could be adapted to a 5-week titration and 43 week maintenance&#xD;
      period, if needed). Titration doses start at 10 micrograms (mcg) and increase up to 80 mcg&#xD;
      (10 mcg first week, 20 mcg second week, 40 mcg third week, 80 mcg fourth week). Subjects will&#xD;
      be titrated to the maximum tolerated dose with the objective of titrating to the highest dose&#xD;
      (80 mcg GSK239512), whenever possible, based on investigator judgement of tolerability. The&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up period will be a minimum of 2 weeks in duration following the end of&#xD;
      treatment at Week 48 or early withdrawal, as appropriate.&#xD;
