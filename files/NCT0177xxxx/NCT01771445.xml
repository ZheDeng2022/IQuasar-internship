      Aim: Evaluate the regulation of muscle derived Interleukin-6 (IL-6)during exercise and in&#xD;
      particular whether it is regulated by the Interleukin-1 (IL-1) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: It has been shown that IL-1 antagonism improves glycemia and insulin secretion in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 Diabetes. However, IL-1 antagonism also decreases IL-6 levels. The&#xD;
      effect if IL-6 on the glucose metabolism has been unclear in the past and subject to intense&#xD;
      debate, with recent evidence indicating a beneficial role in regulating glucose metabolism.&#xD;
      However little is known about regulation of muscle-induced IL-6 produced during exercise. It&#xD;
      is therefore our aim to investigate whether exercise induced increases in IL-6 are dependent&#xD;
      on the IL-1 system. If IL-1 antagonism does decrease IL-6 and along with it, the beneficial&#xD;
      potential of IL-6, this may require additional medication like IL-6 substitution or&#xD;
      dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV)antagonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will assess the effect of IL-1 antagonism on insulin and&#xD;
      Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion as well as muscle soreness,fatigue and vascular&#xD;
      function in response to an acute exercise bout.&#xD;

      This is a randomized placebo-controlled, double blind, cross-over, proof-of-concept study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of one screening visit followed by 3 study visits. During the first&#xD;
      two study visits, the subjects (20 apparently healthy, lean men) will perform a submaximal&#xD;
      exercise bout on a treadmill for 60 minutes. Subjects will be randomly assigned into two&#xD;
      groups consisting each of 10 subjects receiving study medication in a double-blinded, crossed&#xD;
      over manner.&#xD;
