    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy remains a major cause of lifelong disability affecting approximately 2 per&#xD;
      1,000 children. Of those about 30% have hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HPC),a unilateral&#xD;
      impairment, which can often lead to major difficulties with manual dexterity and upper&#xD;
      limb,functional ability and independence. Therapists employ a number of strategies in upper&#xD;
      limb rehabilitation however they are poorly understood and their efficacy has been&#xD;
      questioned. Constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT)has been found to be an effective&#xD;
      intervention with HCP however its use in the preschool child within a national health service&#xD;
      (NHS) setting has not been evaluated. The investigators aim is to compare CIMT using&#xD;
      prolonged restraint with CIMT using brief manual restraint which may be standard practice and&#xD;
      acts as the control. This age group has been targeted as there may be greatest neural&#xD;
      plasticity (change)and minimal disruption to compulsory education. The investigators intend&#xD;
      to recruit 60 patients from treatment databases of participating trusts. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomised following baseline assessments which will include 2 upper limb assessments(The&#xD;
      Assisting Hand Assessment and the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test) and a quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaire (PedsQL Generic Core Scales and the Cerebral Palsy Module) for parents.&#xD;
      The intervention period will be for 6 weeks offered intermittently (2week blocks) over 10&#xD;
      weeks. Parents /guardians and possibly preschool workers will be expected to carry out a&#xD;
      therapy guided programme. The amount of intervention and compliance will be recorded by&#xD;
      parents/guardians and therapists. Assessments will be repeated at 10 weeks and 24 weeks from&#xD;
      the beginning of the trial. The results of the trial will contribute to the evidence on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of CIMT in the preschool child with HCP, and will also provide evidence on the&#xD;
      implementation of CIMT delivery within the current NHS therapy services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy(CP) is the most common lifelong neurodisability with a prevalence of&#xD;
      approximately 2 per 1000 children born in Europe. Hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP) is&#xD;
      characterised by unilateral motor impairment and is present in around 30% of all CP in the&#xD;
      UK. The associated impairments of the arm and hand can cause lifelong major difficulties with&#xD;
      manual dexterity and upper limb functional ability and independence. Elective non-use may add&#xD;
      substantially to the problem as children may disregard their affected hand even when the&#xD;
      actual motor loss is mild.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This may lead to further impairment including increased muscle tone, reduced ranges of&#xD;
      movement, weakness and delayed skeletal maturity.Physiotherapists and occupational therapists&#xD;
      are routinely involved in the care of children with CP. They employ a number of strategies in&#xD;
      upper limb rehabilitation. However, the lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) has meant&#xD;
      that the effects of different upper limb treatments are not well understood. Also the&#xD;
      efficacy of therapy has been questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) has its origins in behavioral research with&#xD;
      primates conducted by Taub in the 1980s. It consists of the immobilisation of the unaffected&#xD;
      upper limb, together with massed practice of the affected upper limb. It has been extensively&#xD;
      tested with adults poststroke and has been found to be effective in improving patient&#xD;
      centered and motor outcomes with improvement maintained for 24 months. A Cochrane review of&#xD;
      CIMT in children with HCP(2007) with 2 RCTs (n=49) and a case control study found that the&#xD;
      evidence for the use of CIMT was promising but that there was a need for further evidence to&#xD;
      support its use in practice.Additionally, Huang(2009)carried out a systematic review of 21&#xD;
      intervention studies of which 5 were RCTs (n=114) on the use of CIMT in children with HCP and&#xD;
      found positive support for it although there were recommendations for further research to&#xD;
      provide information about the threshold of effective intensity and comparisons of different&#xD;
      components in relation to specific children. The McMaster Centre for Child Disability&#xD;
      Research describe the evidence for the use of CIMT with HCP as promising and rate it as an&#xD;
      'A' although recommend that investigation is required to continue to evaluate its&#xD;
      effectiveness and address ongoing questions. The aim of this study is to compare the use of&#xD;
      CIMT in the preschool child in an NHS setting, using prolonged restraint (splint/cast with a&#xD;
      bandage to enclose the fingers) with using brief manual restraint which may be used in&#xD;
      current practice and acts as the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research proposal has been developed not only with scientific critique but also from&#xD;
      input at all levels from service users (parents) whose children have already been involved&#xD;
      with CIMT especially one who was the subject of a single case study carried out by the&#xD;
      author. Design: A pragmatic, multicentered, blinded, individually randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial. Baseline Assessment Three baseline assessments will be conducted prior to&#xD;
      randomisation. The Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA),developed for children aged 18 months to 5&#xD;
      years which is a well evaluated measure appropriate for hand function in hemiplegia will be&#xD;
      carried out by the chief investigator (CI). The AHA is administered in 2 steps. Firstly a DVD&#xD;
      is made of a 1015 minute semistructured play session with the child using toys from the AHA&#xD;
      kit which require bimanual activity. Using the DVD,the play session is then scored by a&#xD;
      validated AHA scorer. The CI will carry out all of the recorded play sessions and will do&#xD;
      some of the scoring along with another AHA validated scorer who is a therapist who works for&#xD;
      another NHS trust. The CI will also assess the patient's affected upper limb using the&#xD;
      Quality Of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST) which evaluates four domains: dissociated&#xD;
      movement, grasp, protective extension, and weight bearing. This will provide evaluation of&#xD;
      the severity of the underlying impairment and allow comparison with other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/guardians will complete the PedsQL Generic Core Scales and the Cerebral palsy Module&#xD;
      to assess the impact on quality of life. Randomisation will then be carried out using a&#xD;
      standard method with adequate concealment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be done on an intention to treat basis. Intervention Following randomisation&#xD;
      the child will either be allocated to the control arm, which involves an episode of CIMT&#xD;
      using brief manual restraint and therapy or to the intervention arm,which involves an episode&#xD;
      of CIMT using prolonged restraint using a cast/splint and crepe bandage to enclose the&#xD;
      fingers and therapy.Some parents/guardians may choose to put a sock over the restraint to&#xD;
      keep it clean. Both methods will offer 6 weeks (42days)of intervention over a 10 week&#xD;
      period.It would be expected that this active period would start 2 weeks after randomisation&#xD;
      and would be no later that 4 weeks after randomisation.This amount of intervention has been&#xD;
      informed by previous CIMT studies in HCP and is in line with the amount of intervention which&#xD;
      may be offered as an episode of care in standard practice. The control arm involves the&#xD;
      unaffected hand being gently held so as not to be able to participate in an activity and&#xD;
      encouraging the child to use their affected hand instead. This therapy would be guided by the&#xD;
      therapist but would be carried out mainly by parents/guardians and when the child attends&#xD;
      nursery by the nursery workers. The support from the nursery workers is what may be expected&#xD;
      in usual practice. The therapy would be expected to last for approximately one hour per day.&#xD;
      It is not necessary for this time to be continuous if meal times are included most&#xD;
      parents/guardians should be able to accomplish this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NHS REC Form Reference:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10/H1207/36 IRAS Version 2.5 Date: 30/03/2010 7 47136/110912/1/802 randomisation and would be&#xD;
      no later that 4 weeks after randomisation.This amount of intervention has been informed by&#xD;
      previous CIMT studies in HCP and is in line with the amount of intervention which may be&#xD;
      offered as an episode of care in standard practice. The control arm involves the unaffected&#xD;
      hand being gently held so as not to be able to participate in an activity and encouraging the&#xD;
      child to use their affected hand instead. This therapy would be guided by the therapist but&#xD;
      would be carried out mainly by parents/guardians and when the child attends nursery by the&#xD;
      nursery workers. The support from the nursery workers is what may be expected in usual&#xD;
      practice. The therapy would be expected to last for approximately one hour per day. It is not&#xD;
      necessary for this time to be continuous if meal times are included most parents/guardians&#xD;
      should be able to accomplish this. The intervention arm involves restraining the unaffected&#xD;
      hand using a belowelbow splint/cast and crepe bandage.Some parents/guardians may choose to&#xD;
      put a sock over the restraint to keep it clean. The restraint is used to limit the activity&#xD;
      of unaffected hand. The therapy implemented at the same time, to encourage the use of the&#xD;
      affected hand, would be offered in exactly the same way as in the control arm. Using a&#xD;
      belowelbow method of prolonged restraint, allows the unaffected upper limb to continue to&#xD;
      participate to a degree in bimanual activities, therefore is less intrusive to the child. In&#xD;
      addition using a splint/cast and bandage is relatively nonstigmatising as children with&#xD;
      splints/casts and bandage are not an unusual event in society. With regard to the prolonged&#xD;
      restraint we would aim that parents/guardians persist with this and although it may take time&#xD;
      for the child to adjust to it, it would be expected that with appropriate attention to tasks&#xD;
      this could be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, if the child is completely unaccepting of the prolonged restraint, it may be that&#xD;
      after approximately three/four days, following discussion between the therapist and&#xD;
      parents/guardians a recommendation may be made to discontinue with the prolonged restraint&#xD;
      but continue with the therapy. Setting The research will be carried out in the setting where&#xD;
      the patients receive their usual treatment either at home or in a local clinic. Prolonged&#xD;
      restraint will be applied in a local clinic. Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be a change in AHA at 10 weeks after trial entry and will be&#xD;
      carried out by the CI who will be blind to patient allocation and some of the scoring will be&#xD;
      carried out by a validated AHA scorer working for another trust who will be blind to&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A change in the AHA at 24 weeks after trial entry will be carried out by the CI who will&#xD;
           be blind to patient allocation and some of the scoring will be carried out by a&#xD;
           validated AHA scorer working for another trust who will be blind to allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A change in the QUEST at 10 weeks and 24 weeks after trial entry which will be carried&#xD;
           out by the CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A change in the the PedsQL Generic Core Scales and the Cerebral Palsy Module at 10 weeks&#xD;
           and 24 weeks after trial entry which will be carried out by parents/guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the intervention parents/guardians, nursery workers and therapists will be asked&#xD;
           to collect information about the acceptability and compliance of the restraint and&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: Patients from the participating trusts children's services directorate&#xD;
      treatment databases,who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be identified by&#xD;
      their treating therapists, and approached by them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion All eligible children with HCP aged 18months9 months before starting&#xD;
      compulsory education will be included. The intervention is targeted to preschool children who&#xD;
      would have the most potential to benefit (neural plasticity may be greatest) and least&#xD;
      disruptive to their compulsory education. The maximum age is 9 months before the child starts&#xD;
      compulsory education which allows those children randomised to the control arm the&#xD;
      possibility of having an episode of prolonged CIMT if requested by parents/guardians before&#xD;
      they start compulsory education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Where there is a skin condition present which may cause problems with splinting/ casting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there is some abnormal neurological involvement in both upper limbs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical presentation of athetosis/ dystonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the child has received &gt;2 weeks of prolonged restraint using a cast/splint within the&#xD;
           last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Consent from parents/guardians will be gained prior to inclusion. Parents/guardians&#xD;
      of prospective patients will be given a full explanation of the trial by the treating&#xD;
      therapist or by the principal investigator (PI) who will understand the ethical principles&#xD;
      underpinning informed consent. Discussion will include the reason the research is being&#xD;
      carried out, information about the treatment options,the risks and benefits and the manner of&#xD;
      the treatment allocation. They will be given a patient information sheet to read and&#xD;
      sufficient time to decide whether they would like to join the trial. Simple explanations&#xD;
      about the intervention will be given to the children within the limits of their&#xD;
      understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/guardians will then be asked to sign a consent form by a different therapist where&#xD;
      possible who is part of the clinical care team. If support is needed from an interpreter this&#xD;
      will be provided. It will be made clear that if they do not take part this will not affect&#xD;
      their treatment in any way. Specific consent will be gained for making, posting and storing&#xD;
      the DVDs which are part of the AHA assessment. Risks and benefits A risk assessment of the&#xD;
      trial has been performed which included consultation with parents/guardians of children who&#xD;
      have already been involved with CIMT. The CIMT interventions are considered to be of low&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      10/H1207/36 IRAS Version 2.5 Date: 30/03/2010 8 47136/110912/1/802 given a patient&#xD;
      information sheet to read and sufficient time to decide whether they would like to join the&#xD;
      trial. Simple explanations about the intervention will be given to the children within the&#xD;
      limits of their understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/guardians will then be asked to sign a consent form by a different therapist where&#xD;
      possible who is part of the clinical care team. If support is needed from an interpreter this&#xD;
      will be provided. It will be made clear that if they do not take part this will not affect&#xD;
      their treatment in any way. Specific consent will be gained for making, posting and storing&#xD;
      the DVDs which are part of the AHA assessment. Risks and benefits A risk assessment of the&#xD;
      trial has been performed which included consultation with parents/guardians of children who&#xD;
      have already been involved with CIMT. The CIMT interventions are considered to be of low&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks identified include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The children allocated to the intervention arm may become frustrated leading to an&#xD;
           increase in poor behavior as they are not able to use their unaffected hand. Every&#xD;
           effort will be made to keep this to a minimum through providing appropriate toys and&#xD;
           advice on activity. Clear guidelines are available to therapists and parents/guardians&#xD;
           to respond to this. The method chosen for prolonged restraint is removable and&#xD;
           parents/guardians will have instructions for removing the splint/cast if needed and&#xD;
           emergency contact numbers.If there is total noncompliance by the child,after three /four&#xD;
           days a decision may be made between the therapist and parent/guardian to discontinue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The skin on the upper limb which is restrained for a prolonged period may become red and&#xD;
           sore. At worse this could become blistered. This will be highlighted to&#xD;
           parents/guardians. It would be expected that if this was the case the child would&#xD;
           complain and parents/guardians would be able to remove the restraint. As the splint/cast&#xD;
           is removable the skin condition can be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The unaffected upper limb while restrained may be less effective in saving reactions.&#xD;
           The method of restraint chosen is below elbow to keep this to a minimum. However there&#xD;
           may be an increase in risk of injury from falling over. This risk is kept to a minimum&#xD;
           by highlighting it to parents/guardians and advising to limit situations which would be&#xD;
           especially challenging to balance or offering supervision in these situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events will be recorded by the therapists and will also be recorded in the same&#xD;
           way as an adverse event occurring as an NHS patient. Those patients who are randomised&#xD;
           to the CIMT using brief manual restraint (control arm) whose parents/guardians request&#xD;
           an episode of CIMT with prolonged restraint(intervention arm)will be offered this at the&#xD;
           end of the trial before compulsory education begins. Confidentiality Members of the&#xD;
           direct clinical care team will have access to personidentifiable information as in their&#xD;
           usual practice. This trial will not use person identifiable data but instead unique&#xD;
           identifiers will be used. Any data generated as part of the research will be stored&#xD;
           securely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DVDs of the participants will be made as part of the AHA assessment. All DVDs will be&#xD;
      encrypted to the standard recommended by the NHS and stored in a locked cupboard. Some of the&#xD;
      DVDs produced as part of the AHA will be posted to another NHS trust using a tracking service&#xD;
      to be scored by a therapist who is a validated AHA scorer.Secure storage will be provided by&#xD;
      this trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/guardians will be informed about the transfer and asked to consent to this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be stored in a secure cupboard for 5 years after the end of the trial and will&#xD;
      then be destroyed.&#xD;
