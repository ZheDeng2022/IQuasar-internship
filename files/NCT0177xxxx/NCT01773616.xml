    <textblock>
      The treatment of the multisystem autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)&#xD;
      remains a challenge, particularly when there is renal involvement (lupus nephritis). For the&#xD;
      last 60 years corticosteroids have been the backbone of the treatment of lupus nephritis but&#xD;
      they are associated with significant toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although randomized placebo controlled trials of Rituximab in non-renal lupus and lupus&#xD;
      nephritis did not meet their primary end-points, there is accumulating data that suggests&#xD;
      that B cell depletion with Rituximab may be efficacious in lupus disease refractory to&#xD;
      conventional therapy. Furthermore, our pilot data suggests that the addition of Rituximab to&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) without oral steroids is at least as effective at inducing a&#xD;
      renal response as the standard of care therapy comprising MMF and high dose oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RITUXILUP is a proof of concept, open labeled, randomized, controlled, multicentre trial that&#xD;
      aims to demonstrate whether the addition of Rituximab to MMF therapy is useful in treating a&#xD;
      new flare of lupus nephritis and whether it has a long lasting steroid-sparing, beneficial&#xD;
      effect with equal efficacy and greater safety than a conventional regimen of MMF and oral&#xD;
      prednisolone. If successful, this trial has the potential to dramatically change the&#xD;
      management of lupus nephritis.&#xD;

      TRIAL SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      TITLE RITUXILUP - An open label randomised multicentre controlled trial of RITUXImab and&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) without oral steroids for the treatment of LUPus nephritis&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the combination of Rituximab, Methyl prednisolone and MMF as effective in treating&#xD;
           lupus nephritis as Methyl prednisolone, oral steroids and MMF?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does the omission of oral steroids increase the safety of the treatment regimen?&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN This is a 1:1 randomised, international open label, controlled phase III multicentre&#xD;
      trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE A total of 252 patients: 126 patients in each arm (As of April 2017 decided 25&#xD;
      patients will be maximum recruited following decision to close the study early)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY Children (12 years and above) and adults with lupus nephritis ISN/RPS Class III A&#xD;
      or A/C, Class IV-G A or A/C, Class IV-S A or A/C, and/or Class V with a urine&#xD;
      protein/creatinine ratio (PCR) ≥ 100mg/mmol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Experimental group - Rituximab, IV methyl prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group - oral prednisolone, IV methyl prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME The primary outcome is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Rituximab arm in&#xD;
      comparison to the control arm in the proportion of patients achieving complete renal response&#xD;
      (CR) at week 52 without the need for steroid prescription.&#xD;
