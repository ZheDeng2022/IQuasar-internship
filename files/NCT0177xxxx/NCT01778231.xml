      This study aims to investigate genetic and environmental determinants of macular pigment (MP)&#xD;
      and assess the effects of lutein and zeaxanthin-rich supplements on macular pigment levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in elderly people in&#xD;
      western countries1. It is a degenerative condition of the macula characterized by the death&#xD;
      or dysfunction of photoreceptors, leading to the progressive loss of central vision1. Central&#xD;
      vision is needed for activities requiring fine vision such as reading, driving or recognizing&#xD;
      faces. With the aging population and increasing expectations in health care it is therefore&#xD;
      of utmost importance to preserve the quality of life and independence of the elderly through&#xD;
      prevention of this ocular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much interest surrounds macular pigment due to its putative role in protecting the macula&#xD;
      from oxidative stress and age-related degenerative change2, yet much is still unknown about&#xD;
      factors that determine its uptake and deposition. Large inter-individual differences in MP&#xD;
      have been demonstrated with several large population based studies showing that peak macular&#xD;
      pigment density can vary by over a factor of 10 between individuals3-4. Subsequent studies&#xD;
      have suggested a number of parameters such as age, diet, percentage body fat, gender and&#xD;
      tobacco use5-9 as determinants of MP, however these only account for approximately a third of&#xD;
      the variance leaving a significant proportion unexplained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lutein and Zeaxanthin (L and Z), constituents of MP, cannot be synthesized by the body and so&#xD;
      are entirely dietary in origin. They are present in foods such as collard greens, spinach and&#xD;
      Brussels sprouts10. Variation in the bitter-taste receptor gene, TAS2R38 confers the ability&#xD;
      to taste 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) which is present in many&#xD;
      of these foods11. People who taste PTC with a greater intensity are more likely to avoid&#xD;
      these foods and therefore we hypothesize they may have lower levels of macular pigment. Thus,&#xD;
      this study may help to identify a group at higher risk of macular degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite MP's dietary origin only modest correlations exist with serum and dietary levels of L&#xD;
      and Z, and although the level of MP can be augmented in most people by diet or&#xD;
      supplementation the response is variable and not always correlated with baseline level. Most&#xD;
      supplementation studies identify a sub-group of &quot;retinal non-responders&quot;12 in which serum&#xD;
      values of the carotenoids have risen, yet no change is found in macular pigment, the reason&#xD;
      for this is not clear. The first part of our study will provide a well-phenotyped group in&#xD;
      which to explore this further. Several studies have also shown that peak macular pigment&#xD;
      levels are strongly heritable13-14 suggesting genetics may play an important role. Although&#xD;
      no gene has currently been clearly identified the ApoE gene has been suggested to show an&#xD;
      association with macular pigment level. A supplementation study in this population will be&#xD;
      able to determine whether the genes identified on a cross-sectional basis do determine uptake&#xD;
      of the nutritional supplement. We may also be able to identify specific demographic or&#xD;
      lifestyle factors of non-responders which may help to explain the phenomenon.&#xD;
