      The purpose of this study is to assess overall survival of anti-tumor immunization using&#xD;
      HyperAcute®-Lung immunotherapy versus Docetaxel in patients with progressed or relapsed&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that have been previously treated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer death in men and women&#xD;
      in the United States. Despite advances in the treatment of advanced NSCLC in the last decade,&#xD;
      survival outcomes remain poor. Treatment benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy has reached a&#xD;
      plateau and further progress will depend upon identifying novel methods to target tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harnessing the human immune system to target lung cancer could result in the development of&#xD;
      effective treatment options against lung cancer and potentially enhance the effect of&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy. Lung cancer cells produce a number of abnormal proteins or abnormal&#xD;
      amounts of certain proteins found in normal lung cells. In some cancers, the abnormal protein&#xD;
      expression may lead to an immune response against the cancer cells much in the way the immune&#xD;
      system responds to an infection. In progressive lung cancer however, the immune system fails&#xD;
      to identify or respond to these abnormalities and the cancer cells are not attacked or&#xD;
      destroyed for reasons not yet fully understood. This clinical trial proposes a novel method&#xD;
      to stimulate the immune system to recognize the abnormal components found in lung cancer&#xD;
      cells and to stimulate an immune response that destroys or blocks the growth of the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new method of treatment helps the immune system of lung cancer patients to &quot;identify&quot;&#xD;
      and target the cancerous tissue. As an example, patients who receive an organ transplant to&#xD;
      replace a damaged kidney or heart are treated with special drugs to supress their immune&#xD;
      response from destroying or &quot;rejecting&quot; the transplanted organ. This &quot;rejection&quot; occurs when&#xD;
      the patient's immune system responds to differences between the cells of the transplanted&#xD;
      organ and their own immune system by attacking the foreign tissue in the same way as it would&#xD;
      attack infected tissue. When the differences between foreign tissues and the patient's body&#xD;
      are even larger, perhaps like differences between organs from pigs and the immune system&#xD;
      cells of humans, the rejection is very rapid, highly destructive and the immunity it&#xD;
      generates is long-lasting. This is called hyperacute rejection and the medicine used to&#xD;
      immunize patients in this protocol tries to harness this response to teach a patient's immune&#xD;
      system to fight their lung cancer just as the body would learn to reject a transplanted organ&#xD;
      from an animal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, we have placed a mouse gene into cultured human lung cancer cell lines. These&#xD;
      cells will express a sugar that will stimulate a strong immune response in humans. These&#xD;
      cancer cells are irradiated to prevent any growth and then injected along with chemotherapy&#xD;
      to patients with lung cancer. The presence of the sugar will stimulate the patient's immune&#xD;
      system to kill the injected immunotherapy cells. As part of the process of destroying the&#xD;
      immunotherapy cells, the patient's immune system is stimulated to identify as many&#xD;
      differences between these cancer cells and normal human cells. This extra stimulation is&#xD;
      thought to encourage immune responses against the lung cancer in the patient based on shared&#xD;
      abnormalities of lung cancer immunotherapy cells and the patient's lung cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experimental therapy, patients are given docetaxel or injections of an immunotherapy&#xD;
      consisting of three types of modified lung cancer cells. We propose to test these treatments&#xD;
      in patients with lung cancer who have progressed after initial chemotherapy to demonstrate&#xD;
      that treatment of immunotherapy results in improved tumor stabilization or response and could&#xD;
      potentially improve the patient's overall survival.&#xD;
