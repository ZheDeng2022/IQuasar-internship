    <textblock>
      Whether the lower immunogenicity of the mumps component obtained in clinical studies with the&#xD;
      MMR in Brazil, due to the multidose presentation. Investigations were made on factors that&#xD;
      could interfere with immunogenicity of mumps component, as the kits used for the immunoassay&#xD;
      method, and potency of the vaccine, but no explanation was found. This study aimed to&#xD;
      investigate the hypothesis that the lower immunogenicity of the mumps component of the MMR&#xD;
      Bio-Manguinhos vaccine, is due to the multidose presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Main objetctive is evaluate the immunogenicity of MMR after one dose in children 12 to 23&#xD;
      months of life, comparing the performances multidose vial (10 doses per vial of vaccine&#xD;
      produced in Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz through technology transfer from GlaxoSmithKline&#xD;
      Laboratory - GSK) and single dose vial (1 dose per vial of vaccine produced by GSK).&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical trial Phase IV, randomized, single-blind, with two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MMR (TV) combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine produced in Bio-Manguinhos, applied&#xD;
           to healthy children 12 to 23 months. Multidose presentation, only from one batch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MMR (GSK-TV), produced by GlaxoSmithKline, the same age. Monodose presentation, only&#xD;
           from one batch.&#xD;

    <time_frame>42 days after vaccination, blood samples will be done to determine the levels of antibodies to all three components of the MMR Vaccine</time_frame>
    <description>Before vaccination study and about 42 days after, shall be taken blood samples to determine the levels of antibodies to all three components of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella). Antibody titers are measured by enzyme immunoassay (cut off point of 231 units/ml for mumps, 4 IU/ml for rubella and 150 IU /ml measles) and neutralization test plaque reduction for measles (cut off point of 0.20 IU/mL for measles).</description>
