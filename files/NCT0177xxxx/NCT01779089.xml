    <textblock>
      Diabetic kidney disease increases the risk of illness and death from heart disease in&#xD;
      patients with Type 2 diabetes. Some blood pressure medications called ACE inhibitors and ARBs&#xD;
      slow progression of kidney disease, but the dose that can be used is often limited by side&#xD;
      effects that are experienced by patients. The most limiting side effects of the current&#xD;
      treatments are lowering of the kidney function or blood pressure, and a rise in blood&#xD;
      potassium levels. A safe and inexpensive medication that doesn't lower kidney function or&#xD;
      blood pressure or raise serum potassium would be useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with recently appreciated protective properties. In&#xD;
      a published journal article by Dr. Isermann, minocycline prevented the death of specialized&#xD;
      kidney cells in mice. The kidneys of these mice did not develop diabetic kidney disease when&#xD;
      seen under the microscope and the mice experienced only a little bit of protein loss in the&#xD;
      urine. In a different published paper, the authors showed that minocycline also decreased&#xD;
      kidney injury in a model of non-diabetic kidney disease. A related tetracycline antibiotic&#xD;
      was shown to lower urine protein in diabetic patients. These data support a rationale for&#xD;
      testing to see if minocycline is safe and helpful in patients with diabetic kidney disease.&#xD;
      In this study, all patients will stay on their usual medications for the treatment of&#xD;
      diabetic kidney disease. Patients will be given either minocycline (100 mg by mouth twice a&#xD;
      day for 24 weeks) or placebo (an inactive capsule taken twice a day for 24 weeks).&#xD;
      Minocycline or placebo will be assigned by a process called &quot;randomization&quot;, which is like a&#xD;
      coin toss. Neither the patient nor the study team will know if the patient is taking placebo&#xD;
      or minocycline until the end of the study. The study will assess minocycline safety and test&#xD;
      to see if minocycline is helpful or not helpful for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was funded by the American Diabetes Association and is not supported by any&#xD;
      pharmaceutical company.&#xD;
