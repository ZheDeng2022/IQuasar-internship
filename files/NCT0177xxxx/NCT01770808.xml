    <textblock>
      Digestive discomfort includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, altered bowel&#xD;
      habit, flatulence and bloating and can sometimes result from slower intestinal transit and&#xD;
      other digestive irregularities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of consuming Aquamin (as AquaCal and&#xD;
      AquaPT) on digestive discomfort and symptoms amongst adults without diagnosed&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders.&#xD;

      Digestive discomfort includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, altered bowel&#xD;
      habit, flatulence and bloating and can sometimes result from slower intestinal transit and&#xD;
      other digestive irregularities. Digestive discomfort may lead to health issues in the&#xD;
      long-term. In a recent survey of over 1,000 women in the UK, 88% reported having experienced&#xD;
      digestive discomfort from time to time, but the majority of them (70%) had never consulted a&#xD;
      doctor or nurse. Digestive discomfort is often a source of embarrassment for people; they&#xD;
      therefore may be reluctant to address these issues with a healthcare professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aquamin is a seaweed-derived mineral source, which is rich in calcium, magnesium and 74 other&#xD;
      trace minerals including zinc, iron and selenium. It is produced from the red algae,&#xD;
      Lithothamnion Calcareum, which is found in just three locations in the world, including the&#xD;
      south-west coast of Ireland and Iceland. During a five-year life span, these algae absorb&#xD;
      essential minerals from the sea - this gives Aquamin its unique multimineral content. The&#xD;
      algae then break down naturally and settle on the sea bed. These calcified skeletal remains&#xD;
      are harvested, washed, dried and milled and provided in a capsule formulation. Aquamin is&#xD;
      proven to deliver digestive health benefits. In a recent study, mice feed on a high-fat&#xD;
      'Western-style' diet (HFWD) and Aquamin, suppressed colon polyp formation and a reduction in&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory changes in comparison to those not receiving Aquamin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of consuming Aquamin (as AquaCal and&#xD;
      AquaPT) on digestive discomfort and symptoms amongst adults without diagnosed&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders.&#xD;
