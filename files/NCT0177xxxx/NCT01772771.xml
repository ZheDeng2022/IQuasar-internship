  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study performs standardized testing of tumor tissue samples to learn which genes are&#xD;
      mutated (have changed) in order to provide personalized cancer therapy options to cancer&#xD;
      patients at MD Anderson. This may help doctors use testing information on tumors to identify&#xD;
      clinical trials that may be most relevant to patients. Researchers may also use the&#xD;
      information learned from this study to develop a database of the different kinds of mutations&#xD;
      in cancer-related genes.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform standardized molecular analysis for patients at MD Anderson to assist in&#xD;
      personalized cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the frequency of mutations and co-mutations and other alterations in&#xD;
      cancer-related genes in different tumor types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To establish a database of somatic mutations, copy number alterations, gene&#xD;
      fusion/translocation information and other biomarker alterations and clinical characteristics&#xD;
      that can be used to select patients that may be eligible for new targeted therapy trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine enrollment to pathway-targeted therapy trials by cancer genotype and&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein expression, and plan additional pathway-targeted therapy&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine how somatic and germline mutations in cancer-related genes, other molecular&#xD;
      alterations affect response to commonly used anti-tumor therapies and cancer outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine genomic alterations detectable in plasma and their evolution with&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To perform multiplex and non-multiplex protein and protein/RNA screening using different&#xD;
      platforms such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence, (IF) mass spectrometry&#xD;
      (MS), and nanostring of slides or tissue microarrays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine feasibility of identifying actionable targets and rationale drug combinations&#xD;
      based on gene expression profiling and systems biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' previously collected tissue samples are analyzed. Patients may also undergo&#xD;
      collection of blood, saliva or buccal samples for analysis. Patients' medical records are&#xD;
      reviewed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically, radiographic, or cytologically documented cancer,&#xD;
             suspected glioma, sarcoma, melanoma or hematologic cancer. Patients with benign tumors&#xD;
             may also be consented at the discretion of the attending physician if molecular&#xD;
             profiling is felt to have potential clinical implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may be consented without confirming the amount and quality of archival&#xD;
             diagnostic or residual tissue available. However, research testing will only be&#xD;
             performed on patients who have sufficient archived diagnostic tissue or residual&#xD;
             tissue banked in one of the authorized tissue banks at MD Anderson available to&#xD;
             proceed with testing. The extent of testing may be modified based on amount of tissue&#xD;
             available. If any new tissue acquisition including a biopsy and/or surgical resection&#xD;
             etc. is being ordered for clinical care or another research study, or an operation is&#xD;
             being performed testing can be ordered on that sample&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) Cohort: Circulating cell-free DNA&#xD;
             next generation sequencing (NGS) testing will be performed with the Clinical&#xD;
             Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified Guardant360 panel (or equivalent) for&#xD;
             select patients. This particular cohort of research collaboration will be supported by&#xD;
             Guardant Health, Inc. at no charge to MD Anderson. Patients who are being considered&#xD;
             for enrollment into clinical trials in the next 2 lines of therapy may be enrolled.&#xD;
             Selected patients may have cfDNA, circulating RNA /exosome/circulating tumor cell&#xD;
             testing approaches performed on alternate platforms (eg Foundation ACT)&#xD;
