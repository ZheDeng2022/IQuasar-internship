  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common infection leading to hospitalization in&#xD;
      intensive care units and the most common cause of death associated with infection disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies have shown that respiratory tract infections are associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk for the development of acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This link is further supported by studies indicating that influenza vaccination is associated&#xD;
      with a reduced risk of hospitalization for pneumonia as well as heart disease and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data connecting acute respiratory tract infections and cardiovascular events stem almost&#xD;
      exclusively from cross-sectional or retrospective studies. Thus the real incidence and the&#xD;
      prognostic impact of AMI, as well as the pathophysiological relationship between pneumonia&#xD;
      and cardiovascular damage is still elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease. The increased&#xD;
      concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines together with the activation of coagulation, the&#xD;
      down-regulation of anticoagulant mechanisms and the enhanced platelet aggregation may trigger&#xD;
      atheroma's instability, plaque rupture and thrombus formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation and coagulopathy are also considered universal host responses to infection in&#xD;
      patients with severe sepsis. Thus far limited data are available on the changes in these high&#xD;
      regulated systems, together with platelet activity in patients with CAP and their potential&#xD;
      relationship with cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will consist in a prospective multicenter study to investigate the incidence of&#xD;
      major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in hospitalized patients with CAP,&#xD;
      its prognostic relevance and the potential relationship between enhanced cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      and the activation of inflammation, coagulation and platelet aggregation in this setting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common infection leading to hospitalization in&#xD;
      intensive care units and the most common cause of death associated with infection disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies have shown that respiratory tract infections are associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk for the development of acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This link is further supported by studies indicating that influenza vaccination is associated&#xD;
      with a reduced risk of hospitalization for pneumonia as well as heart disease,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease and the risk of death from all causes during influenza seasons in&#xD;
      elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data connecting acute respiratory tract infections and cardiovascular events stemmed almost&#xD;
      exclusively from cross-sectional or retrospective studies and the pathophysiological&#xD;
      relationship between pneumonia and cardiovascular damage is still elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of the study will be to analyze the prevalence of major adverse cardiac and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients hospitalized for CAP, followed up for two years&#xD;
      after hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During hospitalization myocardial damage will be strictly monitored by measuring cardiac&#xD;
      troponins until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac troponins are established markers of myocardial damage. Cardiac troponin elevation is&#xD;
      seen not only in the setting of acute coronary syndromes but also in a variety of conditions&#xD;
      not directly related to flow-limiting coronary stenosis or occlusion of the coronary&#xD;
      arteries, such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, heart failure and stroke. In these settings, it&#xD;
      is well documented that elevated circulating levels of troponins are associated with poor&#xD;
      prognosis, regardless of underlying disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sparse information exists concerning the significance of troponin elevation during&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections. Most of the studies investigated the role of troponin elevation&#xD;
      in patients admitted in hospital for acutely exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD); only a recent study investigates specifically CAP, showing a correlation&#xD;
      between troponin elevation and oxygenation impairment; however, the underlying mechanism was&#xD;
      not explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease. The increased&#xD;
      concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines together with the activation of coagulation, the&#xD;
      down-regulation of anticoagulant mechanisms and the enhanced platelet aggregation may trigger&#xD;
      atheroma's instability, plaque rupture and thrombus formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic coagulation abnormalities including clotting activation and inhibition of&#xD;
      anticoagulant factors have been observed in patients with severe sepsis; in patients with CAP&#xD;
      similar changes have been detected only in the lung compartment. Changes of clotting system&#xD;
      activation are of potential relevance as they could elicit myocardial damage with several&#xD;
      mechanisms including coronary ischemia and/or direct inflammation of cardiac cells.&#xD;
      Concerning this last point it is of interest that Protein C, an anticoagulant factor with&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory property, is reduced in severe sepsis where it correlates with disease&#xD;
      severity and mortality. Accordingly, infusion of recombinant human activated Protein C&#xD;
      improves survival of patients with severe sepsis due to pneumococcal pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now no data exists about the behavior of Protein C in patients with CAP and its&#xD;
      interplay with myocardial damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover no data on platelet reactivity and activation during pneumonia exist. Very limited&#xD;
      data is only available on common viral respiratory tract infections in which enhanced&#xD;
      platelet reactivity has been shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators speculated that inhibition of Protein C as well as enhanced platelet&#xD;
      activity may be implicated in myocardial damage in patients with CAP. Therefore the&#xD;
      investigators will perform a prospective study to investigate whether this relationship&#xD;
      exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained could have important clinical consequences: new therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      targeting these systems could prevent myocardial damage and eventually MACCEs in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
