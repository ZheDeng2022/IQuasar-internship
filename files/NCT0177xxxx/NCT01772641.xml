  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has three main aims. Aim 1: To provide initial data on the efficacy of combined&#xD;
      Scheduled Gradual Reduction (SGR) and Varenicline (VN) for smoking cessation, by assessing&#xD;
      abstinence and levels of smoking at 2 time points (4 and 12 weeks post quit). Aim 2: To&#xD;
      explore the possibility that SGR+VN will be particularly efficacious among smokers with&#xD;
      higher background levels of Cue Reactivity (CR), as assessed at the start of the study, using&#xD;
      a classic experimental smoking CR paradigm. Aim 3: To explore possible mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      the effects of SGR+VN, by assessing potential mediators (i.e., self-efficacy, cue-induced&#xD;
      cravings) of treatment effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking remains an intransigent public health concern. There is ample evidence that&#xD;
      non-pharmacological factors, such as environmental triggers (e.g., sight or smell of a&#xD;
      cigarette), can give rise to strong classically-conditioned urges to smoke (termed&#xD;
      'cue-reactivity' [CR]), and that exposure to smoking cues can contribute to cessation&#xD;
      failure. One promising intervention that may address CR is scheduled smoking with gradual&#xD;
      reduction (SGR). Under SGR, individuals smoke only at fixed intervals, and over several&#xD;
      weeks, systematically decrease their cigarettes consumed each day. The approach is postulated&#xD;
      to: 1) provide 'practice' coping with environmentally-triggered cravings that occur during&#xD;
      the inter-cigarette intervals, yielding increased self-efficacy to quit, and 2) weaken the&#xD;
      associations between cues and smoking. Accumulating evidence has also shown that the smoking&#xD;
      cessation drug, varenicline (VN), substantially ameliorates cravings and enhances cessation,&#xD;
      significantly outperforming other drugs. Interestingly, recent animal research suggests that&#xD;
      VN may operate at least partially by dampening conditioned drug cravings. A combination&#xD;
      therapy consisting of SGR+VN might thus lead to significantly enhanced cessation,&#xD;
      simultaneously attacking cravings using both pharmacological and non-pharmacological&#xD;
      approaches. Because the beneficial effects of SGR and VN may be at least partially due to&#xD;
      enhanced management of conditioned cravings, it is possible that that they will be&#xD;
      particularly efficacious for smokers with high levels of CR. Using both laboratory&#xD;
      experimental techniques and a prospective intervention design in this R34 application, we&#xD;
      propose to provide initial data to: 1) test the hypothesis that a combination of SGR+VN will&#xD;
      enhance cessation, 2) explore the possibility that SGR and VN might be particularly&#xD;
      efficacious among smokers with higher levels of CR, and 3) explore potential mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying treatment effects. Findings from this study would set the stage for larger&#xD;
      efficacy and effectiveness trials of SGR alone and in conjunction with VN, as well as efforts&#xD;
      to target SGR and/or VN toward the subgroups that would benefit the most (e.g., smokers with&#xD;
      high levels of CR, carriers of specific smoking-related genotypes).&#xD;

This is done through a smoking schedule in which participants smoke a cigarette at given fixed and equal intervals throughout their waking day. Additionally, they will take 0.5 mg of Varenicline (VN) once a day for the first three days, then 0.5 mg twice a day for the next four days, and they will continue for 13 weeks at 1.0 mg twice per day.</description>
