    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well intravenous (IV) chemotherapy or oral&#xD;
      chemotherapy works in treating patients with previously untreated stage III-IV human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, prednisone,&#xD;
      lomustine, etoposide, and procarbazine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving&#xD;
      more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the efficacy of standard cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride,&#xD;
      vincristine sulfate, and prednisone (CHOP) and an oral chemotherapy regimen for acquired&#xD;
      immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related (AR)-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa with respect to overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the objectives response rate (ORR) of persons randomized to CHOP and oral&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the progression free survival (PFS) of persons randomized to CHOP and oral&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the safety and tolerance of persons randomized to CHOP and oral chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the rates of completion of therapy of persons randomized to CHOP and oral&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe adherence to chemotherapy of persons randomized to CHOP and oral&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe adherence to antiretroviral therapy of persons randomized to CHOP and oral&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe the effects of therapy on HIV control, as measured by cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation (CD)4 counts and HIV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To investigate correlates of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive CHOP chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on&#xD;
      day 1, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1, vincristine sulfate IV on day 1, and prednisone&#xD;
      orally (PO) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive lomustine PO once daily (QD) on day 1 (courses 1 and 3 only),&#xD;
      etoposide PO QD on days 1-3, cyclophosphamide PO QD on days 22-26, and procarbazine&#xD;
      hydrochloride PO QD on days 22-26. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 3 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.&#xD;
