      Objective of the study: To study the concordance of sentinel node (SN) localization between&#xD;
      preoperative Magnetic Resonance Lymphangiography and SPECT-CT SN mapping and the&#xD;
      intra-operative SN procedure for low stage cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: The SN procedure for surgically treated cervical cancer is promising.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, efficient and direct intra-operative SN localisation, without an extensive&#xD;
      surgical exploration, remains a challenge even with combined use of patent blue dye en&#xD;
      technetium-99m (99mTc). Preoperative imaging (= mapping) with 99mTc based SPECT-CT, which is&#xD;
      increasingly adopted, has partly alleviated this problem. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      investigate the feasibility of a new SN mapping modality, which visualises the (sentinel)&#xD;
      lymph nodes using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique (so called; Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Lymphangiography), and compare it to SPECT-CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective, feasibility type diagnostic study. 40 subjects targeted. Via vaginal&#xD;
      speculum exam, a specific MRI contrast-agent will be intracervically injected. Subsequently,&#xD;
      on a wide bore 1.5T MRI system multiplanar imaging is performed, followed by a blinded review&#xD;
      (experienced radiologist) for bilateral SN localization. Standard care with a preoperative&#xD;
      SPECT-CT (after intracervical 99mTc administration). A blinded nuclear medicine specialist&#xD;
      will localize the SN on the SPECT-CT images. Open or (robot-assisted) laparoscopy performed&#xD;
      for localization of the blue stained and/or 99mTc-hot SN. Excision of the SN with freeze&#xD;
      sectioning and histological review. Statistical analysis with intrapatient testing for&#xD;
      concordance of MR Lympangiography and SPECT-CT based SN localization against the reference&#xD;
      standard: the intra-operative sentinel node procedure.&#xD;

      Background of the study: The sentinel procedure (SN) for surgically treated cervical cancer&#xD;
      is promising. Unfortunately, efficient and direct intra-operative SN localisation, without an&#xD;
      extensive retroperitoneal exploration, remains a challenge even with combined use of patent&#xD;
      blue dye en 99mTc. The draining lymph nodes are positioned around the retroperitoneal pelvic&#xD;
      vasculature, in close relation to the ureters and nerves innervating bladder, rectum and&#xD;
      sexual functionality (inferior hypogastric plexus, genitofemoral nerve, etc), which makes&#xD;
      exploration hazardous and time consuming. Furthermore, complete retroperitoneal exploration&#xD;
      often necessitates dissection of lymph vessels (to find the SN) which would have been spared&#xD;
      in a selective SN excision. The use of technetium-99m(99mTc) enables preoperative SN mapping&#xD;
      with SPECT(-CT) to localise SN and partly alleviate this issue. Some clinics perform&#xD;
      preoperative SPECT(-CT), despite its disadvantages of prolonged hospital admission, radiation&#xD;
      exposure, limited spatial resolution (SPECT) and the limited soft tissue differentiation in&#xD;
      the female pelvis (CT). The investigators postulate that Magnetic Resonance (MR)&#xD;
      Lymphangiography is a better technique for preoperative SN mapping in cervical cancer. It&#xD;
      allows for integration with regular work-up pelvic MRI and could make SPECT-CT unnecessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study: To study the concordance of sentinel node localization between&#xD;
      preoperative MR Lymphangiography and SPECT-CT SN mapping and the intra-operative sentinel&#xD;
      node procedure (patent blue and 99mTc) for low stage cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, feasibility type diagnostic study with the experimental test (MR&#xD;
      Lymphangiography) added to standard clinical care (SPECT-CT, intra-operative SN procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 40 subjects targeted. Via a vaginal speculum exam 1ml of MR contrastmedium will be&#xD;
      intracervically injected peripheral of the cervical tumor at 3, 6, 9 and 12 o'clock (suspine&#xD;
      position). On a wide bore digital 1.5T MRI multiplanar T1w imaging is performed, followed by&#xD;
      a blinded review (experienced radiologist) for bilateral SN localization with a standardized&#xD;
      anatomical system. Standard procedure with a preoperative 220 MBq 99mTc SPECT-CT, a blinded&#xD;
      nuclear medicine specialist will localize the SN. Standard peri-operative care; under general&#xD;
      anesthesia 1ml injection of patent blue V in each of the four quadrants. Open or&#xD;
      (robot-assisted) laparoscopy performed for visual localization of the blue SN's. Introduction&#xD;
      of a gamma-probe and localization 'hot and blue' SN. For both methods anatomical locations of&#xD;
      the SN are registered. Excision SN for freeze sectioning and histological review. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis with intrapatient testing for concordance of SPECT-CT and MR Lympangiography based&#xD;
      SN localization against the reference standard: the intra-operative sentinel node procedure&#xD;
      (Patent blue and 99mTc).&#xD;

    <description>The difference in concordance (imaging to intra-operative results) between two strategies are compared.&#xD;
The 1st strategy entails preoperative imaging with SPECT-CT and 'standard' intra-operative SN procedure (= with 99mTc use).&#xD;
The 2nd strategy is with preoperative MR lymphangiography and an intra-operative 'blue dye only' SN procedure (= without 99mTc).</description>
