    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effectiveness of two telephone-based psychotherapy (Tel-PT)&#xD;
      interventions for patients with mild to moderate depression. Both interventions consist of&#xD;
      one personal session and weekly to bi-weekly 8-10 telephone sessions with a licensed&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapist accompanied by the study of educational materials and&#xD;
      the completion of regular monitoring questionnaires (total treatment duration: approximately&#xD;
      3 months). Patients are randomized into one of two conditions: Patients in the condition&#xD;
      &quot;Tel-PT including mail&quot; additionally receive a motivating letter from their psychotherapist&#xD;
      after each telephone session, while patients in the condition &quot;Tel-PT without mail&quot; receive&#xD;
      no further interventions. Patients refusing to be randomized are to be assigned to the&#xD;
      condition &quot;Tel-PT without mail&quot;. This study takes place within a larger study evaluating a&#xD;
      stepped care model for depression (01KQ1002B-TP7).&#xD;

      The study aims to compare the effectiveness of two telephone-based psychotherapy (Tel-PT)&#xD;
      interventions for patients with mild to moderate depression. Patients are randomized into one&#xD;
      of two conditions: Patients in the condition &quot;Tel-PT including mail&quot; additionally receive a&#xD;
      motivating letter from their psychotherapist after each telephone session, while patients in&#xD;
      the condition &quot;Tel-PT without mail&quot; receive no further interventions. Patients refusing to be&#xD;
      randomized are to be assigned to the condition &quot;Tel-PT without mail&quot;. This study takes place&#xD;
      within a larger study evaluating a stepped care model for depression (01KQ1002B-TP7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both conditions, patients are referred to telephone-based psychotherapy by their general&#xD;
      physician within the framework of the larger study. Both intervention programs are based on&#xD;
      the translated and adapted German version of a depression-specific program developed by&#xD;
      researchers in Seattle. Both include psycho-educational materials (patient workbook and&#xD;
      therapist manual) and comprise 1 personal session, 8 to 10 telephone contacts (20 to 40&#xD;
      minutes) carried out weekly and in some cases bi-weekly, as well as up to 2 maintenance&#xD;
      therapy telephone sessions for patients responding well to telephone-based psychotherapy (see&#xD;
      monitoring process below). Both programs have a duration of approximately 3 months and follow&#xD;
      a cognitive-behavioral approach with main focus on behavioral activation and cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring and are carried out by licensed cognitive-behavioral psychotherapists receiving&#xD;
      weekly to bi-weekly supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both conditions, depressive symptoms are monitored with the Patient Health Questionnaire&#xD;
      depression module (PHQ-9) at the personal session at baseline and the fourth and eighth&#xD;
      telephone sessions. Additionally, psychotherapists complete non-standardized assessments&#xD;
      regarding general progress and therapeutic alliance after each session. Decisions about&#xD;
      further treatment are to be supported by monitoring results: If symptoms are reduced by at&#xD;
      least 20% from baseline to the fourth telephone session, the following sessions are to be&#xD;
      stretched to a bi-weekly frequency; if not, continued weekly sessions are recommended. If the&#xD;
      PHQ-9-score lies under the cut-off point of 5 by the eighth session, patients are to continue&#xD;
      with maintenance therapy. If the PHQ-9-score remains above the cut-off point, transfer into a&#xD;
      higher-intensity treatment is recommended. For those patients receiving maintenance therapy,&#xD;
      a further monitoring at the end of maintenance therapy is performed and patients above the&#xD;
      PHQ-9 cut-off score are also recommended to transfer to a higher-intensity treatment. In case&#xD;
      of acute suicidality, emergency measures are carried out: e.g. additional psychiatric&#xD;
      treatment in an in- or outpatient setting. Psychotherapists contact the patients' general&#xD;
      physicians at begin and end of treatment, as well as on other occasions if necessary.&#xD;
      Psychotherapists facilitate transferrals to other mental health care specialists within the&#xD;
      stepped care project if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the study condition &quot;Tel-PT including mail&quot; receive a one-page letter from their&#xD;
      psychotherapist after every telephone session. The letter contains motivational messages as&#xD;
      well as a summary of the homework planned during the session and a reminder of the&#xD;
      appointment made for the next session. The letters will usually be received by patients&#xD;
      approximately two to three days after the telephone session and are meant to refresh memory&#xD;
      of and motivation for the planned assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the study condition &quot;Tel-PT without mail&quot; receive no letters from their&#xD;
      psychotherapist.&#xD;
