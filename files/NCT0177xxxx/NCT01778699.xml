      In a previous study the efficacy of Lb CD2 on interim covariates related to caries&#xD;
      development was tested. So, it was decided to plan a new study on schoolchildren from the&#xD;
      same area. The aim of the present research protocol was to evaluate the anticariogenic effect&#xD;
      of probiotics daily used, on the caries development in children. The null hypothesis was that&#xD;
      the probiotic Lb CD2 would not modify the caries risk of the children. Moreover, the study&#xD;
      will be carried out to investigate the plaque acidogenicity in situ following the regular&#xD;
      consumption of a probiotic product compared to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the effect of a regularly consumed probiotic on the development of&#xD;
      new caries lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Double blind, placebo-controlled, longitudinal study, monocentric, national, in&#xD;
      situ&#xD;

      2 RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY In a previous study the efficacy of Lb CD2 on interim covariates&#xD;
      related to caries development was tested. So, it was decided to plan a new study on&#xD;
      schoolchildren from the same area. The aim of the present research protocol was to evaluate&#xD;
      the anticariogenic effect of probiotics daily used, on the caries development in children.&#xD;
      The null hypothesis was that the probiotic Lb CD2 would not modify the caries risk of the&#xD;
      children. Moreover, the study will be carried out to investigate the plaque acidogenicity in&#xD;
      situ following the regular consumption of a probiotic product compared to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regular consumption of probiotic will lead to a significantly lower caries increment&#xD;
      compared to a placebo. Regular oral hygiene is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: Lower caries increment Safety: Determination of side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Determination of side effects Side effects such an especially changes of the oral&#xD;
      mucosa after the consumption of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 STUDY DESIGN 4.1 Study design and study centre Double blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      longitudinal study on 440 test subjects. The study will be carried out at a single centre in&#xD;
      the Department of Surgery, Microsurgery and Medical Sciences -School of Dentistry of the&#xD;
      University of Sassari, Viale San Pietro 43/C Sassari.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned duration of the study is January-February 2013 to March 2015 (with Final Report).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed start of the recruitment of test subjects January-February 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 TEST SUBJECTS 440 healthy male or female chidren test subjects. These will be recruited&#xD;
      from primary schools in Sassari.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Concomitant treatment not permitted In general, other probiotic-containing products,&#xD;
      except dairy products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Permitted concomitant medication All other medications are allowed. However, for the 30&#xD;
      days prior to the screening phase and during the entire study period, they must be entered in&#xD;
      the case report form under the &quot;Concomitant Medication&quot; section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Criteria for premature termination of the study in individual test subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons which may be given for the premature withdrawal of an individual test subject are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retraction of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If continued participation in the study is no longer acceptable or justified on&#xD;
           important medical grounds as assessed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of intolerable side effects (SE) as assessed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Violation of the protocol, according to the decision of the investigator, with reasons&#xD;
           given in writing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-attendance by the test subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of compliance and motivation on the part of the test subject (e.g. not wearing the&#xD;
           intra-oral specimen holder for more than six hours a day) Test subjects who withdraw&#xD;
           from the study prematurely should be subjected to the final examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons for withdrawal from the study and the date must be recorded by the investigator&#xD;
      in the case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Criteria for discontinuing the entire study In particular, the recognition of new&#xD;
      information and/or risks which requires the benefit/risk ratio to be reassessed. In the case&#xD;
      of a negative outcome, the LKP may discontinue the study in discussion with the principal&#xD;
      investigator and the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is inadequate recruitment or persistent or recurrent serious objection to the trial&#xD;
      protocol, the sponsor, in agreement with the LKP and after discussion with the principal&#xD;
      investigator, may decide to terminate the study prematurely for administrative reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the premature termination of the study be unavoidable, measures must be decided upon&#xD;
      and introduced to protect the interests and well-being of the test subjects as far as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 STUDY PRODUCTS 6.1 Test products and placebo The test products for the study is&#xD;
      manufactured and provided by CD Investments srl, Italy. The placebo lozenges will look like&#xD;
      the active lozenges with the same taste and weight of 1 gram containing only the ingredients&#xD;
      listed above in the same proportion as the active but with no L. brevis CD2. It will not be&#xD;
      possible to differentiate the two products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study center and the monitor must be informed of any deficiency in the study products&#xD;
      (products will be kept at 4° degrees during the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Standard toothpaste and toothbrushes Standard toothpaste containing fluoride:&#xD;
      monofluorophosphate containing toothpaste (800/1000 ppm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Packaging and labelling 6.3.1 Test product Before use, the investigator will store the&#xD;
      test samples at 4° degrees temperature. For each subject one container of study medication&#xD;
      for the study period will be delivered, as well as one replacement container in each case.&#xD;
      The test samplesy were produced and supplied by CD investiments (Italy) and coded as either&#xD;
      'green' or 'red'. The code was sealed by an independent monitor, and not broken until the&#xD;
      statistical analysis was finalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Determination of compliance 6.4.1 Test medication The containers will be weighed before&#xD;
      and after the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4.2 Standard toothpaste The test subjects must use the standard toothpaste throughout the&#xD;
      study. A check will be made on compliance by questioning the test subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.5 Documentation on the whereabouts of the test samples The investigator will record the&#xD;
      whereabouts of the test samples in an inventory. Delivery notes and notices of returns will&#xD;
      be signed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 DOSAGE In the treatment phase subjects will use 2 losanges a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 STUDY SCHEDULE AND TEST METHODS 8.1 Study schedule 8.1.1 Planned schedule Prior to the&#xD;
      start of the study, demographic, ethnic and prognostic data will be collected (screening&#xD;
      phase). A medical history will be taken, with documentation of previous and concomitant&#xD;
      treatment and a clinical examination of the oral cavity (dental status, oral mucosa) will be&#xD;
      performed by the investigator. If the test subject meets all the inclusion criteria without&#xD;
      fulfilling any of the exclusion criteria, he/she will be enrolled in the clinical trial and&#xD;
      given a test subject identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All test subjects will receive a patient diary in the screening phase. Individual specimen&#xD;
      holders will now be prepared for each test subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1: (180 days) consumption of the study product, regular oral hygiene At the start of&#xD;
      the period ICDAS score will be recorded with plaque pH and salivary mutans streptococci. All&#xD;
      subjects are instructed about oral hygiene and about the consumption of the study product. At&#xD;
      the 90th day plaque pH and salivary mutans streptococci will be also recorded again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2: (90 days) regular oral hygiene plaque pH and salivary mutans streptococci will be&#xD;
      recorded again. Period 3: (180 days) consumption of the study product, regular oral hygiene&#xD;
      At the start of the period ICDAS score will be recorded with plaque pH and salivary mutans&#xD;
      streptococci. All subjects are instructed about oral hygiene and about the consumption of the&#xD;
      study product. At the 90th day plaque pH and salivary mutans streptococci will be also&#xD;
      recorded again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 4: (90 days) regular oral hygiene plaque pH and salivary mutans streptococci will be&#xD;
      recorded again. Period 5: (180 days) consumption of the study product, regular oral hygiene&#xD;
      At the start of the period ICDAS score will be recorded with plaque pH and salivary mutans&#xD;
      streptococci. All subjects are instructed about oral hygiene and about the consumption of the&#xD;
      study product. At the 90th day plaque pH and salivary mutans streptococci will be also&#xD;
      recorded again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 MATERIALS AND METHODS 9.1 Clinical parameters ICDAS (International Caries Detection and&#xD;
      Assessment System) index, Oral mucosa&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 Investigation of saliva factors Saliva factors pH and flow rate will be measured during&#xD;
      the screening phase on three days, each time in the morning. The mean of the three&#xD;
      measurements will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dentobuff® test kit (Vivadent, Liechtenstein) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3 Teeth brushing technique Test subjects are required to clean their teeth at minimum two&#xD;
      times a day with the fluoride-containing toothpaste and a soft toothbrush. During that time,&#xD;
      a fresh, damp gauze (soaked in water) will be placed in the container each day in order to&#xD;
      provide a moist atmosphere for the appliances. The specimens should not be allowed to dry&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enamel specimens themselves are likewise carefully cleaned with the soft toothbrush&#xD;
      except the last day of every period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.4 Randomization Using a computer program (Excel 2010 for Mac OsX), the randomization will&#xD;
      carried out on an individual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.5 Application of the study product The subjects are not allowed to chew the lozenges. They&#xD;
      are allowed to swallow the lozenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.6 Plaque-pH evaluation At the end of each phase plaque acidogenicity will be assessed using&#xD;
      the MicroTouch technique after a previous sucrose challenge. Evaluations of pH will be&#xD;
      carried out at on each specimen. The pH will be measured in quintuplicate at 6 different time&#xD;
      points: at baseline (before sucrose rinse) and 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min after a 1-min rinse&#xD;
      with 10 ml 10% sucrose, using active movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An iridium touch microelectrode (diameter 0.1 mm; Beetrode NMPH-1, World Precision&#xD;
      Instruments, Sarasota, Fla., USA, with a porous glass reference electrode (MERE 1, World&#xD;
      Precision Instruments) will be used. A salt bridge will be created in a KCl (3 M) solution&#xD;
      between the reference electrode and a finger of the subject. Before each session of pH&#xD;
      evaluation, the electrode will be calibrated using buffer solution at pH 7.00 and 4.00.&#xD;
