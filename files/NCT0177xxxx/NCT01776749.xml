      Aim of the study Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is a clinical entity consisting of&#xD;
      chronic leg and /or back pain due to radicular nerve damage. The effectiveness of Spinal Cord&#xD;
      Stimulation (SCS) in the pain management of patients with FBSS is proven. Patients mostly&#xD;
      have dominant leg pain, however a significant percentage of FBSS patients has a more&#xD;
      pronounced back pain and are commonly excluded from SCS as it is often inadequate in&#xD;
      relieving both the back and leg pain components. Recently some reports showed the benefit of&#xD;
      subcutaneous stimulation (SubQ) for low back pain in patients with FBSS. This has been&#xD;
      confirmed by a feasibility study performed by our group. The aim of the randomized controlled&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effect of SubQ on low back pain in FBSS patients for whom SCS gives&#xD;
      an inadequate back pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that SubQ in addition to SCS in FBSS patients with leg and low back&#xD;
      pain is more effective in treating low back pain (i.e. &gt;50% pain reduction) than SCS alone.&#xD;

      Aim of the study FBSS is a clinical entity consisting of chronic leg and /or back pain due to&#xD;
      radicular nerve damage. The effectiveness of SCS in the pain management of patients with FBSS&#xD;
      is proven. Patients mostly have dominant leg pain, however a significant percentage of FBSS&#xD;
      patients has a more pronounced back pain and are commonly excluded from SCS as it is often&#xD;
      inadequate in relieving both the back and leg pain components. Recently some reports showed&#xD;
      the benefit of subcutaneous stimulation (SubQ) for low back pain in patients with FBSS. This&#xD;
      has been confirmed by a feasibility study performed by our group. The aim of the randomized&#xD;
      controlled study is to evaluate the effect of SubQ on low back pain in FBSS patients for whom&#xD;
      SCS gives an inadequate back pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that SubQ in addition to SCS in FBSS patients with leg and low back&#xD;
      pain is more effective in treating low back pain (i.e. &gt;50% pain reduction) than SCS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and duration of the study The study is a randomized controlled trial. Patients&#xD;
      with FBSS with additional chronic back pain and an intensity of 5 or more for leg and back&#xD;
      pain separately on the visual analogue scale are eligible for the study. About ninety&#xD;
      patients will receive a SCS system targeting to relief leg and back pain. The study group&#xD;
      consists of patients having a pain reduction of ≥50% in the leg after SCS trial stimulation.&#xD;
      If, after trial stimulation, there is less than 50% back pain relief compared with initial&#xD;
      values, patients will receive one or two Quad leads subcutaneously at the time of&#xD;
      implantation of the pulse generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group, a total of 56 patients,will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in which group 1 (n=28)&#xD;
      receives SCS plus non-activated SubQ(SubQ OFF) and group 2 (n=28) receives SCS plus activated&#xD;
      SubQ (SubQ ON) (phase 1), for a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the controlled phase of the study, all 56 patients will receive maximal effective SCS&#xD;
      and SubQ for the rest of the study duration (phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the study for a patient is12 months. Estimated duration of the study is 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons will be made after 3 months between no SubQ OFF and SubQ ON. After 6 and 12&#xD;
      months (phase 2) patients will be compared with their baseline values to explore long term&#xD;
      effects of SCS and SubQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type and number of patients The study will include FBSS patients with leg and low back pain,&#xD;
      failing to relief back pain with SCS. For the controlled part of the study 56 patients are&#xD;
      needed based on a power calculation in which a difference between the two treatments is&#xD;
      postulated of about 40%. To assure this about 90 patients will be included in the study.&#xD;

    <description>Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) and subcutaneous (SubQ) stimulation SCS trial stimulation: Implantation of the Octad lead in the epidural space. The lead implantation in the epidural space is performed under local anesthesia using a standard percutaneous technique. A key element to the technical success of an SCS procedure is the accurate placement of the lead, which results in paresthesia covering the patients' painful areas. This depends on the patients' feedback during intra-operative testing. Therefore, it is important that the patient is awake and fully cooperative during the trial stimulation.</description>
