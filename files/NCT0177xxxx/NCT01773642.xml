  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With increased availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and improved care, increasing&#xD;
      numbers of perinatally infected children are surviving into adolescence. While HIV care and&#xD;
      treatment programs are expanding, growing challenge faced by health providers and caregivers&#xD;
      is diagnosis disclosure to HIV infected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a 4 year project to test the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioural intervention that the investigators have designed to support&#xD;
      developmentally appropriate disclosure to HIV infected children by their caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will lead to increased disclosure rates&#xD;
      and will over time improve health and mental health outcomes among caregivers and children in&#xD;
      the intervention group compared to those receiving standard care. The findings of the study&#xD;
      will inform Ugandan and other countries' national policies on pediatric HIV care and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the end of 2009, there were an estimated 2.1 million children &lt; 15 years living with HIV,&#xD;
      with almost 90% residing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In Uganda alone there are an estimated&#xD;
      150,000 HIV-infected children. Although disclosing to a child that he or she is infected with&#xD;
      HIV is an important and integral part of providing comprehensive HIV medical care, studies&#xD;
      conducted in SSA have indicated that only 2% to 37.8% of HIV-infected children &lt; 15 years&#xD;
      know their HIV status. Studies by the investigators' team and others have revealed a high&#xD;
      demand by both caregivers and children for health provider-facilitated communication about&#xD;
      HIV and disclosure to HIV-infected children. In Uganda despite the rapid expansion of HIV&#xD;
      services for children, very few health providers receive formal training in how to support&#xD;
      disclosure of an HIV diagnosis to an infected child. Despite the existence of international&#xD;
      and national recommendations for disclosure there are no tested models for supporting&#xD;
      caregivers and HIV-infected children in SSA through the process of disclosure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to test the effectiveness of an innovative cognitive-behavioural&#xD;
      intervention designed to support developmentally appropriate disclosure to HIV-infected&#xD;
      children by their caregiver. The proposed intervention builds on the investigators' team's&#xD;
      prior research is informed by a cognitive behavioral perspective, as well as the Disclosure&#xD;
      Processes Model. The investigators will also adapt components of a multi-faceted program for&#xD;
      caregivers of HIV-infected children, developed by members of the investigators' team with&#xD;
      funding support from the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavior intervention for increasing&#xD;
           disclosure of children's HIV diagnosis by caregivers to their HIV-infected children age&#xD;
           7-12 years old in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of disclosure on immediate and longer-term caregiver and child&#xD;
           mental health, and child behavioral and clinical outcomes, and whether the intervention&#xD;
           modifies these effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the incremental cost, health impact, and cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
           intervention&#xD;
