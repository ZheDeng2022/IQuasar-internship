      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects (good and bad) on subjects and&#xD;
      their cancer using standard chemotherapy in combination with hypofractionated proton&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Hypofractionation is a technique that delivers higher daily doses of&#xD;
      radiation over a shorter period of time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional fractionated photon-based radiotherapy to 60-63 Gy at 1.8-2 Gy/fraction with&#xD;
      concurrent chemotherapy remains the standard treatment practice in patients with stage III&#xD;
      non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with local control rates of approximately 50% and a&#xD;
      median overall survival of just 18 months.Unfortunately, even the standard treatment has&#xD;
      significant toxicity with approximately 40% of patients developing grade 3 or higher acute&#xD;
      toxicities in the RTOG 9410 study.1 These outcomes are poor and more effective treatment&#xD;
      regimens are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Higher doses of radiation have been hypothesized to improve local control in patients with&#xD;
      stage III NSCLC. This is expected to translate into better overall survival.Given the&#xD;
      significant improvements in outcome in patients receiving hypofractionation for stage I&#xD;
      NSCLC, perhaps similar gains could be achieved if hypofractionated radiotherapy could be&#xD;
      safely delivered to stage II-III NSCLC with concurrent chemotherapy. Hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy may offer improvement in local control compared with conventional fractionation&#xD;
      that may translate into improved overall survival. Furthermore, hypofractionation will&#xD;
      shorten the time interval during which patients are receiving less aggressive chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Proton therapy is a highly conformal radiotherapy technique that takes advantage of the&#xD;
      proton's characteristic Bragg Peak, resulting in significant reductions in the exit dose of&#xD;
      the treatment beam. Thus, proton therapy can substantially reduce the dose to critical&#xD;
      structures even compared with IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of delivering hypofractionated proton&#xD;
      therapy with concurrent chemotherapy in patients with stage II-III NSCLC&#xD;
