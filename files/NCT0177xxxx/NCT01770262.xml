      Lack in vitamin D reduces the absorption of calcium in the body, accelerates bone loss and&#xD;
      may increase the risk of fractures due to osteoporosis. An algorithm that will allow&#xD;
      immediate and non-invasive quantification of vitamin D levels will shorten the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis, reduce lab costs and prevent hazards or discomfort to the patient associated with&#xD;
      a blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is therefore to develop a non-invasive method for quantifying vitamin D&#xD;
      levels in the body using spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 subjects will be recruited: 20 hospitalized patients in the rehabilitation department,&#xD;
      diagnosed with osteoporosis and 20 healthy subjects. Spectroscopy will be used with visible&#xD;
      light on the subject's skin and middle infrared (MIR) on the blood sample to find correlation&#xD;
      with the chemical lab test results.&#xD;

      Lack in vitamin D reduces the absorption of calcium in the body, accelerates bone loss and&#xD;
      may increase the risk of fractures due to osteoporosis. Vitamin D can be ingested by foods&#xD;
      and specific supplements, but the main source for the vitamin is its synthesis in the skin by&#xD;
      using sun radiation. Today, quantification of vitamin D levels is performed using a blood&#xD;
      test. Mostly, the physician will send the patient to check the levels and vitamin D if he&#xD;
      suffers from osteoporosis, hypertension, renal impairment, suspected for activity of the&#xD;
      thyroid gland, tuberculosis or sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that it is possible to quantify the different elements in the contents of&#xD;
      the blood, such as melanin and hemoglobin, using spectroscopy of the skin (Zonios et al,&#xD;
      2001; Tseng et al, 2009), but to the investigators' knowledge, the identification of levels&#xD;
      and vitamin D in similar means has not been reported in professional literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this research: an algorithm that will allow immediate and non-invasive&#xD;
      quantification of vitamin D levels will shorten the time of diagnosis, reduce lab costs and&#xD;
      prevent hazards or discomfort to the patient associated with a blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is therefore to develop a non-invasive method for quantifying vitamin&#xD;
      D levels in the body using spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 subjects aged 18-65 will be recruited for this research: 20 patients be recruited from the&#xD;
      population of patients in the rehabilitation department who were diagnosed with osteoporosis.&#xD;
      Also, 20 healthy subjects will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be able to understand the study protocol and sign a consent form&#xD;
      independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will look for a correlation between the results of&#xD;
      conventional blood test for detection of vitamin D levels in the blood and the results of&#xD;
      measurements of spectral examinations that will be performed on various locations on the&#xD;
      upper body of the subject. These measurements will take place in Hillel Yaffe Medical Center&#xD;
      as the subject arrives to the chemistry lab for the blood test. Visible light spectrometer&#xD;
      (manufactured by Ocean Optics, USB 2000 model), connected to an optical fiber (manufactured&#xD;
      by Ocean Optics, diameter 1mm) will be used. The measurement will use a light source&#xD;
      (Fiberoptics Technology Inc. company., Model SOL-R 150) connected also to an optical fiber.&#xD;
      Both ends of the fiber will be positioned on the upper body of the patient one of two&#xD;
      configurations: for areas with greater thickness, e.g. the forearm, the fibers would be&#xD;
      placed next to each other on the same side of the limb to measure the return of the light,&#xD;
      and in areas with smaller tissue thickness, e.g. finger tip, the fibers will be placed to&#xD;
      both sides of an organ and record light transmission through the target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the investigators will attempt to find correlation between the spectral analysis&#xD;
      results of the visible wavelengths and the blood test. Then the investigators will further&#xD;
      compare the subjects' blood samples using FTIR spectrometer in the mid infrared (device&#xD;
      manufactured by Oriel, Model MIR8025). The device is equipped with plug-ATR (Attenuated Total&#xD;
      Reflectance) and allows testing of a small sample of fluids. Vials of samples delivered to&#xD;
      Rupin on foil-wrapped test using a cooler with ice will be tested in Ruppin on the day of&#xD;
      extraction. The samples will be disposed of as biological waste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will arrive at the lab at Hillel Yaffe Medical Center. the subject will read and&#xD;
      sign an informed consent form for participation in the study. The subject will fill out a&#xD;
      short questionnaire reporting on the nature of sun exposure, dietary habits and chronic&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then two tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood test for vitamin D levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test using the spectrometer: two fiber optic guided by the researchers on different&#xD;
           places on the torso of the patient, when one side of the fiber optic is connected to a&#xD;
           light source and the anther optical fiber end is connected to the spectrometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no expected risk or discomfort to the subject beyond the risk associated with&#xD;
      regular blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectral test to be held Ruppin on the patient's blood samples, as described in the methods,&#xD;
      and will not require the presence of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several algorithms will be developed to be used on the spectral database, in order to&#xD;
      identify individuals suffering from vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data processing will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Statistical analyzes will be carried out using regression methods to find correlation&#xD;
           between the level of vitamin D quantified with laboratory chemical test of the blood and&#xD;
           spectral measurements in the visible light as performed at the hospital in different&#xD;
           areas of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Statistical analyzes will be carried out using regression methods to find correlation&#xD;
           between the level of vitamin D quantified with laboratory chemical test of the blood and&#xD;
           spectral measurements in middle infrared (MIR), as performed on blood samples taken from&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The tested population will be divided into two groups according to the blood test&#xD;
           results: subjects defined as having vitamin D deficiency and subjects classified as&#xD;
           having normal vitamin D levels. Clustering methods of analysis will be carried out, such&#xD;
           as PCA and LDA, to find distinguishing characteristic between the two populations.&#xD;
