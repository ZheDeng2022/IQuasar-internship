  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a disease of great frequency and is a major public health problem. In&#xD;
      Lebanon, the incidence of diabetes is estimated at 12%, it is expected to double by the year&#xD;
      2025. Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes in Lebanon, the evolution of complications&#xD;
      of this disease and the lack of studies at this level, it is appropriate to conduct a study&#xD;
      that aims to evaluate the effects an education program for people with type 2 diabetes on&#xD;
      their sense of self-efficacy and their ability to self-manage their disease to make them the&#xD;
      most optimal therapeutic adherence possible. The design of this study is experimental type&#xD;
      before / after randomization by diabetic patients. Education program delivered to the&#xD;
      experimental group is the &quot;Accu-Chek Education Program&quot; of Roche. Membership will be assessed&#xD;
      using a biomarker HbA1c should be &lt;7%, and a questionnaire (Summary of Diabetes Self-Care&#xD;
      Activities Measure), which measures self-care behaviors. Self-efficacy is measured using the&#xD;
      Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale. And this before the intervention and 3 months later.&#xD;
      The sample will be 240 diabetic patients T2. Recruitment will be in outpatient diabetology a&#xD;
      Hospital located in Beirut. Statistical analyzes used for descriptive variables are measures&#xD;
      of central tendency, dispersion and frequency distribution. T-test and chi-square will be&#xD;
      used to compare the socio-demographic characteristics of the 2 groups, experimental and&#xD;
      control. To test hypotheses and determine the difference in the results of the dependent&#xD;
      variables of the 2 groups, analysis of variance and covariance are used. The data will be&#xD;
      processed using SPSS version 14.0.&#xD;

      1. Following the implementation of a program of education, feeling of self-efficacy&#xD;
           participants will be higher in the experimental group than in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Following the implementation of a program of education, self-management behaviors:&#xD;
           monitoring the diet, the practice of physical exercise, self-monitoring blood sugar,&#xD;
           taking medications and care feet, participants will be higher in the experimental group&#xD;
           than in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Following the implementation of a program of education, the percentage of participants&#xD;
           who have an HbA1c less than 7 will be higher in the experimental group than in the&#xD;
           control group.&#xD;

    <description>education program in 6 hours for groups of 10 people. The content will be divided into 2 sessions with an interval of 2 weeks, the duration of each session is 3 hours. Means active learning, teaching materials in Arabic accompany the content masterful discussions on flipcharts, situation analysis, computer-assisted presentation, demonstration, 150 photos of Lebanese dishes. After, patients receive a 10-page illustrated book, a logbook of diabetes control. 2 weeks after the second education session, each participant will receive 5 calls every 15 days in 2 months. During each call, the research assistant will ask the patient about diet, exercise and self-monitoring, medication and foot care and this according to a checklist.</description>
