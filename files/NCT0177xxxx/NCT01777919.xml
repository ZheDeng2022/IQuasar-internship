  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults.&#xD;
      Despite maximal treatment tumor relapse occurs regularly accompanied by unfavourable&#xD;
      prognosis. Among other reasons, it is believed that this could be in part due to the&#xD;
      existence of the so-called tumor stem cells (TSCs), a cellular subfraction within GBM which&#xD;
      escape therapy by being highly resistant to irradiation and chemotherapy and thus&#xD;
      constituting the source of tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBM, like many other cancers, show a sub-population of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)&#xD;
      overexpressing TSCs. More specifically, ALDH1A1, a cytoplasmatic isoform of ALDH, proved to&#xD;
      be a novel stem cell marker in human GBM. In addition, ALDH1A1 has been shown to be a&#xD;
      mediator for resistance of GBM to temozolomide (TMZ) and a reliable predictor of clinical&#xD;
      outcome; prognosis of patients with a high level of ALDH1A1 expression was poor compared with&#xD;
      that of patients with low levels. Consequently, ALDH1A1 may serve as a potential target to&#xD;
      improve treatment of human GBM through inhibition of the enzyme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disulfiram (DSF) has been used for more than sixty years in the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      alcoholism because of the unpleasant symptoms it provokes after ethanol intake. The&#xD;
      underlying mechanism is believed to be the accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood, due to&#xD;
      inhibition of the liver ALDHs. Actually, DSF is a strong inhibitor of ALDH1A1 and relatively&#xD;
      non-toxic at therapeutic (for chronic alcoholism) doses that can penetrate the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier. In addition, DSF has been shown to be cytotoxic on GBM stem-like cells, inhibiting&#xD;
      the growth of TMZ resistant GBM cells and blocking self-renewal by ~100% , while it has been&#xD;
      identified as an inhibitor of human GBM stem cells in high-throughput chemical screens.&#xD;
      Interestingly, a number of these actions were copper-dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current Phase II clinical trial, DSF/copper combination will be tested as an&#xD;
      adjunctive and concurrent chemotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. According to&#xD;
      our hypothesis, initiation of DSF chemotherapy after the resection of the tumor and before&#xD;
      the introduction of the standard radio-chemotherapy will inhibit ALDH1A1 of GBM TSCs making&#xD;
      them more susceptible to radio-chemotherapy and possibly reducing the recurrence rate of GBM.&#xD;
      On the other hand, the addition of copper will probably enhance the cytotoxic effects of DSF&#xD;
      possibly through augmentation of its pro-apoptotic and proteasomal inhibitory actions.&#xD;

    <description>Disulfiram/copper combination will be started on the 5th postoperative day and before the initiation of the standard radiochemotherapy (fractionated irradiation with a total dose of 60 Gy with concomitant 75 mg/m2 body surface temozolomide each day, including weekends, during irradiation). After completion of the radiation therapy patients will receive maintenance temozolomide 150-200 mg/m2 body surface on Days 1-5 every 28 days for 6 months. Daily administration of disulfiram and copper will take place for the whole study period.&#xD;
NOTE: Patients may receive additional maintenance temozolomide at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist.</description>
