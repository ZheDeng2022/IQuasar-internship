      1. Background Multidisciplinary trauma teams reduce mortality and have become an important&#xD;
           part of modern trauma care. Activation of the trauma team (TTA) when receiving patients&#xD;
           with potentially severe injuries and protocols for TTA, are widely implemented&#xD;
           throughout Scandinavia. Trauma team activation guidelines vary somewhat among&#xD;
           Scandinavian trauma centers, but resemble the recommendations from the American College&#xD;
           of Surgery - Committee On Trauma (ACS-COT). The criteria are based on parameters of&#xD;
           physiologic compromise, anatomic injury classification, and mechanism of injury (MOI).&#xD;
           They are designed to prevent undue delay of vital care as the trauma team is activated&#xD;
           when prehospital information indicates that at least one of the TTA criteria is&#xD;
           fulfilled. A substantial overtriage (activation of the trauma team despite only minor or&#xD;
           moderate injury) is common and may reach 70%, mostly reflecting the limited precision of&#xD;
           criteria relating to MOI. Overtriage is mainly a resource problem, as assembly of the&#xD;
           multidisciplinary trauma team diverts personnel from other important activities in the&#xD;
           hospital. Undertriage delays diagnosis and treatment of severely injured patients and&#xD;
           may compromise the clinical outcome and even increase mortality. ACS-COT suggests that&#xD;
           an overtriage as high as 50% is acceptable in order to minimize undertriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Triage criteria should be adapted to the local case-load and injury pattern, which may&#xD;
           vary considerably between geographical regions. The predictive properties of triage&#xD;
           criteria depend on the prevalence of severe injuries. Typical for most Scandinavian&#xD;
           trauma hospitals is a predominance of blunt over penetrating injuries. Furthermore, the&#xD;
           frequency of severe polytrauma admissions is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In 2011, we published an evaluation of the trauma team activation protocol in our&#xD;
           hospital, leading to a change in the criteria. This study represents an evaluation of&#xD;
           those changes and also addresses whether there may be a potential for further&#xD;
           improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim of the study The aim of the study is to establish the predictive properties of our&#xD;
           TTA protocol, and its individual criteria, and if possible to suggest changes that&#xD;
           reduce over- and undertriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will also give an overview of the frequency and type of emergency procedures&#xD;
           at a university hospital trauma center, which can contribute to optimal resource use and&#xD;
           indicate which type of surgical skills are necessary in our trauma emergency procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Method Identification of patients and inclusion-/exclusion criteria The trauma register&#xD;
           at UNN Tromsø registers all patients admitted with TTA. Also included are patients with&#xD;
           penetrating injury to the head/neck/torso/extremities proximal for elbow or knee, all&#xD;
           patients with New Injury Severity Score (NISS) &gt;12 and all patients with a head injury&#xD;
           with AIS≥3. Excluded from the trauma register are patients with a chronic subdural&#xD;
           hematoma, and patients with injuries from drowning, inhalation and asphyxia&#xD;
           (strangulation/hanging).&#xD;
&#xD;
           From the patients in the trauma register in the time period 1.2.2013 - 31.01.2015, we&#xD;
           will identify and include patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection Almost all necessary data will be available from the trauma register.&#xD;
           Criteria used for activation of the trauma team, is not registered in the trauma&#xD;
           registry, and hence, will be registered from the documentation in the emergency medical&#xD;
           dispatch centre (AMK) in Tromsø.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Classification of injuries All injuries will be classified according to the Abbreviated&#xD;
           Injury Scale (AIS)) and the extent of injuries will be classified with the Injury&#xD;
           Severity Scale (ISS). Both classifications will be performed by authorized registrars.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Triage The TTA protocol is evaluated against two standards, ISS and emergency procedure.&#xD;
           Triage is considered correct when ISS&gt;15 or an emergency procedure is performed aimed at&#xD;
           stabilizing respiration or circulation. Overtriage is defined as the fraction of TTA&#xD;
           where the patients are not severely injured (ISS≤15) or did not receive an emergency&#xD;
           procedure. Undertriage is defined as the fraction of severely injured (ISS&gt;15) or an&#xD;
           emergency procedure was performed, and the patient was admitted without TTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The ability of a criterion to predict severe trauma and/or need for an emergency&#xD;
           procedure, is given as the percentage of patients that fulfilled the specific criterion&#xD;
           that also had an ISS &gt;15 and/or were subject to an emergency procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis Previously, there was an undertriage of 12 % and an overtriage at UNN Tromsø&#xD;
           of 70 %. On the 01.04.2011, the trauma team activation protocol at UNN Tromsø was&#xD;
           revised, and of the previously 27 criteria, five criteria had been removed. We plan to&#xD;
           assess if the current protocol has lead to an improvement in under- and overtriage. We&#xD;
           also want to identify criteria which are seldom used (&lt; 5 % of patients) and/or with a&#xD;
           low positive predictive value (&lt; 10 %), and these criteria will be considered omitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A last hypothesis is to analyze if &quot;walking wounded&quot; is safe to admit without mobilizing&#xD;
           the trauma team (a &quot;walking wounded&quot; patient is an injured patient with no loss of&#xD;
           conscience and is up and walking on his own), given that there is enough prehospital&#xD;
           information to assess this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Design The study is a prospective cohort study, based on data from the trauma register&#xD;
           at UNN Tromsø.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline characteristics for included patients are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  sex&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  age&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mechanism of injury&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  classification of injuries with AIS and ISS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  transfer from other hospitals&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome parameters include&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  type and frequency of emergency procedures performed at the local hospital and at&#xD;
                UNN Tromsø&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Criteria used for trauma team activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
           Emergency procedures includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Chest tube insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemostatic surgery in the abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemostatic surgery in the pelvis with packing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Thoracotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary stabilization of fractures (external fixation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Endotracheal intubation (our addition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical methods Simple statistical methods like frequency, mean, median and&#xD;
           percentage will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Study group Supervisor is dr.med. Kristian Bartnes, Avd. for hjerte-/lunge-/karkirurgi,&#xD;
           UNN.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Coworkers are dr.med. Knut Fredriksen, Akuttmedisinsk avd. UNN; cand.med. Svein Arne&#xD;
           Monsen, Anestesiavd. UNN and cand.med. Trond Dehli, Gastrokirurgisk avd, UNN.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Trond Dehli is responsible for the practical follow-up of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Time Schedule Data collection will start 1.2.13 and continue until 31.01.15. Since&#xD;
           registration of data in the trauma registry most likely will be delayed by 2-12 weeks,&#xD;
           the registration of data will continue until all patients in the registry are completed.&#xD;
           Presentation of the study in the form abstract/posters and a manuscript will be written&#xD;
           during 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Ethics and publication The protocol will be sent to the regional ethical committee for&#xD;
           approval. We plan to present the results in national and international conferences, and&#xD;
           also in a peer-reviewed medical journal.&#xD;
