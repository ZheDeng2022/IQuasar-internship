  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaplastic thyroid cancer has historically proven very difficult to research due to a&#xD;
      combination of its rarity and the associated short survival period for those affected. In&#xD;
      2009, 2340 patients in the UK were diagnosed with thyroid cancer with 70-90 expected to be&#xD;
      the anaplastic subtype 1,2. For these patients average life expectancy is in the range of 2-6&#xD;
      months with only a very small number surviving for more than one year. It is a highly&#xD;
      aggressive form of cancer that is refractory to current treatment options. By collecting&#xD;
      tissue and blood samples along with clinical data across the UK we will be able to accumulate&#xD;
      numerically significant numbers of samples and data points which will facilitate research&#xD;
      opportunities. Researchers will be encouraged to apply for access to the collected samples in&#xD;
      order to try and establish the causal mechanisms for disease development, potential&#xD;
      therapeutic targets and to relate clinical course and outcome with specific molecular&#xD;
      defects. Due to the rarity it is not feasible for a single cancer centre or cancer network to&#xD;
      accumulate sufficient samples for research in a meaningful timeframe hence the need for&#xD;
      national collaboration in order to try and offer patients with this disease hope in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All UK patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer would be potentially eligible. The project is&#xD;
      expected to run for at least 15 years and all thyroid cancer clinicians will be encouraged to&#xD;
      participate. Patients will be asked to donate surplus thyroid cancer tissue following routine&#xD;
      biopsy procedures along with an optional blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives The primary objective of this project is to establish a national&#xD;
      anaplastic thyroid cancer tissue collection to help facilitate both basic and translational&#xD;
      research opportunities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no direct research question that the project itself addresses at this stage. The&#xD;
      research proposals that subsequently arise as a result of this project will be generated by&#xD;
      accredited research parties from the UK and potentially internationally. These research&#xD;
      proposals will be submitted to the interNational Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Tissue Bank and&#xD;
      Database Project (iNATT) Steering Committee for assessment. As the volume of material&#xD;
      collected per patient is expected to be of small volume, by virtue of the specimen comprising&#xD;
      core biopsy or fine needle aspirate material, research proposals will need to be prioritised&#xD;
      according to the potential benefits the proposed research offers. Priority will be given to&#xD;
      projects that may lead to the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Each research&#xD;
      proposal will require their own ethical approval and research and development assessments&#xD;
      before commencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The steering committee will be multidisciplinary and will include nationally respected&#xD;
      researchers and thyroid cancer clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Justification The long term objective is to try and address the current lack of&#xD;
      understanding about the aetiology and progression of this disease and ultimately to develop&#xD;
      new therapeutic interventions that may slow the rate of disease progression, improve quality&#xD;
      of life and prolong what is currently a very short survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the short prognosis following diagnosis it is notoriously difficult to run&#xD;
      interventional therapeutic clinical trials in this patient population. Patients usually&#xD;
      present with locally advanced and metastatic disease and as a consequence are often of poor&#xD;
      performance status making clinical trial participation very problematic. If potential&#xD;
      therapeutic targets could be identified in vivo it would potentially open up new therapeutic&#xD;
      avenues whilst sparing some patients with the 'wrong' molecular profile futile treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a unique project within the setting of anaplastic thyroid cancer research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design and methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATC patients will be identified by thyroid cancer specialists (including endocrine surgeons,&#xD;
      head and neck cancer surgeons, clinical oncologists, endocrinologists, pathologists,&#xD;
      radiologists, clinical nurse specialists) working in thyroid cancer multidisciplinary teams&#xD;
      (MDTs) across the UK Cancer Networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached by a member of the MDT and provided with a patient information&#xD;
      leaflet on the interNational Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Tissue Bank and Database project.&#xD;
      Following discussion and adequate time to consider the project, the patient will be invited&#xD;
      to participate and to provide their written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be sought for thyroid tissue collection, blood sample collection as well as&#xD;
      collection of anonymised clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the majority of patients will be willing to participate as their own care&#xD;
      will be unchanged but they have the potential to help future patients in the same difficult&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As entry into the study will not affect the patient's own care there is no time limit after&#xD;
      diagnosis in which participation can be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval has been granted for qualifying relatives of deceased patients to be able to&#xD;
      consent for their family member's already collected thyroid tissue and clinical information&#xD;
      to be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the majority of the patients will not have anaplastic thyroid cancer that is amenable to&#xD;
      total thyroidectomy the tissue specimen collection will usually entail diagnostic core&#xD;
      biopsies or fine needle aspirates from the thyroid gland. The tissue specimens will initially&#xD;
      be used for histological diagnosis at the local hospital and any spare tissue will then&#xD;
      subsequently be sent to the Wales Cancer Bank (WCB) 3. In the minority of patients who&#xD;
      undergo some form of thyroid resection, tissue blocks and possibly slides will be sent for&#xD;
      storage at WCB once the initial diagnostic work is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optional EDTA blood samples will also be collected and sent to WCB. Patients will ideally&#xD;
      provide both tissue and blood samples but can opt to submit one or other specimen type if&#xD;
      they prefer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multidisciplinary steering committee will be established to oversee the running of the&#xD;
      project and to review subsequent independently submitted research proposals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline Case Report Form (CRF) will be completed and forwarded to WCB. Where consent has&#xD;
      been given for the collection of clinical data this will be entered on to a secure database&#xD;
      by the Chief Investigator, Dr Moss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As ATC comprises a heterogeneous group of histological appearances that often prove difficult&#xD;
      to accurately diagnose, a central pathological review process will be implemented to ensure&#xD;
      uniform pathological reporting. An opportunity for molecular profiling of individual tumours&#xD;
      will also be considered at this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome data will be requested at 6, 12, 18months and annually thereafter. However as the&#xD;
      prognosis is generally poor with current treatment options, outcome data collection is&#xD;
      unlikely to extend beyond 6 months in the majority of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATC disease trajectory, response to treatment and outcomes (Progression Free Survival and&#xD;
      Overall Survival) will be correlated with histological appearance and molecular profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient identifiable data will only be accessible at the referring centre by the clinical&#xD;
      team caring for the patient but not at the interNational ATC Tissue Bank. Each patient will&#xD;
      be allocated a unique identification number by WCB and all stored data and specimens will use&#xD;
      this for reference only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown with the currently available UK data on thyroid cancer incidence precisely how&#xD;
      many cases of anaplastic thyroid arise annually. It is estimated that 70-90 new cases are&#xD;
      diagnosed per year. The research project is expected to run for between 5 and 10 years in the&#xD;
      first instance to allow a significant number of patients to be included in the project.&#xD;
      Funding has been secured from Thyroid Cancer Support Group- Wales5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer who are able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with foci of anaplastic thyroid cancer within a more differentiated thyroid&#xD;
           cancer who are able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with non anaplastic thyroid cancer including medullary thyroid cancer,&#xD;
           papillary thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, thyroid lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be discussed and identified at a thyroid cancer or head and neck cancer&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team meeting. Identification may arise from pathologist, radiologist,&#xD;
      clinicians or clinical nurse specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the expected short survival of this patient group it would be prospective&#xD;
      identification of patients and not a retrospective review of previous cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached by a member of the team either on an inpatient ward or in the out&#xD;
      patient clinic only once the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient is aware of their diagnosis&#xD;
      and have had sufficient time to come to terms with the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment and Registration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid cancer and who are aware of their&#xD;
      diagnosis and able to provide informed consent would be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate patients would receive a verbal explanation of the study in the first instance&#xD;
      followed by a written information leaflet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient would then be given as much time as they need to decide if they wish to&#xD;
      participate. For those wishing to proceed, a member of the thyroid cancer multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team will go through the consent process and consent form with them. They will answer any&#xD;
      questions and highlight the optional parts of the study. The patient would be given a copy of&#xD;
      the consent form including contact details for the local thyroid cancer team lead and the&#xD;
      Chief Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No patients from vulnerable groups would be approached. Information on the tissue bank and&#xD;
      database project will be posted on the Thyroid Cancer Forum-UK (TCF-UK) and Thyroid Cancer&#xD;
      Support Group- Wales websites as well as announced at national and international thyroid&#xD;
      cancer meetings and in the medical press. Other UK thyroid cancer patient support groups will&#xD;
      be kept informed of the project as they will be in contact with anaplastic thyroid cancer&#xD;
      patients and their families. The project will also be registered and displayed on the&#xD;
      www.clinicaltrials.gov website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Collection and Storage&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the vast majority of patients will already have had biopsies or Fine&#xD;
      Needle Aspirates (FNA) taken from their thyroid gland in order to make the diagnosis in which&#xD;
      case it is these samples that will be sent to the tissue bank. Occasionally diagnostic&#xD;
      biopsies will have been retrieved from anatomical sites other than the thyroid gland&#xD;
      including, but not confined to, cervical lymph nodes and distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only tissue samples that are no longer required by the local pathology department will be&#xD;
      sent to the tissue bank. Due to the usual short prognosis for patients with this disease it&#xD;
      is not expected that the local pathology department will need to request the samples back in&#xD;
      order to undertake any further investigations at a later date in the patient's cancer&#xD;
      journey. However if this situation does arise then any unused samples will be returned as&#xD;
      requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be asked if they wish to donate an optional EDTA blood sample as part of the&#xD;
      research project and this sample will be taken when possible at the same time as any routine&#xD;
      clinically indicated blood samples to reduce the number of venepuncture procedures required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Storage&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked if they wish for a summary of their clinical history including&#xD;
      details on their mode of presentation, any treatment interventions and complications (such as&#xD;
      requiring a tracheostomy or enteral feeding tube) to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's local thyroid cancer team will be responsible for liaising with the iNATT&#xD;
      project/Wales Cancer Bank to attribute a unique identifier number to each study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' initials and unique identifier number will be used to identify subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Wales Cancer Bank (WCB) processes confidential and valuable data. The WCB Security Policy&#xD;
      aims to protect data against loss or destruction, and unauthorised access or modification. It&#xD;
      also ensures data integrity will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical data is stored on a secure website server. The national data is only accessible&#xD;
      by Dr Laura Moss (iNATT Chief Investigator). The patient's local team can only access data on&#xD;
      their own patients and not patients registered elsewhere in the UK. Data fields collected&#xD;
      include patient initials, iNATT unique identifier number, gender and date of birth. This&#xD;
      information is required in order to nationally assess age and gender distribution and to&#xD;
      correlate with treatment received and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research into anaplastic thyroid cancer has been thwarted by a combination of its rarity and&#xD;
      poor prognosis. A rare disease is often quoted as having an incidence of &lt;2 cases per 100,000&#xD;
      and anaplastic thyroid cancer has an incidence of only 0.17 per 100,000 in Europe. The rarity&#xD;
      means it is very difficult to carry out prospective research without collaboration amongst&#xD;
      thyroid cancer teams. This project is designed to involve thyroid cancer multidisciplinary&#xD;
      teams across the UK and will seek to approach as many patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer&#xD;
      as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has been discussed from an early stage with the National Cancer Research&#xD;
      Institute Thyroid Cancer subgroup and has its support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient involvement in the project development was sought at an early stage from the two UK&#xD;
      thyroid cancer specific patient organisations, Butterfly Thyroid Cancer Trust and Thyroid&#xD;
      Cancer Support Group-Wales. The latter charity has subsequently committed themselves to&#xD;
      funding the entire project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the recruitment rate will be high as the patient will not need to&#xD;
      undergo any additional invasive procedure other than a blood test which is optional. Patients&#xD;
      will be aware that this is a rare disease with currently no effective therapy and short&#xD;
      prognosis so it is anticipated that there will be altruistic donations for the benefit of&#xD;
      future patients who face the same diagnosis. Patients will be approached by members of their&#xD;
      local thyroid cancer multidisciplinary team who are experienced in the management of this&#xD;
      disease and who have appropriate experience in consent procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected in accordance with the Caldicott Principles and patient identifiable&#xD;
      data will be very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in the project face no physical risk as a result of their&#xD;
      participation in the project. Due to the anticipated timescale for collection of tissue and&#xD;
      data it is expected to take a minimum of several years before any meaningful outcomes will be&#xD;
      achieved. The poor prognosis of the disease means that the project participants are unlikely&#xD;
      to be alive when the subsequent research projects come to fruition and will not therefore&#xD;
      benefit directly from participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient information leaflet explains the project objectives both in terms of what is&#xD;
      being asked of the individual patient in terms of donation of tissue, blood and data and also&#xD;
      stipulates that the samples will be stored pending submission of future research proposals&#xD;
      from respected researchers which will have the necessary ethical approvals and will be&#xD;
      scrutinised by the interNational Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Tissue Bank and Database (iNATT)&#xD;
      steering committee. Patients will be able to withdraw their consent at any stage, without&#xD;
      needing to provide a reason and will be made aware that any unused samples will either be&#xD;
      returned to their local hospital or disposed of in accordance with the Human Tissue Authority&#xD;
      code of practice and their data will be removed from the database. The issue of consent&#xD;
      withdrawal is not expected to be a significant problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human tissue disposal It is recognised that all donations to the iNATT project are altruistic&#xD;
      and patients are free to withdraw consent without reason at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are advised, at the time of consent, that some of their samples may already have&#xD;
      been used by the time they wish to withdraw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is acknowledged that the disposal of human tissue is a sensitive area and the project will&#xD;
      comply with the Human Tissue Authority code of practice, 'The removal, storage and disposal&#xD;
      of human organs and tissue'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Approval The project will be conducted in accordance with the World Medical&#xD;
      Association, Declaration of Helsinki (2008 version) and in accordance with the terms and&#xD;
      conditions of the ethical approval given to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Velindre University NHS Trust Research and Development Department will be responsible for&#xD;
      organising Material Transfer Agreements between Velindre University NHS Trust and each Tissue&#xD;
      Collection Centre. Individual investigators will liaise with their local R&amp;D departments.&#xD;
      They are then responsible for recruiting patients, adhering to the most recent version of the&#xD;
      protocol and collection of data on the case report forms (CRFs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be overseen by a multidisciplinary steering committee comprising clinical&#xD;
      oncologists, Wales Cancer Bank manager, Velindre University NHS Trust R&amp;D management, thyroid&#xD;
      cancer scientists and pathologists. The committee will review the tissue sample collection in&#xD;
      terms of central pathology review to ensure consistency, rate of national recruitment, number&#xD;
      of centres participating and any potential limitations to patient recruitment into the&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any publications or presentations arising directly as a result of this project will&#xD;
      acknowledge all contributing investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to facilitate research opportunities into this difficult disease&#xD;
      which historically has been difficult to research due to the combination of its rarity and&#xD;
      overall poor prognosis. By utilising a national tissue and data resource model a significant&#xD;
      number of patients and samples can be studied in a realistic research timeframe. The project&#xD;
      has the potential to help with our understanding of the disease aetiology and to open new&#xD;
      avenues for treatment interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the patient participating in this project they will be agreeing to any surplus&#xD;
      anaplastic thyroid cancer tissue plus a blood sample being sent to the Wales Cancer Bank for&#xD;
      storage until a suitable research project is approved by the interNational Anaplastic Thyroid&#xD;
      Cancer Tissue Bank and Database (iNATT) Project Steering Committee. Participants also have&#xD;
      the option of having their clinical information collected in a pre-existing national&#xD;
      database. Participants will not be approached regarding any further tissue or blood samples.&#xD;

        Since August 2014 ethical approval has been granted to open this UK initiated study&#xD;
        internationally. The project has therefore been rebranded the interNational Anaplastic&#xD;
        Thyroid Cancer Tissue Bank (iNATT) project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        It is unknown with the currently available UK data on thyroid cancer incidence precisely&#xD;
        how many cases of anaplastic thyroid arise annually in the UK. If the annual incidence is&#xD;
        2-4% it is estimated that 50-100 new cases are diagnosed per year in the UK.&#xD;
