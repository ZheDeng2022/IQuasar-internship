      The purpose of this study is to test the use of a tool (NOTSSdk)to assess and provide&#xD;
      feedback to trainee surgeons' non-technical skills. It focuses on two aspects: reliability of&#xD;
      ratings of trainee surgeons using NOTSSdk; and the content and quality of feedback given to&#xD;
      trainees based on observations using NOTSSdk.&#xD;

      The specific research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many situations (=operations) are necessary to assess using NOTSSdk, to get reliable&#xD;
           ratings of trainee surgeons' NTS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the impact of the NOTSSdk feedback tool on the content of feedback conversations&#xD;
           regarding NTS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do trainees perceive the usefulness of the feedback session?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do raters perceive the usefulness of the ratings and the feedback session?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim for a sample of 15 trainees in one hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data will be collected regarding: gender, age, postgraduate experience&#xD;
      (years/months), surgical experience (years/months), specialist training level for both&#xD;
      assessors and trainees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure The head of the surgical department will be informed about the project and will be&#xD;
      asked permission to recruit trainees and assessors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed about the project orally and in writing prior to commencement.&#xD;
      Surgeon assessors and trainees will be given the NOTSSdk handbook to familiarize themselves&#xD;
      with the system before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessors will receive a short guidance on how to provide assessments and give feedback&#xD;
      using NOTSSdk immediately before the first operation. After the first assessment and feedback&#xD;
      session, the assessor will be offered a further short structured guidance on how to fill in&#xD;
      the assessment form and how to provide structured feedback. It will also be allowed for the&#xD;
      assessor to solve ambiguities, ask questions and to get further explanation of the categories&#xD;
      and elements of NOTSSdk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible operations: laparoscopic cholecystectomy, hernia repair, laparoscopic appendectomy,&#xD;
      small bowel obstruction, hemicolectomy - depending on the trainee's competence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability study Each trainee will be assessed by one surgeon assessor using NOTSSdk during&#xD;
      an operation. Each trainee will be assessed on two occasions. Assessors will vary according&#xD;
      to availability. This will produce app. 30 assessments in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback study Data will be collected in connection with data gathering in the reliability&#xD;
      study that is, data will be provided by the same assessors and the same trainees on the same&#xD;
      occasions. After the operation the surgeon will provide feedback to the trainee based on&#xD;
      his/her observations. This feedback session will be observed and audio recorded by the&#xD;
      primary investigator. After each feedback session the trainee and the surgeon will be&#xD;
      individually surveyed exploring their perception of the feedback session and its usefulness.&#xD;
      After the last feedback session the assessors will be surveyed about their perceptions of&#xD;
      NOTSSdk feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability study Generalizability theory will be applied to analyze how many operations are&#xD;
      necessary to observe for reliable assessment. First the different variance components&#xD;
      (trainees, assessors, cases etc.) will be estimated (three facet, balanced design with&#xD;
      trainees nested within assessors and nested within operations). These will be used to&#xD;
      generate Generalizability coefficients to estimate overall reliability of the use of NOTSSdk&#xD;
      depending on number of assessors and operations observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback study&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use qualitative content analysis of emergent themes to explore the contents of the&#xD;
      feedback sessions with special focus on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of NTS topics discussed over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of TS topics discussed over time Descriptive statistics will be used to&#xD;
           present trainees' perceptions of the usefulness of the feedback and to present&#xD;
           assessors' perceptions of the usefulness and feasibility of the ratings and the&#xD;
           feedback.&#xD;
