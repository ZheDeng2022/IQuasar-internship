      The purpose of the study is to assess in a randomized, double blind, controlled,&#xD;
      multi-center, phase III study, the efficacy of low level diode laser (100 MW, 658 Nm), in the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of radiochemotherapy-induced mucositis for stage III and IV head and&#xD;
      neck carcinomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III randomized, double-blind, multicenter study, with two groups of patients&#xD;
      receiving radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized as follows: Arm A = patients will receive a preventive and&#xD;
      curative treatment by low-energy laser, and arm B = a control group treated with standard&#xD;
      local treatments and a placebo laser (laser nonfunctional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be balanced in a ratio 1: 1 and stratified by the investigator site.&#xD;
      Assessments of mucositis, nutritional status, tolerance of the laser and pain will be&#xD;
      performed throughout the treatment, once a week, by an investigator unaware of the patients&#xD;
      treatment arm. The locoregional control will be evaluated every 3 months during the first&#xD;
      year, then every 6 months up to 5 years. In case of progression, treatments undertaken and&#xD;
      their results should be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy: All patients will be treated with conformal radiotherapy with or without IMRT.&#xD;
      The dose should be adapted to the treatment indication (exclusive or postoperative) and the&#xD;
      histological findings in case of tumoral resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiotherapy will be prescribed in accordance with the recommendations of the ICRU 50&#xD;
      report. The dose delivered will always be 2 Gy per day 5 times a week. All beams will be&#xD;
      treated in each session. A radiological audit will be conducted for each beam treated by&#xD;
      photons in the first session and at least once a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several chemotherapies concomitant to radiotherapy are possible:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a combination of 5-FU and Cisplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a combination of 5-FU and Carboplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cisplatin alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cetuximab alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental care: All patients (except edentulous) will be seen in odontostomatology consultation&#xD;
      prior to the treatment for dental care if necessary or potential production of fluorinated&#xD;
      gutters During the treatment, all patients will receive oral care&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosimetric study will concern the cross section, the frontal and sagittal planes through&#xD;
      the axis of the lateral beams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A : laser low-level energy functional The material used will be a diode laser of 100 mW,&#xD;
      with a wavelength of 658 nm. Application will be made after each radiotherapy session in an&#xD;
      adapted room (low light intensity, possibility of ENT examination) on all grades superior or&#xD;
      equal to 2 stomatitis injuries. The application is painless, athermal, odorless and&#xD;
      completely silent. The patient will wear glasses for retinal protection. The operator will&#xD;
      also wear glasses for his protection but allowing nevertheless the view of the beams and its&#xD;
      limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor areas macroscopically invaded will be excluded from the areas application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The energetic dose delivered will be 4 J/cm2. The duration of the treatment for one will be&#xD;
      determined by a corresponding abacus : [t(s) = energy (J/cm2) x surface (cm2) / puissance&#xD;
      (W)]. The overall duration will be a few minutes varying depending on the surface to be&#xD;
      treated The usual dental care will be prescribed when required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B : laser low-level energy nonfunctional The procedure is identical to the one used in&#xD;
      arm A but the laser will not be functional. The period of application will be around one&#xD;
      minute. All applications will be performed by one single operator by center. The results will&#xD;
      be assessed once a week by another physician (or nurse specifically trained) in each center,&#xD;
      unaware of whether the patients had laser sessions or not, in order to respect the&#xD;
      &quot;blinding&quot;. The assessment will be detailed on a specifique sheet, specifying the degree of&#xD;
      mucositis (WHO), the level of pain, body weight , type of feeding , any analgesic treatment&#xD;
      taken by the patient, quality of life specific questionnaire, and the possible end of&#xD;
      treatment or therapeutic modifications (number of cycles of chemotherapy, dosage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laser should be started as soon as a grade 2 mucositis (WHO) is observed and will be&#xD;
      continued throughout the radio-chemotherapy until improvement of the mucositis (grade &lt;2).&#xD;
