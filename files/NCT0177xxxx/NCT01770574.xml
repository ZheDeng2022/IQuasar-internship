    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether structural calcium ceramic bone graft&#xD;
      substitute (ReproBone™) is non-inferior compared to autologous tricortical iliac crest bone&#xD;
      graft in lateral calcaneal lengthening osteotomies in pediatric patients and reduces&#xD;
      postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To groups of patients (age 5-16) will be compared. One group randomized to autologous bone&#xD;
      graft and the other group randomized to calcium ceramic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be based on radiostereometric analysis, pedobarography, Patient reported&#xD;
      outcome assessment (Oxford Ankle Foot Questionnaire), and pain (measured by visual analog&#xD;
      scale and numerical range scale).&#xD;

      Study C: HA-β TCP (ReproBone™) vs. autologous tricortical iliac crest bone graft in a&#xD;
      calcaneal lengthening osteotomy in children with pes planovalgus. A clinical randomized&#xD;
      controlled non-inferiority study with 12 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose. To investigate the clinical and radiographic findings of a calcaneal lengthening&#xD;
      osteotomy by comparing autologous bonegraft and HA-β-TCP graft in a group of children with&#xD;
      hindfoot valgus deformities. The primary outcome measure the stability of the osteotomy&#xD;
      measured by migrations in the x-translation by RSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. Prospective, randomized controlled non-inferiority study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Children who fulfill the criteria for inclusion together with their&#xD;
      parents/guardian receive information about the project. The patients are randomized to&#xD;
      respectively HA-ß-TCP and iliac crest bone graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure: Calcaneal lengthening osteotomy is performed between the anterior and&#xD;
      middle facet of the subtalar joint. The corticalis of the calcaneus is bilaterally cut&#xD;
      through. The planovalgus deformity is corrected and with a graft matching the wedged&#xD;
      osteotomy is inserted. Tantalum balls are inserted into calcaneus on each side of the&#xD;
      osteotomy and in cuboideum. Postoperative pain treatment consist of a tibial nerve catheter&#xD;
      which is used the first 24 hours. Patients in whom graft is harvested from the iliac crest&#xD;
      get local infiltration analgesics accordingly to a standardized procedure. The pain is&#xD;
      registered by the use of a visual analog scale (VAS, NRS, faces scale) a 3, 8 and 12 hours&#xD;
      postoperative. The amounts of used analgesics are registered. The stability of the osteotomy&#xD;
      is assessed by radiostereometric assay (RSA) at the following time points: Baseline&#xD;
      (first/second postoperative day) after 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and significance: The primary parameter is stability of the osteotomy, measured as&#xD;
      x-translations by the RSA software. We used continuous non-inferiority sample size&#xD;
      calculations. With alpha 0.05 and power 0.9, non-inferiority limit 2 mm and sd 1.5 mm we&#xD;
      estimated the sample size to 10 patients in each group. To secure against drop-out, we plan&#xD;
      to include 15 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ethical considerations an interim analysis was planned when 10 patients completed 6&#xD;
      months RSA follow-up. Primary outcome was compression of the osteotomy. We used a 99.8%&#xD;
      confidence interval.&#xD;

    <description>RSA examinations will be performed at baseline (first/second postoperative day), after 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Aim: To assess stability of the osteotomy and any micro motion in the neighbouring calcaneal-cuboid joint.</description>
