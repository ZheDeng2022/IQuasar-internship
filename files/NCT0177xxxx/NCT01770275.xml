      Background. The aim of our study was to investigate the ability of the Seventh edition of the&#xD;
      classification by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) to identify patients at&#xD;
      higher risk and to predict the overall survival in patients with esophageal carcinoma.&#xD;
      Methods. Demographic and clinical data of 605 patients, who underwent esophagectomy for&#xD;
      esophageal carcinoma between 1992 and 2009, were analyzed. Tumor stage and grade were&#xD;
      classified according to the sixth and seventh editions of the UICC classification.&#xD;

      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University-Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf is a specialist reference centre for the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with esophageal carcinoma in Germany. A prospective database for all patients&#xD;
      with surgically resectable esophageal carcinoma was established in 1992 at the Department for&#xD;
      General, Visceral and Thoracic Surgery at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.&#xD;
      Only patients without perioperative chemotherapy and histologically proven esophageal cancer&#xD;
      were included into this study. The demographic, clinical, operative and postoperative courses&#xD;
      of each patient were collected. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before&#xD;
      including them in the prospective database. The study was approved by the Medical Ethical&#xD;
      Committee of the chamber of physicians of Hamburg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures in patients with esophageal carcinomas encompassed either transhiatal&#xD;
      (TH) or thoracoabdominal (TA) esophagectomy. The thoraco-abdominal (Ivor - Lewis)&#xD;
      esophagectomies were performed by right-sided thoracotomy, median inverse T-shaped&#xD;
      laparotomy, and left-sided cervicotomy for collar anastomosis until mid 2003. From mid 2003&#xD;
      onward the anastomosis was done highly intrathoracically. A wide peritumoral resection was&#xD;
      performed including an en bloc subtotal esophageal resection with dissection of the&#xD;
      right-sided paratracheal, aortopulmonary window, subcarinal, mediastinal, and paracardial&#xD;
      lymph nodes. The azygos vein was also resected. An extensive lymphadenectomy of the upper&#xD;
      abdominal compartment (D-II lymphadenectomy, including the paracardial nodes, the left&#xD;
      gastric artery nodes along with the lymph nodes of the lesser curvature of the stomach, the&#xD;
      celiac trunk, the common hepatic artery, and the splenic artery) was conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transhiatal esophagectomies consisted of an inversed T-shaped laparotomy, followed by&#xD;
      wide peritumoral dissection of the distal esophagus and abdominal lymph node dissection of&#xD;
      the upper abdominal compartment (D-II lymphadenectomy), and a dissection of the lymph nodes&#xD;
      of the posterior mediastinum extending as far as the main carina of the trachea. Above the&#xD;
      tracheal bifurcation, the dissection was continued bluntly using digital dissection and&#xD;
      staying close to the esophageal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative follow-up was conducted in all patients at three months intervals for the first&#xD;
      two years and at six-month intervals thereafter, and included physical examination, plain&#xD;
      chest radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, endoscopy, endosonography, computed tomography&#xD;
      of the chest and abdomen as well as PET-CT after January 2006 in selected cases, studies of&#xD;
      tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19-9), and bone scanning. Recurrence was&#xD;
      diagnosed if proven by biopsy or unequivocal evidence of tumor masses (newly appearing&#xD;
      metastases or local recurrence) with a tendency to grow during further follow-up and/or&#xD;
      follow-up until death. Events considered were death, local recurrence, and distant&#xD;
      metastasis. When no events were recorded, the patients were censored at the last contact. The&#xD;
      last general follow-up of survivors was done at the end of April 2011. Overall patient&#xD;
      survival, defined as time from operation to death or last follow-up, was used as a measure of&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      We used the SPSS 17.0 for Windows for statistical analysis. Tumor stage and grade were&#xD;
      classified according to the 6th and 7th edition of the TNM classification of the UICC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associations between categorical variables at surgery were assessed by Fisher exact test. The&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the occurrence probability of an event (death,&#xD;
      recurrence). Point and interval estimates for survival probabilities at 60 months were&#xD;
      calculated. Differences between patient groups with respect to their survival were assessed&#xD;
      using log-rank tests, and the difference was considered to be statistically significant at&#xD;
      P&lt;0.05. Apart from patient's sex and age at surgery, those covariates with a P value &lt; 0.05&#xD;
      in univariate survival analysis (log rank test) were entered into multivariate Cox&#xD;
      proportional-hazards analysis to assess the independent influence of these covariates. In&#xD;
      this case, significance statements refer to P values of 2-tailed tests with a P-value ≤0.05.&#xD;
