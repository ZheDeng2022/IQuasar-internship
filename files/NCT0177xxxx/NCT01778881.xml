  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bruxism is a parafunctional habit characterized by grinding and/or clenching of the teeth. It&#xD;
      may happen while awake (awake bruxism) or while sleeping (sleep bruxism). In adults, the&#xD;
      prevalence is 20% for the awake bruxism and 8% for the sleep bruxism. Peripheral, central,&#xD;
      and psychosocial factors influence the disorder, which may predispose to pain in the&#xD;
      masticatory muscles and neck, headache, decreased pain thresholds in the masticatory and&#xD;
      cervical muscles, limitation mandibular opening, sleep disorders, stress, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and overall impairment of oral health. The aim of this study is to compare&#xD;
      physical therapy interventions with dental treatment in pain, mandibular opening, sleep&#xD;
      quality, anxiety, stress, depression, and oral health in individuals with bruxism.&#xD;

      Participants will be randomized into one of four groups: Group 1 (n = 24) intervention will&#xD;
      consist of massage and stretching exercises; Group 2 (n = 24) will consist of relaxation and&#xD;
      imagination therapies; Group 3 (n = 24) will receive dental treatment and Group 4 (n=24) will&#xD;
      consist of massage, exercises, relaxation and imagination. The evaluations will be performed&#xD;
      at baseline, immediately after treatment, and at 2-month follow-up. Pain intensity will be&#xD;
      assessed using the visual analogical scale, while pain thresholds will be determined using&#xD;
      algometry. Mandibular opening will be assessed using digital pachymeter. Sleep quality will&#xD;
      be assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, anxiety by the State-Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory, stress by the Perceived Stress Scale-10, depression by the Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory, and oral health will be assessed using the Oral Health Impact Profile - 14.&#xD;
      Significance level will be determined at the 5% level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valid Reasons of updates:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2014 - Changes made according requeriments of plattform of ClinicalTrials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2015 - In 2014, in my qualification examination at University of SÃ£o Paulo, the professors&#xD;
      suggested my transfer from master degree to direct doctorate and the inclusion of more one&#xD;
      intervention group, whereas the other three groups were still in the randomization process. I&#xD;
      updated the registration in 2015 with the inclusion of this fourth group. However, as the&#xD;
      protocol published in 2014 reports 3 groups (initial idea of the master degree before the&#xD;
      transition to the direct doctorate), this fourth group started the treatment (massage,&#xD;
      exercises, relaxation and imagination) after the end of treatment of other three groups&#xD;
      (Groups:1,2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2016- Although I have listed as primary variables: pain (VAS) and mandibular opening in this&#xD;
      platform in 2013, and in the protocol published in 2014&#xD;
      (http://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6215-15 -8); symptoms like&#xD;
      clenching, headaches and sleep difficulties were also assessed by VAS, and no included&#xD;
      posteriorly to trial registration. They were evaluated, but not described in this platform.&#xD;
      The same happened with intention to treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      June 20, 2016- Updates for clarifications and suggested by the PRS Team.&#xD;
