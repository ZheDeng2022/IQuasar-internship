      Investigators hypothesized that the use of Pilsicainide after radiofrequency ablation of AF&#xD;
      could reduce the incidence of recurrence of atrial arrhythmia during follow up compared with&#xD;
      other class IC antiarrhythmic drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation has become an integral part of the management of atrial fibrillation (AF),&#xD;
      when a strategy to preserve normal sinus rhythm is required. However, recurrence of atrial&#xD;
      arrhythmias is common after AF ablation. In order to prevent these arrhythmia recurrences,&#xD;
      antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) are often resumed empirically after AF ablation. Previously a&#xD;
      prospective randomized trial demonstrated that the treatment with AADs during the first&#xD;
      6-weeks after AF ablation reduced the incidence of clinically significant atrial arrhythmias&#xD;
      and need for cardioversion or hospitalization for arrhythmia management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilsicainide is a class IC antiarrhythmic drug originally developed in Japan, which has a&#xD;
      pure sodium channel blocking action with slow recovery pharmacokinetics. Its mechanism of&#xD;
      action appears to provide new insight into the pharmacological conversion of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In experimental studies, pilsicainide has a potent depressant effect on intra-atrial&#xD;
      conduction and a prolonging effect on the atrial effective refractory period (ERP).&#xD;
      Theoretically the suppression of conduction velocity minimizes the prolongation of wavelength&#xD;
      induced by the increase in the ERP and may thus serve to allow the continuation of multiple&#xD;
      re-entrant wavelets. Iwasa et al demonstrated that pilsicainide was more effective at&#xD;
      terminating vagally induced AF than propafenone, despite the greater effect of propafenone on&#xD;
      wavelength, suggesting that suppression of conduction velocity may play an important role in&#xD;
      terminating AF. Moreover, Wijffels et al reported that the pharmacological cardioversion of&#xD;
      AF cannot be explained by the prolongation of wavelength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of a single oral treatment of pilsicainide were compared with that of a&#xD;
      disopyramide infusion in a multicentre trial. Seventy two patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF were randomised to receive either a single oral dose of pilsicainide&#xD;
      (100-150mg) or an infusion of disopyramide (2 mg/kg; maximum dose = 100mg). In the&#xD;
      pilsicainide group, the cumulative percentage of conversion to sinus rhythm within 120&#xD;
      minutes was high as disopyramide (73% vs 56%). Moreover, the conversion time of pilsicainide&#xD;
      is shorter than that of other class IC antiarrhythmics, including flecainide and propafenone,&#xD;
      in patients with recent-onset AF. This seems likely to be due to the favorable&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of pilsicainide, including its rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract, the absence of changes from a first-pass effect, and a short elimination half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of an unsuccessful ablation for AF, AADs that were ineffective before the&#xD;
      ablation are sometimes effective. The effects and mechanisms of hybrid therapy with&#xD;
      pilsicainide and PV isolation for AF have been assessed. Seventy four patients with&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF in whom pilsicainide was ineffective underwent PV isolation. A second PV&#xD;
      isolation was performed in 31 patients among 42 recurred patients (57%). Pilsicainide was&#xD;
      re-administered in recurred patients even after the second session. Amng 21 patients with&#xD;
      recurrence of AF, pilsicainide and eliminated AF in 11 patients (success with hybrid therapy&#xD;
      was 86%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with paroxysmal AF, pilsicainide significantly prolonged the ERP of the distal&#xD;
      pulmonary vein (PV), PV-left atrium (LA) junction and LA, and the conduction time from the&#xD;
      distal PV to the PV-LA junction. In some patients, PV-LA conduction block has been observed&#xD;
      just before pilsicainide-induced termination of AF; this isolation of the PV may provide a&#xD;
      new insight into the mechanism of pharmacological conversion of AF. Hybrid therapy with&#xD;
      pilsicainide and PV isolation (by radiofrequency catheter ablation) appears to be an&#xD;
      effective therapeutic approach for AF. The pharmacological PV isolation by pilsicainide and&#xD;
      its suppression of focal discharges from atrial tissue may prevent the development of AF&#xD;
      after unsuccessful ablation. These mechanism makes it suitable for hybrid therapy with&#xD;
      catheter ablation of the PVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore investigators hypothesized that the use of Pilsicainide after radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation of AF could reduce the incidence of recurrence of atrial arrhythmia during follow up&#xD;
      compared with other AADs. Furthermore, we seek to identify whether there are clinical&#xD;
      predictors of AF recurrence at 1-year follow-up and the relationship of early recurrence&#xD;
      during blanking period and recurrence during 1-year follow up.&#xD;
