      This is a multicenter phase II study on trabectedin in advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer&#xD;
      patients with BRCA mutation and BRCAness phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility in terms of objective response rate&#xD;
      by RECIST version 1.1 (Complete and Partial Response [CR + PR]) with trabectedin in patients&#xD;
      with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carrier or BRCAness phenotype advanced ovarian cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main contribution to hereditary ovarian cancer comes from breast cancer (BRCA) genes&#xD;
      mutations, which are responsible of 90% of hereditary ovarian cancer. The two susceptibility&#xD;
      genes associated with epithelial-type OC are BRCA1 and BRCA2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BRCA proteins play an important role in the DNA repair mechanisms and are also involved&#xD;
      in the control of the cell cycle checkpoints, in protein ubiquitinization and chromatin&#xD;
      remodelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutations in the BRCA genes have been extensively described in families affected by breast&#xD;
      and/or OC; mutated BRCA1 has been found in up to 75% of families with hereditary OC - Recent&#xD;
      data suggest that dysfunction of BRCA1andBRCA2, so-called BRCAness, maybe more prevalent than&#xD;
      originally assumed. Both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms can create the BRCAness phenotype&#xD;
      in at least a third of all epithelial ovarian cancers. The definition of BRCAness ovarian&#xD;
      cancer is: high-grade serous cancers, high initial sensitivity to platinum drugs and&#xD;
      retention of platinum-sensitivity through multiple relapses, longer history of disease,&#xD;
      longer survival, longer TFIs between relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yondelis® (trabectedin) is proposed to block the transcriptional activation of a subset of&#xD;
      inducible genes without affecting their constitutive expression. Trabectedin binds to the&#xD;
      minor groove of DNA, bending the helix to the major groove. This binding to DNA triggers a&#xD;
      cascade of events affecting several transcription factors, DNA binding proteins, and DNA&#xD;
      repair pathways, resulting in perturbation of the cell cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell cycle studies of the action of trabectedin on tumor cells in vitro reveal that it&#xD;
      decreases the rate of progression of the cells through S phase towards G2 and causes a&#xD;
      prolonged blockade in G2/M at biologically relevant concentrations (20-80 nM). These cell&#xD;
      cycle blocks are p53-independent and lead to a strong apoptopic response. Cells in G1 are&#xD;
      more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of trabectedin. These effects appear to be related to&#xD;
      the unique 3-subunit structure, where two of the subunits or rings are involved in binding to&#xD;
      the minor groove of DNA in guanine-cytosine rich sequences and alkylation N2 of guanine&#xD;
      forming adducts that distorted the DNA helix structure and they are recognized by the TC-NER&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA repair proficiency is a major determinant for the cytotoxicity of trabectedin: human cell&#xD;
      lines deficient for genes essential for TC-NER activity as XPA, XPB, XPD, XPF, XPG, ERCC1,&#xD;
      CSA and CSB are resistant to trabectedin, and this resistance is reverted by complementation&#xD;
      of the cells with the corresponding gene. Trabectedin induces double strand breaks and that&#xD;
      the BRCA1-/- human cell line HCC1937 and BRCA2Δ22/Δ22 mice cells are more sensitive to&#xD;
      trabectedin and this hypersensitivity is reverted by complementation by the BRCA1 or BRCA2&#xD;
      gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based in these observations it was hypothesized that the NER machinery trapped in the DNA&#xD;
      lesion induced by trabectedin was resolved by the cells producing double strand breaks that&#xD;
      were repaired by the HRR machinery, and synergistic action of TC-NER and HRR machinery would&#xD;
      be necessary for maximal trabectedin cytotoxicity.&#xD;
