    <textblock>
      Many individuals with chronic lung disease have night time symptoms that disrupt their sleep.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of an air purifying device (PureNight,&#xD;
      Halo Innovations, Minneapolis, MN) on sleep disruptions measured by a &quot;sleep watch&quot;&#xD;
      (actigraph) and individual perception of sleep quality.&#xD;

      Objective There are many detrimental effects of obstructive airway disease. One of the&#xD;
      hallmark effects is poor sleep quality. Due to the association of air pollutants with&#xD;
      worsening respiratory symptoms, a logical intervention to improve sleep quality may be air&#xD;
      filtration. A novel air filtration system, the PureNight SystemTM, which delivers&#xD;
      pre-filtered air around the head of a sleeping person, may offer a solution to decrease&#xD;
      exposure to noxious triggers during time spent sleeping and improve sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One method to measure sleep quality is to use 24-hour actigraphy. The actigraph is a small,&#xD;
      wrist-worn device that contains a pizo-electric bender element, or accelerometer, that&#xD;
      measures wrist movement. Algorithms interpret the movement on an epoch-by-epoch basis and&#xD;
      identify sleep/wake states and circadian rhythms from activity counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design We propose to study the effect of the Pure Night TM air filtration system on a&#xD;
      cohort of patients with chronic obstructive airway disease with self-reported poor sleep&#xD;
      quality due to nocturnal respiratory symptoms. We hypothesized that patients using the Pure&#xD;
      Night TM system would have fewer nocturnal awakenings and a consolidation of sleep time&#xD;
      measured by actigraphy and better sleep quality measured by quality of sleep questionnaires&#xD;
      than when not using the device. In a cross-over randomized clinical trial, baseline&#xD;
      measurements were compared to treatment with the PureNight TM device and with &quot;sham&quot;&#xD;
      filtration. Sleep variables including data on circadian rhythms were compared using a&#xD;
      within-subject design between test conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Each subject underwent baseline actigraphy over 7 days followed by two seven day&#xD;
      treatment arms with a 7-day wash-out period between treatment arms. Subject slept with the&#xD;
      PureNight during each arm of the study. The systems used in each arm of the study were&#xD;
      identical except one arm had a sham filter replacing the HEPA filter of the PureNight TM&#xD;
      system in random order. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at the&#xD;
      start of the study and at the end of each treatment phase. Objective estimates of sleep were&#xD;
      calculated from the actigraphy recordings using the device's proprietary software.&#xD;
