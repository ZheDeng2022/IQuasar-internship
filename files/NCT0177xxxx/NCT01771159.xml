      Spinal Cord Injured [SCI] patients typically cannot &quot;pee&quot;. Injury to the spinal cord disrupts&#xD;
      the in-coming and out-going brain signals that coordinate bladder sensation and the emptying&#xD;
      of bladder. SCI typically causes chronic retention of urine with uncontrolled leakage of&#xD;
      urine. Some form of tube (catheter) is needed to drain the urine except with the mildest&#xD;
      forms of SCI. Two types of tubes to drain the urine have been used for many years. These&#xD;
      types are the urethral (inserted into the bladder through the opening usually used to empty&#xD;
      the bladder) and abdominal, called suprapubic cystostomy tubes (put into the bladder through&#xD;
      the abdomen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacteria (germs) normally live on our skin. Bacteria have sticky surfaces and so they stick&#xD;
      to catheter surfaces. Bacteria reproduce very rapidly from a few dozen to over a million in&#xD;
      24 hours. In a warm liquid environment, like urine, bacteria can reach a density of 10&#xD;
      million per cubic centimeter in 48 hours which causes infection. Oral drugs and&#xD;
      antibiotic-coated catheters delay this process by a week or two, but within a month 100% of&#xD;
      patients have bacteria in their urine. Existing drugs cannot eliminate these microbial&#xD;
      sanctuaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TBC is a 'closed access' abdominal drainage tube that has a 'cuff' or 'anchor'. It is&#xD;
      permanently placed in the abdominal muscle to bond with the body's tissue. Another catheter&#xD;
      is temporarily connected to the TBC that is easily replaceable in the clinic without&#xD;
      anesthesia or special instruments. It locks to form a water-tight system. Many parts of the&#xD;
      TBC are coated with an antibacterial substance that will delay the growth of bacteria. The&#xD;
      TBC has been used with success in multiple animal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I human clinical trial in which the TBC will be used 10 spinal cord injured&#xD;
      patients, each of whom will be followed for 12 months or longer. Abdominal catheter exit&#xD;
      sites will be photographed monthly and tested periodically to document growth of any&#xD;
      bacteria. Every three months, patients will complete satisfaction questionnaires and their&#xD;
      urine will be tested for bacteria. Urine will also be tested as clinically indicated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in permanent paraplegia or quadriplegia in&#xD;
      approximately 10,000 Americans annually. All patients with SCI have neuropathic dysfunction&#xD;
      of the urinary bladder. Progressive neurological syndromes such as multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, Stroke, hemiplegia and dementia also induce progressive neuropathic&#xD;
      bladder dysfunction. Neurologic impairment of the bladder causes or contributes to chronic&#xD;
      urinary retention or urinary incontinence or both. Several million Americans suffer chronic&#xD;
      neuropathic urinary retention or incontinence or both. Males tend to develop urinary&#xD;
      retention and females tend to develop urinary incontinence but both genders commonly develop&#xD;
      elements of both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current management includes [a] indwelling tubes (urethral catheterization or [b] suprapubic&#xD;
      (abdominal) catheterization, [c] intermittent urethral catheterization [4+times per day], and&#xD;
      surgical rehabilitation [e.g. use of autogenous intestinal conduits or reservoirs]. No single&#xD;
      form of management is ideal. A high percentage of elder and disabled patients are poor&#xD;
      candidates or non-candidates for surgical rehabilitation because of co-morbidities or limited&#xD;
      life expectancy. A majority of neurologically impaired patients are managed with chronic tube&#xD;
      drainage of their bladders [e.g. a-c, above].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional tube drainage of the bladder may be either via the urethra or via an intubated&#xD;
      fistula in the lower abdomen. Intermittent catheterization-by the patient or a care&#xD;
      giver--via the urethra is a well accepted and sometimes used method. This technique is&#xD;
      occasionally used [by an attendant] in cognitively impaired patients or quadriplegics with&#xD;
      impairment of the upper extremities. Intermittent catheterization is expensive when provided&#xD;
      by a professional care giver and is a social and domestic burden when provided by a family&#xD;
      member. In most chronically impaired [cognitively or physically] patients chronic indwelling&#xD;
      urethral or suprapubic tubes evolve as the most practical and widely used treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic urinary infection and bladder stones are recurrent problems in patients who use&#xD;
      indwelling tubes. Foley urethral catheters [which are also commonly used as suprapubic tubes]&#xD;
      are licensed for 30 day use by FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indwelling urethral catheters and suprapubic tubes are &quot;open eco-systems' and provide easy&#xD;
      access to skin flora. Skin microbes migrate along the tubes and gain access to bladder urine&#xD;
      which becomes colonized in 100% of cases. Both gram-stain positive [gram +] and gram-stain&#xD;
      negative [gram-] organisms easily gain access to bladder urine. Both type of microbes form&#xD;
      biofilms on the catheters within 48 hours of colonization. The biofilms are microbial&#xD;
      sanctuaries that are highly resistant to eradication with antibiotics. Use of antimicrobial&#xD;
      agents [often for non-urinary indications] may eradicate common urinary pathogens and thereby&#xD;
      'select' more resistant organisms. Multiple organisms and resistant organisms are commonly&#xD;
      grown from the bladders of neurologically impaired patients who utilize indwelling urethral&#xD;
      or suprapubic tubes. Both types of tubes tend to induce bladder spasms and urinary leakage&#xD;
      thereby soiling under-garments and bed clothes. A majority of such patients smell of&#xD;
      urine-chronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine is normally supersaturated with dissolved salts, notably physiologic concentrations of&#xD;
      calcium, phosphorus, oxalic acid, and magnesium. Foreign bodies [e.g. the indwelling tube']&#xD;
      initiate nucleation of the salts which then precipitate and form stones on the catheters. A&#xD;
      high percentage of neurologically impaired patients have Proteus species of chronic&#xD;
      bacteriuria. These urea-splitting [urease producing] organisms greatly accelerate formation&#xD;
      of struvite [magnesium-ammonium-phosphate] stones on the catheters; rapid stone formation may&#xD;
      necessitate catheter exchanges more frequently than monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant expense attends the chronic use of traditional urinary catheters. Monthly travel&#xD;
      to clinics and monthly replacement of the drainage catheter and management of febrile&#xD;
      reactions which may be precipitated by tube changes are routine and expensive. Surgical&#xD;
      procedures are commonly required to remove bladder, kidney or ureteral stones that develop as&#xD;
      a consequence of the chronic bacteriuria. Soiled garments and beds and the prevailing order&#xD;
      of urine cause many disabled patients to be put in to assisted care facilities.&#xD;

    <description>The anchor is capped and surgically implanted in the extra-peritoneal space of the suprapubic region of pubic hair of the lower abdomen using sutures sandwich and secure the anchor between the rectus abdominis muscle and the detrusor [bladder] muscle. Skin is closed over the implant and the bladder is drained with a Foley urethral catheter. The Phase I implant is left in place for 3+ months to allow fibroblasts and collagen from the adjacent muscles to grow into the porous PTFE and effect robust, water--tight bonding of anchor to both rectus and bladder muscles.&#xD;
After a local anesthesia is injected, the remaining components of the TBC are connected forming a water-tight union of the anchor to the urinary bladder.</description>
