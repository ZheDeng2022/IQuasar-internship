      Phase I, open-label, single-site, safety study of HSSC transplantation for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Group A enrolled 4 subjects with a cord injury at T2-T12;&#xD;
      Group B will enroll 4 subjects with a C5-C7 cord injury. Study period will be 6 months&#xD;
      post-operative. Post-study, subjects will be followed for an additional 54 months.&#xD;
