  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is thought that vaccines trigger innate inflammatory responses to induce antigen-specific&#xD;
      adaptive immunity (the desired effect), but excessive inflammation may lead to serious&#xD;
      inflammatory complications or unwanted side effects. Currently there is a lack of reliable&#xD;
      biomarkers (a measurable biological response that predicts something) able to predict severe&#xD;
      inflammation and this has resulted in the development of several vaccines being terminated&#xD;
      and the withdrawal of some licensed vaccines which were associated with inflammatory&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of the BIOVACSAFE project which is a 5-year 30 million Euro project funded&#xD;
      by the Innovative Medicines Initiative. The project involves a series of clinical studies&#xD;
      using licensed vaccines as benchmarks to generate clinical data on inflammation and identify&#xD;
      biomarkers that can be used to predict acceptable reactogenicity. The target is to identify&#xD;
      biomarkers that can predict the occurrence of beneficial and detrimental effects in response&#xD;
      to a vaccine. Such biomarkers could be used in future vaccine development programs to&#xD;
      optimise selection of vaccine candidates with a profile that will be unlikely to generate&#xD;
      worrisome safety signals once they are in generalised use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is one in a series of &quot;training&quot; studies which will each use different licensed&#xD;
      vaccines that are prototypical representatives of a class of vaccine used in a particular&#xD;
      population. Forty-eight subjects will be randomised into three groups to receive: a) Fluad&#xD;
      (n=20), b) Agrippal (n=20), c) saline placebo (n=8). Following a screening visit,&#xD;
      participants will undergo a seven-day residential visit which will include immunisation and&#xD;
      intensive monitoring of physiological (e.g. heart rate, oral temperature, blood pressure)&#xD;
      metabolic and immune (innate and adaptive) parameters. This visit will be followed up by four&#xD;
      outpatient visits with further monitoring and blood samples.&#xD;

             disease process that could interfere with the study endpoints.&#xD;
