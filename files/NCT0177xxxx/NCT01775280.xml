    <textblock>
      The study enrolls patients with non-resectable or borderline resectable hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC), intraheaptic choalngiocarcinoma (IHCC) or colorectal cancer metastasis.&#xD;
      Patients are not a candidates for liver transplantation and have only limited extrahepatic&#xD;
      disease. All patients are treated with radioembolization. Primary endpoint is the percentage&#xD;
      of patients that can be downstaged to resectability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are radiologic response to radioembolization,tissue response to&#xD;
      radiomembolization and systemic immune response and intra-tumoral T-cell response to&#xD;
      radioembolization.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria: - Patients already considered for radioembolization fulfil criteria to&#xD;
        be included in the study. If radioembolization is not considered by the tumor board,&#xD;
        inclusion in the study should not be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Non-resectable or borderline resectable liver tumors (HCC, CRCM or CCC) as as-sessed by a&#xD;
        multidisciplinary tumor-board. Non-resectability or borderline resectablily is based&#xD;
        closeness to essential nonresectable structures (f.e. the portal vein bifurca- tion or&#xD;
        hepatic vein trifurcation) or insufficient liver volume after resection, general&#xD;
        performance status of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Chemotherapy (mostly applicable to CRCM) should be termininated at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
        enrolling patients in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant manoevers to manipulate liver volume like portal vein embolization or&#xD;
             ligation and two-stage resections are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients 18-99 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presentation of the case at the Multidisciplinary Meeting attended by hepatobiliary&#xD;
             surgeons, oncologists, hepatologists and radiologists&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent given by the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver function or kidney function tests, including any of the following. It&#xD;
             is possible to perform endoscopic or percutaneous stent placement to achieve&#xD;
             normal-isation of laboratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are not breastfeeding and are using effective contraception if sexually&#xD;
             active, who are not pregnant and agree not to become pregnant during the 12 months&#xD;
             thereaf-ter. A negative pregnancy test before inclusion into the trial is required for&#xD;
             women &lt; 50 years. Men who agree not to father a child during participation in the&#xD;
             trial or during the 12 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Effective contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient compliance and geographic proximity&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria: -Patients with no clinical indications for radioembolization&#xD;
        (resectable tumors, no need for downsizing)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  contraindications on ethical grounds,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  women who are pregnant or breast feeding,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  significant concomitant disease states (e.g., renal failure, hepatic dysfunction,&#xD;
             cardi-ovascular disease, etc) as based on above mentioned labaratory values or&#xD;
             preopera-tive cardiac assessment making the patient unsuitable for major surgery known&#xD;
             or suspected non-compliance, drug or alcohol abuse, enrolment into a clinical trial&#xD;
             within last 4 weeks, extrahepatic tumor burden, as evaluated by PET/CT or chest CT.&#xD;
             Potentially resectable small lung nodules or hilar lymphadenopathy by CT or PET in&#xD;
             case of MCRC mandate systemic chemotherapy prior to enrolment into this trial if not&#xD;
             already performed. The patient may be en-rolled into this trial to be downstaged by&#xD;
             radioembolization after finishing systemic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anatomic variant in arteriogram which prevents selective delivery of the chemother-apy&#xD;
             to the liver (discussed within group of principal investigators)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &lt; 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidacy for liver transplantation in the case of HCC&#xD;
