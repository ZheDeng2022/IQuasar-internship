  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cabazitaxel is a new taxoid which promotes the tubulin assembly in vitro and stabilizes&#xD;
      microtubules against cold-induced depolymerization as efficiently as docetaxel and was&#xD;
      selected for development based on a better antiproliferative activity on resistant cell lines&#xD;
      than docetaxel. It has shown superior survival against mitoxantrone (MTX) plus prednisone in&#xD;
      docetaxel pre-treated hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer patients leading to&#xD;
      registration of the compound. It showed a favorable toxicity profile with an interestingly&#xD;
      low rate of alopecia. In the Genevieve study it will be compared against weekly paclitaxel&#xD;
      which is currently most widely used treatment of breast cancer patients. A head-to-head&#xD;
      comparison in the neoadjuvant setting will allow a rapid and precise comparison of efficacy&#xD;
      and tolerability of cabacitaxel versus paclitaxel to decide in how far further development of&#xD;
      this taxoid in breast cancer is reasonable.&#xD;

      Primary Objective To compare the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in the breast&#xD;
      (ypT0/is ypN0/+) in patients with operable Triple Negative or luminal B/HER2 normal breast&#xD;
      cancer treated with either cabazitaxel or weekly paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective To assess&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pCR rates per arm separately for the stratified subpopulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective response rate (ORR) in the breast according to WHO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pCR rate defined as ypT0 ypN0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pCR rate defined as ypT0/is ypN0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pCR rate in the axillary lymph nodes (ypN0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pCR rate and local recurrence free survival (LRFS) in patients with a&#xD;
           clinical complete response (cCR) and a negative core biopsy before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast conservation surgery rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the toxicity (NCI CTCAE V4.03) and compliance in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Invasive loco-regional recurrence free survival (LRRFS), distant-disease-free survival&#xD;
           (DDFS), invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the biomarkers and profiles potentially predicting response to treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by&#xD;
             core biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration alone is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy is not&#xD;

             which side will be evaluated for the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor lesion in the breast with a palpable size of &gt;= 2 cm or a sonographical size of&#xD;
             &gt;= 1 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion has to be measurable in two dimensions,&#xD;
             preferably by sonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be in the following stages of disease: cT3 or cT2 or cT1c and cN+ or&#xD;
             cT1c and pNSLN+.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should&#xD;

             PgR-negative defined as &lt;1% stained cells. HER-2 negative defined as IHC 0+, 1+ or IHC&#xD;
             2+ and FISH/SISH/CISH (ratio &lt;2.0) negative. Luminal B defined as ER and/or PgR + and&#xD;
             &gt; 14% Ki-67 stained cells. The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tissue&#xD;
             block from the diagnostic core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the Dept. of&#xD;
             Pathology at the Charité, Berlin prior to randomization.&#xD;

             have bilateral mammography, breast ultrasound (&lt;= 21 days), breast MRI (optional),&#xD;
             chest X-ray (PA and lateral), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRI, and bone scan&#xD;
             done. In case of positive bone scan, bone X-ray is mandatory. Other tests may be&#xD;
