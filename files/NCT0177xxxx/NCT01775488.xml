    <intervention_name>Vortx Rx - Histotripsy BPH Device</intervention_name>
    <description>Non-invasive histotripsy treatment / therapy to be delivered by surgeon using very low duty cycle ultrasound pulses from outside the patient's body. These pulses form a bubble cloud at the focal area within the prostate which mechanically breaks up the cellular structure of the soft tissue. During treatment, a surgeon is able to direct the bubble cloud throughout the targeted volume using controls located on the device console and using the real-time ultrasound for visualization feedback and control of the bubble cloud location.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of BPH and eligible for endoscopic BPH surgery including Transurethral&#xD;
             Resection of the Prostate [TURP], PVP, electrovaporization&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prostate volumes 30 - 80 gm based on transrectal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Men â‰¥ 50 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. IPSS symptom score &gt; 15 and IPSS bother score &gt; 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Baseline peak flow rate Qmax &lt; 12 cc/s on two separate occasions with voided volume at&#xD;
             least 150 cc&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of prostate or bladder cancer, pelvic radiation, untreated bladder stones,&#xD;
             urethral strictures/bladder neck contracture (BNC), renal insufficiency (i.e.&#xD;
             creatinine &gt; 1.4)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Neurogenic bladder, Parkinson's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior treatment for urinary incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Micturition frequency AND urgency. Micturition frequency defined as &gt; 8 micturitions&#xD;
             per 24 hours as assessed by a thorough subject history including the question: &quot;On&#xD;
             average, how many times do you void during a 24 hour period? // &lt; 4, 5-7, 8 or more.&quot;&#xD;
             Urgency defined as an uncontrollable urge to void that occurs &gt; 3 per 24 hours as&#xD;
             assessed through the subject history/question: &quot;On average, how many times a day do&#xD;

             anticoagulant at least seven days prior to the time of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of known bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Prior BPH prostate procedures (e.g. Transurethral Microwave Therapy [TUMT], TUNA,&#xD;
             water induced thermotherapy, TURP, PVP)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Men with confirmed or suspected malignancy of the prostate based on a digital rectal&#xD;
             exam (DRE), prostate biopsy or PSA &gt; 10 ng/mL. Men with free PSA &lt; 25% and with PSA&#xD;
             within an age and race-specific range may only be enrolled after a negative biopsy. If&#xD;
             a biopsy is required, the subject shall have a six-week waiting period between the&#xD;
             biopsy and histotripsy treatment, if he is deemed eligible to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Men interested in future fertility&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Declines or unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. In the opinion of the investigator, it is not in the subject's best interest to&#xD;
