      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Uveal coloboma is a condition where the eye does not form normally. It occurs early in the&#xD;
      fetus s development during pregnancy. It can lead to different kinds of eye problems,&#xD;
      including blindness. Several genes have been linked to coloboma, but the cause of most cases&#xD;
      is hard to find. Researchers want to study the genes of people who have coloboma and genes&#xD;
      from their close, unaffected relatives (such as parents and siblings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the genes associated with uveal coloboma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 1 years of age who either have uveal coloboma or are an unaffected&#xD;
      relative (such as a parent or sibling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical exam and medical history. They will also have a full&#xD;
           eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with uveal coloboma may have other exams, such as imaging studies and&#xD;
           hearing assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will also provide blood, cheek swab or saliva or DNA samples for&#xD;
           genetic testing.&#xD;

      Objective: The objectives of this study are to: 1) define ocular, systemic and other&#xD;
      associations in a cohort of well-phenotyped participants with microphthalmia, anophthalmia&#xD;
      and/or uveal coloboma (MAC); 2) define risk factors and microforms of MAC in relatives of&#xD;
      affected individuals; and 3) establish a repository of DNA and/or lymphoblastoid cell lines&#xD;
      from participants for use in laboratory investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Six hundred (600) individuals of at least one year of age with documented&#xD;
      MAC and their relatives will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a natural history/genetic repository study. Six hundred (600) participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled over fifteen years. Participants will undergo a complete age-appropriate&#xD;
      baseline eye examination and physical examination and provide a blood, buccal cell/saliva, or&#xD;
      DNA sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The tests, data and samples collected will be analyzed to better understand&#xD;
      the genetics of MAC. In particular, ocular and systemic associations will be defined in a&#xD;
      cohort of well-phenotyped participants with MAC, as will the risk factors and microforms of&#xD;
      these disorders in relatives of affected individuals.&#xD;

        Participants will be ascertained through other pre-existing protocols, such as the NEI&#xD;
        Ocular Natural History protocol (16-EI-0134), the NEI Screening protocol (08-EI-0102),&#xD;
        through another similar, existing protocol or through referral from an outside clinician&#xD;
        after a review of pertinent medical records. To increase minority enrollment, we will send&#xD;
        a recruitment letter and flyer to ophthalmic and genetics clinics serving diverse and&#xD;
        minority communities in the D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas and local clinics with&#xD;
        whom we have ongoing relationships.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The participant must be one year of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The participant must be able to cooperate with an age-appropriate eye examination&#xD;
                  or be able to provide a copy of a complete eye examination report.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The participant must be able to provide a blood, buccal/saliva or DNA sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. The participant must be able to understand and sign this protocol s informed&#xD;
                  consent form OR have a legal parent/guardian/representative with the ability to&#xD;
                  do the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. The participant must either:&#xD;

                  phenotype related to MAC or if they are deemed affected by other clinical&#xD;
                  evaluations (e.g., the presence of a unique, systemic manifestation cosegregating&#xD;
                  with MAC, or a rare or unique kidney finding).&#xD;
&#xD;
