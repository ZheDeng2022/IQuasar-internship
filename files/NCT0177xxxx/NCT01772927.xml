    <textblock>
      Numeta G13% is a triple chamber bag including amino acids plus electrolytes, glucose and&#xD;
      lipids, dedicated for parenteral nutrition in preterm newborn infants when oral/enteral&#xD;
      nutrition is not possible, insufficient or contra indicated. The product has been registered&#xD;
      in 18 countries in Europe via a decentralized procedure that ended 15th December 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study want to evaluate the use of Numeta 13% as standard medical prescription in&#xD;
      the NICU of the university of Liege. It is a prospective, monocentric, non-interventional,&#xD;
      non comparative, open-labeled data collection of record keeping, nutritional intakes from the&#xD;
      bags, additional intakes as well as blood and urine biochemical markers currently evaluated&#xD;
      in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected only in VLBWI &lt; 1500 g receiving Numeta G13% from day of birth&#xD;
      (day 1) until parenteral nutrition (PN) decreases below 20% of the targeted intakes 2 days in&#xD;
      a row as a quality control of the new solution in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication for PN and daily prescription will follow the protocol in use in the NICU on&#xD;
      behalf of the investigators&#xD;

      Background information&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multichamber bag parenteral solution specially designed for preterm infant has been&#xD;
      developed to provide adequate and appropriate mixture of macronutrients (amino acids,&#xD;
      carbohydrates, lipids) and micronutrients (electrolytes, vitamins, trace-elements) through&#xD;
      either peripheral or central veins in the range of the more recent nutritional&#xD;
      recommendations for ELBW, VLBW and LBW infants requiring total or partial parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition (Tsang &amp; al 2005, Espghan-ESPEN Commentary 2005). The multichamber bag parenteral&#xD;
      solution for preterm infants NumetaG13% has been evaluated in a phase III study entitled:&#xD;
      &quot;Safety use of a triple chamber bag formula, administered IV during 5 to 10 consecutive days,&#xD;
      in preterm infants requiring parenteral nutrition.&quot; EudraCT Number: 2007-001378-97; PPM&#xD;
      Number: 36830247 It was a prospective, multicentre, non-comparative phase III study limited&#xD;
      to 5 to 10 days of parenteral nutrition. Preterm infants can be include without any&#xD;
      restriction of postnatal age and according to the need of informed parental consent, only 30&#xD;
      % of the patient was included during the first 3 days of life. Weight gain and nutritional&#xD;
      intakes from the multichamber bag parenteral solution, from additional parenteral and oral&#xD;
      supplies were collected daily during the study. Biochemical parameters recorded during the&#xD;
      study were limited to BUN, glycemia, triglyceridemia, natremia, kaliemia, calcemia,&#xD;
      phosphatemia and plasma bicarbonate concentration collected at inclusion, and at 5 &amp; 10 days&#xD;
      of parenteral nutrition. Performance safety was assessed through the collection of vital&#xD;
      signs and adverse events whereas, information on handling and administration of the Ped3CB&#xD;
      was evaluated using a visual scale parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the study were summarized in a manuscript recently published in JPGN 2012 referred&#xD;
      as. J. Rigo, ML. Marlowe, D. Bonnot, Th. Senterre, A. Lapillonne, E. Kermorvant-Duchemin, JM.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Numeta 13% has been registered in 18 countries in Europe via a decentralized procedure that&#xD;
      ended 15th December 2010. In the NICU of the University of Liege, we decided to use Numeta&#xD;
      13% as our standard of parenteral solution for preterm infants from the first day of life and&#xD;
      therefore to perform a quality control evaluation of this balanced parenteral solution from&#xD;
      the first day of life in preterm infants with a birth weight &lt;1500 g. collecting nutritional&#xD;
      intakes from the bags, additional intakes as well as blood and urine biochemical markers&#xD;
      currently evaluated in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, we recently reported that using a ready to use binary parenteral solution&#xD;
      compounded in the pharmacy hospital it is possible to provide nutritional intakes in the&#xD;
      range of the recommendations (Tsang 2005, ESPGHAN-ESPEN 2005), to abolish the cumulative&#xD;
      nutritional deficit frequently observed in those preterm infants and to limit the postnatal&#xD;
      growth restriction a preterm infants with a birth weight &lt; 1250 g. (Senterre Th and Rigo J&#xD;
      JPGN 2011, Acta Paediatrica 2012). In that study, we suggested that the use from birth of a&#xD;
      RTU parenteral solution containing electrolytes, minerals and a high protein (AA):energy&#xD;
      ratio improves clinical tolerance and reduces metabolic disturbances during the first week of&#xD;
      life in this group of preterm infants (Senterre Th and Rigo J Manuscript in preparation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to provide further informations to our medical staff and to&#xD;
      the the medical community on the adequacy of use and flexibility of Numeta 13%. to provide&#xD;
      recommended nutritional intakes and to evaluate the daily biochemical tolerance, and safety&#xD;
      issues when administered from the first day of life in a significant population of very low&#xD;
      birth weight infants (VLBWI). The secondary objective will be to compare the clinical&#xD;
      tolerance and the biochemical laboratory data obtained with Numeta 13% with those recently&#xD;
      published in a similar population using a compounded solution prepared in our hospital&#xD;
      pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out as a prospective, monocentric, open label phase IV study in&#xD;
      therapeutic use.The hospital pharmacists will dispense to the clinical department the&#xD;
      Paediatric 3CB for patient use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment will be performed on the base of the consecutive admission rate.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the recruitment will be balanced according to birth weight (&lt;1000 g, 1000-&lt;1250&#xD;
      g and &gt;1250 g) to ensure patient distribution in the ranges of ELBW and VLBW infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, intravenous nutrition will be administered&#xD;
      using Numeta 13% up to the end of parenteral support need. Prescription of Numeta 13% will&#xD;
      follow the guideline for parenteral nutrition defined at the NICU of the University of Liege&#xD;
      Belgium. Activation or non-activation of the lipid bag will be on the discretion of the&#xD;
      neonatologist in charge of the preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional intakes (parenteral and oral), body weight, biochemical laboratory data, insulin&#xD;
      needs, clinical data and additional treatments will be recorded every day, up to the last&#xD;
      infusion day. Prescription of blood and urinary biochemical survey will be performed by the&#xD;
      neonatologist in charge of the preterm infants and recorded. When several data of an&#xD;
      identical parameter were requested during the same day, the maximal and the minimal data will&#xD;
      be recorded and the mean value calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations will be conducted from birth and include daily monitoring of biochemical&#xD;
      laboratory data (plasma ionogram, minerals, pH, glucose, BUN and triglycerides) according to&#xD;
      biological prescription as well as the daily collection of supplementation needs, vital signs&#xD;
      and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenteral support: Numeta 13% administration will be adapted to body weight, postÂ¬natal age,&#xD;
      and oral/enteral tolerance and intakes, according to current nutritional guidelines&#xD;
      (ESPEN-ESPGHAN 2005, Tsang 2005). The protocol in use in the NICU of the University of Liege&#xD;
      will be used and is gathered in table I and II according to the activation or not of the&#xD;
      lipid bag Numeta 13% will be administered daily mainly through a central venous catheter.&#xD;
      When peripheral supplemental parenteral nutrition is indicated, dilution of the Numeta 13%&#xD;
      solution will be performed in order to limit the osmolality of the perfusion to a value &lt; 900&#xD;
      mosm/L.&#xD;
