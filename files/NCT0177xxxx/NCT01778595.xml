      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Early detection of colon cancer can improve the chances of successful treatment for most&#xD;
      people. This approach is especially important if blood is detected in the stool. However,&#xD;
      much better stool sample tests are needed to find this cancer early. To improve the tests,&#xD;
      researchers want to collect samples from people who are already being screened for colon&#xD;
      cancer. This study will collect information and samples from older adults in Shanghai, China.&#xD;
      These adults will be participating in screening tests for colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect samples and medical information for colon cancer screening from older adults in&#xD;
      Shanghai, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults between 50 and 74 years of age who are being screened for colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be recruited from two community health centers in Shanghai, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide information on their medical history and factors related to&#xD;
           colon cancer. They will respond to questions on use of medications, diet choices (such&#xD;
           as eating red meat), bowel habits, and other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will collect samples for study. These samples will be collected within 3&#xD;
           days of the screening visit. Particpants will provide a urine sample and four stool&#xD;
           samples. They will also use cotton swabs to collect samples from just inside the anus.&#xD;
           The samples will be returned to the study doctors for research tests that may indicate&#xD;
           who has colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      To examine how risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) is related to the microbes that inhabit the&#xD;
      distal human intestine (the microbiota), we have proposed a large study that compares&#xD;
      characteristics of the fecal microbiota in CRC patients and controls in the Shanghai&#xD;
      population. In advance of that, we are proposing a small pilot study with the following two&#xD;
      objectives: 1) determine participation rates among Shanghai adults, age 50-74 who are&#xD;
      positive by fecal immunochemical test (FIT+); and 2) determine the suitability of fecal&#xD;
      specimens provided by the participants for microbiome analyses. Each of two Shanghai&#xD;
      community health centers, where CRC screening is ongoing, will recruit 25 FIT+ participants&#xD;
      (half male; half age 50-64, half age 65-74). Each of the 50 participants will provide&#xD;
      informed consent, brief questionnaire data, blood plasma and buffy coat, a urine specimen,&#xD;
      and four samples of one stool, which will be frozen. Complete blood count and plasma glucose,&#xD;
      cholesterol, and creatinine levels will be determined in real time and returned to the&#xD;
      participant. Each participant s plasma, buffy coat, urine, and one pair of fecal samples will&#xD;
      be stored frozen for future genetic or other assays. DNA will be extracted from the second&#xD;
      pair of fecal samples from each participant (n=100 vials), amplified for 16S rRNA genes, and&#xD;
      sequenced to determine fecal microbiome profiles. Participation will be deemed unsatisfactory&#xD;
      if participation is &lt;30% overall (95% confidence interval 17% - 43% for N=50 participants),&#xD;
      or if there are &lt;20 male, female, younger, or older participants. Specimen quality will be&#xD;
      deemed unsatisfactory if the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is &lt;0.70 (95%&#xD;
      confidence interval 0.53 0.82 for N=50 paired vials) for the Shannon index estimate of&#xD;
      microbiome alpha diversity. As amended, the two community health centers will recruit up to&#xD;
      600 additional adults presenting for CRC screening, irrespective of FITstatus, who will be&#xD;
      asked to provide saliva as well as the other specimens.&#xD;
