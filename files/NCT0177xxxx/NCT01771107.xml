    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of brentuximab vedotin&#xD;
      when given together with combination chemotherapy and to see how well they work in treating&#xD;
      patients with stage II-IV human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
      Brentuximab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, called brentuximab, linked to a chemotherapy&#xD;
      drug called vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to CD30-positive cancer cells in a targeted way and&#xD;
      delivers vedotin to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride,&#xD;
      vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving brentuximab vedotin together with combination chemotherapy may kill more&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of brentuximab vedotin&#xD;
      when combined with the doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine (AVD)&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of HIV-associated stage II-IV Hodgkin lymphoma. (Phase&#xD;
      I) II. Establish an estimate of the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) for participants&#xD;
      with HIV-associated stage II-IV Hodgkin lymphoma when treated using brentuximab vedotin plus&#xD;
      the AVD chemotherapy regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicity of AVD and brentuximab vedotin with highly active antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (HAART).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the partial response (PR) rate, complete response (CR) rate, overall survival&#xD;
      (OS), and event free survival (EFS) at 2 and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the effect of AVD and brentuximab vedotin on cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      (CD)4 and CD8 counts after cycle 1, 4, at the end of therapy, and every 3 months after&#xD;
      treatment completion for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To investigate the prognostic value of fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans at baseline, after cycle 2, and at treatment completion,&#xD;
      with respect to 2-year progression free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate HAART status at baseline and to correlate this with tumor response to therapy&#xD;
      and OS and PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To characterize the histologic subtypes in HIV-Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in the highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess the neurotoxicity of HAART in combination with AVD and brentuximab vedotin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To evaluate effect of AVD and brentuximab vedotin on viral load after cycles 1, 4, at&#xD;
      the completion of therapy, and every 3 months after treatment completion for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To perform pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity studies to determine drug levels during&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. To perform micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) profile analysis on the HIV-HL tumor specimens&#xD;
      and to correlate miRNA expression with OS, PFS, tumor response to therapy, histologic subtype&#xD;
      of HIV-HL, and HIV disease characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. To perform tissue microarray analysis on HIV-HL tumor specimens and to correlate the&#xD;
      markers studied with OS, PFS, and tumor response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XII. To identify Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumor derived deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (DNA) in the plasma of study participants and to correlate these levels during therapy with&#xD;
      disease response and OS. (Phase II) XIII. To identify cytokines in the plasma of participants&#xD;
      during therapy that can be used as tumor and prognostic markers. (Phase II) XIV. To assess&#xD;
      latent and expressed HIV reservoirs before, during, and post chemotherapy. To understand how&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents affect HIV expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin followed by a phase&#xD;
      II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV), vinblastine sulfate IV, and&#xD;
      dacarbazine IV on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes&#xD;
      on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

          -  Measurable or non-measurable (evaluable) tumor parameter(s); non-measurable tumor&#xD;
             parameters will be defined as not having bi-dimensional measurements (i.e., gastric or&#xD;
             marrow involvement) but can be followed for response by other diagnostic tests such as&#xD;
             gallium, PET imaging and/or bone marrow biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients already receiving erythropoietin or granulocyte colony stimulating factor&#xD;
             (GCSF) for treatment of HIV-related cytopenia are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4 count &gt;= 50 cells/ul&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants are required to be on antiretroviral regimens that are in accordance with&#xD;
             the current International Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Society&#xD;
             guidelines concurrently with chemotherapy; the specific agents are at the discretion&#xD;
             of the investigator and the use of investigational agents currently available on an&#xD;
             expanded access basis is allowed; use of experimental antiretroviral agents or those&#xD;
             containing zidovudine (including Combivir and Trizivir) or ritonavir (includes Norvir&#xD;
             or Kaletra), cobicistat, didanosine (Videx or Videx EC), or similar potent cytochrome&#xD;
             P450 (CYP)3 inhibitors are prohibited; in order to be eligible, participants taking&#xD;
             zidovudine or ritonavir, or cobicistat, didanosine, or other CYP3 inhibitors must&#xD;
             change to a different regimen 7 days prior to therapy initiation; changes to HAART&#xD;
             therapy during the study may be made if medically necessary (toxicity, failure of&#xD;
             regimen, etc.); participants must be on HAART at least 7 days prior to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative for hepatitis B, or if infected with hepatitis B, receiving anti-hepatitis B&#xD;
             therapy; all participants will be required to be screened for hepatitis B; per&#xD;
             Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and Assistance for AIDS Specific Drugs&#xD;
             (AASD) guidelines, those participants that show no immunity, defined by the lack of&#xD;
             hepatitis B surface antigen antibody, and show evidence of chronic infection (i.e.&#xD;
             hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]+, hepatitis B core [HBcore]+, hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antibody [HBsAB]-) will be required to be on anti-hepatitis B therapy during the study&#xD;
             in order to be eligible; patients will be permitted to enroll in the study provided&#xD;
             normal liver function tests and no evidence of cirrhosis; the exact hepatitis B&#xD;
             therapy will be at the discretion of the infection disease specialist or investigator;&#xD;
             however all patients who present with acute hepatitis B or show normal transaminases&#xD;
             and are hepatitis B virus HBsAg surface protein antigen (HBsAg) positive (+) and&#xD;
             immunoglobulin M (IgM)+ for hepatitis core antigen will not be eligible for trial&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients diagnosed with hepatitis C who are hepatitis C antibody positive, whether&#xD;
             hepatitis C RNA level is measurable or not, must have no evidence of cirrhosis and&#xD;
             have liver function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brentuximab vedotin is partially metabolized via the CYP3A4 pathway and is cleared&#xD;
             from the cells via the P-glycoprotein pump; therefore, participants must discontinue&#xD;
             use of the following agents within 7 days prior to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors that treat HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other strong CYP3A inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be used with caution but are not excluded; if 2&#xD;
                  moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are used concurrently, one must be discontinued at&#xD;
                  least 7 days (1 week) prior to the initiation of chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  P-glycoprotein inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If patients are taking any of these excluded medications, they must be&#xD;
                  discontinued at least 7 days (1 week) prior to the initiation of chemotherapy All&#xD;
                  concomitant medications must be reviewed by the study chair or co-chair prior to&#xD;
                  enrollment by email; because the lists of these agents are constantly changing,&#xD;
                  it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a&#xD;
                  list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior anthracycline therapy will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants who are pregnant or breast-feeding; confirmation that the subject&#xD;
             is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum beta (b)-human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (b-hCG) or urine pregnancy test result obtained during screening;&#xD;
             pregnancy testing is not required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical illness unrelated to HL, which in the opinion of the study physician will&#xD;
             preclude administration of chemotherapy safely; this includes patients with&#xD;
             uncontrolled infection (including opportunistic), chronic renal failure, myocardial&#xD;
             infarction (MI) within the past 6 months, unstable angina, or cardiac arrhythmias&#xD;
             other than chronic atrial fibrillation, or second malignancy requiring active&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior malignancy within 2 years before enrollment other than curatively treated&#xD;
             cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, anal&#xD;
             intraepithelial neoplasia, or cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS); participants with prior&#xD;
             malignancies must have completed all therapy at least 2 years before enrollment with&#xD;
             no evidence of disease since therapy completion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) identified on the&#xD;
             pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Central nervous system disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of John Cunningham (JC) virus identified in the cerebrospinal&#xD;
             fluid (CSF) or previous history of PML will be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cirrhosis secondary to any cause will be excluded&#xD;
