      The purpose of this study is to determine whether introducing the new weaning indexes can&#xD;
      predict better than traditional ones?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was divided into two parts: First, the threshold values of the indexes that&#xD;
      discriminated best between successful weaning and weaning failure were determined in training&#xD;
      set (n = 208). Second, the accuracy of each index was scrutinized prospectively in an&#xD;
      additional group of patients (prospective-validation data set, n = 967). One thousand one&#xD;
      hundred and seventy-five patients who were on mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours&#xD;
      were evaluated.Informed consent was obtained from each patient, whenever possible, or from&#xD;
      the patient's next of kin. The samples were selected using a simple random sampling method in&#xD;
      which the entry number of eligible patients was considered to be the sampling ID number.&#xD;
      Using Random Allocation Software (RAS), random numbers were generated to select the study&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ventilators used were Evita XL and Evita 4 edition (Draeger, Lubeck, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a protocol that have introduced in two studies, the protocol established. All of&#xD;
      the mechanically ventilated patients undergoing assessment for extubation undergo a daily SBT&#xD;
      if predetermined eligibility criteria for weaning are met . According to this protocol,&#xD;
      sedation would be discontinued before evaluation of weaning. Patients who meet these criteria&#xD;
      are initially placed on SBT (continuous positive airway pressure of 5 mmHg, FiO2≤0.4) for 3&#xD;
      minutes to obtain weaning parameters. If the Oxygen saturation is ≥ 92% on pulse oximetry&#xD;
      with FiO2≤0.4 and RSBI &lt;104 breaths/minute/L, patients are continued on the SBT for 30 to 120&#xD;
      minutes. All clinical and ventilator parameters are monitored closely for signs of&#xD;
      respiratory distress (respiratory rate &gt; 30 breaths/minute, SaO2&lt; 90%, heart rate &gt; 140&#xD;
      breaths/minute, or a sustained increase or decrease of heart rate of &gt;20%, blood pressure&gt;200&#xD;
      mm Hg or &lt;80 mm Hg, and agitation, diaphoresis, or anxiety). At the end of the SBT, the RSBI&#xD;
      is measured again, ABG is obtained, and the predetermined values are calculated and measured.&#xD;
      The decision to return to mechanical ventilation made by the two subspecialists in pulmonary&#xD;
      and lung diseases, who were chief supervisor of both ICU in two cities (who were completely&#xD;
      blind to the study and the results of the indexes evaluated), based on airway competence&#xD;
      (cough, sputum production, neurologic status, level of consciousness, and maximal inspiratory&#xD;
      pressure). Patients who remain extubated at 48 hours are classified as having had a&#xD;
      successful extubation. Baseline demographics, initial diagnosis, and pre-extubation clinical,&#xD;
      ventilator, laboratory, and radiographic data are collected for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the prognostic value of new indices, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves&#xD;
      was drawn for each formula in addition for other conventional criteria used in this area. For&#xD;
      each ROC curve analysis, sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value, Negative&#xD;
      Predictive Value, diagnostic accuracy, likelihood ratio of a positive test (LR+) and the&#xD;
      likelihood ratio of a negative test (LR-), probability for weaning success when test is&#xD;
      positive and probability for weaning success when test is negative of the indexes were used&#xD;
      to predict the weaning outcome in the prospective-validation data set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hanley and McNeil method was used to calculate the area under curve (AUC) for each formula&#xD;
      and then the methods developed by the same authors were used to compare these AUCs. Bayes'&#xD;
      theorem was used to compute the weaning outcome the probability for weaning success when test&#xD;
      is positive and negative (post-test probability) in the prospective-validation data set to&#xD;
      assess the perform&#xD;
