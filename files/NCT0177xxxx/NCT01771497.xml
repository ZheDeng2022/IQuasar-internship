    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that using Koning Breast CT during the neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
      of breast cancer will allow for accurate tumor localization and tumor volume measurement,&#xD;
      leading to improved surgical and radiation therapy outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Tumor volume will be measured with KBCT imaging at the beginning of the therapy (baseline), mid-point of the therapy (about 3 months after the treatment starts) and end of therapy (about 4-6 months after the treatment starts). The volume change from the baseline during the treatment will be recorded.&#xD;
Adverse Events will be recorded as a measure of safety.</description>

        Twelve female patients at least 18 years of age undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for locally&#xD;
        advanced breast cancer with either chemotherapy or hormonal therapy will be recruited for&#xD;
        this study. Inclusion of those patients 18 years or older is important since as it is the&#xD;
        younger patients who present with breast cancer that often end up receiving neoadjuvant&#xD;
        treatment.&#xD;
