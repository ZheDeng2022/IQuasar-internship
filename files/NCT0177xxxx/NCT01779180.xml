      INTRODUCTION Eight trials studying the effect of providing neonatal vitamin A supplementation&#xD;
      (NVAS) have been reported, and another four are underway to test whether NVAS should become&#xD;
      WHO policy. Three of the four African trials were conducted by the Bandim Health Project&#xD;
      (BHP) in Guinea-Bissau. One of them was a two-by-two factorial trial among low-birth-weight&#xD;
      children. From 2004-2008, the children were randomly allocated to 25,000 IU vitamin A or&#xD;
      placebo at birth, and furthermore to BCG vaccination at birth or later as is local policy. In&#xD;
      2011, the investigators conducted a follow-up study. A remarkably strong harmful effect of&#xD;
      NVAS on atopy and wheezing was found (manuscript under review).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seen in the context that NVAS may soon become a WHO policy it is obviously worrying if NVAS&#xD;
      is associated with a higher risk of atopy and wheezing. The investigators therefore aim to&#xD;
      conduct a similar follow-up study of participants in the first NVAS trial conducted in&#xD;
      Guinea-Bissau from 2002-2004, among normal-birth-weight infants, to test whether NVAS is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of atopy and wheezing and other allergic symptoms as well&#xD;
      as growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 2002-2004 BHP conducted a randomised trial of NVAS. The investigators recruited newborns&#xD;
      when they came for BCG vaccination. Provided parental consent, they received an oral&#xD;
      supplement of 50,000 IU vitamin A or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a follow-up study of the cohort of children randomised to NVAS&#xD;
      (intervention) or placebo (current policy) together with BCG vaccine at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other exposures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also investigate the effect of receiving an additional dose of measles&#xD;
      vaccine and the timing of DTP vaccine on the development of atopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will visit all children at the last known address. Height, weight and mid&#xD;
      upper arm circumference will be measured. BCG scar will be examined and vaccination card&#xD;
      details recorded by the field assistant. Children will be excluded from skin prick testing&#xD;
      (SPT) if they have a history suggestive of anaphylaxis or are currently using anti-histamine&#xD;
      medication. SPT will be performed using aero-allergens, food allergens and positive histamine&#xD;
      and negative saline control. The mother or guardian will be interviewed by a local assistant.&#xD;
      Symptoms of eczema and asthma as well as food allergy will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of randomisation group and other factors on outcomes will be analysed in multivariable&#xD;
      regression models. All analyses will be adjusted for skin prick tester. All analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted stratified by sex.&#xD;
