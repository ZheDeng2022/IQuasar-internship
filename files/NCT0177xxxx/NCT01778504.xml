      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Many psychiatric, behavioral, and developmental disorders are genetic. This means that they&#xD;
      tend to run in families. Some begin in childhood, while others do not appear until adulthood.&#xD;
      Researchers want to look at people of all ages who have these disorders that started in&#xD;
      childhood. They will also look at relatives of people with these disorders. This information&#xD;
      will allow doctors to learn more about childhood behavioral problems and how they are&#xD;
      inherited. It may also help doctors treat those disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the onset and treatment of childhood behavioral, psychiatric, and developmental&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals of any age who have a psychiatric, autism spectrum, or developmental&#xD;
           disorder, or other behavioral problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family members of individuals with the above disorders. This group may include parents,&#xD;
           grandparents, siblings, aunts/uncles, cousins, and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have a&#xD;
           psychiatric history with tests of thinking, judgment, and behavior. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Brain imaging scans will be performed to look at brain&#xD;
           function. They may have a spinal tap to collect cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relatives will have a medical history and physical exam. They will also have a&#xD;
           psychiatric history with tests of thinking, judgment, and behavior. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Brain imaging scans will be performed to look at brain&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A relative s exams may reveal a behavioral or other disorder. If so, he or she may&#xD;
           re-enroll on the study as a person with the disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a diagnostic protocol designed to provide opportunities for identifying new clinical&#xD;
      syndromes and permitting longitudinal assessments of a variety of childhood behavioral,&#xD;
      psychiatric and developmental disorders. Disorders of particular interest are: autism,&#xD;
      disorders of social cognition and other neurodevelopmental disorders; childhood psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders and particularly those with acute symptom onset; and unique clinical presentations&#xD;
      of pediatric behavioral syndromes, such as those associated with genetic disorders or those&#xD;
      with a unique family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate a variety of behavioral,&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric, and neurodevelopmental conditions. The protocol will allow OCD&#xD;
      investigators to gain additional knowledge about the course of various childhood behavioral&#xD;
      syndromes. The information obtained is expected to generate questions to be answered and&#xD;
      hypotheses to be tested in future protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The number of participants to be enrolled will be set at 3,500 participants&#xD;
      to permit inclusion of up to 1,000 probands (children, adolescents and adults) and their&#xD;
      relatives (n = 2,500 to include key 2nd and 3rd degree relatives, as well as 1st degree&#xD;
      relatives).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a natural history protocol. The cross-sectional portion of this study may&#xD;
      include in-depth medical, sleep and neurodevelopmental assessments to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship of biological abnormalities with neuropsychiatric symptomatology. Family members&#xD;
      may be studied to elucidate the nature of any genetic abnormalities observed in the probands.&#xD;
      Clinically useful information will be shared with all participants. Standard therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions may be utilized to evaluate their effects in well-characterized participants&#xD;
      with unique clinical presentations. Participants also may be asked to return to NIH for&#xD;
      periodic follow-up assessments, in order to facilitate the longitudinal assessment of natural&#xD;
      and treated courses of illness as a means of better understanding their progression and&#xD;
      pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: No formal outcomes will be measured; however, the clinical assessments of&#xD;
      enrolled participants may be used to evaluate correlates of clinical symptomatology and&#xD;
      response to standard therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
