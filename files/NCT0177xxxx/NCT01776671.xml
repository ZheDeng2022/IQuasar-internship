      Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a common disorder reported by the patients who undergo amputation.&#xD;
      Even though the cause of PLP remains unclear, Gabapentin has been widely used. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the accuracy and efficacy achieved in using of extended release&#xD;
      Gabapentin. Reducing the incidence of chronic post-amputation pain and improving clinical&#xD;
      outcomes postoperatively.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a common disorder reported by the patients who undergo amputation&#xD;
      from peripheral vascular disease, peripheral neuropathic disease, neoplasm or traumatic&#xD;
      events. Even though the cause of PLP remains unclear and the large number of treatments has&#xD;
      been suggested, there is no single treatment regimen proving long lasting pain relief for&#xD;
      PLP. However Gabapentin is widely used and have been well suggested recently for the&#xD;
      treatment of neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and efficacy achieved in using of&#xD;
      extended release Gabapentin to offer effective pain relief, improvement of sleep function,&#xD;
      and decrease problematic side effects related to the peaks and valleys of the drug's short&#xD;
      cycle in patients with PLP. Gabapentin has been clearly demonstrated to be effective in&#xD;
      neuropathic pain and epilepsy, but as a treatment option for post amputation pain, it has not&#xD;
      been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately, 20 patients will be enrolled in the study, after a titration of two weeks a&#xD;
      changing in pain intensity and quality of life will be obtained at subsequent visits. We are&#xD;
      expected that the accuracy will be of benefit in reducing the incidence of chronic&#xD;
      post-amputation pain and improving clinical outcomes postoperatively.&#xD;
