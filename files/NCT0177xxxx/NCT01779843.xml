    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I trials test the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational drug or combination of drugs. Phase I studies also try to define the&#xD;
      appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot;&#xD;
      means that the combination of drugs is still being studied and that research doctors are&#xD;
      trying to find out more about it. As part of this research study, you will take alisertib in&#xD;
      combination with idarubicin and cytarabine. Alisertib has not been approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      your cancer. However, cytarabine and idarubicin have both been approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      treatment of AML. It also means that the FDA has not approved giving alisertib with&#xD;
      idarubicin and cytarabine for use in patients, including patients with your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Idarubicin and cytarabine are chemotherapy agents that are commonly used to treat individuals&#xD;
      diagnosed with AML. Alisertib has been used in laboratory studies and those studies suggest&#xD;
      that alisertib may slow down the spread of your cancer. It does this by blocking certain&#xD;
      substances needed by the cancer cells to spread. In this study, researchers would like to&#xD;
      combine alisertib with standard chemotherapy (cytarabine and idarubicin) in order to see if&#xD;
      it can be given safely with chemotherapy in individuals with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this research study is to determine the highest dose that alisertib&#xD;
      can be given with idarubicin and cytarabine without severe or unmanageable side effects. The&#xD;
      dose identified in this study will be used in future research studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests or&#xD;
      procedures to find out if you can be in the research study. Many of these tests and&#xD;
      procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out&#xD;
      that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or&#xD;
      procedures recently, they may or may not need to be repeated. These tests and procedures&#xD;
      include: a medical history, physical exam, performance status, urine test, Electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      Echocardiogram, blood tests and a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy. If these tests show that you&#xD;
      are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you&#xD;
      do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will begin treatment with idarubicin, and cytarabine followed by alisertib several days&#xD;
      later (on day 8). Not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same&#xD;
      dose of the study drug. The dose you get will depend on the number of participants who have&#xD;
      been enrolled in the study before you and how well they have tolerated their doses. The&#xD;
      following assessments will be completed while on trial: physical exam, performance status,&#xD;
      urine test, blood tests, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study procedure is called &quot;induction&quot;. During induction you will be&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital on an in-patient basis. You will receive cytarabine and idarubicin&#xD;
      by IV (intravenously or through a vein). Cytarabine will be given by continuous IV infusion&#xD;
      for seven days, beginning on Day 1. Idarubicin will be given once each day as an IV injection&#xD;
      for a total of three days, beginning on the same day as cytarabine. If idarubicin is not&#xD;
      available, you may receive a very similar chemotherapy in its place called daunorubicin.&#xD;
      Alisertib will be given orally (by mouth) twice a day for one week. It will start on the&#xD;
      second week of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bone marrow biopsy will be performed at approximately 14 days after the start of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. If the results of this biopsy detect residual leukemia in the bone marrow, your&#xD;
      physicians may give you another round of induction therapy. However, this time, cytarabine&#xD;
      will be given by continuous IV infusion for only five days, and idarubicin will be given once&#xD;
      each day as an IV injection for a total of 2 days, again beginning on the same day as&#xD;
      cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at the end of the first cycle of induction (whether you've received one round or two&#xD;
      rounds of induction) the number of leukemia cells have not decreased as much as expected or&#xD;
      desired, you will be removed from the study and given alternative options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of study procedure is called &quot;consolidation&quot;. If you have achieved a&#xD;
      remission after your induction phase, you are not a candidate for a bone marrow transplant,&#xD;
      and you tolerated study drug well during induction, you may receive consolidation treatment.&#xD;
      Soem participants may not receive consolidation therapy on this trial, based on the advice of&#xD;
      their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For consolidation, you will receive a higher dose of cytarabine than you did during&#xD;
      induction. You will be hospitalized and cytarabine will be given daily as an IV infusion for&#xD;
      five days. Alisertib will also be given during the consolidation phase of therapy. It will&#xD;
      start at the end of the cytarabine administration and be given for a total of seven days. You&#xD;
      may receive up to four cycles of consolidation treatment, depending on your disease and the&#xD;
      discretion of your treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third part of study procedures is called &quot;maintenance&quot;. After the induction course of&#xD;
      therapy, your physician may begin consolidation therapy. If this is the case, you will start&#xD;
      maintenance therapy after finishing consolidation therapy. If consolidation is not done, the&#xD;
      maintenance phase will start after induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During maintenance, you will take alisertib twice daily for a period of seven days, followed&#xD;
      by a two week break without treatment. This one week of therapy, followed by two weeks off&#xD;
      therapy, will be a 21-day cycle. It will be repeated until 12 months have passed from the&#xD;
      start of the maintenance therapy phase. During this phase, participants will not receive&#xD;
      other chemotherapies and will not be hospitalized for treatment. They will take alisertib at&#xD;
      home and will be followed in clinic for monitoring. During the maintenance phase, we will&#xD;
      continue to collect approximately 2 to 3 teaspoons of blood for research purposes&#xD;
      intermittently on your visits to clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final dose of the study drug we would like to keep track of your medical condition&#xD;
      and overall health following the 12 months of alisertib. We may ask you questions about your&#xD;
      general health, current medications, and disease status. We will also check on any new&#xD;
      anticancer therapy you may have started.&#xD;
