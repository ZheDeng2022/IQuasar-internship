  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Everolimus will be given to patients with metastatic breast cancer who already has a progress&#xD;
      taking Everolimus but with a change in the endocrine treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With continuation of endocrine treatment of breast cancer an adaptive upregulation of&#xD;
      different signaling cascades including the PI3K/akt/mTOR pathway results in cell growth&#xD;
      stimulation and results in resistance to endocrine therapies. One way to restore endocrine&#xD;
      sensitivity is the inhibition of the mTOR pathway in combination with endocrine therapy&#xD;
      leading to an increase in PFS compared with endocrine therapy alone. Guidelines recommend the&#xD;
      sequential treatment with different endocrine therapies. It therefore appears reasonable to&#xD;
      explore if sensitivity can be restored by changing the subsequent endocrine combination&#xD;
      partner of Everolimus in case of failure of a combined endocrine-everolimus therapy.&#xD;
