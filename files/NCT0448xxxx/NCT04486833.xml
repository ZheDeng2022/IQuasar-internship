  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized study is to determine the safety and efficacy of GPX-001 a.k.a&#xD;
      REQORSA (a TUSC2, tumor suppressor gene, encapsulate by non-viral lipid nanoparticles) added&#xD;
      to osimertinib in NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations who have progressed while on&#xD;
      treatment with osimertinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 phases, a Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1) and an Expansion&#xD;
      Phase (Phase 2). In Phase 1, patients will be enrolled in sequential cohorts treated with&#xD;
      successively higher doses of GPX-001 in combination with osimertinib. In Phase 2, patient&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive GPX-001 plus osimertinib or osimertinib alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      GEN-104 is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study evaluating quaratusugene ozeplasmid&#xD;
      (GPX-001) plus osimertinib versus monotherapy osimertinib in patients with advanced&#xD;
      metastatic or recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicities will be assessed by the Investigator using United States National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Serious Adverse&#xD;
      Events and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) will be reviewed by a safety review committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Dose Escalation: The prospective maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in combination with&#xD;
      osimertinib, identified in the Dose Escalation phase will be confirmed in at least 6 patients&#xD;
      to obtain additional safety and anti-tumor activity data. This confirmed GPX-001 dose will be&#xD;
      the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) used in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: In the this Phase, GPX-001 in combination with osimertinib will be further evaluated&#xD;
      using the RP2D identified in Phase 1. Patients will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      combination therapy or osimertinib alone in a 1 to 1 ratio and stratified based on prior&#xD;
      local radiotherapy. Other subsets may be explored based on emergent data.&#xD;
