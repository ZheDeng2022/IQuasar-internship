  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The a series of clinical studies of [18F]FSPG PET/CT showed that [18F]FSPG is safe and&#xD;
      promising PET tracer for detecting inflammation with favorable biodistribution and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics in patients. By using [18F]FSPG, which targets system xCˉ, a key player in&#xD;
      the active phase of inflammation, the goal of this phase 2 study is to evaluate diagnostic&#xD;
      validity of [18F]FSPG PET/CT to detect allograft rejection after heart and liver allograft,&#xD;
      where conventional imaging has limitations. Diagnostic efficacy of [18F]FSPG PET/CT will be&#xD;
      determined in comparison with histologic evaluation of allograft biopsy. Other critical&#xD;
      questions including whether quantitative measures of [18F]FSPG uptake is associated with the&#xD;
      severity of rejection, inter-reader variability of [18F]FSPG PET/CT, and safety assessment&#xD;
      will be also evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open label, non-randomized, single center, single-dose exploratory study is designed to&#xD;
      obtain imaging assessments using PET/CT with [18F]FSPG in patients with heart transplantation&#xD;
      (HT, n = 10) and liver transplantation (LT, n = 10). Subjects who underwent or scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo biopsy for histologic diagnosis of acute rejection will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises 3 periods: screening, treatment, and follow-up. The screening period&#xD;
      starts with the subject's signature on the informed consent form and ends with assignment to&#xD;
      treatment that is inclusion of the subject for treatment. The treatment period starts with&#xD;
      baseline measurements, and ends with the last measurement/procedure on the day following&#xD;
      injection of 200 MBq of [18F]FSPG. The follow-up period contains the end-of-study interview.&#xD;
      Key measurement is the PET/CT image acquisition about one hour after the single injection of&#xD;
      [18F]FSPG. For evaluation of safety, adverse events (AE) will be monitored and recorded&#xD;
      during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be monitored regularly by a clinical research associate from the sponsor or a&#xD;
      designated contract research organization. Data quality and study integrity will be assessed.&#xD;
      The investigator will document the items that are required to evaluate the study in the&#xD;
      subject files. Data required according to this protocol are to be recorded on the case report&#xD;
      forms provided by the sponsor as soon as possible.&#xD;
