  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, many studies have shown that technology assisted learning is a new learning&#xD;
      approach (1); In particular, learning environments involving virtual reality (VR) techniques&#xD;
      have become a powerful tool for educators and students (3, 4). Significant progress has been&#xD;
      made in various fields, enabling students to interact with the virtual world. These&#xD;
      technologies support many educational activities originally offered in web-based learning&#xD;
      environments. In midwifery education, the use of simulation has become an important training&#xD;
      method in the last decade (2). Simulation is a method that reflects a clinical situation as&#xD;
      close to reality as possible, making it easier to understand and manage when this situation&#xD;
      is actually encountered in clinical practice. Ensuring patient safety, efforts to increase&#xD;
      students' competence have enabled the use of simulation to become more widespread in the&#xD;
      training of health professionals (5). Using virtual reality in midwifery education will&#xD;
      enable students to use midwifery practices effectively before going to clinical practice.&#xD;
      Teaching the birth, which is one of the cornerstones of midwifery education and where the&#xD;
      students find the opportunity to practice clinically, with virtual reality application, will&#xD;
      minimize clinical application errors and will provide early diagnosis of adverse conditions&#xD;
      such as fetal presentation and placental anomalies that may occur at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of the Study: The study is an experimental study planned as an experimental and control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research consists of 2 parts. In Part I, Virtual Reality Application will be Developed.&#xD;
      Virtual birth software will be prepared through service procurement. For this, algorithms&#xD;
      will be created by the researchers by writing in detail the physiology, stages, mechanism and&#xD;
      anatomy of the woman in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. The application of the research will be done in the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECTION I: Development of Virtual Reality Application&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1st part of the research, virtual birth software will be prepared through service&#xD;
      procurement. For this, algorithms will be created by the researchers by writing in detail the&#xD;
      physiology, stages, mechanism and anatomy of the woman in detail. This algorithm will be&#xD;
      transferred to the glasses based on the images and drawings of the anatomy of the woman from&#xD;
      the birth atlases and the real images shared on the internet at the moment of birth. As&#xD;
      stated in the budget form, services will be procured for the development of the virtual birth&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the virtual birth application,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn the physiology and mechanism of birth,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To monitor the progress of the birth and to understand deviations from the normal,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learning normal birth,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will provide the opportunity to see all the emergencies that may be encountered at&#xD;
           birth and besides these, the information will be remembered for a long time. In this&#xD;
           way, the effectiveness of virtual birth in midwifery education will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Department: Application of the Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this last part of the research, the application part of the research has been started. The&#xD;
      research will consist of 3 groups, 2 experimental groups and a control group. 35 students&#xD;
      will be admitted to each group as a result of G-power analysis calculated with 0.95 power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Universe of the research will consist of 464 Midwifery students studying at Karabük&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will consist of 105 midwifery students, 35 control, 35 experiment I and 35&#xD;
      experiment II, as a result of the G-power analysis calculated by 0.95 power, among midwifery&#xD;
      students who took the birth mechanism 4 hours theoretically in their curriculum within the&#xD;
      scope of normal birth lesson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first stage: after 4 hours of theory training for all three groups, the information&#xD;
      form (DEDBF) to be prepared by the researchers to be used in this research will be applied as&#xD;
      the first test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage: No application will be made to the control group, computer-aided and&#xD;
      guided virtual reality application will be applied to the experimental group, and&#xD;
      computer-free and non-guided virtual application will be monitored to the experimental group&#xD;
      II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third stage: DEDBF questions will be replaced and posttests will be applied. After the&#xD;
      4-hour theory training for the control group, the post-test will be done after the virtual&#xD;
      birth application is watched on the experiment groups. Also, at this stage, &quot;Cognitive Load&#xD;
      Scale&quot; and &quot;Feel of Inventory&quot; will be applied to the experimental groups after the&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the fourth stage: After three weeks, the DEDBF will be applied again to the three groups,&#xD;
      and the effectiveness of the application of virtual birth will be examined in recalling and&#xD;
      recalling the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During applications, experiment and control group videos and images will be taken and&#xD;
      published visually in the thesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students who could not participate in the study and were selected as a control group in&#xD;
      randomization will also be provided with virtual reality glasses after the study, so that all&#xD;
      students will see the virtual birth application and equality will be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection form: It is planned to apply a form consisting of 15 questions, which&#xD;
      includes the characteristics of the participants such as age, marital status, educational&#xD;
      status and family type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Birth Action Assessment Information Scale (DEDBF): The scale will be prepared by the&#xD;
      researchers themselves for use in this thesis. For the preparation of the form, the latest&#xD;
      literature information was reviewed by the researchers, the midwifery core curriculum (EUÇEP)&#xD;
      created by YÖK, and a 42-question information form containing items on the physiology, stages&#xD;
      and mechanism of delivery was prepared. The items in the information form will be presented&#xD;
      to the students in the form of a full sentence that can be true or false, and students will&#xD;
      be asked to answer these statements as &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot;. Total response time is 30 minutes.&#xD;
      Correct answers will be evaluated as 1 point, Wrong answers will be evaluated as 0 points.&#xD;
      Wrong expressions were also used in the information form, and these items were coded in&#xD;
      reverse compared to others. The lowest score to be taken from the information form is 0 and&#xD;
      the highest total score is 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Load Scale: Kılıç et al. (2004) &quot;Cognitive Load Scale&quot; (BYÖ) adapted to Turkish&#xD;
      will be used. It has single factor and nine points (very little, very little, little, partly&#xD;
      little, neither more nor less, more, more, more, more, more, more or more). The Cronbach&#xD;
      Alpha internal consistency coefficient of the original version was found to be .90 (7). Kılıç&#xD;
      et al. (2004) in the adaptation study, the Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient&#xD;
      was found as .78. The lowest point of the scores obtained from the scale is 1.00, the middle&#xD;
      point is 5.00 and the highest point is 9.00. Participants scoring less than five points were&#xD;
      evaluated as &quot;cognitively overloaded&quot;, and participants scoring higher than five points were&#xD;
      evaluated as &quot;cognitively overloaded&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Availability Sensitivity Scale: It is the scale whose original validity in Turkish was valid&#xD;
      in 2018 by Gökoğlu et al. The scale is measured in virtual reality based learning&#xD;
      environments. The scale has 5 factors (subscale), namely Participation (Factor 1), Cohesion /&#xD;
      Surrounding (Factor 2), Sensory Commitment (Factor 3), Interaction (Factor 4) and Interface&#xD;
      Quality (Factor 5) and consists of 29 questions (8 ). According to the exploratory factor&#xD;
      analysis (AFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the total variance explained by the&#xD;
      5-factor structure was 41.197% and the reliability coefficient of the scale was .844.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis of the Research: Analysis of the data of the study will be done using IBM SPSS&#xD;
      for Mac book 24 version.&#xD;
