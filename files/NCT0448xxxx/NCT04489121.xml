  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) is induced by an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reaction in the&#xD;
      allergen-sensitized subjects, affecting 10% to 40% of the world population. AR could be&#xD;
      divided into two kinds, perennial AR and seasonal AR (SAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, biologics have become promising drugs for allergic diseases. The efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Omalizumab in treating SAR have been well proven by previous studies. However,&#xD;
      the efficacy in preseasonal treatment for SAR has not yet been studied before.&#xD;
