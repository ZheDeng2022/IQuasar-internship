  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease, and in particular ischemic heart disease, is the main cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality worldwide today (1). Myocardial infarction (MI) presents the most&#xD;
      serious clinical entity through its short-term life threatening involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The many advances in the management of IDM during the acute phase, namely the increasingly&#xD;
      frequent and effective use of reperfusion means (angioplasty and thrombolysis) as well as&#xD;
      pharmacological progress, in particular, the management of anti-thrombotic treatment has&#xD;
      enabled a significant reduction in intra-hospital mortality, in the medium and long term (2).&#xD;
      In fact, the mortality rate dropped from 25-30% before the creation of the cardiac intensive&#xD;
      care units (ICUS) around the 1960s, to around 16% in the 1980s and reaching 4 to 6% today. In&#xD;
      the latest data from the French FAST MI 2015 register (French Registry of Acute ST-Elevation&#xD;
      or Non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction) mortality was 2.8% in hospital (3) and 5.3% at 6&#xD;
      months (4). Nevertheless, mortality rates diverge from one register to another and are&#xD;
      generally higher compared to randomized controlled clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our country, due to the aging of the Tunisian population (currently the oldest population&#xD;
      in Africa), as well as the rise in the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (5), the&#xD;
      incidence of IDM is clearly increasing. However, our local specificities concerning the&#xD;
      management of this pathology and the intra-hospital mortality which results from it, remain&#xD;
      little described despite the importance of these data in the development of personalized&#xD;
      algorithms and the improvement of the quality of this support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the management of CAD ST + in the public sector poses more and more efficiency problems and&#xD;
      moves away from international recommendations in our country, an assessment of our national&#xD;
      situation is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are, primary, the incidence of new cases that consult the&#xD;
      emergency room for CAD ST + and the treatment delivered to the emergency room, in particular&#xD;
      the nature of the treatment for obstruction (primary angioplasty or thrombolysis). Secondary,&#xD;
      the evaluation of hospital complications and the future of patients on D30 and after one year&#xD;
      from the inclusion's day.&#xD;
