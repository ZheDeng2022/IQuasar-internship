  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, pilot, feasibility study evaluating effects of Intermittent Theta&#xD;
      Burst Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (iTBS) on 5 eligible adolescents for the treatment of&#xD;
      depression. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated with changes in depression scores, and&#xD;
      suicidality and non-suicidal self injurious behavior will also be monitored for exploratory&#xD;
      and safety measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy and durability of the effects of Intermittent Theta&#xD;
      Burst Stimulation (iTBS) in adolescent depression by measuring changes in clinical ratings&#xD;
      before, during, and after 4 weeks of treatment, up to 12 weeks following treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that subjects will show: improvement in symptoms over 20 iTBS sessions&#xD;
      as measured by the Children's Depression Rating Scale Revised (CDRS-R), Hamilton Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Non-suicidal Self Injurious Behavior (NSSIB) measures, and&#xD;
      persistence of this reduction of depressive symptoms through the 12 weeks follow up period of&#xD;
      the study. In this study, the investigators will investigate the safety of the effects of&#xD;
      iTBS in adolescent depression. The investigators will investigate safety of the treatment&#xD;
      regimen by assessing suicidality. The investigators expect suicidal thoughts and behavior&#xD;
      will reduce with iTBS treatment as measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale&#xD;
      (C-SSRS) and a psychiatrist's clinical assessment. The investigators also expect that those&#xD;
      with NSSIB at the start of the trial will have less after iTBS treatments. The investigators&#xD;
      do not expect any change in cognition measured with the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),&#xD;
      Trails B, and List Generation. The investigators will investigate treatment feasibility by&#xD;
      assessing treatment completion and withdrawal. The investigators define the feasibility of&#xD;
      iTBS will be defined as feasible by as completion of 15/20 (75%) iTBS treatment sessions by&#xD;
      all subjects and withdrawal from treatment of no more than one of five subjects (20%) due to&#xD;
      intolerable side effects or persistent symptoms of MDD. Investigation of efficacy,&#xD;
      durability, safety as well as feasibility simultaneously is essential in this preliminary&#xD;
      study of the use of iTBS in adolescents in order to justify a larger future study. This study&#xD;
      will include a screening visit, 20 iTBS treatments, and 3 planned follow up visits.&#xD;

    <measure>Safety Defined by Change in C-SSRS Evaluations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks Post-Treatment Completion, a total of up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a semi-structured interview that has &quot;yes or no&quot; answers to assess the likelihood of a subject harming themselves. Based on subject's response to questions, a clinician scores &quot;acute lethality/ medical damage&quot; from a score of 0-5, with a higher score indicating more medical attention is needed and the patient is less safe. &quot;Potential lethality&quot; is scored 0-2, with a higher score indicating a higher risk of future harm to self. This scale also uses clinician judgment to determine these scores based on the subject's responses to the &quot;yes/no&quot; questions and follow-up descriptions to answers as needed.</description>

    <description>Motor Threshold determination, done prior to starting treatments, determines the location and the intensity for the iTBS treatments. A magnetic field is applied with increasing intensity stimulating the motor region of the brain until there is thumb movement; this indicates the intensity of the treatments; the location for treatment is in the sensory area parallel to this location.</description>

    <description>iTBS is a particular TMS protocol which delivers the magnetic field in triplet bursts (three stimulations very close together at a frequency of 50 Hz very quickly). The triplet bursts are repeated at a rate of 5 Hz for 2 seconds (30 pulses), followed by 8 seconds rest, repeated 20 times for a total of 600 pulses. Each treatments lasts approximately 3 minutes, and sessions are provided 20 times (Monday-Friday for 4 consecutive weeks).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A score of greater than 40 on the CDRS-R and 17 on HAM-D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of DSM-V criteria for current MDD or TRD will be required for study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may be on antidepressant medication at a stable dose or receiving&#xD;
             psychotherapy with a licensed provider during the active phase of TMS treatment for 4&#xD;
             weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide consent and take part in questionnaires and scales (i.e.: not&#xD;
             currently intellectually disabled).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of suicidality or NSSIB are not required to enter this study. Although&#xD;
             our secondary end-points include suicidality, and the investigators are also exploring&#xD;
             NSSIB, and thus this may not lead to many data, the investigators' plan is to use data&#xD;
             from this study to justify a larger study where this can be more robustly&#xD;
             investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past or current diagnosis of bipolar disorder, psychosis, seizures or traumatic brain&#xD;
             injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of intracranial metallic implants or fragments, which is a contraindication&#xD;
             for TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lifetime history of (or currently present) epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current diagnosis of substance abuse, eating disorder, PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress&#xD;
             Disorder), or intellectual disability.* Nicotine use disorder will not directly&#xD;
             preclude a potential subject from this study. Although chronic nicotine use does&#xD;
             effect central nervous system excitability, what would be more confounding to our&#xD;
             study would be if there is a sudden change in nicotine use during the treatment phase,&#xD;
             as this may affect the motor threshold. Inclusion will however be at the PI's&#xD;
             discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current imminent suicide ideation or other clinical reasons for inpatient psychiatric&#xD;
             hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently pregnant. There is currently not adequate data from this population to&#xD;
             ensure safety with the scope of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any reason the investigator determines may cause noncompliance with study rules or is&#xD;
             unfit for receiving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking certain medications including antidepressants, stimulants,&#xD;
             benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics, antiepileptic (per investigator discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any positive drug testing from a urine drug test unless medically indicated with a&#xD;
             valid prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Those with marijuana/cannabis positive results may retest later if at that time&#xD;
                  they do not meet criteria for substance abuse at screening and agree to refrain&#xD;
                  from use for the duration of study participation. Decision to be made by&#xD;
                  Investigator discretion.&#xD;
