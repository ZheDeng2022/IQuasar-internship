  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Submucous myomas represent one of the main indications of operative hysteroscopy. Since 1976&#xD;
      when Neuwirth and Amin reported the first five cases of excision of submucous myomas ,&#xD;
      several techniques have been developed in order to render hysteroscopic myomectomy a safe and&#xD;
      effective procedure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hysteroscopic myomectomy is currently considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; minimally invasive&#xD;
      approach for the treatment of symptomatic submucous myomas . Patients undergoing&#xD;
      hysteroscopic myomectomy are liable to significant blood loss, and hemodynamic and&#xD;
      hematological disturbances. Excessive bleeding during hysteroscopic myomectomy remains a&#xD;
      major challenge for the endoscopic gynecological surgeons. Many interventions were introduced&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of bleeding during myomectomy. These include the use of utero-tonics such&#xD;
      as oxytocin, or the use of anti-fibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid . The potential&#xD;
      advantage of oxytocin infusion during hysteroscopic myomectomy is that it can maintains&#xD;
      uterine contractility throughout the procedure, and thus, reduce blood loss .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbetocin (1-deamino-1-monocarba-(0-2-methyltyrosine)-oxytocin) is a long-acting synthetic&#xD;
      agonist analogue of the human oxytocin. When injected to a woman, it induces uterine&#xD;
      contractions . Although many interventions have been described to reduce the intraoperative&#xD;
      blood loss during hysteroscopic myomectomy, there is a need for a well-designed randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials to identify the most efficient interventions, with reasonable safety&#xD;
      profiles, to help the perform a safe and curative surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All patients will have preoperative evaluation by gynecologists and anesthetists, with&#xD;
      history taking and pelvic examination. A TVS scan will be done to determine the number, size&#xD;
      and location of the myomas, and evaluate the myometrial free margin (the minimum thickness&#xD;
      between the outer edge of the myoma and inner edge of the uterine serosa), which was found to&#xD;
      be ideally ≥ 10 mm (11). Prior office diagnostic hysteroscopy will be performed for&#xD;
      evaluation of the number, location and grade of the submucous myomas, and assessment of the&#xD;
      endocervical canal and uterine cavity and the position of the tubal ostia in order to aid&#xD;
      orientation. Preoperative full blood count, serum creatinine, fasting blood glucose, liver&#xD;
      enzymes, coagulation profile ( INR), and viral markers will be done for all the patients.&#xD;
      Monopolar resectoscopic myomectomies will be scheduled in the proliferative phase of&#xD;
      menstrual cycle by a single experienced operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of general anesthesia, immediately before the operation, participants will&#xD;
      receive either 1 ml of carbetocin (100 mcg/ml) IV over 1 minute (study group) or 1 ml of&#xD;
      sodium chloride 0.9% IV over 1 minute (control group). The procedure will be done using the&#xD;
      available standard setup and the distending solution used will be 1.5% glycine. A drape with&#xD;
      a fluid-collection pouch (Lingeman 3 in 1 Procedure Drape, Lingeman Medical Products, Inc.,&#xD;
      Indianapolis, IN) placed beneath the woman's buttocks will be used to collect outflow fluid&#xD;
      escaping between the cervix and sheath to prevent spillage of irrigating fluid onto the&#xD;
      floor. Fluid inflow and outflow will be monitored every 3-5 minutes. The outflow fluid will&#xD;
      be measured to the nearest milliliter. The inflow and outflow volumes of the distension&#xD;
      solution will be carefully monitored continuously during the procedure by nurses not involved&#xD;
      in the study under the current monitoring protocol at the operating theater. The procedure&#xD;
      would be terminated if the fluid imbalance reached 1 L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the procedure, the surgeon completed a record sheet for rating of bleeding&#xD;
      amount and the quality of operative view. Postoperative full blood count will be done for all&#xD;
      patients 24 hours after the procedures. Preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin and&#xD;
      hematocrit, the need for blood transfusion, the duration of operation, any operative&#xD;
      complications and medication adverse effects will be recorded.&#xD;
