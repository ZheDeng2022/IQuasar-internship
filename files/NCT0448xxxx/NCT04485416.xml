      Primary Objective: To assess safety of eltrombopag in pediatric patients undergoing intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy for malignant solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To assess the efficacy of eltrombopag in increasing platelet count up&#xD;
      to 2 weeks after completion of chemotherapy in pediatric patients undergoing intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy for malignant solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that eltrombopag an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist will&#xD;
      increase the platelet count safely and efficaciously in children having chemotherapy induced&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia while on therapy for solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eltrombopag is an orally administered, small molecule thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonist&#xD;
      that stimulates platelet production by a mechanism similar, but not identical to endogenous&#xD;
      TPO. Eltrombopag interacts with the transmembrane domain of the TPO-R (also known as C-MPL)&#xD;
      leading to increased platelet production (Erickson-Miller, 2010; Sun et al, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eltrombopag is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult and pediatric&#xD;
      patients one year and older with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have&#xD;
      had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eltrombopag has also been approved for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients&#xD;
      with chronic hepatitis C to allow for the initiation and maintenance of interferon-based&#xD;
      therapy and for the treatment of cytopenias in adult patients with severe aplastic anemia&#xD;
      (SAA) who have had insufficient responses to immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, single center pilot trial of eltrombopag in pediatric patients&#xD;
      receiving cancer directed therapy for solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to explore&#xD;
      the platelet supportive care effects and safety of eltrombopag in pediatric patients (ages&#xD;
      one to 18 years of age) undergoing intensive chemotherapy for malignant solid tumors. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be to determine the safety of eltrombopag in pediatric patients&#xD;
      undergoing intensive chemotherapy for malignant solid tumors using CTCAE v5.0 criteria. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoint will be to determine the efficacy of eltrombopag in pediatric patients&#xD;
      undergoing intensive chemotherapy for malignant solid tumors. These objectives will be&#xD;
      assessed by evaluating drug-related toxicities, the platelet response in patients and the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects receiving eltrombopag who are platelet transfusion-free during the&#xD;
      time period of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 10 subjects with histologically confirmed solid tumors, including but&#xD;
      not limited to rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcoma, peripheral nerve sheath tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor,&#xD;
      hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, higher grade neuroblastoma,&#xD;
      medulloblastoma, or other rare malignant solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cancer directed therapy will be part of standard treatment for each patient and will&#xD;
      consist of two to four cycles of chemotherapy (or as many as clinically indicated per&#xD;
      physician discretion) to reduce tumor burden, followed by surgery in the majority of cases,&#xD;
      and/or radiation in a minority of cases, or both in rare cases at various times in the course&#xD;
      of treatment. After recovery from the surgery and/or radiation, chemotherapy and eltrombopag&#xD;
      will be resumed until completion. Each cycle of chemotherapy will be approximately two to&#xD;
      four weeks (14 to 28 days) in length with chemotherapy administered for one to five days per&#xD;
      cycle. The duration of chemotherapy varies by regimen and underlying malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will initiate eltrombopag on the first day following the completion of chemotherapy&#xD;
      for each cycle (e.g., chemo is administered on Days 1-5, eltrombopag to start on Day 6).&#xD;
      Eltrombopag will be administered daily and the dose will be age dependent (see Table 5).&#xD;
      Children less than 6 years of age will receive a starting dose of 25 mg by mouth once daily,&#xD;
      taken on empty stomach one hour before or two hours after a meal. For children greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 6 years of age, the starting dose will be 75 mg by mouth once daily. Doses shall&#xD;
      be reduced in patients of Asian ancestry (e.g., Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese, or Korean): for&#xD;
      those patients greater than or equal to 6 years of age, the starting dose will be 50 mg by&#xD;
      mouth once daily and for those patients less than 6 years old, the starting dose will be 12.5&#xD;
      mg by mouth once daily. Eltrombopag will be continued until the platelets are at least&#xD;
      100,000/µL after the nadir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center or when they are&#xD;
      admitted to UC Davis Children's Hospital.&#xD;

                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of use&#xD;
                  of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a&#xD;
                  minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Female subjects who are nursing or pregnant (positive serum or urine B-human chorionic&#xD;

             drug during treatment, and for 8 days (&gt; 5 half-lives ) after stopping eltrombopag and&#xD;
             for 5 half-lives after the last dose of chemotherapy treatment and should not father a&#xD;
             child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as well&#xD;
             as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the drug via&#xD;
             semen.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Any condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the&#xD;
             patient's safety or compliance on trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to enrollment that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would interfere with patient safety or compliance on trial.&#xD;
