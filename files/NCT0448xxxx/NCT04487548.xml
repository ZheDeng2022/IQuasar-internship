    <textblock>
      Smoking continues to be a burden to the healthcare system in Canada. It is well-known that&#xD;
      smokers suffer more complications and higher risk of mortality after surgery than&#xD;
      non-smokers. A quality improvement project at Royal Columbian Hospital recently showed that&#xD;
      it is possible to implement a smoking cessation bundle for all current smokers during their&#xD;
      preadmission clinic visit. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the bundle was&#xD;
      abandoned as it relied heavily on in-person interactions. The investigators wish to study the&#xD;
      effect of a structured smoking cessation bundle, delivered remotely, on smoking cessation and&#xD;
      postoperative complications. The aim is to determine the feasibility of giving the remotely&#xD;
      delivered bundle to elective surgical patients before or around the time of a preadmission&#xD;
      clinic visit, and whether it can reduce smoking rates and postoperative complications versus&#xD;
      the standard uncoordinated advice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction and Background Smoking continues to be a burden to the healthcare system in&#xD;
      Canada. As of 2019, 3.7 million Canadians (12% of the population over age 15) reported being&#xD;
      a current smoker. British Columbia's smoking rate is lower, but 10.2% of adults still&#xD;
      regularly smoke cigarettes1. It is well-known that smokers suffer more complications and&#xD;
      higher risk of mortality after surgery than non-smokers. Pulmonary complications,&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications, and surgical site infections are mediators of&#xD;
      smoking-associated mortality at 6-months and 1-year after elective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there have been a handful of studies that have demonstrated dramatic reductions in&#xD;
      postoperative complications with well-timed smoking cessation interventions in the&#xD;
      preoperative period, these results have not translated into widespread clinical practice in&#xD;
      delaying surgery for the purpose of achieving smoking cessation. In addition, most of these&#xD;
      studies took place in Europe, where smokers may behave differently than in the Canadian&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review recommended at least 4 weeks of smoking cessation in order to reduce&#xD;
      postoperative complications6. Several European studies have shown dramatic reductions in&#xD;
      complications (up to 30% absolute risk reductions) when smoking cessation interventions have&#xD;
      been implemented 4-8 weeks preoperatively. One Canadian editorial even suggested new policies&#xD;
      be put into place to delay elective surgeries in smokers until a trial of cessation for 6&#xD;
      weeks had taken place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of smoking cessation programs preoperatively have the potential to reduce&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. A Cochrane systematic review has shown that preoperative smoking&#xD;
      cessation therapy improves both short and long-term smoking cessation. In fact, a surgical&#xD;
      encounter with the healthcare system has been described as a &quot;teachable moment&quot; that provides&#xD;
      motivation for patients to permanently stop smoking. Despite this information, most&#xD;
      anesthesiologists do not routinely offer smoking cessation advice to their patients and&#xD;
      advice, counselling, and pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is not routine in&#xD;
      pre-admission clinics across Canada and the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several small trials have shown that smoking cessation interventions can increase smoking&#xD;
      cessation and reduce postoperative complications, particularly wound-healing complications,&#xD;
      which can have an absolute risk reduction of up to 25%. Prior work by one of the&#xD;
      co-investigators showed that a simple intervention in the pre-admission clinic was able to&#xD;
      increase the abstinence rate from 3.6% to 14.3% on the day of surgery. Smoking cessation&#xD;
      initiated in the perioperative period can also promote long-term smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these successes, since the COVID-19 pandemic, standard care at Royal Columbian&#xD;
      Hospital (RCH) has not routinely included specific preoperative smoking cessation&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy or counselling. However, hospital leaders and the RCH Department of&#xD;
      Anesthesia have identified preoperative preparation, including smoking cessation, as a key&#xD;
      area of interest for development. Therefore, this is the ideal time to study the feasibility&#xD;
      of the perioperative smoking cessation bundle given to patients without the requirement for&#xD;
      an in-person visit. Advantages of this remote model are expected to continue after the&#xD;
      pandemic restrictions end, since smoking cessation bundles will be able to be started earlier&#xD;
      (and thus have more potential to prevent surgical complications), compared to waiting for a&#xD;
      preadmission clinic visit, which can often occur only a few days preoperatively. The&#xD;
      perioperative smoking cessation bundle will include: an emailed link to a quitnow.ca&#xD;
      preoperative smoking cessation video and referral to quit coach, free nicotine replacement&#xD;
      therapy (NRT) delivered by an online pharmacy, an emailed or post-mailed RCH smoking&#xD;
      cessation brochure, and brief telephone advice. This bundle will be offered to those regular&#xD;
      smokers of cigarettes randomized to the intervention group following their surgical&#xD;
      consultation, at the time of preadmission clinic appointment booking, or following their&#xD;
      preadmission telephone consultation. The control group will receive the standard of care&#xD;
      which sometimes includes brief advice and informing patients about availability of further&#xD;
      aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the simple smoking cessation intervention has been implemented for the intervention&#xD;
      group, the investigators wish to compare rates of resource access, smoking cessation, and&#xD;
      postoperative complications between the group receiving the smoking cessation bundle and&#xD;
      those receiving standard care. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person preadmission clinic&#xD;
      visits are no longer scheduled. Instead, high-risk surgical patients are phoned prior to&#xD;
      surgery to mitigate surgical risk factors and better prepare them for surgery.&#xD;
      Self-identification as a regular smoker is one risk factor that would warrant recruitment&#xD;
      into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators estimated that a definitive randomized controlled trial would require a&#xD;
      sample size of 214 participants. However, relatively low rates of smoking in British Columbia&#xD;
      and the cancellation of in-person preadmission clinic visits present a unique challenge to&#xD;
      patient recruitment. It is therefore imperative to establish the recruitment rate for&#xD;
      progression to a full randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a preliminary analysis of rates of smoking and reduction of postoperative&#xD;
      complications in elective surgical patients when the smoking cessation bundle is given to&#xD;
      patients immediately following their preadmission clinic telephone consultation will be&#xD;
      conducted. The investigators plan to carry out a pilot randomized controlled trial where&#xD;
      patients who identify as smokers will be randomized to receive the remotely delivered smoking&#xD;
      cessation bundle versus standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and Justification Most randomized studies showing improved smoking cessation rates&#xD;
      after preoperative interventions have strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, and required&#xD;
      ongoing consent for research experimentation, which limits their external generalizability.&#xD;
      The BuTT Out Pilot Study is of utmost importance since it has the potential to demonstrate&#xD;
      reductions in surgical site infections and lengths-of-stay using a low-cost intervention (a&#xD;
      bundle of emailed video, brochure, helpline referral and government funded smoking-cessation&#xD;
      therapy). A 2020 survey of the BC Smoking Cessation Program reported that 66% of respondents&#xD;
      found the program helpful, with a quit rate of 37%. Providing the program as a part of a&#xD;
      structured bundle will improve the accessibility of smoking cessation aids. If this&#xD;
      hypothesis is confirmed as suspected since it is based on prior research in other countries,&#xD;
      widespread implementation could translate into tremendous advantages for the patient, in&#xD;
      terms of reduced complications, and providers, in terms of cost savings. Conducting a pilot&#xD;
      study will help mitigate the challenge of recruiting an adequate sample size by establishing&#xD;
      a recruitment rate and consequently improve the feasibility of a definitive randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. Since this study will examine remotely-delivered interventions, its&#xD;
      potential for widespread use will be much greater than other previously studied in-person&#xD;
      study designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question For patients who smoke undergoing elective surgery, what is the effect of&#xD;
      an evidence-based remotely-delivered smoking cessation bundle administered preoperatively on&#xD;
      patients' outcomes (smoking rates, complication rates and hospital length of stay) compared&#xD;
      with standard practice which sometimes includes brief advice and informing patients about&#xD;
      availability of further aids?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives To establish the recruitment rate, optimal recruitment pathway, and rate&#xD;
      of accessing of available resources as criteria for progression to a definitive randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether smoking rates, surgical complications, and postoperative complications&#xD;
      can be documented in elective surgical patients when the remotely-delivered smoking cessation&#xD;
      bundle is administered preoperatively vs. standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis The hypothesis for this pilot RCT is that at least 8 patients will be&#xD;
      screened per week, at least 25% will give informed consent, and &gt;80% will adhere to the study&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching research hypothesis is that in patients who smoke, receiving the&#xD;
      remotely-delivered perioperative smoking cessation bundle prior to elective surgery for the&#xD;
      purpose of quitting smoking will result in reduced smoking rates on the day of surgery, lower&#xD;
      30-day complications, and shorter lengths of stay. Definitive estimation of effect size is&#xD;
      not expected from this pilot study, but confidence intervals will give rise to sample size&#xD;
      estimation for a future full-size trial.&#xD;
