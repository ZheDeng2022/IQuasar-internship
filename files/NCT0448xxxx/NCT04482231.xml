  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the study aimed to determine the distribution of respiratory infections in Tunisian&#xD;
      population and evaluate the frequency of antibiotics prescribed according to current&#xD;
      international recommendations.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is an observational, cross-sectional, multicenter, national clinical study . The study was&#xD;
      carried out from January 2018 to August 2018 in Tunisian population involving 57 primary care&#xD;
      outpatient centers and 6 emergency departments from the 24 departments of the country .&#xD;
&#xD;
      We included all patients with lower and upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs) who have&#xD;
      recieved antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) include pneumonia and acute bronchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTIs) include rhinitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis,&#xD;
      and laryngitis. Rhinitis, also known as coryza, is irritation and inflammation of the mucous&#xD;
      membrane inside the nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol of our study includes the demographic characteristics and the history of the&#xD;
      sample as well as the symptomatology at inclusion. The data from the clinical examination&#xD;
      were reported by the investigating doctor. After the diagnosis retained by the doctor is&#xD;
      noted with the management of the patient which includes additional explorations if they have&#xD;
      been requested. Finally, the investigating doctor specifies the antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      prescribed.Appropriateness of antibiotic prescription was assessed in patients managed in the&#xD;
      EDs . We used the MAI score (medication appropriateness index) wich includes 10 criteria. For&#xD;
      each criterion, the evaluator rates whether the medication is appropriate, marginally&#xD;
      appropriate, or inappropriate. Support is provided through explicit definitions and&#xD;
      instructions.The MAI has been used in observational and interventional studies.Its&#xD;
      feasibility, content validity, predictive validity, and reliability have been demonstrated in&#xD;
      ambulatory settings. The maximum score is 20 which translates into maximum inappropriateness.&#xD;
      If a patient is on multiple drugs, this test can be repeated for each drug in order to&#xD;
      determine a total MAI score.&#xD;
