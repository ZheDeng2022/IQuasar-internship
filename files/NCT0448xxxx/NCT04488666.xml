      A study of the first clinical use in humans of a novel NPWT system (npSIMS) to assess the&#xD;
      suitability, safety and efficacy of the system for the management of closed surgical wounds&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to test the functionality of a novel, non-electric NPWT&#xD;
      device: npSIMS (negative pressure Surgical Incision Management System) from Aatru Medical LLC&#xD;
      (Ohio, USA) which uses an exothermic chemical process to extract the oxygen from the air&#xD;
      contained within the dressing (air contains 21% O2) and hence bring and maintain the system&#xD;
      to between -160 and -80 mmHg below atmospheric pressure (760 mmHg). The dressing and the&#xD;
      chemical reaction pump module can be manufactured for significantly less than the cost of&#xD;
      electromechanical NPWT systems and can be profitably marketed at a discount to the cost of&#xD;
      existing commercial devices. The Aatru Medical NPWT system could transform the economics and&#xD;
      increase the availability of this therapy across the world.&#xD;
