    <textblock>
      The study focuses on the development of a new personalized approach to diagnostics and&#xD;
      surgical treatment of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The algorithm for selection of&#xD;
      patients for certain type of cardiac surgery will be developed. The models for prediction of&#xD;
      the risks and outcomes of cardiac surgery will be elaborated to reduce the rate of&#xD;
      complications in the early and long-term postoperative period in patients with ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. Imaging modalities, methods for assessement of structural and functional&#xD;
      state of the myocardium, biochemistry testing, immunohistochemical examination, and&#xD;
      myocardial biopsy studies will be used to achieve these goals.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to develop a new personalized approach to diagnostics and surgical&#xD;
      treatment of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the prognostic values of scintigraphic indicators of myocardial perfusion,&#xD;
           contractility, and metabolism in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy in regard to the&#xD;
           development of cardiac remodeling and adverse cardiovascular events in the mid term&#xD;
           after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the prognostic values of parameters of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
           (cMRI) allowing to predict the risks of surgical intervention and chronic heart failure&#xD;
           progression in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze the relationships between the structural and functional state of the&#xD;
           myocardium and the effectiveness of various types of surgery in patients with ischemic&#xD;
           cardiomyopathy. The structural and functional state of the myocardium is assessed by the&#xD;
           instrumental methods including myocardial scintigraphy, cMRI, stress echocardiography,&#xD;
           spiroergometry, and intraoperative fluometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify the myocardial biopsy-based predictors of adverse outcome in patients with&#xD;
           ischemic cardiomyopathy in the early and mid term postoperative period in patients with&#xD;
           ischemic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To study the relationships between tissue and molecular biomarkers, severity of ischemic&#xD;
           cardiomyopathy, and the outcomes in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy in the&#xD;
           postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To introduce new and to optimize existing methods of surgical treatment in patients with&#xD;
           ischemic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To develop an algorithmic model for assessing the risks and predicting outcomes of&#xD;
           surgical intervention in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy in the postoperative&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;

           μg/kg/min and increasing its dose every 3 minutes to 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 μg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Coronarography for assessing the anatomy and condition of the coronary pool using an&#xD;
           angiographic unit (Axiom Artis/Innova 2121-IQ (General Electric, USA)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Contrast-enhanced cMRI to assess the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mass of viable left ventricular myocardium;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  volumes of cardiac cavities;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  diameter of the mitral and tricuspid valve rings with the determination of&#xD;
                regurgitation degree;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the long axis of the ventricle;&#xD;
&#xD;

           radiopharmaceuticals 199 Tl chloride or 99m Tc. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with&#xD;
           Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) and iodine-123-labeled&#xD;
           iodine-123-phenylmethylmethylene diode and metabolic scintigraphy with 123I-FMPDKc.&#xD;
           Stress ventriculography with 99-Tc-pyrophosphate by GKS-301T gamma camera (VNIIMP-VITA,&#xD;

&#xD;
       10. Intraoperative fluometry of coronary grafts during coronary artery bypass grafting using&#xD;
           the Medistim VeriQ System.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Myocardial biopsy: it is planned to take myocardial biopsy samples in patients with&#xD;
           ischemic cardiomyopathy intraoperatively. In case of aneurysmectomy, myocardial biopsy&#xD;
           will be sampled in the middle left ventricular (LV) parts of the anterior, posterior,&#xD;
           lateral walls and the endocardium, the wall of the aneurysm and the portion of the right&#xD;
           atrial appendage, the right atrial appendage in the absence of aneurysmectomy. The&#xD;
           preparation of histological samples will be carried out in a standard way: fixation of&#xD;
           biopts in formalin with further filling in a paraffin medium and staining with&#xD;
           hematoxylin and eosin with determination of morphometric indicators. For histochemical&#xD;
           reactions, biopsy samples freshly frozen in liquid nitrogen will be used. The enzymatic&#xD;
           activity of succinant dehydrogenase (LDH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and&#xD;
           3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (3-HBDH) will be studied using the Lojda tetrazolium&#xD;
           method according to the intensity of staining of the structure using the ImageJ program&#xD;
           (NIH, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Statistical processing of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured collection of patient data will be performed in a database formed on the platform&#xD;
      of the Microsoft Excel 2010 software (Microsoft Corp., USA). Statistical processing of the&#xD;
      results will be carried out using the SPSS 23.0 for Windows software package (IBM Corp.,&#xD;
      Armonk, NY, USA). The normality of the law of distribution of quantitative indicators will be&#xD;
      checked using the Shapiro-Wilks criterion. Normally distributed parameters will be presented&#xD;
      as mean value (M) and standard deviation (StD) in the form M ± StD; not normally distributed&#xD;
      parameters will be presented as median (Me) and the 1st and 3rd interquantile intervals (Q25&#xD;
      - Q75) in the form of Me [Q25; Q75]. Qualitative data will be described by the frequency of&#xD;
      occurrence or its percentage. To find statistical dependences, to determine their strength&#xD;
      and direction, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) (for normally distributed parameters)&#xD;
      and Spearman correlation coefficient (for for not normally distributed parameters and for&#xD;
      qualitative indicators in the ordinal scale) will be calculated. Using logistic regression,&#xD;
      significant predictors will be identified for the values of reverse remodeling in the long&#xD;
      term after surgical treatment. When conducting a multivariate analysis of interconnections,&#xD;
      first, by means of a univariate analysis, the main parameters that influence the studied&#xD;
      value will be identified, then, based on the search for intergroup correlations, the signs&#xD;
      that have a moderate or strong relationship will be eliminated, and multivariate modeling of&#xD;
      the relationships will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival analysis will be performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. All statistics will be&#xD;
      considered significant at p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the work, the methods of statistical analysis can be revised and (or) supplemented.&#xD;
