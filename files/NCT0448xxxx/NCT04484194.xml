  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to modify an existing Seattle Children's Hospital&#xD;
      investigator-developed, patient-centered, electronic health assessment (eHA) called &quot;Check&#xD;
      Yourself&quot; for AYAs with cancer. The investigators will then evaluate the new eHA prototype&#xD;
      for feasibility and acceptability among AYAs with cancer and their oncology providers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unmet needs among Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) with cancer translate to poor physical&#xD;
      and psychosocial outcomes. This is particularly true when it comes to AYA sexual health. Our&#xD;
      team has found that intimate relationships and risky health behaviors are common among AYAs&#xD;
      during their cancer experience, that oncology clinicians rarely ask about these behaviors,&#xD;
      and that AYAs rarely volunteer to share these behaviors. As a result, AYAs with cancer are&#xD;
      deprived of the surveillance, anticipatory guidance, and normative support participants would&#xD;
      have received if participants were well. Currently there is no standard screening process for&#xD;
      risk behaviors and the recommended psychosocial screening for AYAs in the SCH oncology clinic&#xD;
      setting. To address this problem, the investigators propose to adapt a validated AYA-targeted&#xD;
      electronic health assessment (eHA) screening tool for use in oncology clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to modify an existing Seattle Children's Hospital&#xD;
      investigator-developed, patient-centered, electronic health assessment (eHA) for AYAs with&#xD;
      cancer. The investigators will then evaluate the new eHA prototype for feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability among AYAs with cancer and their oncology providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1. To evaluate the modified eHA program prototype for feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      process measures. The investigators will enroll a cohort of N=25 AYAs with cancer and N=10&#xD;
      providers from our institution to &quot;beta-test&quot; the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: There will be applicable and nonapplicable eHA content for AYAs with cancer in&#xD;
      the current electronic health assessment (eHA) tool in addition to content relative to AYAs&#xD;
      with cancer that should be developed and added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: AYAs will report that the modified AYA oncology specific eHA is both useful and&#xD;
      easy to use. Additionally, oncology providers will report that the eHA tool was useful and&#xD;
      positively impacted patient care.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible adolescents and young adults will be 13 to 29 years old, have an oncologic&#xD;
             diagnosis for which they are receiving cancer directed therapy, have an appointment to&#xD;
             see an SCH oncology provider and will be able to understand English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible oncology providers will either be a Physician (Fellow or Attending) or&#xD;
             Advance Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner or Physicians Assistant), have an&#xD;
             appointment to see an adolescent or young adult receiving cancer directed therapy&#xD;
             receiving who is also enrolled on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be excluded from the study if they do not meet age requirements, do&#xD;
             not have an appointment in oncology clinic, lack the means to complete follow-up&#xD;
             interviews (i.e., has neither telephone nor internet access), and/or are not able to&#xD;
             understand English. Our experience in the Seattle region is that, because of English&#xD;
             Language Learning schooling supports, inability to read or understand English is a&#xD;
             barrier for &lt;0.5% of adolescents. Thus, we do not anticipate that language&#xD;
             restrictions will significantly limit the demographic distribution of our&#xD;
             participants.&#xD;
