  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burning mouth syndrome is one of the most common oral mucosal diseases in clinic. It is a&#xD;
      chronic pain syndrome with extensive burning pain of oral mucosa as its main symptoms. There&#xD;
      are no pathological changes in oral mucosa and no characteristic histopathological changes.&#xD;
      Patients often have accompanying symptoms such as depression and xerostomia. Although the&#xD;
      patient does not have obvious oral lesions, the pain symptoms are more serious and the mental&#xD;
      pressure is greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMS, as a complex clinical syndrome associated with multiple factors, mainly occurs in people&#xD;
      aged 27-87, with an average age of 61. BMS is rare among people under 30 years old. BMS is&#xD;
      predominant in women, the ratio of male to female is 1:5 to 1:7, the incidence is 0.7%-15%,&#xD;
      and increases with age. Up to 90% of female patients are in perimenopausal period. Symptoms&#xD;
      occur from 3 years before menopause to 12 years after menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causes of BMS are complex, and the treatment is difficult, easy to relapse and&#xD;
      protracted. Studies have confirmed that the occurrence and development of BMS are directly&#xD;
      related to mental factors. Therefore, psychosocial factors are the most important pathogenic&#xD;
      factors of BMS. If we intervene in these factors, it is hopeful to improve the curative&#xD;
      effect of BMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional psychotherapy methods include drug treatment, psychotherapy, surgical treatment,&#xD;
      traditional Chinese medicine treatment, etc. Drug treatment is mainly based on different&#xD;
      types of mental and psychological diseases, choose different pharmacological effects of&#xD;
      drugs, so as to effectively control the disease. However, these drugs are prone to adverse&#xD;
      reactions such as sleepiness, weight gain, headache, physical weakness, etc. The basic&#xD;
      principle of psychotherapy is to let patients fully expose symptoms, listen to their&#xD;
      complaints patiently, carry out explanatory psychotherapy according to their medical history&#xD;
      or take other psychological training, so as to relieve patients' mental stress and alleviate&#xD;
      symptoms. But this method has a long course of treatment and needs the cooperation of the&#xD;
      patients' family members; the basic principle of surgical treatment is to resect the&#xD;
      corresponding areas of the brain or adopt endoscopy and micro-current to treat them, but the&#xD;
      risks and injuries caused by the operation are greater, and the adverse reactions after the&#xD;
      operation are larger; the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine needs a long course of&#xD;
      treatment, and the treatment of some patients. The effect is not stable enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causes of BMS are complex, there is no objective disease in clinic, and the patients&#xD;
      suffer from abnormal pain, but the treatment methods are not uniform, and the curative effect&#xD;
      is not good, which makes the patients unable to get effective treatment in the early stage of&#xD;
      the disease, and easy to relapse, resulting in the aggravation and development of BMS into&#xD;
      intractable sensory abnormalities, and protracted! Literature reports confirm that the&#xD;
      tri-drug of oryzanol-riboflavin-vitamin E (oryzanol-riboflavin-vitamin E) is a classic&#xD;
      treatment for BMS and has been included in the classic book in China, Pharmacotherapy for&#xD;
      oral mucosal disease . However, its long-term clinical application has found that its&#xD;
      efficacy is unstable, and clinical symptoms after drug withdrawal. The symptoms are prone to&#xD;
      recurrence or even aggravation. Therefore, it is necessary to use the classical program on&#xD;
      the basis of a combination of interventions to promote the efficacy of stable and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past two years, the investigators has treated nearly 100 cases of BMS with head&#xD;
      yuanshi dian therapy, and achieved satisfactory results. It can obviously relieve burning&#xD;
      pain of BMS oral mucosa, promote saliva secretion, improve dry mouth and bitter mouth, and&#xD;
      improve sleep to a certain extent. However, due to the limited number of cases treated, the&#xD;
      classification of BMS is not meticulous enough, and there are still vague areas in the&#xD;
      classification of BMS, which affects the rigorous evaluation of the therapeutic effect of&#xD;
      BMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose a hypothesis: can the head yuanshi dian therapy be used&#xD;
      as the main adjuvant therapy for BMS? By consulting Pubmed, OVID, CNKI, Wanfang and other&#xD;
      major databases at home and abroad, the investigators found that there is no relevant report&#xD;
      at home and abroad. In view of this, the investigators intend to design this randomized&#xD;
      positive controlled clinical trial, using conventional valley-nucleus-E triple drug therapy&#xD;
      as the positive control group, to observe the efficacy and safety of head yuanshi dian&#xD;
      therapy for BMS, in order to find a safe and effective green non-invasive therapy,&#xD;
      effectively alleviate or eliminate oral mucosal pain, dry mouth, etc.&#xD;

      2.1 Test Target&#xD;
&#xD;
      To observe the efficacy and safety of head yuanshi dian therapy in the treatment of BMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Case Collection 2.2.1 Diagnostic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Burning-like neuropathic pain occurs in the tongue or other parts of oral mucosa, which&#xD;
           may be relieved or disappeared when attention is transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Most of them are accompanied by dry mouth, numbness, taste disorder, depression,&#xD;
           insomnia and other emotional changes, neuropathological changes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Symptom changes may have special regularities and rhythms, such as mild morning symptoms&#xD;
           and worsening afternoon symptoms; pain does not increase when eating or drinking water,&#xD;
           and usually does not affect sleep; or persistent pain; or intermittent throughout the&#xD;
           day;&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.3 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There are local stimulating factors that can cause burning pain in the mouth (including&#xD;
           bad prosthesis, sharp cusp or ridge, complete denture, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with other serious oral mucosal diseases (including bullous diseases, allergic&#xD;
           diseases, oral candidiasis, oral lichen planus, recurrent aphthous ulcer, etc.);&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.4 Standards and procedures for discontinuation of trial/trial therapy When the following&#xD;
      occurs, the trial can be stopped according to the judgement of the researcher, and the&#xD;
      reasons for the discontinuation of the trial can be recorded in the case report form (CRF)&#xD;
      and the original record. If the cause of adverse events leads to the discontinuation of the&#xD;
      test, the relevant treatment should be carried out according to the adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Misacceptance was found after enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Those who received neurological, psychiatric drugs or other interventions during the&#xD;
           trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Those who did not use the test drug according to the doctor's advice or who were treated&#xD;
           by the combination of internal and external heat source and push of the original point&#xD;
           after admission into the group;&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 randomization In this study, multi-center (Zhejiang University Second Hospital, Zhejiang&#xD;
      Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang Hospital of Stomatology, Guizhou, 3&#xD;
      clinical research centers), non-inferior effect, 1:1 randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      were used. Random numbers generated by SPSS21.0 will be placed in sequentially coded, sealed,&#xD;
      opaque envelopes. When the qualifications of the subjects were determined by the researchers,&#xD;
      the envelopes were opened sequentially and the subjects were assigned to groups. The odd&#xD;
      number represented the experimental group and the even number represented the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Measures to Reduce and Avoid Bias In order to reduce and avoid the bias of experimental&#xD;
      conditions, the investigators should strictly group according to the random number of groups,&#xD;
      and adopt the corresponding treatment plan. At the same time, in order to ensure the&#xD;
      objectivity of the study group's evaluation of cases dropped and excluded, it is necessary to&#xD;
      clarify the statistical treatment methods and evaluation criteria for cases dropped and&#xD;
      excluded in the statistical analysis plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Sample size calculation Referring to the previous study of this group, the difference and&#xD;
      standard deviation of the mean between the two groups before treatment and after one month of&#xD;
      treatment were used to calculate the sample size required for this study. Based on the visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS), the non-inferior boundary value was allowed to be 1 and the standard&#xD;
      deviation was 2.3, and 113 persons were needed for each group (90% of the test efficiency and&#xD;
      0.025 of the alpha). Taking into account the possibility of abscission, 290 cases were&#xD;
      finally included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Researcher and patient training The main researcher receives relevant training in head&#xD;
      yuanshi dian therapy, and can master the principle of the therapy and related matters needing&#xD;
      attention, as well as the use of various psychological dosimeters. In addition, the main&#xD;
      researcher trained the patients in this therapy so that they could take care of themselves at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7 Basic information of subjects During the first and second visits, the investigators&#xD;
      recorded the basic information of the subjects in the BMS Case Report Form: case number,&#xD;
      random number, visiting date, name, sex, age, occupation, employment status, education level,&#xD;
      contact mode, nationality, communication address, systemic disease, allergy history,&#xD;
      medication history, and so on. Family history, female subjects recorded menstrual history,&#xD;
      routine physical examination results, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.8 Trial Groups and Treatment Programs 2.8.1 Treatment plan of control group Specific&#xD;
      medicines and usage, course of treatment are as follows: oryzanol + vitamin B2 (riboflavin) +&#xD;
      vitamin E, oryzanol tablets, oral, 10 mg/time, 3 times/day; vitamin B2 tablets, oral, 10&#xD;
      mg/time, 3 times/day; vitamin E pills, oral, 100 mg/time, 1 time/day, 1 months as a course of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.8.2 Therapeutic regimen of experimental group On the basis of classical &quot;Gu-Nucleus-E&quot;&#xD;
      triple drug therapy, the experimental group was treated with head yuanshi dian therapy twice&#xD;
      a day for 1 months as a course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.8.3 Specific operating procedure of head yuanshi dian therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.9 Evaluation Index of Therapeutic Effect After the first visit or passing the push maneuver&#xD;
      retraining, participants will have a visit twice a week. The aim is to observe the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of the treatment. At the end of one week, two weeks, three weeks and one month of&#xD;
      treatment, the researchers recorded the efficacy indicators of the patients. The&#xD;
      immunoglobulin, hemorheology index, blood routine, ESR, CRP, blood lipid routine and changes&#xD;
      were examined at the first diagnosis and at the end of treatment. At the end of the&#xD;
      treatment, the drug was stopped, and the head Yuanshi Dian therapy was suspended in the&#xD;
      experimental group. The patients were followed up one month after the treatment and three or&#xD;
      six months after the treatment by telephone to observe the recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.10 Blind Assessment Each of the three centers has a researcher responsible for the&#xD;
      treatment and interpretation of the subjects. The head of the research center trained the&#xD;
      researcher to unify the standards. Three researchers were not involved in the evaluation of&#xD;
      efficacy. Another researcher was responsible for recording pain and emotional nature and&#xD;
      degree score, pain index, pain multi-dimensional characteristics score, depression index,&#xD;
      Pittsburgh sleep quality index, Kupperman menopause score, dry mouth subjective symptoms&#xD;
      questionnaire, saliva flow, and recording laboratory results, and collecting records. Data,&#xD;
      analysis of efficacy, the researchers do not know the specific grouping, in order to minimize&#xD;
      the subjective impact of the researchers on the test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.11 Safety Evaluation Index 2.11.1 Laboratory Indicators Two groups of subjects were&#xD;
      required to provide the following examination reports within 12 months: blood routine, blood&#xD;
      sugar, liver and kidney function, urine routine, abdominal ultrasonography, chest X-ray, sex&#xD;
      hormone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.11.2 Indicators of vital signs Including blood pressure and pulse. 2.11.3 Adverse reactions&#xD;
      The subjects in the experimental group can inform the researchers of any discomfort and have&#xD;
      the right to withdraw from the trial at any time when they are given the head yuanshi dian&#xD;
      therapy. When the subjects in the control group were re-visited, the researchers asked if&#xD;
      there were any adverse reactions during the medication process. If so, they should record in&#xD;
      detail, including the number of adverse reactions (incidence), specific reactions,&#xD;
      elimination and so on.&#xD;
