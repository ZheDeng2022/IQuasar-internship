    <textblock>
      RESONANCE-II trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase III study&#xD;
      which will enroll 524 patients in total. Patients with eligibility will be registered,&#xD;
      pre-enrolled and receive three cycles of SOX. Then, tumor response evaluation will be carried&#xD;
      out. Those who achieve stable disease or progressive disease will be excluded. Patients&#xD;
      achieving complete response or partial response will be enrolled and assigned into either&#xD;
      group A for another three cycles of SOX (six cycles in total) followed by D2 surgery and&#xD;
      group B for D2 surgery (three cycles in total). The primary endpoint is the rate of&#xD;
      pathological complete response and the secondary endpoints are R0 resection rate, three-year&#xD;
      disease-free survival, five-year overall survival and safety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      RESONANCE-II trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase III study&#xD;
      which was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different cycles of SOX as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. All patients with&#xD;
      eligibility will be registered, pre-enrolled and receive three cycles of SOX. Then, tumor&#xD;
      response evaluation will be carried out according to the Response Evaluation Criteria for&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Those who achieve stable disease (SD) or progressive disease&#xD;
      (PD)will be excluded. Patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) will&#xD;
      be enrolled and assigned into either group A (six cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with&#xD;
      SOX) for another three cycles of SOX followed by D2 surgery and group B (three cycles of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy with SOX) for D2 surgery. The primary endpoint is the rate of&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR%) and the secondary endpoints are R0 resection rate,&#xD;
      three-year disease-free survival (3-y DFS), five-year overall survival (5-y OS) and safety.&#xD;

    <description>The preoperative SOX chemotherapy consists of three-week cycles of intravenously administered oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on day 1 and orally administered S-1 40-60 mg twice a day (BID) on day 1 to 14.

    <intervention_name>Gastrectomy</intervention_name>
    <description>Surgery is planned 3-4 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy. A standard D2 radical laparoscopic gastrectomy is recommended. The extent of gastric resection and lymphadenectomy were performed as per the treatment guidelines. Reconstruction after gastrectomy was decided by the surgeon. All operations are performed by well trained and experienced surgical team to guarantee the quality of surgery, including harvesting more than 16 lymph nodes.</description>

Patients with any patterns of distant metastases, suggestive of distant metastasis (M1), will be excluded from the trial.</description>
