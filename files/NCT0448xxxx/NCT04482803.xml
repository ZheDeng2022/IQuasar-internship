  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the feasibility of target biopsy of carbon nanoparticles labelled lymph node after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant systemic therapy for cN+ breast cancer, and evaluate whether it can accurately&#xD;
      predict axillary lymph node status after neoadjuvant systemic therapy.&#xD;

      Locally advanced breast cancer patients with clinical assessed positive axillary lymph node&#xD;
      (cN+) who receive neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) will be enrolled in this study. Before&#xD;
      NST, one of the suspected lymph nodes will be subjected to ultrasound-guided core needle&#xD;
      biopsy (CNB) or fine needle aspiration (FNA), and a locating clip will be placed. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      a small amount of Kanarine (Carbon Nanoparticles Suspension Injection) will be injected into&#xD;
      or around the cortex of the locating lymph node as well as other positive lymph nodes. All&#xD;
      patients will be confirmed to have axillary lymph node metastasis by pathologic or cytologic&#xD;
      examination. After NST, FNA will be performed again for the lymph nodes labelled with&#xD;
      previous locating clip. During the operation, the clip labelled lymph nodes were identified&#xD;
      with carbon and sent to pathology separately. Meanwhile, the remaining carbon labelled lymph&#xD;
      nodes were also separately examined. Axillary lymph node dissection will be performed in all&#xD;
      patients. The detection rate of labelled lymph node will be record, and the pathological&#xD;
      results of re-FNA of labelled lymph nodes will be compared with postoperative pathological&#xD;
      results. Meanwhile, we will also analysis whether carbon labelled lymph node biopsy could&#xD;
      predict the overall status of axillary lymph nodes after NST.&#xD;
