  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prescription opioids contribute to opioid related deaths, overdose and addiction. Unused&#xD;
      prescribed opioids are not routinely being stored or disposed of appropriately and their&#xD;
      availability is associated with harms. Maximum daily doses prescribed are higher than that&#xD;
      recommended in a significant number of patients. This study is designed to help have&#xD;
      appropriate doses and quantities of opioids dispensed for the treatment of short-term pain.&#xD;
      Rather than targeting prescribing, this study targets the dispensing process by training&#xD;
      community pharmacists to assess the appropriateness and safety of opioid prescriptions for&#xD;
      short-term pain and to work with patients to partially fill prescriptions if the quantities&#xD;
      prescribed are deemed excessive. Patient education tools were developed to help promote&#xD;
      understanding of opioid safety, including the use of appropriate quantities, safe storage and&#xD;
      safe disposal. Pharmacists in five randomly selected regions in Ontario, Canada are targeted&#xD;
      for the eLearning intervention. The primary study outcome is the quantities dispensed for&#xD;
      initial opioid prescriptions for short-term pain in the intervention regions compared to ten&#xD;
      control regions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed intervention is designed to implement and evaluate a pharmacist-led intervention&#xD;
      to promote dispensing appropriate doses and quantities of opioids for acute pain at the&#xD;
      initial prescription stage. This would include patients discharged from hospital&#xD;
      post-surgery, following emergency room visits, after dental procedures, and patients visiting&#xD;
      primary care prescribers. Thus it will capture a wide spectrum of prescribing. This study&#xD;
      focuses on incorporating into routine pharmacy practice the assessment and adjustment of&#xD;
      opioid doses and quantities for the treatment of acute pain to appropriate levels.&#xD;
      Pharmacists in Ontario are able to reduce the quantities of prescriptions with the agreement&#xD;
      of the patient. The remainder of the prescription quantity can remain active to be filled&#xD;
      subsequently if needed. By implementing the option of part-fills for prescriptions with&#xD;
      higher quantities, this intervention does allow patients to access more analgesia if their&#xD;
      pain management requires it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop, test, optimize and implement an intervention in 5 randomly selected regions&#xD;
           in Ontario to promote pharmacist-led practices to limit initial quantities of opioid&#xD;
           prescriptions to appropriate levels for the treatment of acute pain. The intervention&#xD;
           components include a pharmacist a training program, patient engagement tools and&#xD;
           prescriber engagement communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure pharmacist uptake of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare initial prescription opioid quantities and daily doses in the intervention&#xD;
           regions to 10 matched control regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating a 6-month pharmacy&#xD;
      practice intervention to limit initial doses and quantities of opioid prescriptions to&#xD;
      appropriate levels for the treatment of acute pain. The intervention components include a&#xD;
      pharmacist a training program, patient engagement tools and prescriber engagement&#xD;
      communication. The development of the intervention was informed by the systematic approach&#xD;
      described by French and colleagues (2012) for behaviour change interventions implementing&#xD;
      evidence into practice. The 5 eLearning modules (15-20 minutes each) and the patient&#xD;
      communication tools (patient handout and pharmacy poster) have undergone usability testing&#xD;
      using a human factors research approach prior to finalization. The intervention will be&#xD;
      implemented in 5 public health unit regions in Ontario randomly selected along with 10&#xD;
      matched (1:2) control public health unit regions. All community pharmacists in the&#xD;
      intervention regions will be invited to undertake the eLearning program to promote the&#xD;
      specific practice change related to opioid quantities. The primary outcome measure will be&#xD;
      the quantities of opioids dispensed to patients receiving initial prescriptions for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute pain. Analyses will be at the cluster level in which quantities dispensed&#xD;
      will be compared both between intervention and control public health unit regions after 6&#xD;
      months, and before and after implementation within intervention sites.&#xD;
