  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restylane® Skinboosters™ Vital (SBV) is a smooth formulation without particles, which helps&#xD;
      it distribute evenly and smoothly under the skin to aid in rejuvenation. This feature makes&#xD;
      RSV particularly well suited for more superficial injections, such as at the level of the&#xD;
      dermis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBV smooths fine lines and wrinkles and is intended to improve skin smoothness and&#xD;
      appearance, as well as the elasticity and hydration of the skin in the face and dorsal hands.&#xD;
      However, many clinicians have used SBV in other regions of the body. Given these attributes,&#xD;
      SBV are particularly well suited for photo aged skin. A region that is susceptible to&#xD;
      photo-ageing and may therefore benefit from the use of SBV is the décolletage. Photodamaged&#xD;
      skin of the chest is characterized by atrophy, skin laxity, fine lines and wrinkles,&#xD;
      dehydration and tactile roughness. Therefore, SBV may help to improve these signs of aging in&#xD;
      the décolletage region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim: To investigate the effectiveness and tolerability of SBV for rejuvenation of the&#xD;
      décolletage region.&#xD;
