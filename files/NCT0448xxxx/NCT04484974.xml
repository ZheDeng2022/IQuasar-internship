  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a within-subjects crossover study that examines subjective appetite, food intake,&#xD;
      hormone and metabolic responses to consumption of mid morning snacks of pecan nuts as&#xD;
      compared to an iso-caloric amount of pretzels. Pecans are high in fat and calories and low in&#xD;
      carbohydrate by weight, while pretzels are mostly carbohydrate and essentially devoid of fat.&#xD;
      These two very different nutrient profiles should elicit different metabolic and biomarker&#xD;
      responses. The study aims to determine whether these treatments also elicit different&#xD;
      subjective appetite and food intake responses. Participants will be healthy volunteers with&#xD;
      overweight and obesity, a population that may be seeking healthy snacking options that are&#xD;
      satisfying and satiating.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, two condition, crossover study in healthy individuals with overweight&#xD;
      and obesity examining the effect of a mid-morning snack of pecans vs. a low fat savory snack&#xD;
      on appetite, energy expenditure, blood biomarkers of appetite and metabolism and ad libitum&#xD;
      food intake at lunch. Twenty-four participants will be enrolled and studied on two test days&#xD;
      with at least one week washout in between. On test days, participants will have baseline&#xD;
      measures of appetite (by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)), blood hormones and substrates, and&#xD;
      energy expenditure and fuel oxidation (Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR), by indirect calorimetry)&#xD;
      taken just prior to consuming a standardized 300 kcal breakfast. VAS measures will be taken&#xD;
      at 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min following the meal and RMR will be measured for 20 min after&#xD;
      eating. A mid-morning snack of either 300 kcal of pecans or unsalted pretzels will be&#xD;
      consumed and VAS and blood measures will be taken at 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min following the&#xD;
      snack and RMR will be measured for 20 min after eating. Participants will be given an ad&#xD;
      libitum lunch meal and VAS and blood measures will be taken at 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min&#xD;
      following the lunch and RMR will be measured for 20 min after eating. Blood will be analyzed&#xD;
      for glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, triglycerides, ghrelin, leptin, PYY, and GLP-1. Two&#xD;
      hypotheses will be examined: 1. pecans will provoke greater feelings of fullness and reduced&#xD;
      hunger after the snack and lunch meal consumption (on either a calorie per calorie or volume&#xD;
      basis) as compared to the pretzel snack, and 2. the pecan snack will provoke greater&#xD;
      responses of satiety hormones compared to pretzels. Post-snack and lunch energy expenditure&#xD;
      and fat oxidation will also be compared between treatments as an exploratory aim.&#xD;
