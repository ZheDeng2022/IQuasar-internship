    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous&#xD;
      dose of Human Umbilical Cord Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hCT-MSC) in adults&#xD;
      with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). hCT-MSC is a cell product isolated from umbilical cord&#xD;
      tissue. The cells from the cord tissue are processed and expanded in the laboratory and then&#xD;
      infused intravenously in a single dose per participant. Participants will be ages 18-35&#xD;
      years, with ASD and a full-scale IQ &gt;70 without an identified genetic cause of autism.&#xD;
      Participants will have remote follow up visits at 3 and 12 months and an in-person visit at 6&#xD;
      months. In addition to the primary endpoints evaluating safety, the study will include&#xD;
      secondary and exploratory endpoints evaluating Autism Spectrum Disorder specific outcome&#xD;
      measures to describe any changes in autism symptoms after hCT-MSC administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, phase one study to determine the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of a single intravenous dose of Human Umbilical Cord Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells&#xD;
      (hCT-MSC) in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). hCT-MSCs are manufactured from&#xD;
      umbilical cord tissue donated by healthy mothers delivering full term babies via Cesarean&#xD;
      Section. The cells are extracted from the cord tissue, expanded and cryopreserved (frozen).&#xD;
      One dose of 2x10^6 cells/kg (maximum of 10 x 10^7) will be administered intravenously to each&#xD;
      participant in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that immune dysregulation and/or abnormal neuronal connectivity that&#xD;
      adversely affects normal brain development may cause core symptomatology observed in&#xD;
      individuals with ASD. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have demonstrated a multitude of&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effects which are thought to be carried out via paracrine and trophic&#xD;
      signaling. While MSCs modulate the immune response, MSCs themselves have low immunogenicity&#xD;
      (the body does not have a strong immune reaction against them) and they do not permanently&#xD;
      engraft in the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 to 35 years with ASD will be eligible to participate. All participants will&#xD;
      have a screening visit that includes clinical evaluation to verify the diagnosis of ASD,&#xD;
      cognitive abilities, ASD symptom level, and confirmation of eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One dose of 2x10^6 cells/kg (maximum of 10 x 10^7) will be administered intravenously to each&#xD;
      participant at a baseline visit. Participants will be admitted to the infusion center on the&#xD;
      day of their baseline visit and vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature,&#xD;
      respiratory rate) will be measured. Participants may require some sedation prior to IV&#xD;
      placement if they are unable to remain still or cooperate. A peripheral IV will be placed and&#xD;
      prior to the infusion, premedications (Benadryl, Solumedrol, 0.5mg/kg each) will be&#xD;
      administered. The hCT-MSCs product will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes.&#xD;
      Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and IV fluid&#xD;
      maintenance will be given. Participants will be discharged after 1 hour, providing all vital&#xD;
      signs are at their baseline and they are asymptomatic with no evidence of toxicity.&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated the day after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related&#xD;
      adverse reactions or complications. A phone call or email to the participant or legally&#xD;
      authorized representative to assess safety of the infusion will occur 7-10 days after the&#xD;
      infusion. Remote follow up will occur 3 months and one year after infusion. Participants will&#xD;
      return to Duke six months after infusion for repeated testing and safety follow-up. The&#xD;
      Medical and Behavioral History Questionnaire assessing adverse events will be obtained at&#xD;
      baseline, 3, 6 and 12-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main endpoint is safety, for which acute infusion reactions, incidence of infections, and&#xD;
      markers of alloimmunization will be assessed. Key secondary endpoints will include&#xD;
      ASD-specific outcome measures to describe any changes in autism symptoms after product&#xD;
      administration. Exploratory analyses will include measures obtained by EEG, eye-tracking,&#xD;
      pupillary light reflex, computer vision analysis, and tactile stimulation.&#xD;
