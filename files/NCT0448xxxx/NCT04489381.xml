        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female outpatients at least 12 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;

             due to Enterovirus/Rhinovirus infection (one of the following is required):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Presence of at least two respiratory symptom domains (head, throat, nose, chest,&#xD;
                  cough) with a score of ≥2 as determined by Screening FLU-PRO OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Presence of at least one respiratory symptom domain (head, throat, nose, chest,&#xD;
                  cough) with a score of ≥2 as determined by Screening FLU-PRO with pulse rate ≥90&#xD;
                  OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Presence of at least one respiratory symptom domain (head, throat, nose, chest,&#xD;
                  cough) with a score of ≥2 as determined by Screening FLU-PRO with respiratory&#xD;
                  rate ≥16&#xD;
&#xD;
        AND patient reported assessment that symptoms are present, the symptoms are not consistent&#xD;
        with the subject's usual health, the symptoms interfere with daily activities, and the&#xD;
        symptoms have worsened or remained the same relative to the previous day, as confirmed by&#xD;
        responses to questions in the Screening FLU-PRO.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Onset of symptoms no more than 72 hours before enrollment in the trial. Onset of&#xD;
             symptoms is defined as the earlier of the first time at which the subject experienced&#xD;
             subjective fever or any respiratory symptom (head, throat, nose, chest, or cough&#xD;
             symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent (including assent by legal&#xD;
             guardian if under 18 years of age) and comply with the requirements of the protocol,&#xD;
             including completion of the subject diary and all protocol procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who experienced a previous episode of acute upper respiratory tract&#xD;
             infection, otitis, bronchitis or sinusitis or received antibiotics for these&#xD;
             conditions within two weeks prior to and including study day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severely immunodeficient persons including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Subjects with immunologic disorders or receiving immunosuppressive therapy (e.g.,&#xD;
                  for organ or bone marrow transplants, immunomodulatory therapies for certain&#xD;
                  autoimmune diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subjects with untreated human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) infection or treated&#xD;
                  human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) infection with a CD4 count below 350&#xD;
                  cells/mm3 in the last six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subjects actively undergoing systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment for&#xD;
                  malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subjects using steroids as maintenance therapy for a chronic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with active respiratory allergies or subjects expected to require anti-&#xD;
             allergy medications during the study period for respiratory allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential who are either pregnant or sexually active without&#xD;
             the use of birth control. Female subjects of child-bearing potential that are sexually&#xD;
             active must have a negative baseline pregnancy test and must agree to continue an&#xD;
             acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the study and for 1 month&#xD;
             post-treatment. A double barrier method, oral birth control pills administered for at&#xD;
             least 2 monthly cycles prior to study drug administration, an Intrauterine Device&#xD;
             (IUD), or medroxyprogesterone acetate administered intramuscularly for a minimum of&#xD;
             one month prior to study drug administration are acceptable methods of birth control&#xD;
             for inclusion into the study. Female subjects are considered of childbearing potential&#xD;
             unless they are postmenopausal (absence of menstrual bleeding for 1 year - or 6 months&#xD;
             if laboratory confirmation of hormonal status), or have had a hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             tubular ligation or bilateral oophorectomy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known sensitivity to nitazoxanide (NTZ) or any of the excipients comprising the study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unable to swallow oral tablets or capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known severe heart, lung, neurological or other systemic disease that&#xD;
             the Investigator believes could preclude safe participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects likely or expected to require hospitalization unrelated to cold during the&#xD;
             study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who, in the judgment of the Investigator, will be unlikely to comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of this protocol including completion of the subject diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects taking medications considered to be major CYP2C8 substrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons with any clinical sign or symptoms suggestive of severe systemic illness with&#xD;
             COVID-19, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. shortness of breath at rest,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. resting pulse ≥125 beats per minute,&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. resting respiratory rate ≥ breaths per minute, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. SpO2 ≤ 93% on room air at sea level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects known to have a diagnostic test positive for SARS-CoV-2 or influenza&#xD;
             infection within the preceding three weeks.&#xD;
