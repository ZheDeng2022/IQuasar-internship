    <textblock>
      Patients with active rheumatic arthritis (RA) and lack of efficacy of at least one csDMARD&#xD;
      (Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug) treatment will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      Tofacitinib (TOFA) or etanercept (ETA). The study will be separated into two parts: The&#xD;
      capability to decrease and discontinue pain-reducing treatment with a NSAID (non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug) over the first 12 weeks of treatment will be measured for primary&#xD;
      outcome measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) at week 12 compared to baseline between&#xD;
      the two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting at week 12, the capability to taper corticosteroid (CS) treatment using a&#xD;
      treat-to-target strategy, i.e. when at least low disease activity (LDA-DAS28) is achieved,&#xD;
      will be measured in both groups.&#xD;

      In this clinical study, a design was chosen to reflect European standards recommended by&#xD;
      EULAR for treatment of active RA by comparison of a Treat-to- target (T2T) approach in two&#xD;
      treatment groups: Patients with active RA and lack of efficacy of at least one csDMARD&#xD;
      treatment will be randomized to receive either TOFA or ETA. The study will be separated into&#xD;
      two parts: The capability to decrease and discontinue pain-reducing treatment with a NSAID&#xD;
      (Celecoxib, two times 200 mg as maximum standard dosage for RA) over the first 12 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment will be measured for primary outcome. The proportion of patients with successful&#xD;
      discontinuation of Celecoxib and significant and clinical relevant decrease of pain-levels&#xD;
      measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) with a reduction of at least 30% at week 12&#xD;
      compared to baseline will be compared between the two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting at week 12, the capability to taper CS treatment using a treat-to-target strategy,&#xD;
      i.e. when at least low disease activity (LDA-DAS28) is achieved, will be measured in both&#xD;
      groups. In addition to efficacy assessments (DAS28, ACR-response, SJC, TJC), patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes, Quality of Life (QoL) measurements and patient satisfaction will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Safety (severity and frequency of adverse events) will be evaluated over the 24-week&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of Life: SF36 scores.SF36 is a 36 items short form health survey and consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
