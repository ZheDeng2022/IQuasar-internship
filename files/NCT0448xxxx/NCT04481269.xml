      This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-arm, non-inferiority study that&#xD;
      will be carried out in China. It aims to compare two implant systems (the research group uses&#xD;
      surface-modified composite coated orthopedic implants, and controls group using conventional&#xD;
      orthopedic implants) safety and effectiveness. A total of 240 patients were recruited. The&#xD;
      recruited patients are randomly divided into groups at a ratio of 1:1 to ensure that the&#xD;
      distribution of patients in the treatment group and the control group is consistent. Patients&#xD;
      will receive clinical follow-up in the 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months postoperatively. The main&#xD;
      indicator for evaluation is the postoperative infection rate, and the secondary indicators&#xD;
      include the SF-12 scoring scale, EQ-5D patient questionnaire score, fracture healing,&#xD;
      malunion, nonunion incidence in the 12th month after surgery, and skin and soft tissue&#xD;
      complications Symptom incidence rate. The follow-up data will be used to determine the main&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of the new surface modified composite coated orthopedic implant&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
