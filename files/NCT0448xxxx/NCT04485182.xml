      Underwater massage is the more modern variety of massages otherwise known as tangentor, where&#xD;
      the temperature of the water of the treatment tub and the mechanical effect of the water jet&#xD;
      is utilised. It is typical of chronic low back pain that, after the first painful episode, is&#xD;
      repeated at 44-78% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goals are the followings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the beneficial effect of a Underwater massage therapy addition to a complex&#xD;
           physiotherapy comparable to a control group with respect to clinical parameters?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How much does the quality of life change in an initial state and how much is it in&#xD;
           comparison with the control group?&#xD;

      Informed consent was obtained from all participants. We use two groups to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of the tangentor on the low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients presenting at the rheumatology inpatient clinics were enrolled without into the&#xD;
      treatment and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation + underwater massage + spine&#xD;
      gymnastics&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the controll group the Patients receiving Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation +&#xD;
      spine gymnastics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Underwater jet massage (Tangentor) would be performed in a tub developed for this purpose,&#xD;
      where the water temperature: 33-35 ° C. The treatments lasting from 15 atm and 15 cm for 15&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The water temperature is precisely measured by a built-in thermometer. Pressure is controlled&#xD;
      by a manometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They take a minimum of 10 treatments for approx. under 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The back massage position is, that the patient lying on their side, hip and knees are&#xD;
      slightly bent and the head and neck rest on a support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the massage the client should rest for about 30minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participated in two visits, for the first time before the study, right after the&#xD;
      therapy treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, all participants received the usual or necessary medications. On a Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS) patients indicated degree of pain on a scale from 0 to 100 mm for the&#xD;
      past week. VAS scores were expressed in millimetres (zero point-no pain; endpoint-intolerable&#xD;
      pain). Patients recorded on the VAS scale the level of low back pain at rest as well as&#xD;
      during activity. Functional disability was assessed by using the Oswestry Disability Index&#xD;
      (ODI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there was a questionnaire on the quality of life, known as the EuroQol Five&#xD;
      Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).&#xD;
