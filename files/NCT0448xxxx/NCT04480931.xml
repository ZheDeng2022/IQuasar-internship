  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot project is to test the feasibility and potential efficacy of the&#xD;
      evidence-based mHealth app (BumptUp) for improving physical activity and subsequent health&#xD;
      outcomes (i.e. obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance) among pregnant and postpartum women&#xD;
      in a rural community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to accomplish this goal, feasibility of the intervention protocol will be tested by&#xD;
      the assessment of recruitment (how many participants eligible per month), retention (% of&#xD;
      women who complete the study protocol), adherence to intervention (% of women who utilize the&#xD;
      app), and acceptability (survey and one-on-one exit interviews) during pregnancy and&#xD;
      postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential efficacy will be determined by examining trends in data on physical activity levels&#xD;
      (achieving the goal of 150 minutes per week of physical activity (surveys and accelerometry))&#xD;
      between groups. Other secondary outcomes will also be assessed: weight status, body&#xD;
      composition, blood pressure, insulin resistance, fitness levels, mental health, and infant&#xD;
      anthropometrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The mHealth program will be feasible as evidenced by high rates of enrollment,&#xD;
           retention, and adherence, moderate-to-high levels of satisfaction, and low participant&#xD;
           burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The mHealth intervention will show promise towards improving physical activity levels&#xD;
           and other secondary outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women in a rural community.&#xD;

      After contact is established and eligibility confirmed, Participants (N=40) will be enrolled&#xD;
      and baseline surveys will be conducted to collect information about lifestyle, mental health,&#xD;
      and anxiety levels. Patient data for those participants who have agreed to be in the study&#xD;
      and have specifically agreed on the consent form to allow the study team to pull data from&#xD;
      their prenatal charts. The data being pulled from charts will include patient weights, vital&#xD;
      signs, blood pressures, current complications, blood analytes, and glucose tolerance test&#xD;
      results from each prenatal visit. After the baby is born, delivery reports will also be&#xD;
      obtained in order to collect information on the delivery outcomes (gender, mode of delivery,&#xD;
      complications, time in labor) and baby's anthropometric data (birthweight, birth length, head&#xD;
      circumference).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation will be in the form of Amazon gift cards (delivered electronically). There will&#xD;
      be 4 time points where they take the online assessments. At each time point, they will also&#xD;
      be mailed an Actigraph accelerometer to wear for one week. These will be sanitized and mailed&#xD;
      or dropped off to avoid any contamination from the study team to participants. When the week&#xD;
      is over, the study team will check in with participants and discuss a plan for pick up. They&#xD;
      can leave outside for a study team member to pick up (contactless ) or they can mail it back&#xD;
      (with provided return envelope).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will still receive a total of $160. They be recruited and consented online&#xD;
      around 18-20 weeks. Assessments will occur at 4 timepoints: baseline assessments at 23-25&#xD;
      weeks gestation ($40), phone check at 30 weeks, second assessment/set of surveys at 35-37&#xD;
      weeks ($40), delivery outcomes obtained, 6 week postpartum surveys ($40), and 12 week&#xD;
      postpartum surveys ($40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Determination: Sample size for this pilot study was determined based on&#xD;
      previously performed physical activity interventions among pregnant women. The effect size&#xD;
      (0.91) for the main outcome of physical activity was determined from looking at&#xD;
      post-intervention physical activity data from Asci et al.83. With this effect size, it was&#xD;
      determined using SAS software with a type I error rate of 0.05 that a sample size of 20 per&#xD;
      group could detect this difference with 80% power, thus our sample size of 15 per group is&#xD;
      justified for a pilot project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To estimate the success and feasibility of recruitment methods, the number of people&#xD;
      who will hear about the study via various methods (e.g. health care providers, health fairs,&#xD;
      word-of-mouth) will be estimated. Then, the number of women who completed initial screening,&#xD;
      the number of women who meet the eligibility criteria, the number of women who complete each&#xD;
      of the assessments, the number of women randomized, and the number of women who adhere to the&#xD;
      intervention will be determined. The exit interview data will be analyzed via standard&#xD;
      content analyses for qualitative studies as previously described84 (and recently performed by&#xD;
      our group). Aim 2: Although the investigators may not detect all between group differences&#xD;
      because the investigators are proposing a pilot project, appropriate statistical tests will&#xD;
      be performed in order to examine trends, and thus, promise for effect in the larger future&#xD;
      trial. Normality of the distribution for each variable will be tested using&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and non-normally distributed data will be transformed as needed.&#xD;
      The baseline characteristics of the two groups will be compared using t-tests or Chi square&#xD;
      tests. The potential effect of the intervention on study outcomes will be explored using&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVAs (group x time). Specifically, physical activity data between groups&#xD;
      will be compared from pre-post intervention. All data will be entered in Redcap data&#xD;
      management system. Analyses will be conducted using SAS or other statistical software.&#xD;
