  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      POD has been reported to be associated with a large number of risk factors: age as POD occurs&#xD;
      in 10% to 61% of those aged 65 or older, dementia, impaired left ventricular function,&#xD;
      electrolyte disorder, alcoholism, smoking, high perioperative transfusion requirements,&#xD;
      intraoperative pressure fluctuation, and use of benzodiazepine POD occurs mostly in some&#xD;
      types of surgery, such as orthopedic surgeries, major gastrointestinal surgery, and major&#xD;
      cardiovascular surgeries, surgery under general anesthesia, prolonged surgery, emergency&#xD;
      surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies done before to prove the efficacy of melatonin to decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium in patients with multiple risk factors for POD as traumatic geriatric&#xD;
      patients were concerned only with the type of surgery as hip replacement or with spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia but no study was done before to assess the prophylactic effect of melatonin to&#xD;
      decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in geriatric patients under general&#xD;
      anesthesia ,which represents an independent risk factor for POD. So,this double blinded RCT&#xD;
      will try to fill this gap in literature.&#xD;

      anesthesia ,which represents an independent risk factor for POD. So,this double blinded RCT&#xD;
      will try to fill this gap in literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prove the efficacy of melatonin to decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium after&#xD;
      surgeries under general anesthesia in geriatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology After approval of the Research Ethics Committee and written informed consent from&#xD;
      all patients, A randomized, prospective, controlled, double blind study of the prophylactic&#xD;
      effect of melatonin on postoperative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing surgeries&#xD;
      under general anesthesia will be conducted on 100 patients allocated into 2 equal groups. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted at Cairo University Hospitals, in all surgical units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Patients who meet all the inclusion criteria will be randomized to either&#xD;
      Group M (Melatonin group) or Group C (Control group) by using computer generated random&#xD;
      numbers with closed sealed envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will fast according to standard rules and will be assessed by an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist at the night before the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be screened at that time by Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) ,where patients&#xD;
      having scores &lt; 6 will be considered to have postoperative delirium.This test has been&#xD;
      recommended for routine assessment of cognitive function in the elderly by the Royal College&#xD;
      of Physicians and the British Geriatric Society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnare (score) Each scores one point&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time (to nearest hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Address for recall at end of test (Ask patient to repeat the address to ensure it has&#xD;
           been heard correctly)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Year&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Name of hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Recognition of two persons (e.g. doctor, nurse)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Date of birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Year of any famous event e.g: the last Egyptian revolution&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Name of the present monarch&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Count backwards from 20 to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group M (Melatonin group): will receive 5 mg melatonin orally at 9 p.m. the night before&#xD;
      surgery and another 5 mg melatonin with 15 ml of plain water 30 min before operation and 5 mg&#xD;
      melatonin at 9 p.m. in the day of operation and for the first three postoperative days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C (Control group): received a placebo in the form of one tablet of 500 mg paracetamol&#xD;
      that packaged the same way as melatonin at the same times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesia residents who will administer the drug and assess Abbreviated Mental Test(AMT)&#xD;
      score postoperatively will be blinded to the allocation regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival to the preparation room, wide bore IV cannula will be inserted in the nondominant&#xD;
      hand, sedation will be assessed by Ramsay sedation scale,with grades from 1 to 6&#xD;
      where:1-Patient awake, anxious, agitated, or restless ,2- Patient awake, cooperative,&#xD;
      orientated, and tranquil ,3- Patient drowsy, with response to commands ,4- Patient asleep,&#xD;
      brisk response to glabella tap or loud auditory stimulus ,5- Patient asleep, sluggish&#xD;
      response to stimulus ,6- Patient has no response to firm nail-bed pressure or other noxious&#xD;
      stimuli. patients with score &gt; 4 will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Patients will be monitored with five lead ECG, noninvasive blood pressure, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, capnography and baseline HR,SBP,DBP,MAP,oxygen saturation,ETCO2 , and urine&#xD;
      output will be recorded then every 10 minutes until 30 minutes postextubation. Induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia will be done with fentanyl (2 mic/kg), propofol (1-2 mg/kg), atracurium (0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg). Intubation will be done with oral cuffed endotracheal tube size 6.5-7 mm ID for&#xD;
      females and 7.5-8 mm ID for males and then a urinary catheter will be inserted. Anesthesia&#xD;
      will be maintained with isoflurane (0.75- 1.15%), incremental doses of atracurium every 20&#xD;
      minutes and 1 mic/kg fentanyl IV if HR and/or BP increased 20% or more from baseline in&#xD;
      response to surgical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, patients will be transferred to PACU. Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) scores&#xD;
      will be reported after recovery from anesthesia (PACU AMT) and in the same day 6 hours after&#xD;
      operation (Day-0) and in the following three postoperative days (Day-1, Day-2 and Day-3) at&#xD;
      the same hour of assessment in day 0. Patients having scores &lt; 6 will be considered to have&#xD;
      postoperative delirium, and will be assessed by a psychiatrist for further management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain will be managed by IV 1g paracetamol every 6 hours and 50 mg diclofenac&#xD;
      sodium oral every 12 hours with rescue analgesia of IV nalbuphine with 0.25 mg/kg not&#xD;
      exceeding 0.5 mg/kg every 6 hours when the numerical rating score (NRS) or advanced dementia&#xD;
      scale (PAINAD)(if the patient developed delirium) &gt;4.NRS or PAINAD will be evaluated&#xD;
      according to at times 0-30 minutes 2, 4,8, 12, 18 and 24 hours. The &quot;zero&quot; point of time will&#xD;
      be the moment the patient recovered from general anesthesia&#xD;
