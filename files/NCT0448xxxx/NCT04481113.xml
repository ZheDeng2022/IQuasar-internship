    <textblock>
      This phase I trial tests the side effects and best dose of abemaciclib and niraparib in&#xD;
      treating patients with breast cancer that is positive for estrogen or progesterone receptors&#xD;
      (hormone receptor positive [HR+]) and HER2 negative. Abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking certain proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases, which are needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as&#xD;
      niraparib, can keep PARP from working so tumor cells can't repair themselves and grow. Giving&#xD;
      abemaciclib and niraparib together before surgery may make the tumor smaller.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of the&#xD;
      combination of abemaciclib and niraparib tosylate monohydrate (niraparib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess safety and tolerability of the combination of abemaciclib and niraparib in&#xD;
      early stage HR+ breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine clinical response to treatment. II. To determine pathologic response to&#xD;
      treatment. III. To determine feasibility of combination as determined by no delay to standard&#xD;
      of care breast surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess occurrence of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase 1 dose-escalation study of abemaciclib in combination with niraparib&#xD;
      followed by a dose-expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and niraparib PO once daily (QD).&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2-4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who complete 4 cycles undergo standard of care mastectomy or&#xD;
      lumpectomy. Patients demonstrating progressive disease after only 2 cycles are switched to&#xD;
      receive standard of care chemotherapy prior to undergoing mastectomy or lumpectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed up at 30 days after date of surgery, every 3 months for the first 6&#xD;
      months, every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for up to 5 years from date of surgery.&#xD;
