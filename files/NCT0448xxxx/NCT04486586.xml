  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects first and&#xD;
      foremost language abilities. There are three different variants of PPA, each a relatively&#xD;
      distinct speech and language profile. For individuals with non-fluent variant PPA (nfvPPA), a&#xD;
      core symptom is apraxia of speech (AOS), which is defined as an oral motor speech disorder.&#xD;
      Such a disorder inhibits one's ability to translate speech plans into motor plans and results&#xD;
      in longer segmental durations and reduced rate of syllabic production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project investigates the behavioral and neuromodulatory effects of transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) during language therapy in participants with nfvPPA over&#xD;
      time. Anodal tDCS targeting the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) administered in combination&#xD;
      with language therapy is expected to be more beneficial when compared to language therapy&#xD;
      alone (sham). The investigators believe tDCS during language therapy will 1) improve language&#xD;
      performance or decrease rate of decline, 2) promote better-sustained effects at 2 weeks and 2&#xD;
      months post-treatment, and 3) produce generalization to untrained language items and some&#xD;
      other cognitive functions. Resting-state fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and volumetric&#xD;
      data are also collected to investigate changes in functional brain connectivity associated&#xD;
      with tDCS in individuals with PPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the therapeutic and neuromodulatory mechanisms of tDCS as an&#xD;
      adjunct to language therapy in nfvPPA may have a significant impact on the development of&#xD;
      effective therapies for PPA, and may offer insight into ways of impeding neurodegeneration&#xD;
      that may improve patients' quality of life, as well as extend patients' ability to work and&#xD;
      manage patients' affairs.&#xD;

      A. Evaluation Tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Language Tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be administered baseline language and cognitive tasks, including 1 or more&#xD;
      of the following, depending on participants' residual language and cognitive skills:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) writing to dictation b) oral spelling c) oral and written naming of pictures d)&#xD;
      word-picture matching f) written and oral picture description g) digit span h) spatial span&#xD;
      i) verbal learning j) grammatical sentence production k) oral word repetition l) sentence&#xD;
      comprehension&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be administered standardized and non-standardized quality-of-life&#xD;
      questionnaires before, after, and at follow-up intervals of each experimental period. The&#xD;
      purpose of these questionnaires is to assess whether the proposed interventions have affected&#xD;
      participants' well-being and the general quality of participants' life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. AOS Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention involves oral word repetition of increasingly complex words. The goal is to&#xD;
      improve volitional control of participants' articulators in order to produce co-articulated,&#xD;
      intelligible speech, as well as improve prosody, voice quality, and speech fluency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Assessment of Language Therapy Tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments will probe all sets of increasingly complex words targeted in&#xD;
      intervention and as well as word sets not targeted in intervention to assess near-transfer&#xD;
      generalization. Other language and cognitive tasks will be assessed for far-transfer&#xD;
      generalization. Differences in baseline measures in pre- and post-intervention accuracy for&#xD;
      word production for each patient will be evaluated using the following: percentages of total&#xD;
      number of words correct, arithmetic differences between percentage scores, and permutation&#xD;
      tests (Pearson's chi-square test; Fisher's exact test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. tDCS Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take part in 10-15 consecutive training sessions (3-5 per week), separated&#xD;
      by 2 months. Anodal tDCS has typically been shown to up-regulate neuronal excitability and&#xD;
      produce enhancement of behavioral performance. A Soterix-CT device will be delivering current&#xD;
      at an intensity of 1-2 mA (estimated current density 0.04 mA/cm^2; estimated total charge&#xD;
      0.048 C/cm^2) for a maximum of 20 minutes in the tDCS groups and for a maximum of 30 seconds&#xD;
      in the Sham group. For both interventions (tDCS and Sham) the electrical current will be&#xD;
      increased in a ramp-like fashion at the onset of the stimulation eliciting a transient&#xD;
      tingling sensation on the scalp that usually disappears over seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Imaging Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging will be performed at the beginning of enrollment, before and after each 12-to-15-day&#xD;
      tDCS treatment, and at follow-up intervals for up to 8 time points per individual on a 3T&#xD;
      Philips system, and will consist of resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), MPRAGE, and diffusion tensor&#xD;
      imaging (DTI). Each scanning session will last approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the within-subject crossover protocol, each participant will be administered two&#xD;
      experimental conditions: IFG tDCS+language (tDCS intervention) and IFG sham+language (sham&#xD;
      treatment). All analyses, behavioral and imaging, will be under the oversight of the study&#xD;
      statisticians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before any intervention, participants will be randomly assigned to either sham or tDCS&#xD;
      experimental conditions. After 1-3 weeks of tDCS application (3-5 sessions in a week, 10-15&#xD;
      sessions per stimulation site) there will be an interval of approximately 2 months and then&#xD;
      the investigators will implement the other two tDCS conditions in a within-subject cross-over&#xD;
      design. Participants will be followed-up at 2-week and 2-month follow-up intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be blinded to the application of anodal or sham tDCS. To achieve blinding,&#xD;
      all participants will be fitted with the tDCS electrodes placed over the left inferior&#xD;
      frontal gyrus (IFG). The Soterix-CT device will be used for double-blinding purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. Justification of why participants will not receive routine care or will have current&#xD;
      therapy stopped&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will not disrupt any current care or therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non-treatment group&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo active and sham conditions, thus serving as participants' own&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      J. Definition of treatment failure or participant removal criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be removed from the study if participants are unable to comply with task&#xD;
      instructions or tolerate the tDCS procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      K. Description of what happens to participants receiving therapy when study ends or if a&#xD;
      participant's participation in the study ends prematurely&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study ends participants will continue to receive management with participants'&#xD;
      neurologist as usual. If a patient's participation in the study ends prematurely s/he will&#xD;
      still receive care as before. In sum, termination of the study or termination of&#xD;
      participation in it will not affect regular therapy he or she may be receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L. Qualification of investigators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator (PI) and co-investigators have extensive research and clinical&#xD;
      experience with all study tasks: behavioral language therapy (including AOS intervention).&#xD;
      The investigators have already published tDCS studies showing positive results in spelling.&#xD;
