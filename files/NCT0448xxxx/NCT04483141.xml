  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is common after a stroke, affecting up to 49% of patients within 2 years of the event.&#xD;
      They include headache, musculoskeletal pain, spasticity and central neuropathic pain. A wide&#xD;
      range of patients have communication problems after stroke that make it difficult to assess&#xD;
      pain. Yet there is a major impact of pain on the quality of life of these patients. Some&#xD;
      tools have been validated to assess pain in non-communicative patients, but none are specific&#xD;
      to stroke patients. The Algoplus scale is commonly used in intra-hospital care in France. The&#xD;
      Abbey Pain Scale is not translated into French, and could provide a more accurate pain rating&#xD;
      for non-communicative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to validate a French version of the Abbey Pain Scale for stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an observational study with longitudinal data collection. It is planned to include 120&#xD;
      patients from the neurology department of the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted over a 12-month period. 120 patients hospitalized for stroke&#xD;
      including 60 communicating and 60 non-communicating patients will be recruited.&#xD;
      Epidemiological data will be collected at enrollment, as well as an initial assessment using&#xD;
      the Abbey and Algoplus scales for non-communicating and communicating patients, and also the&#xD;
      numerical scale for communicating patients. The HADS questionnaire will be completed by&#xD;
      communicating patients only. Of the 60 patients in each group, 30 will receive a second&#xD;
      concurrent assessment by an inter-rater, 30 will receive a test/retest reassessment after 30&#xD;
      minutes, and 20 will be reassessed 90 minutes later by the same scales after pain treatment.&#xD;
      For 30 of the 120 patients, an infrared pupillometry measurement will be performed before and&#xD;
      after treatment of acute pain. All patients will be recruited from the neurovascular unit of&#xD;
      the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital.&#xD;

    <description>This scale is an instrument to screen for anxiety and depressive disorders. It consists of 14 items rated from 0 to 3. Seven questions relate to the anxiety dimension (total A) and seven others to the depressive dimension (total D), giving 2 scores. for communicant patients only</description>
