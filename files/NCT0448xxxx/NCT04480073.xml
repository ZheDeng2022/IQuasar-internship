      The aims of this prospective clinical study are to evaluate: a) the effectiveness of&#xD;
      digitally customized titanium meshes in association with autologous bone particles and bovine&#xD;
      bone mineral and covered with collagen membranes for the regeneration of atrophic edentulous&#xD;
      sites; b) the survival rate of implants placed in the reconstructed areas; and c) new bone&#xD;
      regeneration from a histomorphometric point of view&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the effectiveness of digitally customized titanium meshes for guided bone&#xD;
           regeneration with autologous bone chips taken from the mandibular body and/or ramus&#xD;
           mixed with bovine bone mineral bone granules (500-1000microns in diameter):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  complication rate of the reconstructive procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  assessment of bone gain obtained before implant placement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  implant survival and implant-related complications 1 year after the starting of&#xD;
           prosthetic loading;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  peri-implant bone resorption (MBL) after 1 year from the prosthetic load.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to perform a histomorphometric analysis of bone samples taken from sites reconstructed&#xD;
           according to the principle of Guided Bone regeneration by means of autologous bone chips&#xD;
           mixed with a xenograft with a 1:1 ratio and customized titanium mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be analyzed from an histologic point of view:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bone remodeling and mineralization levels of the new bone matrix&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  volumetric tissue fractions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  neo-vascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study method: prospective study - 24 consecutive patients treated (see statistical power&#xD;
      analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in accordance with the ISO Standard 14155: 2011, Clinical&#xD;
      Investigation of Medical Devices for Human Patients with the Appendices VIII and X of the&#xD;
      Medical Device Directive 93/42/ EEC and following the 2004 Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis (H0) is the following: the reconstructed bone is not functionally mature&#xD;
      to support implants, masticatory and functional loads after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was performed with the statistical program&#xD;
      https://clincalc.com/stats/samplesize.aspx. A literature search on PubMed was performed and&#xD;
      revealed that, on average, the percentage of new bone formed after reconstructions with&#xD;
      particulate bone autografts and xenografts and titanium mesh is 66% with a standard deviation&#xD;
      of 6%. The expected percentage value for the investigator's study was set at 70% with a&#xD;
      statistical power of 90% and a two-tier significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data distribution will be analyzed by Shapiro Wilk's normality test, due to the small sample&#xD;
      size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the data distribution is normal, the comparative analysis for the primary outcome will be&#xD;
      performed by T-student test for paired samples. If the data distribution is not normal, a&#xD;
      Wilcoxon test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The independent variable of the study is the bone reconstruction procedure. The dependent&#xD;
      variables are: a) the histomorphometric values of the reconstructed bone; b) the increase&#xD;
      (measured in mm) of the bone reconstruction obtained; c) the MBL (in mm) peri-implant 1 year&#xD;
      after the prosthetic load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be performed with SPSS software. Differences will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant for alpha &lt;0.05.&#xD;

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Customized CAD-CAM Titanium Mesh (Y-xoss CBR® by Reoss -Filderstadt - Germany) for Guided Bone Regeneration of atrophic alveolar ridges</intervention_name>
    <description>Step one:1) exposure of atrophic areas; 2) bone harvesting from mandible or calvarium; 3) filling the meshes with a mixture of the autogenous bone and particulated xenograft in a 1:1 ratio; 4) stabilization of the mesh with titanium micro-screws.&#xD;
A post-operative cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) will be done in all patients to have a reference point for the following controls.&#xD;
6 months later, patients are re-evaluated with a new CBCT to check bone volumes of the regenerated tissues and to plan implant placement.&#xD;
Step two: 1) removal of the meshes; 2) preparation of implant sites (one of which will be randomly chosen to obtain a bone biopsy for histomorphometric analysis); 3) implant placement.&#xD;
3 months later, implants will be uncovered and the prosthetic phases will start.&#xD;
Patients will be recalled 3, 6, and 12 months later, to assess peri-implant hard and soft tissue conditions, the stability of the reconstructed bone, and the onset of implant-related complications.</description>
