  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The challenge of new recommendations and better adapted practices is pushing to operate&#xD;
      patients who are getting older and more fragile. In this context, there is an inevitable&#xD;
      increase in the risks associated with care and in particular perioperative neurological&#xD;
      complications, of which postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is the most common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of perioperative cerebral monitoring and in particular electroencephalography&#xD;
      (EEG) to reduce neurological and cognitive damage in surgery has been the subject of abundant&#xD;
      research and corresponds to a crucial issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the literature and preliminary results obtained in our clinical research unit, it&#xD;
      appears that there is also a relationship between certain characteristics of the peroperative&#xD;
      EEG (signal strength and burst suppression) and the occurrence of postoperative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction (PCOD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, quantitative analysis of the preoperative sleep EEG and the EEG obtained&#xD;
      during general anesthesia could allow the identification of a simple to use biomarker of&#xD;
      susceptibility or fragility. To our knowledge, there is no preoperative evaluation strategy&#xD;
      using EEG analysis to detect a predisposition to POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this observational clinical study is to extend the traditional use of&#xD;
      per-operative EEG with pre-operative and post-operative sleep EEG for the detection and&#xD;
      prediction of early post-operative cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The interest of perioperative brain monitoring to reduce neurological and cognitive damage in&#xD;
      surgery has been the subject of much research and corresponds to a crucial issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The notion of quantitative EEG covers all the electrical signal processing techniques (fast&#xD;
      Fourier transformation, evoked potentials, EEG mapping, etc.) made possible through the&#xD;
      digitization of EEG data and the development of software to process these signals. In this&#xD;
      context, EEG-derived indices have been set up to monitor hypnosis during general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Between 0 (deep hypnosis) and 100 (awakening), the Bispectral Index (BIS) integrates in its&#xD;
      calculation the percentage of fast waves, the degree of wave synchronization and the periods&#xD;
      of EEG suppression (or &quot;Burst suppression&quot;) and allows an adaptation of the dosage of&#xD;
      anesthetic products according to its value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avoiding too deep anesthesia through neuro-monitoring could help to reduce postoperative&#xD;
      delirium by reducing the burst suppression pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative cognitive status assessment :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators observe a great delay in the means implemented to have an objective&#xD;
      evaluation of cognitive disorders in preoperative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the pitfalls of our anesthetist specialty is the lack of continuity of medical care in&#xD;
      the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The geriatric evaluation including a MMSE (mental mini state examination) and a MoCA&#xD;
      (Montreal cognitive assessment) is performed only occasionally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interest of the resting pre-operative EEG :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep EEG analysis is already used in cognitive studies. Slow Wave Activity (SWA) is a&#xD;
      parameter known to be inversely correlated with chronological age and lowered more&#xD;
      significantly in the context of cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power of spindles or sleep spindles and particularly fast spindles have been shown to be&#xD;
      potentially predictive of poor cognitive development in patients already showing symptoms&#xD;
      (Mild Cognitive Impairment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that per operative susceptibility to Burst suppression and the appearance of&#xD;
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction are linked to a set of per operative factors (anesthesia,&#xD;
      surgery, inflammation, pain...) but also preoperative factors (cognitive state, physiological&#xD;
      age and cerebral fragility...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that there is an association between preoperative resting EEG&#xD;
      abnormalities and the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this observational clinical study is to assess the fragility of a patient under&#xD;
      general anesthesia and based on the perioperative quantitative analysis EEG. Thus, this&#xD;
      project should help specialists in perioperative medicine to identify patients at risk of&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction and could lead to proposing strategies for its prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures are based on neuro-psychological tests (Montreal cognitive assesment -MoCA) and EEG&#xD;
      signal and subfrequency power spectral densities including alpha band as well as the amount&#xD;
      of Propofol, each measured for EEG periods where SEF 95 = 8-13Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis includes the characteristics of the preoperative sleep EEG (SWA, fast spindles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: This is a single-center, observational prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population concerned :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for interventional neuroradiology or surgery performed under General&#xD;
      Anesthesia are selected to participate in this prospective, observational, single-center,&#xD;
      routine care study. Patients will be included if they received, for a non-urgent scheduled&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over 18 years of age are eligible to participate in this protocol. During the&#xD;
      anesthesia consultation, they will be given a hand-delivered letter of information on the&#xD;
      objectives and the course of the study. Their non-opposition to participating in this study&#xD;
      will be collected at the latest during the pre-anesthetic visit, on the eve of the operation&#xD;
      after a period of reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will start the day before the intervention. The interventions will be performed&#xD;
      under general anaesthesia. The protocol does not interact with the care procedure. All the&#xD;
      measures are obtained non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day before the procedure: performance of a sleep EEG (DREEM®) and a MoCA test. On the day&#xD;
      of the procedure, monitoring of the depth of anesthesia using the quantitative EEG (Sedline&#xD;
      Masimo®) ensures continuous recording of intraoperative EEG data. Postoperatively the same&#xD;
      investigator performs MoCA at Day1, Day2 and Day5. A sleep EEG (DREEM®) is performed at Day2&#xD;
      and Day5 if the patient is still hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During their general anesthesia, all patients' routine monitoring will consist in collecting&#xD;
      the following parameters: electrocardiogram, pulsated oxygen saturation, endtidal CO2,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, tidal volume and neuromuscular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients whatever the comorbidities, anesthesia induction will be performed using a&#xD;
      target-controlled infusion (Orchestra® Base Primea - Fresenius Kabi France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional additional examination will be performed. The anesthetic strategy is decided by&#xD;
      the anesthetist in charge of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctor in charge of the study collecting the data does not interfere at any time in the&#xD;
      management of the patient. The measurements cannot influence the prescribing physician since&#xD;
      at this stage the data are not yet analysed and available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of selected subjects: Assuming an incidence of DCPO of 30%, with power at 80% and&#xD;
      alpha risk at 5%, it is necessary to include 100 patients to demonstrate an area under the&#xD;
      ROC curve of 80% with a confidence interval width of 0.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous data will be expressed in median [interquartile] and qualitative data in n (%).&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be compared by Mann-Whitney test and continuous variables by&#xD;
      Wilcoxon test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the primary endpoint was the occurrence of post-operative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction, defined as a decrease in MoCA score of more than 4 points between preoperative&#xD;
      and postoperative periods (worst value of the score measured at D1, D2 and D5). The main&#xD;
      exposure is the quantitative score obtained from the analysis of the pre-operative sleep EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of the various parameters of interest of the preoperative sleep EEG to predict&#xD;
      the occurrence of DCPO will be estimated by constructing an ROC curve. The area of these ROC&#xD;
      curves will be measured and the corresponding 95% confidence interval estimated. The areas&#xD;
      under the ROC curve of the different parameters will be compared by DeLong test. A uni- and&#xD;
      then multivariate analysis will be performed to identify the clinical parameters associated&#xD;
      with the occurrence of a DCPO. The possible added value of the sleep EEG parameters on the&#xD;
      clinical parameters will be evaluated by reclassification techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be carried out using the statistical analysis software &quot;R&quot; (The&#xD;
      R Foundation, Vienna, Austria)&#xD;
