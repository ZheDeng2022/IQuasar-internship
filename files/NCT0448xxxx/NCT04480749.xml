  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syphilis infection is a major global health problem, leading to substantial morbidity among&#xD;
      key populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Men who have sex with men (MSM)&#xD;
      are disproportionately affected by syphilis worldwide. Rates of syphilis diagnoses have been&#xD;
      increasing amongst MSM in many countries in the last decade. A growing evidence base&#xD;
      supporting HIV self-testing shows that self-testing kits based on the same proposed clinical&#xD;
      pathways are feasible and reliable. The proposed study will leverage this body of evidence&#xD;
      and apply it to syphilis self-testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study conducted in Zimbabwe. It aims to collect initial data on the&#xD;
      feasability of implementing syphilis self-testing to establish if a large scale-RCT of this&#xD;
      approach would be appropriate and, if so, to inform the design of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 100 MSM in Harare to join the pilot program. Participants will&#xD;
      be recruited through two methods: in-person at MSM community-based organizations that&#xD;
      currently operate HIV self-testing programs and online through banner advertisements that&#xD;
      advertise HIV self-testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: One arm of the pilot will receive a free syphilis self-test kit (Intervention Arm) Arm&#xD;
      2: One arm will receive standard free facility-based syphilis testing (Control Arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention arm the investigators will provide a treponemal rapid syphilis test kit&#xD;
      to all participants in the intervention arm of the pilot, delivered through MSM community&#xD;
      facilitators. This is similar to existing rapid treponemal test kits that are available at&#xD;
      many clinical facilities. Kits will be accompanied by simplified pictorial instructions on&#xD;
      finger prick blood sample collection. Among participants in the control group, they will&#xD;
      receive a list of local clinics that can provide free syphilis testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For individuals in the intervention am the investigators will aim to obtain confirmation of&#xD;
      test uptake. This will be done using either photographic confirmation sent via encrypted&#xD;
      message on a smartphone, SMS message of a unique code or sending a unique five-digit code&#xD;
      along with their test result to the study coordinator. The investigators will conduct&#xD;
      cross-sectional surveys at baseline and six months later to assess sexual risk behaviours,&#xD;
      HIV and syphilis testing experiences, and self-testing experiences. In addition to the survey&#xD;
      data tool the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews with a small number of&#xD;
      participants to gain additional data about their experience of syphilis self-testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will obtain information on linkage to care from routine clinic&#xD;
      administrative records and by providing study participants with a unique code to be provided&#xD;
      when attending at the facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will used mixed-methods to evaluate our pilot intervention including&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine the proportion of individuals who undertake a syphilis test in&#xD;
      the interventional and control arms; among those who receive a test, the proportion of&#xD;
      individuals who receive appropriate post-testing services. The investigators will also&#xD;
      collect qualitative data on attitudes to syphilis self-testing and quantitative data on&#xD;
      syphilis prevalence to inform a subsequent clinical trial.&#xD;
