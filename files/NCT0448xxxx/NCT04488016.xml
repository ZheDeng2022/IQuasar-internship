      This study will be a 2-part, open-label, single-center relative bioavailability, PPI effect,&#xD;
      food-effect and particle size effect randomized crossover study of acalabrutinib tablets in&#xD;
      healthy subjects (males or females). The study will be divided in 2 study parts; following a&#xD;
      review of the safety and Pharmacokinetics (PK) data from Part 1, the study is planned to be&#xD;
      continued with Part 2.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be divided in 2 study parts; Part 1 of this study will be an open-label,&#xD;
      3-treatment-period, 4-treatment, single-center relative bioavailability, PPI effect, and&#xD;
      food-effect randomized crossover study of a new acalabrutinib tablet in healthy subjects&#xD;
      (males or females).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relative bioavailability part of Study Part 1 is designed to investigate the PK of the&#xD;
      acalabrutinib tablet compared with the PK of acalabrutinib capsule, when administered as a&#xD;
      single dose with water under the fasted condition (&gt;10 hours). The PPI effect part of Study&#xD;
      Part 1 is designed to compare the PK of acalabrutinib tablet with or without coadministration&#xD;
      of the PPI rabeprazole. The food-effect part of Study Part 1 is designed to compare the PK of&#xD;
      acalabrutinib tablet under fed and fasted conditions. For each subject, a SmartPill will be&#xD;
      administered with 120 mL of still water followed immediately by a single oral dose of&#xD;
      acalabrutinib tablet (Treatment B, C or D) or acalabrutinib capsule (Treatment A)&#xD;
      administered with 120 mL of still water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Part 1 will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three treatment periods during which subjects will be resident from prior to the evening&#xD;
           meal the night before dosing with Investigational medicinal product (IMP) (Day -1) until&#xD;
           at least 48 hours after dosing; discharged on the morning of Day 3; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Follow-up Visit within 7 to 10 days. There will be a minimum washout period of at&#xD;
           least 7 days between each acalabrutinib administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decision to continue with Study Part 2 will be made following a review of the preliminary&#xD;
      data for relative bioavailability (acalabrutinib tablet versus acalabrutinib capsule), food&#xD;
      effect, PPI effect, and safety observed in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of this study will be an open-label, 4-treatment-period, 4-treatment, single-center&#xD;
      relative bioavailability, randomized crossover study to determine the effect of particle size&#xD;
      on the PK of a single dose of acalabrutinib tablet in healthy subjects (males or females).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This relative bioavailability study is designed to investigate the PK of acalabrutinib&#xD;
      tablets with various drug substance particle size distributions and the PK of acalabrutinib&#xD;
      solution at a single oral dose of 100 mg under the fasted condition (&gt;10 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Part 2 will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four treatment periods during which subjects will be resident prior to the evening meal&#xD;
           the night before dosing with IMP (Day -1) until at least 48 hours after dosing;&#xD;
           discharged on the morning of Day 3; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Follow-up Visit within 7 to 10 days. There will be a minimum washout period of at&#xD;
           least 3 days between each acalabrutinib administration.&#xD;
