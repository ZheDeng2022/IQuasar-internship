  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of&#xD;
      fezolinetant and ES259564 (fezolinetant metabolite) in female participants with mild and&#xD;
      moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy female participants with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of&#xD;
      fezolinetant in female participants with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and healthy&#xD;
      female participants with normal hepatic function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise of three groups based on hepatic function. Participants will be&#xD;
      screened for up to 28 days prior to investigational product (IP) administration on Day 1.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1 and will be residential&#xD;
      for a single period of six days/five nights. On Day 1, participants will receive a single&#xD;
      oral dose of fezolinetant under fasting conditions followed by a 96-hour in-house blood and&#xD;
      urine sampling period. Participants are to remain semirecumbent for four hours postdose.&#xD;
      Standard safety and tolerability assessments will be conducted. Participants will be&#xD;
      discharged from the clinical unit on Day 5 on the condition that all required assessments&#xD;
      have been performed and that there are no medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place five to&#xD;
      nine days after the last pharmacokinetic sample is collected or at the time of early&#xD;
      discontinuation from the study.&#xD;
