  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to estimate the percentage of participants in the&#xD;
      population considered clinically as not having pulmonary hypertension (PH) that are positive&#xD;
      for PH biomarker (micro ribonucleic acid [RNA]); estimate the percentage of participants in&#xD;
      the population considered clinically as not having PH that are positive for PH by cardiac&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and compare results of the MRI to the biomarker results; to&#xD;
      determine the performance of the biomarker signatures identified in the CIPHER (NAPUH0001)&#xD;
      study in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative&#xD;
      predictive value (NPV), in a population considered clinically as not having PH.&#xD;

    <description>Participants who underwent a work-up for the suspicion of PH that includes transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and who were considered to have a low or intermediate probability of PH according to TTE (local interpretation) will be enrolled. Blood samples will be taken and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed to evaluate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). The TTEs that were performed by local standards will be collected and undergo central interpretation using European society of Cardiology / European respiratory society (ESC/ERS) guidelines to confirm the local interpretation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Referred for diagnostic work-up for pulmonary hypertension (PH)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With low or intermediate (but not high) probability of PH by transthoracic&#xD;
             echocardiography (TTE) according to European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/ European&#xD;
             Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines if at the time of enrollment Right Heart&#xD;
             Catheterization (RHC) is not deemed to be clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical history and vital signs&#xD;
             performed at screening. Any abnormalities must be consistent with the underlying&#xD;
             illness in the study population and this determination must be recorded in the&#xD;
             participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must sign an Informed consent (ICF) indicating that he or she understands the purpose&#xD;
             of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must sign a separate approval in the ICF if he or she agrees to provide an optional&#xD;
             (DNA) sample for research. Refusal to give consent for the optional (DNA) research&#xD;
             sample does not exclude a participant from participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergone RHC within 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants requiring renal dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants post-lung or heart transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe left ventricular dysfunction: left ventricular ejection fraction less then (&lt;)&#xD;
