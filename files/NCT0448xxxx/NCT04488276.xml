    <textblock>
      More than 40% of all pregnant women in Pakistan are exposed to second-hand smoke - causing&#xD;
      approximately 17,000 still births in a year. In Pakistan only 1% of still births are&#xD;
      attributed to women actively smoking during pregnancy, but for second-hand smoke the figure&#xD;
      is 7%, largely due to the high numbers of pregnant women exposed to tobacco smoke in the&#xD;
      home. Negative effects of Second-hand smoking (SHS) on maternal and fetal health are well&#xD;
      established. In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) smoking inside the house is largely&#xD;
      unrestricted adversely affecting pregnant women by exposure to SHS. SHS exposure in&#xD;
      non-smoking pregnant women has increased the risk of stillbirth and congenital malformation&#xD;
      along with behavioural and cognitive issues in children. Partner's support during pregnancy&#xD;
      is important for developing a better maternal health. Therefore, a phenomenological research&#xD;
      approach is appropriate for describing the essence of experience in terms of affective and&#xD;
      emotional aspects. Phenomenology is an approach of creating phenomenological knowledge in a&#xD;
      situation by describing implicit meaning of experience. The investigators therefore propose&#xD;
      an epistemological approach of phenomenology.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different forms of tobacco such as cigarettes, water pipe, chewing paan, gutka and naswar are&#xD;
      used in Pakistan. According to Global Adult Tobacco Survey (2014), overall prevalence of&#xD;
      tobacco use in Pakistan is 19.1% (23.9 million adults). 7 out of 10 adults and 5 out of 10&#xD;
      children are exposed to second hand smoke in indoor workplace and at home. Second hand smoke&#xD;
      (SHS) is strongly associated with exposure of non-smoking pregnant women to various toxicants&#xD;
      which can harm the fetus and post partum harm infants and children. Effects of second-hand&#xD;
      smoking during pregnancy include low birth weight, sudden infant death, acute and chronic&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms, asthma and ear infection . In South and Southeast Asia, women have a&#xD;
      higher rate of exposure to SHS than men whereby they are exposed in different places&#xD;
      disproportionality, such as public transportation (62%), restaurants (56%) and at workplace&#xD;
      (37%). In LMICs, smoking inside the home is unrestricted and pregnant women are adversely&#xD;
      affected by exposure to SHS which increases the risk of stillbirth and congenital&#xD;
      malformation. It is, therefore, important to avert negative consequences of pregnancies that&#xD;
      are exposed to second-hand smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously researchers have tried to explore societal and cultural aspects of indoor smoking&#xD;
      and exposure to SHS and attributed gender inequality and gendered power dynamics to women's&#xD;
      failure to negotiate smoke-free homes. Additionally, several interventions have been found to&#xD;
      be effective in changing smoking-related behavior, however, most do not provide think&#xD;
      description of interventions to ascertain their theoretical basis. Therefore, examining the&#xD;
      phenomenon of second-hand smoke with an in-depth understanding of social and cultural factors&#xD;
      may help in describing smoking- and anti-smoking related behavior through qualitative&#xD;
      exploration. Findings of this pioneering qualitative work can be utilized for designing an&#xD;
      effective reduction strategy for tobacco use which can act as a conceptual framework for&#xD;
      behavior change to reduce or eliminate the effects of second-hand smoke on pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 40% of all pregnant women in Pakistan are exposed to second-hand smoke - causing&#xD;
      approximately 17,000 still births in a year. In Pakistan only 1% of still births are&#xD;
      attributed to women actively smoking during pregnancy, but for second-hand smoke the figure&#xD;
      is 7%, largely due to the high numbers of pregnant women exposed to tobacco smoke in the&#xD;
      home. Negative effects of Second-hand smoking (SHS) on maternal and fetal health are well&#xD;
      established. In LMICs smoking inside the house is largely unrestricted adversely affecting&#xD;
      pregnant women by exposure to SHS. SHS exposure in non-smoking pregnant women has increased&#xD;
      the risk of stillbirth and congenital malformation along with behavioral and cognitive issues&#xD;
      in children. Partner's support during pregnancy is important for developing a better maternal&#xD;
      health. Therefore, a phenomenological research approach is appropriate for describing the&#xD;
      essence of experience in terms of affective and emotional aspects. Phenomenology is an&#xD;
      approach of creating phenomenological knowledge in a situation by describing implicit meaning&#xD;
      of experience. The investigators therefore propose an epistemological approach of&#xD;
      phenomenology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed by the findings of the systematic review on the risk perception of second-hand&#xD;
      smoke, an interview guide will be developed. Int depth interviews with expectant or new&#xD;
      fathers who smoke (n=25-30) and their pregnant or post-partum partners exposed to&#xD;
      SHS(n=10-15) will be conducted. Thematic analysis will then be done. In addition to&#xD;
      presenting findings of research in traditional manner (themes), they will also be presented&#xD;
      in more applied or ready-to-be-picked manner. It means that based on the findings of this&#xD;
      study an evidence-informed conceptual framework will be developed to propose a behavior&#xD;
      change communication intervention, which will target poor or risky behaviors to promote&#xD;
      behavior modification that may result in positive maternal and fetal health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a qualitative study incorporating an initial stage of systematic review followed&#xD;
      by a stage of in depth interviewing that will lead to development of the conceptual&#xD;
      framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Search Strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, a review protocol will be developed(followed by its registration in (PROSPERO)&#xD;
      incorporating key terms and alternate search terms which are given below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second hand smoke: Indirect smoke, involuntary smoke, passive smoke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perception: Opinion, Perspective, Experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy: Pregnant woman, post-partum woman&#xD;
&#xD;
      These search terms will be used in different combinations to form search string with use of&#xD;
      Boolean operators (AND, OR) and truncations. PubMed, Embase, Global Health and CINAHL will be&#xD;
      searched systematically to identify and retrieve relevant data. Inclusion criteria are given&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative studies or mixed method studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies covering perception of effects of SHS on pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database Search:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two independent reviewers will implement the search strategy and compile extracted data in&#xD;
      Microsoft Excel sheet. The PRISMA workflow will be employed to complete the search.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) or Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool will be used&#xD;
      to critically appraise the research studies. Two reviewers will appraise and report the&#xD;
      result independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Extraction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be extracted at two levels: first order construct (participant's quote) and second&#xD;
      order constructs (researcher's interpretation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Synthesis and Reporting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracted data will be assembled into collective findings which will explain the phenomenon&#xD;
      under study. The necessary information extracted from each included paper will be descriptive&#xD;
      (regarding the participants, study type and characteristics, location, setting, year, main&#xD;
      topic, etc.), methods, type of analysis, findings, and original quotations. Thematic analysis&#xD;
      of data will be employed. Double data extraction, which is considered the golden standard,&#xD;
      will be employed. As a first step initial codes according to the analytical approach will be&#xD;
      created. As the analysis progresses, it might be that some findings form a code, or they&#xD;
      might become a code combined with other findings. It might also require for some codes to be&#xD;
      collapsed in order to form another code or (sub)theme. The data, once compiled and analyzed,&#xD;
      will also be available for depositing and publishing on an open research data platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will be conducted in Urban and peri-urban settings of Rawalpindi district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our qualitative approach will include in depth interviewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposive sampling will be employed to select potential respondents from different&#xD;
      socio-economic and education background. Though number of respondents will be determined by&#xD;
      theoretical saturation, but for planning purpose the investigators will recruit 25-30 smokers&#xD;
      and 10-15 non-smoking pregnant or post-partum women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Respondents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community gatekeepers and lady health workers will be used to identify expectant and new&#xD;
      fathers, who are active smokers, along with pregnant and post-partum women who are exposed to&#xD;
      SHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview guide will be developed deductively as a result of the systematic review and will&#xD;
      be piloted before its actual use. Guide will be revised based on the experience of pilot&#xD;
      interview or as data collection proceeds. Trained interviewer will conduct in-depth interview&#xD;
      using semi-structured interview guide and will record it with consent from respondents.&#xD;
      Later, services of professional transcriber and translator will be taken and data will be&#xD;
      coded by team of two researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inductive approach of extracting codes from the textual data will be utilized. Initial coding&#xD;
      structure will be developed and discussed and same will undergo several iterations based on&#xD;
      the review of other transcripts. Final coding scheme will be uniformly applied to all&#xD;
      interview transcripts. Inductive thematic analysis approach will be used to identify&#xD;
      behaviors and methods of behavior development. Narrative account on lived experiences will&#xD;
      help us to contextualize key behavior within cultural and social context of the Pakistan.&#xD;
