  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a physical activity intervention for children during acute cancer&#xD;
      treatment. The intervention aims to encourage children to participate in increased levels of&#xD;
      physical activity and reduce the amount of time they spend engaged in sedentary activities.&#xD;
      This study also aims to evaluate different ways of assessing physical function in order to&#xD;
      determine the best outcome measure to use for children during acute cancer treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive the intervention which involves weekly sessions with a&#xD;
      physiotherapist and the provision of an activity tracker. The sessions will aim to help&#xD;
      motivate participants to be more physically active and identify barriers to physical activity&#xD;
      in their environment. The activity tracker will be used to set a steps per day goal for the&#xD;
      participant to achieve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be assessed for feasibility using aspects of the Bowen Framework. Under&#xD;
      this framework the intervention will be evaluated according to different domains:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability: To what extent is a new idea, program, process or measure judged as&#xD;
           suitable or satisfying&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demand: To what extent is a new idea, program, process, or measure likely to be used&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementation: To what extent can a new program is successfully delivered to intended&#xD;
           participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Practicality: To what extent can the program can be carried out with intended&#xD;
           participants using existing means, resources, and circumstances&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limited efficiency: Does the a new program show promise of being successful with the&#xD;
           intended population&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to find out the best way to assess physical function, participants will complete 5&#xD;
      different assessments. The results from these assessments will help to determine the best&#xD;
      measure to use in this population.&#xD;

          -  Has been an in-patient for &gt;7 consecutive days at the time of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide a signed and dated informed consent form and/or has a legally acceptable&#xD;
             representative capable of understanding the informed consent document and providing&#xD;
