  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and a leading cause of death&#xD;
      worldwide. Only about 50% of hypertension patients have good blood pressure control. Patients&#xD;
      with low health literacy have worse blood pressure control, perhaps because they find it&#xD;
      harder to interpret whether blood pressure readings are high or low, reflect good or bad&#xD;
      blood pressure control, and indicate a need for behavior change or medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Heart Association has called for broad efforts to help empower hypertension&#xD;
      patients from different backgrounds to control their blood pressure. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate different ways for helping hypertension patients to interpret&#xD;
      their blood pressure readings and motivate blood pressure control, in a sample of&#xD;
      hypertension patients varying in health literacy, age, and socio-economic status. Their&#xD;
      strategy is based on insights from behavioral science studies, which suggest that people find&#xD;
      it easier to interpret numbers when they can see the range of possible numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Based on existing communications, the investigators will create 3 blood pressure&#xD;
      communications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A) a basic table showing only the normal blood pressure range, which is often used in&#xD;
      clinical practice and online communications about blood pressure, but may make it hard to&#xD;
      interpret numbers outside of the normal range, potentially undermining behavior change&#xD;
      intentions; (B) an enhanced table showing how combinations of diastolic and systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure reflect normal, elevated and hypertension ranges, from the American Heart&#xD;
      Association; (C) an enhanced graph to be adapted from Blood Pressure UK to show the same&#xD;
      color-coded ranges as the enhanced table, with diastolic blood pressure on the x-axis and&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure on the y-axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: : In a sample of 650 diagnosed hypertension patients recruited through the Pitt+Me&#xD;
      Patient Registry at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), the investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate whether being presented with the enhanced table or graph (vs. basic table)&#xD;
      affects patients' self-reported blood pressure measurement (as averaged across two&#xD;
      measurements taken at the time of the survey at least 1 minute apart, as per directions of&#xD;
      the American Heart Association), and improves interpretations of these two blood pressure&#xD;
      readings and of hypothetical blood pressure readings, as well as behavior change intentions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: The investigators will examine whether Aim 2 findings vary by health literacy, age,&#xD;
      and SES.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and a&#xD;
      leading cause of death worldwide. Lifetime risk of hypertension is 70-90%, but it is higher&#xD;
      among adults who are older and of low socio-economic status (SES). Older age and lower SES&#xD;
      are also associated with low health literacy, which undermines understanding of health&#xD;
      information. Yet, low health literacy in hypertension patients is an independent predictor of&#xD;
      poor blood pressure control, with only about 50% of hypertension patients having controlled&#xD;
      blood pressure. Possibly, patients with lower health literacy find it harder to interpret&#xD;
      whether blood pressure readings are high or low, reflect good or bad blood pressure control,&#xD;
      and indicate a need for behavior change or medication use. Even college-educated hypertension&#xD;
      patients who have bought home blood pressure monitors may struggle to interpret blood&#xD;
      pressure readings that are outside the normal range, undermining their intentions to improve&#xD;
      their blood pressure control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE INSIGHT Lab studies in behavioral science have found that individuals'&#xD;
      ability to interpret numbers (likely including blood pressure readings) is improved by&#xD;
      showing the range or distribution - also called 'reference information'. In preliminary work,&#xD;
      the PI showed that many people struggle to interpret credit card APRs, because they do not&#xD;
      know what numbers are good or bad. In line with the behavioral science insight, the PI found&#xD;
      that providing graphs with ranges of existing APRs helped recipients to see which credit&#xD;
      cards posed a bad deal, and reduced their intentions to get such credit cards. It has been&#xD;
      posited that providing reference information (e.g. normal and abnormal blood pressure ranges)&#xD;
      should also help hypertension patients to interpret blood pressure readings, and help them to&#xD;
      control their blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If reference information is used when communicating blood pressure readings in clinics and&#xD;
      online health records, it often involves a basic table that only shows the normal range&#xD;
      (e.g., &lt;120 for systolic and &lt;80 for diastolic blood pressure). In one behavioral science&#xD;
      study, 106 university staff performed similarly when using this basic table or when using a&#xD;
      color-coded horizontal bar graph (showing the normal range in white and values outside the&#xD;
      normal range in black). However, neither format followed the American Heart Association's&#xD;
      communication, which shows more reference information for interpreting blood pressure&#xD;
      readings outside of the normal range. Hypertension patients may need to see such enhanced&#xD;
      reference information, because they are more likely to encounter blood pressure readings&#xD;
      outside of the normal range. Moreover, those readings can be harder to interpret - perhaps&#xD;
      especially for hypertension patients with low health literacy. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      evaluate 2 formats for providing the more enhanced reference information from the American&#xD;
      Heart Association, in either a table (as used by the American Heart Association), or a graph&#xD;
      (as used by Blood Pressure UK, to be adapted to show the information from the American Heart&#xD;
      Association). The behavioral science literature suggests that tables facilitate reading&#xD;
      specific numbers, but that graphs help more with interpreting numbers as high or low, and&#xD;
      good or bad - though that could depend on recipients' health literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS The American Heart Association has called for broad-based efforts to improve&#xD;
      the proportion of hypertension patients with controlled blood pressure, by &quot;further engaging&#xD;
      individuals in the hypertension control process&quot; with &quot;adequate representation of [specific]&#xD;
      populations&quot; including those with lower health literacy, older age, and lower SES. Therefore,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to conduct an NIH Stage I primary data collection project, to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of interventions to facilitate blood pressure readings and motivate&#xD;
      blood pressure control, in a sample of hypertension patients varying in health literacy, age,&#xD;
      and SES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Based on existing communications, the investigators' communication expertise (see&#xD;
      below), and pilot tests with up to 10 hypertension patients, the investigators will generate&#xD;
      3 blood pressure communications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A) a basic table showing only the normal range, which is often used but may make it hard to&#xD;
      interpret numbers outside of the normal range, potentially undermining behavior change&#xD;
      intentions; (B) an enhanced table with more reference information, showing how combinations&#xD;
      of diastolic and systolic blood pressure reflect normal, elevated and hypertension ranges,&#xD;
      from the American Heart Association; (C) an enhanced graph to be adapted from Blood Pressure&#xD;
      UK to show the same color-coded ranges as the enhanced table, with diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
      on the x-axis and systolic blood pressure on the y-axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2:: In a sample of 650 diagnosed hypertension patients recruited through the Pitt+Me&#xD;
      Patient Registry at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), the investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate whether being presented with the enhanced table or graph (vs. basic table)&#xD;
      affects patients' self-reported blood pressure measurement (as averaged across two&#xD;
      measurements taken at the time of the survey at least 1 minute apart, as per directions of&#xD;
      the American Heart Association), and improves interpretations of these two blood pressure&#xD;
      readings and of hypothetical blood pressure readings, as well as behavior change intentions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: The investigators will examine whether Aim 2 findings vary by health literacy, age,&#xD;
      and SES.&#xD;
