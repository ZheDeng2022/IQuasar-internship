      This is a single-arm Phase Ib/II multicenter open-label study, with translational sub-study,&#xD;
      of atezolizumab plus autologous dendritic cell vaccine as maintenance treatment in&#xD;
      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). It is expected that three Spanish sites&#xD;
      will include patients in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive standard treatment with carboplatin and etoposide, plus atezolizumab&#xD;
      for four 21-day cycles (induction phase), followed by a maintenance phase during which they&#xD;
      will receive the dendritic cell vaccine (6 doses maximum) in combination with atezolizumab&#xD;
      until they had unacceptable toxic effects, disease progression according to Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, or no additional clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two primary endpoints are the investigator-assessed toxicity and the 6 months PFS, both&#xD;
      in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary Outcome Measures include: Duration of&#xD;
      clinical benefit (DCB), Overall survival (OS) and Overall response rate (ORR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translational substudy will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of tumor tissue samples will consist of PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry testing, RNA&#xD;
      expression, Work Environmental Scale (WES) analysis, and flow cytometry in pretreatment fresh&#xD;
      tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will consist of T cell immunophenotyping, DC immunophenotyping, Tumoral RNA&#xD;
      analysis by nanostring and tumoral cell-free DNA analysis by WES and cytokine analysis&#xD;

      This is a single-arm Phase Ib/II multicenter open-label study, with translational sub-study,&#xD;
      of atezolizumab plus autologous dendritic cell vaccine as maintenance treatment in&#xD;
      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). It is expected that three Spanish sites&#xD;
      will include patients in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive standard treatment with carboplatin and etoposide, plus atezolizumab&#xD;
      for four 21-day cycles (induction phase), followed by a maintenance phase during which they&#xD;
      will receive atezolizumab and dendritic cell vaccine combination until they had unacceptable&#xD;
      toxic effects, disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST), version 1.1, or no additional clinical benefit. The two primary endpoints are the&#xD;
      investigator-assessed toxicity and the 6 months PFS, both in the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase Ib safety lead-in portion, up to 6 patients will be enrolled into and evaluated&#xD;
      for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during the first 2 cycles of the maintenance therapy. If&#xD;
      &lt;2 out of 6 patients present with limiting toxicities, the administration of the&#xD;
      investigational products will be deemed safe in the Phase 1b lead-in, therefore enrollment&#xD;
      will be expanded into the Phase 2 cohort. Inclusion and treatment of up to 20 patients&#xD;
      (including those enrolled in the Phase Ib lead-in) with atezolizumab and dendritic cell&#xD;
      vaccination as maintenance therapy is finally expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will be based on adverse event reports, results of clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests, immune safety tests, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, Eastern&#xD;
      Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status both during the study, and up to six&#xD;
      months following the last study drug administration. Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed&#xD;
      throughout the study period and evaluated by using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common&#xD;
      Technology Criteria version of Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v 5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor measurements will be performed by computed tomography (CT) scan at baseline, at week 6&#xD;
      (W6), at week 12 (W12), and every 9 weeks thereafter, to evaluate 6m PFS and response to&#xD;
      treatment. The response will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and the immune-related response criteria (irRECIST) as a&#xD;
      secondary endpoint. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed at baseline&#xD;
      (mandatory as per clinical practice), and along with CT scan at each timepoint, if there are&#xD;
      brain metastasis at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) after&#xD;
      induction with chemotherapy plus atezolizumab (CT scan on W12) will continue during the&#xD;
      maintenance phase with atezolizumab plus dendritic cell vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with atezolizumab will continue until disease progression (PD), significant&#xD;
      clinical deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, or if any criteria for withdrawal from the&#xD;
      trial is fulfilled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with dendritic cell vaccines will continue for a maximum of 6 doses until PD,&#xD;
      significant clinical deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, or if any criteria for withdrawal&#xD;
      from the trial are fulfilled (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment may continue after the initial determination of PD per RECIST 1.1 if the subject's&#xD;
      performance status remains stable, and if the opinion of the principal investigator, the&#xD;
      subject will benefit from continued treatment and if other criteria are fulfilled as outlined&#xD;
      in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have a confirmed CR or PR, it should be considered prophylactic cranial&#xD;
      irradiation (PCI) after completion of chemotherapy (i.e., induction) based on the&#xD;
      investigator's judgment. Following the completion of the induction part, PCI may be&#xD;
      administered concurrently with atezolizumab and dendritic cell vaccination during the&#xD;
      maintenance part. For those patients who have not progressed at the time of study drug&#xD;
      discontinuation, the tumor assessments (including all disease locations) will be assessed&#xD;
      radiologically by CT or MRI, as performed at screening, every 9 weeks (approximately 63 ± 7&#xD;
      days), until the occurrence of PD or study completion. The same method of assessment (CT or&#xD;
      MRI) should be used to characterize tumors at screening and at all follow-up assessments. If&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) is used, it should also be accompanied by spiral CT or&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be defined based on the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) comparing with&#xD;
      historic controls of atezolizumab in monotherapy as a maintenance treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaplan Meier method will be used to estimate the survival function. Translational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor samples: All patients will undergo baseline tumor tissue acquisition prior to&#xD;
      enrollment. The only mandatory tissue biopsy is pretreatment. Tissue samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre induction treatment fresh and paraffin-embedded tumor sample (If obtaining a fresh biopsy&#xD;
      is not feasible, the case should be discussed with Coordinating Investigators) Pre&#xD;
      maintenance phase (for those that rebiopsy is feasible) After 24 weeks on maintenance phase&#xD;
      (for those patents that continue on treatment after w24 on maintenance and rebiopsy is&#xD;
      feasible) At tumor progression (for those patients who progressed and rebiopsy is feasible).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of tumor tissue samples will consist of PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry testing, RNA&#xD;
      expression, WES analysis, and flow cytometry in pretreatment fresh tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood samples: Peripheral blood samples will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre induction treatment Pre maintenance phase After 9 weeks of the first vaccination At&#xD;
      progression of the disease The analysis will consist of T cell immunophenotyping, DC&#xD;
      immunophenotyping, Tumoral RNA analysis by nanostring and tumoral cell-free DNA analysis by&#xD;
      WES and cytokine analysis&#xD;
