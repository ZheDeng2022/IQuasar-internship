  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain lesions in the adult have dramatic consequences, because the spontaneous capacity of&#xD;
      the brain to functionally recover is limited. Besides existing rehabilitative therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches (e.g. physiotherapy), several lines of research aim at developing treatments to&#xD;
      promote and refine brain plasticity to enhance functional recovery following brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot clinical study aims at enrolling subjects victim of a stroke with neuronal&#xD;
      destruction leading to a disabling motor deficit. Usually these patients benefit from&#xD;
      intensive neurorehabilitation which allows them to progress up to a certain point but when&#xD;
      their recovery plateau is reached; current medicine is disarmed and no effective treatment&#xD;
      allows, to date, to improve further their performance. This monocentric pilot study aims at&#xD;
      evaluating the feasibility and safety of Autologous Neural Cell Ecosystems (ANCE), which is a&#xD;
      cortical autograft intended to be used on stroke patients, for the replacement of motor&#xD;
      neurons destroyed during an ischemic stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using neural grafts to restore function after lesions of the central nervous system is a&#xD;
      challenging strategy. Most of the transplantation experience acquired the last decades was&#xD;
      focused on fetal neuronal grafts. However, despite the great enthusiasm generated by this&#xD;
      approach, ethical controversies, immune rejection, and lack of fetal donors remain a major&#xD;
      problem. Therefore, autotransplantation of adult brain cells represents an attractive&#xD;
      restoration alternative to bypass the caveats of fetal grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimization of the procedure to obtain ANCE, a cortical autograft obtained from cortical&#xD;
      biopsy, was first successfully demonstrated in producing long-term primary culture of adult&#xD;
      human brain cells from temporal lobe tissues obtained from epilepsy and trauma neurosurgical&#xD;
      patients. ANCE has been characterized as an ecosystem of autologous neural cells in&#xD;
      suspension, composed of several cell types: astrocytes, proliferative progenitors and&#xD;
      quiescent progenitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The production of ANCE has been implemented to prepare long-term primary culture from primate&#xD;
      cortical biopsies. This allowed assessing the feasibility of autotransplantation from brain&#xD;
      biopsy to reimplantation of cultured brain cells in a non-human primate model of motor cortex&#xD;
      lesion. On the same model of cerebral cortex lesion in nonhuman primates, further study&#xD;
      demonstrated, by quantitative behavioral evidence, the beneficial outcome of cell therapy&#xD;
      following injury of the cerebral cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the encouraging results from past experiences on non-human primate model of motor&#xD;
      cortex lesion, this monocentric pilot study aims at evaluating the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      ANCE (Autologous Neural Cell Ecosystems), which is cortical autograft intended to be used on&#xD;
      stroke patients, for the replacement of motor neurons destroyed during an ischemic stroke.&#xD;
