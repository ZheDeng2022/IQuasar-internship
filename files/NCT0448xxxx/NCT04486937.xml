      This study is a multicenter, single arm phase I / II clinical study in mCRPC subjects who&#xD;
      failed to receive docetaxel chemotherapy, abitolone acetate and / or enzalutamide (including&#xD;
      its analogues) for the treatment of BRCA mutations in germ cells and / or somatic cells.&#xD;

      The subjects oral administration sc10914 tablets 400mg on an empty stomach, three times a&#xD;
      day, for 28 consecutive days as a treatment cycle, until disease progression (PD) (according&#xD;
      to Recist1.1 and the adjusted PCWG3 standard, the subjects met the imaging [CT / MRI / bone&#xD;
      scan] PD standard) or the toxicity was intolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into two stages: in the first stage,enrolled 36 patients whose response&#xD;
      can be evaluated, if there are at least 7 cases of objective remission (CR or PR), the second&#xD;
      stage is allowed, otherwise the study will be stopped; in the second stage, the number of&#xD;
      subjects whose response can be evaluated is planned to continue to be enrolled to 70&#xD;
      cases（stage 1 and stage 2）.&#xD;
