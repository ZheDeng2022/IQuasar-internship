        The main cohort is formed from those who do not have CVD, who are affected by different&#xD;
        factors that we register (various physical activities, the presence or absence of&#xD;
        pregnancy, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        An additional cohort is formed from those who have CVD at the time of inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The goal is to track the natural evolution (progression) of the disease, to evaluate the&#xD;
        incidence and risk factors of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        An extremely important criterion for the formation of the study population is the&#xD;
        possibility to control the lower legs veins of observed individuals by a qualified vascular&#xD;
        specialist. To date, a qualitative assessment of veins according to the CEAP classification&#xD;
        is a weak point in longitudinal epidemiological studies.&#xD;
