      Ambulatory blood pressure measurement is more demanding in terms of technical equipment and&#xD;
      specially trained staff. If blood pressure measurement in a self-care room is on average&#xD;
      equivalent to the ambulatory blood pressure daytime monitoring of hypertension in primary&#xD;
      care could be simplified. We therefore want to examine patients monitored for hypertension&#xD;
      (ICD 10) with three different methods: conventional blood pressure measurement in office,&#xD;
      self-directed automated measurement and ambulatory blood pressure, starting in December 2020.&#xD;
      We will also offer an interview covering cardiovascular risk factors, at time for enrollment&#xD;
      and after 6 months. The study was approved to include 150 adult study patients (The swedish&#xD;
      ethical review authority 2020-01375), men and women, where diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      hypertension is relevant after a clinical evaluation.&#xD;

      Background: At present, both 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and self-directed blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement in self-care rooms, are services provided by most Swedish primary care&#xD;
      clinics. Ambulatory measurement of blood pressure has the disadvantage of being more&#xD;
      demanding with regard to the need for advanced technical equipment and trained staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and support for change, should be&#xD;
      integrated into the treatment programs of hypertension. At study entry all study participants&#xD;
      will be invited to an interview focused on identifying modifiable cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors, with a follow-up interview after six months to consolidate good lifestyle choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: If self-directed blood pressure measured in a designated self-care room gives results&#xD;
      that are on average equivalent to ambulatory blood pressure daytime, diagnosis and follow-up&#xD;
      of hypertensive patients in primary care could be simplified. The majority of patients could&#xD;
      then be cared for through self-checks., and the technically more demanding ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement reserved for special cases. We therefore want to examine patients under&#xD;
      treatment or investigated for hypertension in primary care with three different methods:&#xD;
      conventional in-office blood pressure measurement by medical staff, ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
      and automated measurement of blood pressure in a special self-care room. Between study entry&#xD;
      and after six months changes in modifiable risk factors are documented according to an&#xD;
      interview guide covering use of tobacco, alcohol, physical activity and food preferences,&#xD;
      with 4-6 fixed alternatives per item.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics: Study patients are recruited among patients registered at Föllinge Health&#xD;
      Centre (population 1500), of which about 1000 are in ages where investigation and treatment&#xD;
      of hypertension could be relevant. The prevalence of hypertension in the adult population is&#xD;
      estimated to about 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We will recruit men and women from age 20 and older. Advanced age is not a criterion&#xD;
      for exclusion if treatment of hypertension is judged to be important after clinical&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: Between-methods difference 4 mm Hg, standard deviation 15, correlation&#xD;
      0.4, nominal power 0.8, alpha 0.05: Least necessary number of pairwise measurements N = 135.&#xD;
      Corresponding simulation as above, with an assumed correlation 0.5: Necessary number of&#xD;
      pairwise measurements N =113. Based on the power calculation, we want to recruit up to 150&#xD;
      study patients for self-directed and office-based blood pressure measurement and ambulatory&#xD;
      blood pressure, preliminarily starting in October 1 2020 and last enrolment December 30 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview: An interview is offered to all study participants at enrolment and after about 6&#xD;
      months. The interview follows a risk factor inventory according to the Swedish Health&#xD;
      Promotion and Healthcare Network, and the patient information pamphlet &quot;Healthy choices make&#xD;
      a difference&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Potential study patients provide signed informed consent before enrolling in the&#xD;
      study. Study patients are identified among patients who are evaluated or treated for&#xD;
      hypertension. Study patients who have provided written informed consent are randomised for&#xD;
      in-office and self-directed blood pressure measurement in random order on the day before and&#xD;
      immediately after completing a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical equipment: Blood pressure measurements are performed with Omron meters (automated&#xD;
      oscillometry). In-office: Omron M7 Inteli IT (CE. 01997), certified for arm circumferences 22&#xD;
      - 42 cm. Self-care room: Omron i-Q142 (CE. 0197), certified for arm circumferences 22 - 42&#xD;
      cm. Ambulatory blood pressure measurement: Meditech ABPM-05 Blue BP-05 (CE 0120); cuff width&#xD;
      120 - 250 mm for 23 - 33 cm arm circumference and 150 - 330 mm, for 31 - 40 cm arm&#xD;
      circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Office blood pressure: Measurement after five minutes of rest in a quiet environment, with&#xD;
      the patient sitting in a chair with a backrest and support for the arms. The blood pressure&#xD;
      cuff is applied to the upper arm, at the level of the heart. Three measurements are performed&#xD;
      at 1-2 minutes interval. Further measurements are made only if the first two values differ&gt;&#xD;
      10 mm Hg. The blood pressure is recorded as the average of the last two measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure in a self-care room: The measurement is performed according to the same&#xD;
      principles as in the office. The device signals if the patient does not handle it correctly.&#xD;
      Simple instructions are clearly posted in the room. During measurement only one patient may&#xD;
      stay in the self-care room at a time, without any staff present. Patients who need supervised&#xD;
      instruction are offered guidance before measuring blood pressure on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulatory blood pressure: measurement every 30 minutes from 06 A.M.until 22 P.M. and every&#xD;
      60 minutes at night, for a total of 24 hours. The mean value 06 A.M.- 22 P.M is compared with&#xD;
      the mean values for blood pressure measured in-office and in the self-care room respectively.&#xD;
      All blood pressure measurements are performed in the left upper arm, to be able to compare&#xD;
      with the corresponding values obtained in the self-care room, where the device is adapted for&#xD;
      measurement in the left arm, while the patient handles the device's button control with the&#xD;
      right hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Standard numerical outcome measures, means and proportions for baseline&#xD;
      variables, t-test and Chi-2, for means and group comparisons, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard blood and urine samples are analysed at the Department of Clinical Chemistry,&#xD;
      Östersund Hospital. Potential study patients will undergo a medical examination, relevant&#xD;
      biochemical analyses and an ECG recording (12-lead standard ECG) before enrolment in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of expected findings: Ambulatory blood pressure measurement has the disadvantage&#xD;
      of being more demanding in terms of technical equipment and specially trained staff. If blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement in a self-care room gives results that are equivalent to the ambulatory&#xD;
      blood pressure values daytime, monitoring of hypertension in primary care could be&#xD;
      simplified.&#xD;
