      The investigators' objective is to implement an innovative curriculum in narrative medicine&#xD;
      for pediatric residents rotating at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), and to&#xD;
      evaluate whether this curriculum is protective against burnout and diminished quality of life&#xD;
      during that rotation as measured on The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey&#xD;
      (MBI-HSS) and The Professional Quality of Life Scale: Compassion Satisfaction, Burnout, and&#xD;
      Fatigue Scale Version V (ProQOL R-V).&#xD;

      Methods and Procedures This study is designed to evaluate the impact of a narrative medicine&#xD;
      curriculum on a convenience sample of pediatric residents rotating through MSKCC during the&#xD;
      2020-2021 academic year. The first block of the study period will be a control group,&#xD;
      followed by treatment (the second block). Blocks will alternate in this way for the remainder&#xD;
      of the 12 month period (control-treatment-control-treatment-control-treatment etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group will be offered three sessions in narrative medicine during their block&#xD;
      at MSKCC, with sessions taking place during the one-hour afternoon conference time slot. The&#xD;
      control group will proceed through the standard afternoon conference curriculum, with no&#xD;
      narrative medicine sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A session in narrative medicine is defined as a one-hour session in which a pre- selected&#xD;
      piece of poetry or literary fiction is read, then responded to in written form, with the&#xD;
      option to share one's responses aloud with the group. It provides opportunity for reflection,&#xD;
      meaning-making, bearing witness to the stories of doctors and patients, and important&#xD;
      professional development. Candidate texts have been chosen by experts in narrative medicine,&#xD;
      English literature, and creative writing, and are grouped around 4 themes: caring for ill and&#xD;
      dying children and their families, forging connections, coping with uncertainty and&#xD;
      ambiguity, and mindfulness. The publishers for each piece are currently being contacted and&#xD;
      permission requested for their use in this study. While the use of works in the context of&#xD;
      this study meets Cornell University Check.list for Fair Use Criteria, some publishers charge&#xD;
      a nominal fee, up to approximately $50, for use of a complete work such as a poem. Excerpts&#xD;
      from books are typically at no charge. The cost of these permissions has been figured into&#xD;
      the study budget, and is funded by a Pilot Grant from the Dept. of Pediatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narrative medicine sessions will be standardized, and will be taught by 5 of the 6&#xD;
      co-investigator's: two from pediatric emergency medicine, one from pediatric pulmonology, one&#xD;
      from the office of the chaplain, and one from the Dept. of Child Psychiatry at MSK. All five&#xD;
      will receive training in facilitating narrative medicine sessions. They will each attend one&#xD;
      narrative medicine session at the WCMC Liz Claiborne Center for Humanism in Medicine, and&#xD;
      they will each read relevant chapters of the textbook &quot;Narrative Medicine,&quot; by Rita Charon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-test, comprised of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) and&#xD;
      the Professional Quality of Life Scale: Compassion Satisfaction, Burnout, and Fatigue Scale&#xD;
      Version V (ProQOL) will be administered to all groups during the first session of each block,&#xD;
      and demographic information will be collected, specifically post-graduate year,&#xD;
      self-identified gender, self-identified race and/or ethnicity, previous exposure to narrative&#xD;
      medicine, and previous rotations in clinical oncology. A post-test, using the same survey&#xD;
      instruments, will be administered during the final session, along with two open-ended&#xD;
      questions about their experience with this curriculum. Only the intervention group will&#xD;
      answer the two open-ended questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each resident will choose a 4-digit ID number which will be written on their demographic&#xD;
      intakes and pre-and post-tests, as well as on the sign in sheet for the 2nd narrative&#xD;
      medicine session during intervention blocks. They will be asked to email their PIN to&#xD;
      themselves during the pre-test so that they will not forget the number. This identifying&#xD;
      pin-number is necessary in order to match individual pre-tests to post-tests and assess&#xD;
      degree of change for individuals over the duration of the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MBI-HSS is a 22-item self-report questionnaire comprised of 3 subscales, which measure exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Respondents indicate the frequency of their signs and symptoms on a 7-point Likert scale where 0 = never and 6= every day. The highest and lowest possible scores for each of the subscales are as follows:&#xD;
Emotional exhaustion subscale (0- 54) Depersonalization subscale (0-30) Professional accomplishment scale (0-48)</description>

    <description>The PROQOL R-V will be used to measure compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue, and burnout. It is a 30 item self-report questionnaire . Subjects are instructed to indicate on a 6-point Likert scale with endpoints of 0 (never) and 5 (very often), the characteristics that relate to them. The highest and lowest possible scores for each of the subscales are as follows:&#xD;
Compassion Satisfaction subscale (3-50) Burnout subscale (3-40) Secondary traumatic stress subscale (2-37)</description>
