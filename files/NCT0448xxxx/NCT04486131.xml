      Local recurrence rates in rectal cancer have reduced dramatically since the introduction of&#xD;
      the total mesorectal excision (TME) technique and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) to&#xD;
      overall rates of 5-year local recurrence to 5-10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, distal rectal cancers have a tendency to spread to lateral lymph nodes and it was&#xD;
      recently shown that patients with enlarged lateral lymph nodes of ≥7 mm have a considerable&#xD;
      chance of a local recurrence, 19.5% in 5 years regardless of CRT with TME. If the enlarged&#xD;
      (&gt;7mm) lateral lymph node was reduced to &lt;4mm (internal iliac) or &lt;6mm (obturator), none of&#xD;
      the patients developed a local recurrence, while lymph nodes that stayed enlarged in the&#xD;
      internal iliac compartment had a local recurrence rate over 5 years of 52.3%. This rate was&#xD;
      significantly reduced to 8.7% when performing a lateral lymph node dissection (LLND) to (C)RT&#xD;
      + TME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major drawback of this recent multi-center study is its retrospective nature, for example,&#xD;
      while each center has general guidelines for irradiating lateral nodal compartments, it might&#xD;
      be possible that these lymph nodes were not always included in the irradiation fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LaNoReC trial is a prospective registration study aimed at increasing national awareness&#xD;
      for enlarged lateral nodes and their role in local recurrences. The main question of this&#xD;
      study is whether, after standardized and quality controlled irradiation of the lateral nodes&#xD;
      and selective LLNDs performed in an expertise center, the lateral local recurrence rate in&#xD;
      rectal cancers with nodes with a short-axis of ≥ 7 mm can be reduced to below 6%.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Local recurrence rates in rectal cancer have reduced dramatically since the introduction of&#xD;
      the total mesorectal excision (TME) technique. These rates have been lowered further with the&#xD;
      use of neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy ((C)RT) regimens in appropriate cases, decreasing&#xD;
      overall rates of 5-year local recurrence to 5-10%. Western surgeons have always relied on&#xD;
      (C)RT to sterilize the lateral compartment, containing the internal iliac and obturator lymph&#xD;
      nodes, alleviating fears of operative morbidity and nerve function disorders associated with&#xD;
      a lateral lymph node dissection (LLND), mainly performed in the East. Furthermore, most&#xD;
      western clinicians consider lateral nodal disease to represent metastatic disease, not&#xD;
      amendable to cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the lateral node study consortium undertook a multi-centre study with 12 centres&#xD;
      from seven countries, collecting data over a 5-year period, including all consecutive&#xD;
      patients operated for a cT3 or T4 rectal cancer. In all patients, every series of MRI's was&#xD;
      re-reviewed by a standardized protocol, examining lateral pelvic nodes, defining these&#xD;
      according to size and the presence of malignant features and relating these to the&#xD;
      development of locally recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first publication of the consortium with a total of 1216 patients, it was shown that&#xD;
      pre-treatment lateral lymph node (LLN) size of ≥7 mm, results in an unacceptably high&#xD;
      incidence of lateral local recurrence of 19.5%, despite (C)RT with TME. Within the&#xD;
      consortium, several centres performed LLND's after (C)RT, which resulted in a significantly&#xD;
      lower rate of lateral local recurrence of 5.7% in nodes ≥7 mm (p = 0.042). Furthermore, LLN&#xD;
      enlargement did not influence distant metastases rate, suggesting it is a local issue which&#xD;
      requires to be addressed through targeted treatment in the pelvis, rather simply representing&#xD;
      a marker of poor prognosis and distant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the value of restaging MRI, patients who underwent (C)RT and had a restaging MRI&#xD;
      were then selected, leaving 741 for analyses: 651 had (C)RT+TME, 90 underwent (C)RT+TME+LLND.&#xD;
      96 patients (14.7%) had nodes ≥7 mm in short-axis on primary MRI (pre-SA). At 3 years after&#xD;
      surgery, there were no lateral local recurrences in 28 patients (29.2%) with nodes that had a&#xD;
      short-axis of ≤ 4 mm on restaging MRI (post-SA). There was an important difference between&#xD;
      the nodes located in the internal iliac compartment versus the ones in the obturator&#xD;
      compartment. In the internal iliac nodes, there was only a 22% chance of becoming ≤ 4 mm.&#xD;
      Pre-SA ≥ 7 mm and post-SA &gt; 4 mm in the internal iliac compartment resulted in a 5-year&#xD;
      lateral local recurrence rate of 52.3%. Adding LLND to (C)RT+TME in these malignant internal&#xD;
      nodes, resulted in a significantly lower 8.7% lateral recurrence rate (p = 0.0071). For the&#xD;
      nodes in the obturator compartment, the chance of becoming ≤ 4 mm was 36%, but even in the&#xD;
      nodes ≤ 6 mm (63%) there was a 0% chance of lateral local recurrence. If the nodes however&#xD;
      remained post-SA &gt; 6 mm, the chance of lateral local recurrence was 17.8%. This was reduced&#xD;
      to 0% after a LLND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major drawback of this multi-center study is its retrospective nature and although the&#xD;
      general guidelines of each center stated that in these types of rectal cancers would always&#xD;
      have the lateral nodal compartments in the irradiation volume, this remains uncertain.&#xD;
      Furthermore, whether these lymph nodes were always included for each individual patient and&#xD;
      whether the node(s) were boosted was impossible to find out. It might be that the internal&#xD;
      iliac were not always included in the irradiation volume, explaining the low response rate&#xD;
      and the high lateral local recurrence rate. Also, although it was reconstructed from the&#xD;
      operation reports that all patients had a complete formal LLND, surgery was not standardized,&#xD;
      not guaranteeing clearance of all nodes with formal anatomical landmarks and boundaries of&#xD;
      the dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to raise national awareness in the Netherlands that even small&#xD;
      lateral nodes (7mm) can cause lateral local recurrence if not treated adequately. The main&#xD;
      question of this study is, whether after standardized and quality controlled irradiation of&#xD;
      the lateral nodes and selective LLND performed in an expertise center, the lateral local&#xD;
      recurrence rate in rectal cancers with nodes with a short-axis of ≥ 7 mm can be reduced to&#xD;
      below 6%.&#xD;
