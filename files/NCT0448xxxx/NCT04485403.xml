  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome occurs in about 10% of women of childbearing age. His pathogenesis&#xD;
      is not fully understood. More and more research concerns the role of chronic inflammation in&#xD;
      these women as the cause of the disease. In vitro studies have shown a significant reduction&#xD;
      in testosterone production by teak cells after ibuprofen. The goal of the project is to use a&#xD;
      low dose of ibuprofen in women with PCOS to lower androgen levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome 1 is diagnosed in about 4-8% of women of childbearing age and&#xD;
      is,therefore one of the most common endocrinopathies. The exact pathogenetic mechanism of&#xD;
      PCOS is not fully discovered. Some women with PCOS have elevated levels of lutropin, which is&#xD;
      considered to be the strongest stimulator of androgen production in ovarian theca cells. A&#xD;
      breakthrough finding was the causal relationship between insulin resistance and&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism in patients with PCOS. Confirmation of the theory that&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia is the cause of hyperandrogenism in these women gave the opportunity to&#xD;
      treat women with PCOS by improving insulin sensitivity. The compartment of ovarian&#xD;
      theca-interstitial cells is responsible for androgen overproduction in women with polycystic&#xD;
      ovary syndrome. The cause of PCOS syndrome is seen in various mechanisms leading to the&#xD;
      proliferation of thecal-interstitial cells. Factors that may affect the ovary in this way may&#xD;
      include hyperinsulinemia, an increase in oxidative stress, exponents of generalized&#xD;
      inflammation, and various cytokines such as TNF-alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective studies performed on women with polycystic ovary syndrome during perimenopause&#xD;
      showed an increased incidence of type II diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and&#xD;
      myocardial infarction compared to the control group. In patients with PCOS, an abnormal,&#xD;
      atherogenic lipid profile was found more often, characterized by increased total cholesterol,&#xD;
      LDL and triglycerides, and decreased HDL fraction. Another risk factor for the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease are disorders in the functioning of vascular endothelial cells. In&#xD;
      women with PCOS, elevated levels of C-reactive protein - a marker of chronic inflammation and&#xD;
      endothelin-1, which are exponents of vascular endothelial disorders, were found. In addition,&#xD;
      the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in women with PCOS is increased by elevated&#xD;
      oxidative stress markers. Cardiometabolic diseases have been shown to be associated with&#xD;
      abnormal vascular endothelial function and chronic inflammation. One of the most important&#xD;
      and common indicators of inflammation is abnormally high levels of CRP. The acute phase&#xD;
      protein is produced by hepatocytes due to stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines such as&#xD;
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα). Increased high sensitivity CRP&#xD;
      (hs-CRP) is considered to be one of the most important predictors of the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. In addition to C-reactive protein, inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokines, including IL-18, monocyte-1 chemotactic protein (MCP-1) and macrophage-1a&#xD;
      inflammatory protein (MIP-1a) play an important role in chronic inflammation. Interleukin-18&#xD;
      appears to be associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome and has prognostic&#xD;
      value for cardiovascular death. An increased C-reactive protein concentration was found in&#xD;
      the group of women with PCOS. In 2011, the latest meta-analysis confirming the increased&#xD;
      concentration of hsCRP was presented. Increased IL-18 levels were observed in women with&#xD;
      polycystic ovary syndrome, which correlated with obesity and total testosterone levels.&#xD;
      Individual studies have also shown an increase in the concentration of monocyte-1 chemotactic&#xD;
      protein (MCP-1) in these women. In 2005, Orio et al. Showed a significantly elevated white&#xD;
      blood cell (WBC) concentration in a group of 150 women with PCOS. Oxidative stress and&#xD;
      chronic inflammation are closely related and form a vicious circle concept in which&#xD;
      inflammation generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), while oxidative stress promotes and&#xD;
      exacerbates inflammation. The first report documenting increased oxidative stress in women&#xD;
      with PCOS was published in 2001 by Sabuncu. It was assessed by lipid peroxidation, which was&#xD;
      significantly higher in PCOS and positively correlated with BMI, insulin concentration and&#xD;
      blood pressure. In reference to these risks for women with PCOS - last, the latest and most&#xD;
      arousing emotions pathogenetic theory this team is chronic inflammation probably caused by&#xD;
      the improper composition of bacterial microflora microbiota. However, there are many&#xD;
      undiscovered interrelationship mechanisms between inflammation and endocrine disorders. One&#xD;
      of the theories may be the role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) released from Gram (-) bacteria&#xD;
      and adversely affecting metabolic functions, and above all insulin resistance. In 2012, a&#xD;
      paper was published in which a correlation between LPS binding protein and metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      and inflammatory markers was demonstrated. The second hypothesis is the induction of chronic&#xD;
      inflammation through specific pathogens. Microorganisms such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori are associated with chronic inflammation and cardiovascular disease. In&#xD;
      particular, Chlamydia pneumoniae infection correlates with the presence of atherosclerosis&#xD;
      and even acute myocardial infarction, and chronic inflammatory processes associated with&#xD;
      periodontal disease are associated with cardiovascular risk. The theory of specific&#xD;
      microorganisms probably remains the most controversial and least studied concept between PCOS&#xD;
      and chronic infection. Morin-Papunen et al. Observed a higher amount of IgG Chlamydia&#xD;
      pneumonia and Chlamydia trachomatis and hsCRP in women with no ovulation and hirsutism than&#xD;
      in the control group. In another study, the amount of Helico-bacterial pylori was more common&#xD;
      in women with PCOS than in the age-matched control group. In 2011, Dursun published a paper&#xD;
      on periodontal infection in women with PCOS compared to a control group of the same age and&#xD;
      comparable body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new hypothesis for the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome is based on the&#xD;
      assumption that ibuprofen inhibits the proliferation of ovarian theca-intestinal cells,&#xD;
      lowers streroidogenesis, and additionally has a positive effect on insulin and reduces&#xD;
      oxidative stress. Ibuprofen is a medicament from the group of NSAID used for the purpose of&#xD;
      reducing the state zap a cast and analgesic dosage depends on the indication and the&#xD;
      patient's condition. For non-prescription oral ibuprofen, the maximum daily dose is 1.2 g and&#xD;
      has a good safety profile. Under the supervision of a physician and on his behalf, in some&#xD;
      indications, higher doses are used, even up to 3.2 g per day. Low risk of gastrointestinal,&#xD;
      hepatorenal and other complications has been demonstrated. Some, but not all, studies show a&#xD;
      slightly increased cardiovascular risk, but in general, all complications occur less&#xD;
      frequently than when using diclofenac or coxib. Ibuprofen in over-the-counter doses has a low&#xD;
      risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications and the development of kidney problems&#xD;
      and heart disease. Irreversible liver damage is not observed in patients using it, as it&#xD;
      sometimes occurs in patients using paracetamol or aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ibuprofen in women with PCOS may improve the endocrine and metabolic profile which&#xD;
      may reduce the risk associated with cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms of action of ibuprofen that gave rise to use in the treatment of PCOS are as&#xD;
      follows :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro Ibuprofen inhibits the genes that regulate androgen production ( CYP11 , CYP17 and&#xD;
      HSD ) Ibuprofen inhibits the expression of key genes regulating androgen synthesis by IL-1β&#xD;
      and LPS Ibuprofen attenuates the stimulating effect of IL-1β on the growth of theca cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project goals A. Assessment of the effect of ibuprofen on the endocrine and metabolic profile&#xD;
      in women with PCOS B. The effect of ibuprofen on chronic inflammation in women with PCOS&#xD;
&#xD;
      C Recruitment of the patients for testing is scheduled for a period of one year. Will be&#xD;
      based on the classification of patients into three-week application of the ibuprofen, and&#xD;
      assessing the effects of the use of this drug in the daw which 8 00 mg/day ( 2 x 4 00mg) for&#xD;
      3 weeks in women with a bodyweight &lt;70 kg, and a dose of 1200 mg/day (3x400mg) in women&#xD;
      weighing&gt; 70kg. The effects of treatment will be compared on the basis of changes in the&#xD;
      hormonal profile and inflammatory markers, as well as the clinical assessment of the patient.&#xD;
