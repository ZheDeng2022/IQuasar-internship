      This is an epidemiological, single-country, multicenter, 2-year prospective cohort study&#xD;
      based on both primary and secondary data collection, which will include a representative&#xD;
      sample of 300 eligible T2DM patients managed in real-life settings in Greece. A&#xD;
      cross-sectional approach will be applied for addressing the primary objective of the study&#xD;
      (prevalence of HF) and for determining potential predictors associated with HF stage and the&#xD;
      presence of symptomatic HF at enrollment, whereas the prospective cohort phase will capture&#xD;
      the 2-year incidence rate of progression to symptomatic HF as well the long-term outcomes of&#xD;
      interest. Τhe study will be conducted and reported as per the Good Pharmacoepidemiology&#xD;
      Practice and the local rules and regulations. The study will be carried out by approximately&#xD;
      8 cardiology departments that are HF centers of excellence. In addition, aiming at&#xD;
      facilitating recruitment, a referral network will be formed comprising endocrinologists,&#xD;
      diabetologists, internists and general practitioners treating DM and practicing at the&#xD;
      private healthcare sector or at public health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study duration is expected to be 32 months, including an 8-month recruitment&#xD;
      period and a 24-month observation period per patient. Εach patient will be followed for up to&#xD;
      24 months, or until death, withdrawal of consent, or physician's decision for patient&#xD;
      withdrawal, whichever occurs earlier. Follow-up visit frequency will be determined by the&#xD;
      participating Investigators, however study-related data will be collected at enrollment and&#xD;
      at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month data collection timepoints post-enrollment. Data collection at&#xD;
      enrollment, and at 6 and 24 months post-enrollment will be performed in the context of&#xD;
      on-site routine clinical visits at the hospital sites whereas data collection at 12 and 18&#xD;
      months will be performed through telephone contacts.&#xD;

      Background/Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure (HF) is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and one&#xD;
      of the most common urgent cardiovascular (CV) presentations in patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (DM). The incidence of HF is higher in adults with DM than in those without. In&#xD;
      addition, among patients with HF, those diagnosed with DM have a higher risk of CV death or&#xD;
      hospitalization for HF (HHF). As a result of the intersection of DM, atherosclerotic CV&#xD;
      disease, and HF, the importance of determining diabetes therapies that are not only safe but&#xD;
      also effective in reducing CV risk is paramount. Recently, three large randomized trials have&#xD;
      shown that sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, used for the treatment of&#xD;
      DM, significantly reduced the risk for HHF. In addition, recent evidence indicates the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in terms of reducing the risk of&#xD;
      worsening HF or CV-related death in patients with established HF and a reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction, regardless of the presence or absence of DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), patients with&#xD;
      DM have at least stage A HF; thus, early identification of patients at higher risk and prompt&#xD;
      intervention with medical treatments may not only provide symptomatic relief but also delay&#xD;
      the development of HF. In view of the scarce epidemiological data regarding the&#xD;
      classification of HF stages among diabetics and the fact that imaging and circulating&#xD;
      biomarkers could be of significant prognostic value, there is an eminent need for&#xD;
      comprehensive phenotypic characterization of high-risk patients that could provide valuable&#xD;
      insight to support the optimal care transition and timely referral of patients with&#xD;
      unrecognized HF who fit a particular profile to HF specialists for appropriate diagnostic&#xD;
      evaluation and planning of optimal treatment and follow-up care. In light of the above, this&#xD;
      epidemiological study aims to generate novel real-world data on the prevalence and evolution&#xD;
      of HF stages as well as to explore potential determinants of the development of symptomatic&#xD;
      HF, among patients diagnosed with type 2 DM (T2DM) in the past 5 years who are at high CV&#xD;
      risk, in Greece. This study, complemented with cardiac imaging and circulating biomarkers&#xD;
      data, could provide the necessary data for the creation of an algorithm for the selection of&#xD;
      a high-risk population that could draw a greater benefit from medical interventions.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the study will attempt to measure the burden of HF- and CV-related healthcare&#xD;
      resource utilisation (HCRU) by HF stage and to capture the impact of symptomatic HF on&#xD;
      patient-perceived health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is not planned to reject or affirm any formal statistical hypothesis. It is noted&#xD;
      that the term 'overall study population' used in the objectives below encompasses high CV&#xD;
      risk T2DM patients undiagnosed with HF at study enrollment who fulfil the study eligibility&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of&#xD;
      previously undiagnosed, symptomatic (clinically overt) HF and to determine the distribution&#xD;
      of HF stages (as defined by the ACC/AHA classification) in the overall study population and&#xD;
      by New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the evolution of HF stages and of the severity of functional limitation&#xD;
           imposed by HF (as assessed by NYHA classification) over the 2-year observation period in&#xD;
           the overall study population and by HF stage at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the incidence of symptomatic HF over the 2-year observation period in the&#xD;
           study subpopulation with preclinical HF (Stages A and B) at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the rate of progression from asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction&#xD;
           (Stage B) at enrollment to symptomatic HF, in the study subpopulation with HF Stage B at&#xD;
           enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the baseline clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic profile in the&#xD;
           overall study population and by HF stage at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To capture the patient-perceived impact of HF on health status (symptoms, function, and&#xD;
           quality of life) and to measure the change in health status from enrollment at 6 and 24&#xD;
           months post-enrollment using the short version of the HF-specific Kansas City&#xD;
           Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12) in the study subpopulation diagnosed with&#xD;
           symptomatic HF (Stage C) at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the HF- and CV-related HCRU in terms of inpatient and outpatient healthcare&#xD;
           encounters and use of medical procedures/interventions/tests over the 2-year observation&#xD;
           period in the overall study population and by HF stage at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify which baseline clinical, echocardiographic and biochemical parameters of&#xD;
           interest are associated with the HF stage at enrollment and to determine potential&#xD;
           predictors of symptomatic HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify baseline clinical, echocardiographic and biochemical parameters that are&#xD;
           associated with progression from preclinical to symptomatic HF, in the study&#xD;
           subpopulation with preclinical HF at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore whether the change in NT-proBNP level from enrollment to 6 months can serve&#xD;
           as a possible predictor for HF- and CV-related morbidity and mortality outcomes in the&#xD;
           overall study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify number of patients who experience an acute kidney injury event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore changes in eGFR during the study observation period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an epidemiological, single-country, multicenter, 2-year prospective cohort study&#xD;
      based on both primary and secondary data collection, which will include a representative&#xD;
      sample of 300 eligible T2DM patients managed in real-life settings in Greece. A&#xD;
      cross-sectional approach will be applied for addressing the primary objective of the study&#xD;
      (prevalence of HF) and for determining potential predictors associated with HF stage and the&#xD;
      presence of symptomatic HF at enrollment, whereas the prospective cohort phase will capture&#xD;
      the 2-year incidence rate of progression to symptomatic HF as well the long-term outcomes of&#xD;
      interest. Τhe study will be conducted and reported as per the Good Pharmacoepidemiology&#xD;
      Practice and the local rules and regulations. The study will be carried out by approximately&#xD;
      8 cardiology departments that are HF centers of excellence. In addition, aiming at&#xD;
      facilitating recruitment, a referral network will be formed comprising endocrinologists,&#xD;
      diabetologists, internists and general practitioners treating DM and practicing at the&#xD;
      private healthcare sector or at public health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study duration is expected to be 32 months, including an 8-month recruitment&#xD;
      period and a 24-month observation period per patient. Εach patient will be followed for up to&#xD;
      24 months, or until death, withdrawal of consent, or physician's decision for patient&#xD;
      withdrawal, whichever occurs earlier. Follow-up visit frequency will be determined by the&#xD;
      participating Investigators, however study-related data will be collected at enrollment and&#xD;
      at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month data collection timepoints post-enrollment. Data collection at&#xD;
      enrollment, and at 6 and 24 months post-enrollment will be performed in the context of&#xD;
      on-site routine clinical visits at the hospital sites whereas data collection at 12 and 18&#xD;
      months will be performed through telephone contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Source(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be carried through a web-based data capture system (eCRF). Primary data&#xD;
      -which will be obtained at enrollment and prospectively during the study visits/contacts as&#xD;
      performed per standard clinical practice or through patient self-report- will mainly be&#xD;
      employed. Data regarding the patient-perceived health status will be collected through&#xD;
      completion of the KCCQ-12 instrument at enrollment and at 6 and 24 months post-enrollment.&#xD;
      Data regarding the patient's medical, DM- and CV-related history will be abstracted from&#xD;
      patients' medicals records and patient self-report, where applicable. Clinical decisions&#xD;
      concerning the optimum diabetes, HF and CV risk management strategy for a particular patient&#xD;
      are taken independently of and/or prior to any decision by the physician to invite a patient&#xD;
      to participate in the study. The medications administered for T2DM, HF, CV diseases and any&#xD;
      underlying CV risk factors will be recorded and presented only by drug classes.&#xD;
