  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single institution pilot study is to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing an eHealth prostate cancer surveillance program through the eVisit electronic&#xD;
      medical record patient portal. The investigators will assess patient compliance and&#xD;
      satisfaction with eVisit follow up care in lieu of in person clinic visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telehealth offers the opportunity to transform cancer surveillance into a patient-centered&#xD;
      effort with shared leadership between patient and oncologist. Peer-to-peer electronic&#xD;
      communications can improve the collaboration between oncologist and primary care provider&#xD;
      (PCP) as patients transition back to primary care as their primary health provider. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to test a patient-centered eHealth surveillance program utilizing novel&#xD;
      asynchronous telehealth tools to provide patient-reported outcome symptom monitoring using&#xD;
      the electronic medical record's patient portal (eVisit).&#xD;
