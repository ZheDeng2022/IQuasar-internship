  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine if implementing structured exercises prevent&#xD;
      decline in muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function in men with prostate cancer&#xD;
      undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Our main hypothesis is that structured&#xD;
      resistance exercise training in men undergoing ADT will preserve physical function assessed&#xD;
      by loaded stair climbing power compared with the control group. The trial will also examine&#xD;
      the efficacy of the exercise regimen on muscle strength, QOL and fatigue. The findings of&#xD;
      this trial will lay the groundwork for definitive intervention trials to prevent frailty and&#xD;
      falls in these men.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled, parallel group trial of 6-months duration is determining the&#xD;
      efficacy of structured resistance exercise training in preventing the decline in physical&#xD;
      function in older men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). It&#xD;
      will compare the structured resistance exercise training with a control group of men&#xD;
      undergoing flexibility and balance exercises training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men undergoing ADT for treatment of their prostate cancer experience a significant decline in&#xD;
      muscle mass and muscle strength, which impacts their physical function. This predisposes them&#xD;
      to frailty and a higher risk of falls. In addition to physical dysfunction, men undergoing&#xD;
      ADT also experience a significant decrease in health-related quality of life and experience&#xD;
      fatigue (tiredness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is taking a preventative approach to the physical function problems in&#xD;
      men with prostate cancer by implementing exercise interventions before participants begin ADT&#xD;
      that are specifically designed to improve muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function&#xD;
      to lessen the impacts of muscle mass and strength decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a screening visit during which the following procedures will be conducted:&#xD;
      Vitals, EKG, blood sample collection and a physical to determine eligibility. If qualified,&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to two different types of structured exercises:&#xD;
      Resistance exercise training or flexibility and balance exercises. During the weekly exercise&#xD;
      training 20 subjects will be assigned to the Exercise A group and 20 subjects to the Exercise&#xD;
      B group. The exercise training sessions will occur approximately 2 times/week. In addition&#xD;
      participants will also undergo DEXA scans, perform muscle strength testing and complete&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline, 3- and 6-month visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected participants will be in this research study for up to 6 months. It is expected&#xD;
      that about 40 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
