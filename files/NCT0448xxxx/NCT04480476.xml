  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi center, retrospective, chart review study to document the evolution of ocular&#xD;
      disease progression in pediatric patients with CLN2.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLN2 is a rare disease with limited available ocular natural history data. While current&#xD;
      standard of care slows motor degeneration, it is not known to treat the ocular manifestations&#xD;
      of disease. This study is planned to document, through retrospective data collection, ocular&#xD;
      disease progression in children with a clinical presentation consistent with CLN2. No&#xD;
      investigational product is administered in this retrospective, chart review study.&#xD;
