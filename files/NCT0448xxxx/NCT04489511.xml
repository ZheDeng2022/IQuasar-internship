  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, active treatment study in approximately 12 subjects aged&#xD;
      18 to 55 years (inclusive) with STGD1, genotyped with a minimum of two ABCA4 gene mutations.&#xD;
      Treatment course of STG-001 at Dose 1 (Cohort 1) or Dose 2 (Cohort 2) testing doses will be&#xD;
      administered once daily for 28 days. Cohorts will run in parallel. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      their designated dose daily for 28 days and be monitored for safety measures during the&#xD;
      dosing period and for an additional 28 days after dosing (through Day 56).&#xD;
