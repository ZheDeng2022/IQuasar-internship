      1. Background: According to Global Cancer Statistics of International Agency for Research&#xD;
           on Cancer under World Health Organization, stomach cancer is the fifth most common&#xD;
           cancer as there were over 1 million new cases in 2018 and the third leading cause of&#xD;
           cancer death by 783,000 people are estimated to die of stomach cancer. In Korea, gastric&#xD;
           cancer is the most frequent cancer in 13.3% of all cancer cases by the report of Korea&#xD;
           Central Cancer Registry in 2018. Since 2010, adjuvant chemotherapy with advanced gastric&#xD;
           cancer stage 2 and stage 3 patients following gastrectomy has become a standard&#xD;
           treatment through clinical validation of increasing the patient's survival rate.&#xD;
           However, even in the second and third stages of the same stomach cancer, the biological&#xD;
           properties may be different.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The nProfiler® 1 Stomach Cancer Assay is a molecular diagnostic test to predict the&#xD;
           prognosis for patients with stage Ⅱ-Ⅲ advanced gastric cancer. This study will evaluate&#xD;
           the clinical utility of nProfiler® 1 Stomach Cancer Assay by recruiting subjects from&#xD;
           multi centers and observing the 5-year survival rates of Low risk, Intermediate risk,&#xD;
           High risk according to gastric cancer prognostic molecular diagnostic test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Obtaining of informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Review of provider's eligibility/ Sample preparation and delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sample criteria evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subject enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gastric cancer prognostic prediction molecular diagnostic test&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prognostic group result report&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  5-yr survival follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following efficacy outcome measures will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary efficacy outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
           :High risk and low risk group's 5-yr Overall Survival(OS) rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary efficacy outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  High risk and Low risk group's 3-yr Disease Free Survival(DFS) rate&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intermediate risk group's 5-yr OS and 3-yr DFS rate&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subgroup analysis : Adjuvant chemotherapy benefit of Low risk (5-yr OS rate, 3 yr&#xD;
                DFS rate)&#xD;
