  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, single-arm,&#xD;
      observational, post-market surveillance (PS) study of the Ellipsys Vascular Access System in&#xD;
      subjects eligible for arteriovenous (AV) fistula.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this post-market surveillance study is to support the short-term&#xD;
      safety of the device and procedure and further assess long-term safety and effectiveness in&#xD;
      subjects treated by newly trained providers of the Ellipsys Vascular Access System in the&#xD;
      creation of a native AV fistula via percutaneous access in subjects who are on hemodialysis&#xD;
      and are medically indicated for the creation of an upper limb anastomosis.&#xD;
