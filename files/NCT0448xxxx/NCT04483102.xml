  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, clinical trial of discarded liver transplants that&#xD;
      have received normothermic machine perfusion (NMP), compared with standard cold preservation&#xD;
      liver transplants. The discarded livers rejected by all other centers and meeting pre-NMP&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will receive NMP using the OrganOx速 metra device. The NMP-treated liver&#xD;
      that meets the viability criteria will be transplanted to patients who are eligible and&#xD;
      consented to the study. Liver transplant outcomes will be ascertained during 12 months&#xD;
      post-transplantation. The results of the trial will be compared with those of contemporary&#xD;
      comparison groups of patients who received the standard criteria donor liver transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, non-randomized, clinical trial to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of successful transplantation of NMP-treated livers to patients. First, up to 71&#xD;
      marginal livers declined for transplantation will be treated with NMP using the OrganOx速&#xD;
      metra device and tested for viability using previously defined criteria. NMP-treated viable&#xD;
      livers will be subsequently transplanted to patients (n=5 in the 1st stage; additional 10&#xD;
      transplantation in the 2nd stage; additional 10 transplantation in the 3rd stage: total&#xD;
      N=25). Patients will be closely followed for clinical outcomes of the transplantation during&#xD;
      6 months post-transplantation. The follow-up will also be extended up to 1 year&#xD;
      post-transplantation. The trial will compare the results to those of three comparison groups&#xD;
      - 1) matched patients who received liver transplantation at Washington University/Barnes&#xD;
      Jewish Hospital; 2) matched patients who received DBD liver transplantation in the OPTN/UNOS&#xD;
      database; and 3) matched patients who received DCD liver transplantation in the OPTN/UNOS&#xD;
      database. Given that patient safety is the priority, the trial uses a multi-stage design in&#xD;
      which the study stops earlier when NMP-treated liver transplantation is observed to be&#xD;
      ineffective (see trial schema in Section 3.1).&#xD;
