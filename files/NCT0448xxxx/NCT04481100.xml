      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy combined with Itraconazole in patients with locally adcvanced esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (ESCC) is the predominant type in China, accounting for over 90% of all esophageal cancer.&#xD;
      Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) remains the standard therapy of locally advanced&#xD;
      ESCC. However, the outcome remains poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aberrant activation of Hedgehog (HH) signaling is associated with a variety of human&#xD;
      malignancies. Previous studies found that the reactivation of HH pathway occurs in 60% of&#xD;
      esophageal cancer. Targeting the Hh pathway for cancer therapy was expected to work wonders&#xD;
      in Hh-dependent cancers. Itraconazole, an antifungal agent, has been shown to inhibit the Hh&#xD;
      and AKT signaling pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      combined with Itraconazole in patients with locally adcvanced esophageal squamous cancer&#xD;
