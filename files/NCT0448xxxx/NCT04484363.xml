  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the expanded access program are adults with higher-risk myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndromes who have no other treatment options available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this program is to allow participants to have access to pevonedistat before&#xD;
      FDA approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program will take place in the United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access program in which the drug being tested is called pevonedistat,&#xD;
      which is used in combination with azcitidine. This study will provide expanded access of&#xD;
      pevonedistat (in combination with azacitidine) for the first-line treatment to participants&#xD;
      with HR-MDS and option of real world data (RWD) collection for the benefit of future&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive azacitidine via intravenous or subcutaneous route in&#xD;
      combination with pevonedistat intravenous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participant will continue&#xD;
      treatment until benefit is no longer derived from the treatment (that is, until disease&#xD;
      progression, or treatment is no longer tolerable), the benefit-risk no longer favors the&#xD;
      individual, an appropriate alternative therapy becomes available, the participant chooses to&#xD;
      discontinue the treatment, or pevonedistat becomes commercially available.&#xD;

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has never been treated with Azacitidine, or, has been treated with Azacitidine, two or&#xD;
             fewer cycles of Azacitidine have been administered, and has not relapsed while being&#xD;
             treated with Azacitidine or failed Azacitidine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             hepatitis B surface antibody) must have an undetectable hepatitis B viral load.&#xD;
             Participants who have positive hepatitis C antibody may be included if they have an&#xD;
             undetectable hepatitis C viral load.&#xD;
