      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are rare tumors that originate in neuroendocrine cells. NENs&#xD;
      can affect almost any part of the body. People with low-grade tumors can live many years. But&#xD;
      high-grade tumors can be very aggressive. Researchers want to learn more about this type of&#xD;
      cancer. This may help them design better treatments and supportive care studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain a better understanding of neuroendocrine neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People starting at age 3 and older who have or are suspected of having NENs and are enrolled&#xD;
      in protocol 19C0016, Natural History and Biospecimen Acquisition Study for Children and&#xD;
      Adults with Rare Solid Tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with questions about their medical history. This may be done&#xD;
      over the telephone or in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants medical records, test results, and imaging results will be reviewed. They may&#xD;
      have scans and blood tests. They may sign a separate consent form for some of the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete paper or electronic surveys. The surveys will ask about the&#xD;
      effects of cancer on their wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give samples of their tumors from previous surgeries or biopsies. These&#xD;
      samples will be used to study their tumor genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get advice on how to manage their NENs. They will also get recommendations&#xD;
      about potential treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants home doctors will be contacted every 6 to 12 months. They will give medical data&#xD;
      such as imaging and test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have follow-up visits at NIH every 6 to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will contact researchers if there are any changes in their tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed on this study for life.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuroendocrine neoplasm (NENs) are divided into neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and&#xD;
           neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). These are rare malignancies occurring for example in&#xD;
           the gastrointestinal tract, islets of the pancreas, lung, adrenal medulla, thyroid&#xD;
           C-cells, etc. and are heterogeneous group of neoplasms with unique tumor biology,&#xD;
           natural history, and clinical management issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their incidence has increased over the last decade, with an incidence of 6 per 100,000&#xD;
           persons a year and they represent 0.46% of all malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most NETs are sporadic, but they can be part of familial cancer syndromes such as&#xD;
           multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or Von&#xD;
           Hippel- Lindau (VHL) syndrome. Whereas poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas&#xD;
           (NECs) are all high-grade carcinomas that resemble small cell carcinoma or large cell&#xD;
           carcinoma of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment for localized NETs is surgical resection, however, a variety of therapeutic&#xD;
           options are available for patients with advanced NETs. When to apply a given option,&#xD;
           what combination therapeutic approach should be used, how long treatment should be&#xD;
           continued should be used is unclear and controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Characterize the natural history of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). Data will include&#xD;
      clinical presentation, patterns of disease progression, response or lack of response to&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions, disease recurrence and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with confirmed or suspicion of NENs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 3 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol is a subprotocol of protocol 19C0016 Natural History and Biospecimen&#xD;
           Accrual Study for Children and Adults with Rare Solid Tumors . After enrollment on the&#xD;
           master protocol and undergoing evaluations detailed in the master protocol, patients&#xD;
           will be enrolled on this subprotocol specific for NENs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical histories will be documented, and patients followed throughout the course of&#xD;
           their illnesses, with particular attention to patterns of disease recurrence and&#xD;
           progression, response to therapies, duration of responses and hormone production in&#xD;
           patients with hormone production as a manifestation of their disease. Tumor growth rates&#xD;
           will also be calculated throughout the course of the disease.&#xD;
