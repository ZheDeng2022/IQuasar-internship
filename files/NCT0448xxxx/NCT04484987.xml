  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary manipulation that involves restricting food intake&#xD;
      to 6-12 h/day with no energy intake the rest of the day. In rodents, TRE improves metabolic&#xD;
      function without caloric restriction, potentially by activating nutrient sensing mechanisms&#xD;
      and effects on circadian oscillations. However, an understanding of the effect of TRE on&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health in people is not clear and few studies have evaluated this issue.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial in people&#xD;
      with obesity and prediabetes to determine the effect of 9 h TRE for 12 weeks, without a&#xD;
      change in body weight, on key metabolic outcomes that are risk factors for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD): 1) multi-organ insulin sensitivity; 2) 24 h metabolic homeostasis and diurnal&#xD;
      rhythm; and 3) adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biology. The proposed studies will&#xD;
      elucidate the cardiometabolic implications of TRE in people with obesity and prediabetes.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The final dataset will primarily include data collected specifically for the study, but it will also contain some demographic information and historical data regarding family history of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Upon publication of the primary manuscript, we will consider requests to make the study-related data and relevant demographic information (such as ethnicity) available to other investigators. The final dataset, which will not include subject names, will be further stripped of any other unique identifiers and prepared in accordance with all HIPAA regulations prior to release for sharing. No unique subject characteristics will be included in any reports generated by use of the data.</ipd_description>
