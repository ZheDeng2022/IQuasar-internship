  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal disease in the critically ill patient is a serious complication that&#xD;
      increases hospitalization times, morbidity and mortality, and healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team proposes a retrospective observational study of patients from the resuscitation unit&#xD;
      of the Hospital la Fe who during the years 2016-2019 presented invasive candidiasis. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to detect if there are possible specific risk factors that favor the&#xD;
      development of invasive candidiasis in colonized patients and if these associated risk&#xD;
      factors could be considered as 'triggers' or alerts for the implementation of specific care&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, the investigators intend to study the blood samples taken from patients, taking&#xD;
      into account different types of perioperative variables from them, which will be&#xD;
      statistically analyzed, so that evidence-based inferences can be drawn to demonstrate our&#xD;
      hypothesis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that there are factors predisposing to the development of invasive fungal&#xD;
      disease, invasive candidiasis, and that the detection of these factors may allow detecting&#xD;
      the population at risk and implementing both pharmacological measures and general strategies&#xD;
      to reduce the mortality of fungal infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine if candida auris is associated with increased risk of&#xD;
      mortality in invasive fungal disease and the risk factors for mortality in the invasive&#xD;
      fungal disease, including the species of candida that causes this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of predictors of mortality in invasive fungal disease. Prepare and validate a&#xD;
      score in our environment that allows discriminating those patients with a high risk of&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the pharmacological management that has been carried out in patients who develop&#xD;
      candidemia due to auris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detect hospital stays of both population groups, in terms of health management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: observational, longitudinal, and retrospective study of cases and controls of&#xD;
      a selected exposed population that developed the disease over time or not.&#xD;
