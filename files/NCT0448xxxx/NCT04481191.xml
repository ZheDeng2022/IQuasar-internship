    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of concomitant administration of&#xD;
      RotaTeq® (V260) and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV) in Chinese infants. Its primary&#xD;
      objective is to demonstrate that the immunogenicity of IPV in the concomitant-use group is&#xD;
      non-inferior to the immunogenicity of IPV in the staggered-use group. The hypothesis to be&#xD;
      tested is: The seroconversion percentage at 1 month post dose 3 for poliovirus types 1, 2,&#xD;
      and 3 in the concomitant-use group is non-inferior to those of the staggered-use group.&#xD;
