  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to investigate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of AZD2693, following subcutaneous (SC) administration of multiple&#xD;
      ascending doses in participants with Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis Stage&#xD;
      0 to 3 and homozygous for the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) 148M&#xD;
      risk allele.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study in&#xD;
      participants with NASH and fibrosis stage between F0 (no fibrosis) and F3 (bridging&#xD;
      fibrosis), and who are homozygous for the PNPLA3 148M risk allele.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An optional Pre Screening Visit may be completed to determine PNPLA3 genotype and&#xD;
           collect minimal baseline data and only participants homozygous for rs738409 will&#xD;
           continue the study and enter the Screening Period. The Pre-Screening Visit is optional&#xD;
           and sites may proceed with full screening if this is preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Period with a maximum of 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An 8-week dosing period during which participants will be resident of the study site for&#xD;
           Dose 1 and Dose 3. Dose 1 will have participants reside at the study site from the day&#xD;
           prior to study intervention administration (Day -1) until at least 2 days after study&#xD;
           intervention administration with discharge on Day 3. Dose 2 will be administered at the&#xD;
           study site on Day 29 with no overnight stay. Dose 3 will have participants reside at the&#xD;
           study site from the day prior to study intervention administration (Day 56) until at&#xD;
           least 2 days after study intervention administration with discharge on Day 59. All study&#xD;
           interventions and PD assessments will be administered after a 10 hour fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant will be followed for 15 weeks post last dose (approximately 5× t½; t½&#xD;
           is estimated to approximately 22 days); however, the length of follow-up may be&#xD;
           shortened or extended if the actual t½ is considerably shorter or longer than predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at up to 30 study sites in the United States (US) and up to 5&#xD;
      study sites in Mexico. Approximately 60 participants comprised of male participants and&#xD;
      female participants of non-childbearing potential will be randomized into the first 3 cohorts&#xD;
      of this study in order to achieve 48 evaluable participants.&#xD;
