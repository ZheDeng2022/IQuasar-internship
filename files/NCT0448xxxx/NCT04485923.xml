  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In general, 50-90% of patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia are known to&#xD;
      develop hypothermia during surgery. Due to hypothermia during surgery, the patient may cause&#xD;
      coagulation disorders, wound infections, increased ventricular tachycardia, prolonged&#xD;
      anesthesia drug effects, and electrification, resulting in delayed recovery after surgery,&#xD;
      extended recovery room exit, and extended hospital stay. Therefore, unless intentional&#xD;
      hypothermia is needed, active body temperature management during surgery is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary artery, distal esophagus, tympanic membrane, nasopharynx, oral cavity, axillary&#xD;
      cavity, rectum, and bladder can be measured. The most accurate method for measuring deep body&#xD;
      temperature in general anesthesia is esophageal body temperature, nasopharyngeal body&#xD;
      temperature, It is known as tympanic body temperature. 3,4 However, the tympanic body&#xD;
      temperature has the disadvantage that it cannot be continuously measured. Considering these&#xD;
      points, esophageal thermometers that can be continuously measured in patients with general&#xD;
      anesthesia and have few side effects are commonly used. The esophageal thermometer is usually&#xD;
      inserted through the oral cavity. When the supraglottic airway device is inserted, the space&#xD;
      in the oral cavity is filled with the supraglottic airway device, making it difficult to&#xD;
      mount the esophageal thermometer. However, most second-generation supraglottic airway devices&#xD;
      have gastric lumens, and gastric lumens are connected to the esophagus, allowing esophageal&#xD;
      thermometers to be mounted through this space. Since the esophageal temperature probe is&#xD;
      inserted in all general anesthesia patients using the supraglottic airway device in this&#xD;
      application, the body temperature measured by the temporal artery at the same time is how&#xD;
      accurate the body temperature measured at this time is as a reference value using the&#xD;
      tympanic membrane. I would like to analyze the transient comparison. We will also analyze&#xD;
      whether the esophageal thermometer mounted through the gastric lumen of the supraglottic&#xD;
      airway device reflects the rapidly decreasing body temperature change when the pneumatic&#xD;
      tourniquet is decompressed.&#xD;

      Basic anesthesia management is the same as for patients undergoing general anesthesia using&#xD;
      all supraglottic airway devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting from midnight the day before surgery, and when the patient enters the operating room,&#xD;
      a blood pressure monitor, electrocardiogram, pulse saturator is mounted, and baseline blood&#xD;
      pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate are recorded. As an anesthesia-inducing facial&#xD;
      mask, it provides 100% of 4-6L/min of oxygen. Propofol is administered at 2 mg/kg, and after&#xD;
      the patient's self-breathing is lost, 5% sevoflurane is supplied for 3 minutes to deepen the&#xD;
      depth of anesthesia. After inserting the appropriate size of supraglottic airway (i-gel)&#xD;
      according to the patient's weight, the esophageal temperature probe is inserted through the&#xD;
      gastric lumen to the end of the supraglottic airway device i-gel. After 10 minutes, when the&#xD;
      body temperature measurement measured in the esophagus stabilizes, the body temperature is&#xD;
      measured at the tympanic membrane and temporal artery at 10-minute intervals. For the&#xD;
      objectivity of body temperature measurement, the same operator performs it, and the left and&#xD;
      right sides of the tympanic membrane can be measured differently, so both sides are measured&#xD;
      and averaged. After Tourniquet deflation, body temperature is measured and recorded every 10&#xD;
      minutes from 10 minutes.&#xD;
