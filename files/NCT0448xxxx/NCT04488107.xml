    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open, single arm clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and antitumor activity of FCN-437c in combination with letrozole in postmenopausal women with&#xD;
      ER + / HER2 - advanced breast cancer, and to evaluate the PK characteristics of FCN-437c&#xD;
      monotherapy and combined therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The single drug administration period (7 days) . The continuous administration period made up&#xD;
      of 21 days of continuous administration, followed by 7 days of withdrawal, which made up of&#xD;
      28 days as a treatment cycle. The evaluation was conducted every 8 weeks until one of the&#xD;
      following happened, disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, the researcher's&#xD;
      decision or the patients' voluntary withdrawal from the study. The follow-up visit was&#xD;
      conducted 30 days after the last administration. The telephone follow-up was conducted once&#xD;
      every 3 months until the end of the study to record the survival period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the expansion period, FCN-437c was continuous administration per day for 21 days, followed&#xD;
      by 7 days of withdrawal, making a treatment cycle of 28 days during which letrozole was&#xD;
      continuously administrated 2.5 mg QD. Evaluation was conducted every 8 weeks until one of the&#xD;
      following occurred, disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, decision of the&#xD;
      researcher or patients' voluntary withdrawal of the study. Follow up visit was conducted 30&#xD;
      days after the last administration, followed by the survival period telephone follow-up every&#xD;
      3 months until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of of the study was defined as the last patient in the dose expansion stage took the&#xD;
      treatment for more than one year, or terminated the treatment (depending on which occurred&#xD;
      earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, patients with no disease progression were determined to continue&#xD;
      taking FCN-437c according to the clinical benefits.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study plans to start dose escalating from 50 mg, followed by 100, 200, 300, 450, and 600 mg as tentatively designated escalating dose groups. After the initial dose group, it is allowed to adjust the subsequent dose level according to the test data, but it will not exceed 100% dose increment. After the completion of DLT observation in each group, the next dose group and the number of cases were determined according to the safety, efficacy and PK data of the dose group. The traditional &quot;3+3&quot; method was used in the design of dose escalating stage, and the improved Fibonacci series was used for the dose increasing stage.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Letrozole is the latest generation of aromatase inhibitor. Letrozole lowers estrogen levels in postmenopausal women, which may slow the growth of certain types of breast tumors that need estrogen to grow in the body.&#xD;
Letrozole is used to treat breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It is often given to women who have been taking tamoxifen (Nolvadex, Soltamox) for 5 years.</description>
