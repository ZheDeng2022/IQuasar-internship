    <description>Time to KPS deterioration is defined as the time from screening to the first date of deterioration of the KPS score. Deterioration of KPS is defined as a stable or increasing steroid dose-dependent stabilization of a KPS score of &lt;70 over 2 consecutive visits at least 4 weeks apart. KPS is an 11-level score which ranges between 0 (death) to 100 (complete healthy status); a higher score represents a higher ability to perform daily tasks.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. AEs will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0 from mild (Grade 1) to death (Grade 5). SAE is an AE or adverse reaction which is considered serious if it results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, require hospitalizations or prolongation of hospitalizations, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect and is a medically important event.</description>
