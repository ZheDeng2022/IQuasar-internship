      This study proposes to evaluate the efficacy of single shot erector spinae block (ESB) versus&#xD;
      single shot quadratus lumborum block (QLB) when used in conjunction with continuous lumbar&#xD;
      plexus block (LPB) for postoperative analgesia in children and adolescents undergoing&#xD;
      unilateral hip surgical procedures. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of the&#xD;
      QL vs. ESP blocks as supplements to the lumbar plexus block with respect to pain control&#xD;
      outcomes after hip PAO surgery. Both blocks are safe and easy to perform. There is currently&#xD;
      no comparative, prospective data concerning the use of these two blocks for hip surgery. The&#xD;
      investigational hypothesis is that there will be no clinical difference in the amount of&#xD;
      opioid consumed or the overall pain control offered by these two block options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Bernese periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is currently performed at this institution as a&#xD;
      non-arthroplasty option to treat developmental hip dysplasia in symptomatic adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults. Extensive orthopedic surgical procedures of the hip such as this are associated&#xD;
      with severe postoperative pain and benefit from regional anesthesia which provides dense,&#xD;
      targeted analgesia to selected dermatomes. These blocks have the potential to decrease opioid&#xD;
      exposure intraoperatively and postoperatively, thus avoiding opioid-related side effects such&#xD;
      as nausea and vomiting. Other well-known benefits of regional anesthesia in other surgeries&#xD;
      include earlier extubation, shorter ICU admissions, shortened post anesthesia care unit&#xD;
      (PACU) stays, earlier mobilization, facilitation of physical therapy, improving patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, and improved comfort during recovery process. The opioid sparing advantages of&#xD;
      regional anesthesia are particularly relevant given the current concerns over the opioid&#xD;
      epidemic and data relating opioid administration around surgery recovery and long-term opioid&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innervation of the hip is very complex with contributions from various neural structures&#xD;
      arising from the lumbar plexus, including branches of the femoral nerve (L2-L4) innervating&#xD;
      the anterolateral capsule and obturator nerve (L2-L4) innervating the anteromedial capsule.&#xD;
      The posterior and inferior part of the hip joint are innervated by the sacral plexus&#xD;
      consisting of the superior gluteal nerve (L4-S1) and branches of the sciatic (L4-S3)&#xD;
      including the nerve to rectus femoris (L4-S1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin areas involved in the two most common hip PAO surgery incisions (ilioinguinal&#xD;
      incision or the iliofemoral incision) include territories that are innervated by subcostal&#xD;
      nerve (T12) and ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves (L1), 4 neural structures not&#xD;
      reliably covered with the lumbar plexus block given their origin far more superior from the&#xD;
      point of injection which is usually between L2 and L4. For this reason, supplemental blocks&#xD;
      such as the ESB and QLB have been employed to improve nerve block coverage and pain control.&#xD;
      The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L1) which is a sensory branch of the lumbar plexus that&#xD;
      supplies skin of the lateral thigh, has a less important role in this context given that the&#xD;
      surgical incisions are far more anterior to its territory of innervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical osteotomies commonly associated with the Bernese procedure are performed on the&#xD;
      anterior portion of the ischium, superior pubic ramus, posterior; partial osteotomies of the&#xD;
      ischium below the acetabulum are common as well. Arthrotomy is only performed in selected&#xD;
      cases if there is concern for intraarticular pathology, such as a torn labrum, lesions of the&#xD;
      femoral neck, or loose bodies. The pelvic bone with its respective osteotome (i.e. bone)&#xD;
      innervation includes territories ranging from L2 to S1.7 Some evidence suggest that the iliac&#xD;
      crest receives its main sensory innervation from femoral nerve while the gluteal surface of&#xD;
      the ilium comes from the sciatic nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the many dermatomes and osteotomes that are involved, various regional anesthetic&#xD;
      techniques have been described, including LPB, fascia iliaca block, femoral nerve block,&#xD;
      obturator nerve block, sacral plexus block, paravertebral blocks, and also interfascial plane&#xD;
      blocks like QLB and ESB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lumbar plexus block has been shown to provide prolonged analgesia and reduced analgesic&#xD;
      requirements in postoperative period for pediatric patients undergoing hip surgery. This&#xD;
      block targets mainly femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves. At this&#xD;
      institution, ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus block using the &quot;shamrock method&quot; has been&#xD;
      performed as standard of care for PAO surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin incisions include dermatomes T12 to L1 that are not usually covered by the lumbar plexus&#xD;
      block. For full coverage, it is necessary to add a supplementary block to cover these&#xD;
      dermatomes. The options for this coverage are the QLB, the ESB, or paravertebral block (PVB).&#xD;
      Due to the lack of evidence of superiority for any one of these additional blocks over&#xD;
      another, the choice of the block is most often made based on the preference of the regional&#xD;
      anesthesia team. All three blocks have been reported as effectively covering the cutaneous&#xD;
      incision areas. A retrospective preliminary analysis of local data comparing these&#xD;
      supplementary blocks suggested a potential difference favoring ESB in terms of opioid&#xD;
      consumption when compared to PV or QL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QLB blocks the anterior branches of thoracoabdominal nerves and may extend to the upper&#xD;
      branches of the lumbar plexus and lateral cutaneous branches of the thoracoabdominal nerves&#xD;
      with possible spread to the paravertebral space. There are at least four different variants&#xD;
      described in literature based on the site of injection in relation to the quadratus lumborum&#xD;
      muscle: type 1 (lateral), type 2 (posterior), type 3 (anterior or transmuscular) and type 4&#xD;
      (intramuscular) - each causing different spread patterns of injectate with affected&#xD;
      dermatomes ranging from thoracic T6 to lumbar L2. There is no literature evidence suggesting&#xD;
      that one specific QLB approach is superior than the others in terms of clinical outcomes or&#xD;
      duration in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ESB is a novel block developed in 2016. A rapidly growing body of literature suggests it&#xD;
      is efficacious in relieving back, chest wall, abdominal wall and flank pain in both acute and&#xD;
      chronic settings. It has been shown to be a viable option for breast, spine, thoracic and&#xD;
      abdominal surgical procedures. Recently it has also been reported as an alternative for hip&#xD;
      surgery analgesia. Depending on the level of application, this block permits an extensive&#xD;
      craniocaudal spread of the local anesthetic along the fascial plane underlying erector spinae&#xD;
      muscle allowing multiple dermatomal coverage from a single injection. At lumbar level it can&#xD;
      spread from the T12 to S1 vertebrae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy of the QL vs. ESB blocks as supplements to&#xD;
      the lumbar plexus block with respect to pain control outcomes after hip PAO surgery. Both&#xD;
      blocks are safe and easy to perform. There is currently no comparative, prospective data&#xD;
      concerning the use of these two blocks for hip surgery. The investigational hypothesis is&#xD;
      that there will be no clinical difference in the amount of opioid consumed or the overall&#xD;
      pain control offered by these two block options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of QLBs versus ESBs as supplementary blocks to continuous LPB for patients&#xD;
      undergoing primary periacetabular osteotomies. They will compare rescue analgesic&#xD;
      requirements, rendered as opiate equivalents, at 24, 48 and 72 hours postoperatively as the&#xD;
      primary endpoint. Patients aged 15 years - 30 years of age will be recruited from the home&#xD;
      insitution.&#xD;
