      Aim: To evaluate the effects of information-motivation-behavioral skills model interventions&#xD;
      given by nurses during home visits on the knowledge levels, personal and social motivation&#xD;
      levels, behavioral skills, and HbA1C levels of adolescents with poor glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized controlled study. Methods: 50 adolescents with type 1 diabetes were&#xD;
      equally divided into study and control groups. Socio-Demographic Form, Diabetes Information&#xD;
      Evaluation Form, The Child Attitude Toward Illness Scale, The Multidimensional Scale of&#xD;
      Perceived Social Support, and Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale were utilized in data&#xD;
      collection. The scales were administered at the beginning of the study and six months later.&#xD;
      HbA1c levels of adolescents were evaluated in the third and sixth months. Multiple home&#xD;
      visits and phone calls were made to each participant in the intervention group. Interventions&#xD;
      to improve the information-motivation-behavioral skills model-based knowledge, personal and&#xD;
      social motivation, and behavioral skills were applied during the home visits.&#xD;

      Aims The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of IMB model interventions conducted by&#xD;
      nurses during home visits on the knowledge levels, personal and social motivation levels,&#xD;
      behavioral skills, and HbA1c levels of adolescents with T1DM. The study also aimed to test&#xD;
      the following hypotheses: T1DM adolescents who experienced an IMB model-based intervention&#xD;
      during a home visit will have more knowledge (H1) and more positive attitudes (H2) about&#xD;
      their disease, higher levels of perceived social support (H3), higher levels of self-efficacy&#xD;
      (H4), and lower levels of HbA1c (H5) than the control group Design A randomized controlled&#xD;
      experimental study was conducted to test the hypotheses above and explore the aforementioned&#xD;
      aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample/Participants The study was conducted with patients (n=50) of the Pediatric Endocrine&#xD;
      Clinic of the Ankara Pediatric Hematology Oncology Training and Research Hospital between&#xD;
      October 2018 and August 2019. The researchers evaluated the results of T1DM adolescents with&#xD;
      HbA1c measurements at the clinic for 4 months and included those who met the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The inclusion criteria were: (1) a T1DM diagnosis established at least six months&#xD;
      ago, (2) an HbA1c level of &gt;7.5, (3) not using insulin pumps, (4) the absence of any chronic&#xD;
      disease other than diabetes, (5) attending follow-up visits at the clinic once every three&#xD;
      months, and (6) living in Ankara. Adolescents were included in the study after an assessment&#xD;
      of the HbA1c level. Adolescents who met the inclusion criteria were then grouped into study&#xD;
      (n=25) and control (n=25) groups in order of arrival at the clinic, using stratified&#xD;
      randomization by gender to ensure homogeneity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated based on the mean HbA1c level and standard deviations in the&#xD;
      two groups in the power analysis made at the end of the research. An independent sample&#xD;
      t-test was used to establish the 1.4-unit difference in mean HbA1c levels, and a power of&#xD;
      99.107% was achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection The Sociodemographic Information Form prepared by the researcher consisted of&#xD;
      six items regarding sociodemographic data and information on the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes Information Evaluation Form (DIEF), Child Attitude toward Illness Scale (CATIS),&#xD;
      Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and Diabetes Management&#xD;
      Self-Efficacy Scale (DMSES) were used to evaluate the components of the IMB model, and on the&#xD;
      assessment of HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher attended a two-stage &quot;Motivational Interviewing Techniques&quot; course and&#xD;
      received a certificate recognizing their ability to apply motivational interviewing&#xD;
      techniques. The eligible participants and their parents were informed about the research, and&#xD;
      written consent from the parents and written approvals from the adolescents were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, home visits were made to the study group and nursing interventions were&#xD;
      administered in accordance with the components of the IMB model. Information was provided in&#xD;
      accordance with the adolescent's requirements, established from a pretest using the Diabetes&#xD;
      Information Evaluation Form. For the personal motivation component, a list of obstacles and&#xD;
      risky behaviors perceived by the patient in managing diabetes was created collaboratively.&#xD;
      Patients were asked to think about the factors facilitating the emergence of such behaviors,&#xD;
      as well as obstacles and negative perceptions, and potential solutions. Thereby, it aimed to&#xD;
      raise the awareness of their risky behaviors. Furthermore, the patients were enabled to&#xD;
      create positive values about themselves through the discovery of their strengths and&#xD;
      weaknesses. As for social motivation, patients were supported in obtaining help from their&#xD;
      loved ones when they felt unhappy. Cooperation with the diabetes team (physician, nurse,&#xD;
      dietician) regarding appropriate topics was emphasized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skills of adolescents in activities such as blood glucose measurement, ketone&#xD;
      measurement, insulin injection, record-keeping, administering additional insulin doses when&#xD;
      required, creating a balanced food list, calculating the carbohydrate content of foods, and&#xD;
      adjusting pre- and post-exercise insulin doses and meals were then evaluated. Feedback was&#xD;
      provided enabling adolescents to correct their mistakes and improve self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During phone interviews, blood glucose results of the patient were determined first before&#xD;
      the reasons were discussed. Taking into account the patient requirements, information was&#xD;
      provided on insulin administration, nutrition, and exercise. The duration of the phone&#xD;
      interviews varied from 2 to 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group adolescents received no intervention by the researcher throughout the&#xD;
      study. For these participants, blood glucose measurement records were reviewed during their&#xD;
      routine follow-ups at the hospital, their insulin doses were changed when necessary, and the&#xD;
      daily intake of carbohydrates were adjusted after consultation with a dietician. The control&#xD;
      group was informed that the scales would be re-administered six months later, and that they&#xD;
      had to attend the hospital for HbA1c assessment at three and six months. After the posttest,&#xD;
      incorrect answers by the control group were identified and information related to the&#xD;
      question was provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Aspects of the Research Ethics committee approval was granted by the Health Sciences&#xD;
      University Ankara Pediatric Hematology Oncology HARC Clinical Researches Ethics Committee on&#xD;
      April 16, 2018 with case no: 2018-059.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Data were evaluated using IBM SPSS Statistics 23 software and a p value of&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. The results of a Shapiro-Wilk test indicated&#xD;
      a normal distribution of data, and so parametric tests were preferred in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dependent samples t-test was used to analyze the time-base differences of numerical&#xD;
      variables at two different time points, while a repeated measures variance of analysis was&#xD;
      used to examine the time-base differences at more than two different time points. The&#xD;
      difference in the mean scale scores of the two groups were analyzed using an&#xD;
      independent-samples t-test, while a Pearson's correlation analysis was used to examine the&#xD;
      association between the scales. The power analysis of the research was carried out using NCSS&#xD;
      PASS (Power Analysis and Sample Size) 11 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validity and Reliability A Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis was performed to test the&#xD;
      reliability of the scales&#xD;
