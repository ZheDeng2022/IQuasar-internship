  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate the systemic pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and the&#xD;
      safety of AZD8154 following administration of the Monodose DPI formulation compared with the&#xD;
      administration of the nebuliser suspension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomised, open-label, 3-period, single-dose, single-centre, crossover&#xD;
      study in healthy males and healthy females of non-childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three treatment periods during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from&#xD;
           the morning of the day before dosing with AZD8154 or placebo (Day 1) until 72 hours&#xD;
           following dosing for collection of PK samples; discharged on the morning of Day 4 of&#xD;
           each treatment period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Follow up Visit within 6 ± 1 days after last dose administration of investigational&#xD;
           medicinal products (IMPs) (i.e., AZD8154 or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 15 healthy subjects will be randomised in this study to ensure that at least 12&#xD;
      subjects are evaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 9 weeks.&#xD;
