  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gepotidacin is a new antibiotic that may potentially be used to treat prostatic infections&#xD;
      and pharyngeal gonorrhoea. To date, no data exists on gepotidacin pharmacokinetics in those&#xD;
      tissues. The present study is being carried out to determine concentrations of gepotidacin in&#xD;
      plasma, prostate and tonsillar tissue of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RPE) for&#xD;
      localized prostate, simple prostatectomy (PE) for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) or&#xD;
      tonsillectomy (TE). This will contribute to a more complete understanding of the drug's&#xD;
      penetration to its site of action.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single dose of 1500 mg gepotidacin will be administered to patients who will undergo&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy (RPE) or simple prostatectomy (PE) and patients undergoing&#xD;
      tonsillectomy (TE). The individual time-points of gepotidacin administration will be chosen&#xD;
      to ensure that the time-point of tissue removal corresponds with one of six different&#xD;
      sampling time-points, as closely as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study drug administration RPE or TE will be performed according to clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, microdialysis (MD) probes will be inserted in the removed tissue (tonsillar or&#xD;
      prostate tissue) ex-vivo and MD will be performed to determine unbound drug concentrations in&#xD;
      the tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma PK samples will be collected just before study drug administration and up to 48h after&#xD;
      administration of gepotidacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since MD provides the concentration of the unbound fraction of gepotidacin, for comparison we&#xD;
      will calculate the unbound fraction of the concentration values obtained through blood&#xD;
      sampling. To this end, we will determine the protein binding using ultrafiltration for each&#xD;
      subject at the time-point closest to the Cmax. The individual protein binding can then be&#xD;
      used to calculate the unbound plasma fraction of gepotidacin. This will allow to transform&#xD;
      the plasma PK data to the same scale as the microdialysis data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be analysed using non-compartmental analysis (NCA) for plasma concentrations and&#xD;
      population pharmacokinetic models (PopPK) for tissue concentrations pooled with plasma&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
