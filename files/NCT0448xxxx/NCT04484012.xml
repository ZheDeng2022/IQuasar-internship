  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the side effects of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T&#xD;
      cells and acalabrutinib, and to see how well they work in treating patients with mantle cell&#xD;
      lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). T cells&#xD;
      are infection fighting blood cells that can kill cancer cells. The T cells given in this&#xD;
      study will come from the patient and will have a new gene put in them that makes them able to&#xD;
      recognize CD19, a protein on the surface of the cancer cells. These CD19-specific T cells may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system identify and kill CD19 positive cancer cells. Acalabrutinib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Giving CD19 CAR T cells together with acalabrutinib may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety of adding CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes (CD19 CAR T cells) to acalabrutinib treatment. (Safety Lead-in) II. Estimate&#xD;
      the complete response (CR) rate within 6 months after adding CD19 CAR T cells to&#xD;
      acalabrutinib treatment. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess best response, time to and duration of CR. II. Estimate the 1-year progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) rate and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Describe the full toxicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess CD19-CAR T cell persistence. II. Assess CD19-CAR T cell activity as measured by&#xD;
      CD19 B cell aplasia. III. Describe the duration of CR from completion of acalabrutinib. IV.&#xD;
      Describe immunogenicity of CD19-CAR T cells in the presence of the BTK inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Characterize CD19 expression on tumor cells. VI. Describe cytokine profile after CD19-CAR&#xD;
      T cell infusion. VII. Determine BTK and PLCG2 mutational status prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -5 to 28 of cycle 1 and&#xD;
      on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive CD19 CAR T cells intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      on day 0. Treatment with acalabrutinib repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have not attained CR&#xD;
      after the first disease assessment and tolerated the initial CAR T cell infusion may receive&#xD;
      a second CAR T cell infusion in cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months, then&#xD;
      yearly for up to 15 years post CAR T cells infusion.&#xD;
