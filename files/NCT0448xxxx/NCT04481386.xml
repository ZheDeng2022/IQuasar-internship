          5. Must be able and willing to provide written informed consent, attend all scheduled&#xD;
             visits and comply with all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A participant meeting any of the following criteria was to be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any active intraocular or periocular infection or inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Only one functional eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ocular disorders in the study eye that may confound the interpretation of the study&#xD;
             results; macular oedema not requiring vitrectomy surgery, choroidal&#xD;
             neovascularisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. High refractive error demonstrating &gt;6 diopters of myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any ophthalmic condition that reduces the clarity of the optical media that interferes&#xD;
             with ophthalmic examination and adequate imaging (advanced cataract or corneal&#xD;
             opacities).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled glaucoma defined as intraocular pressure &gt; 30 mmHg on maximal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known hypersensitivity to hyaluronic acid or ADH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Uncontrolled blood pressure defined as systolic value ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic value&#xD;
             ≥100 mmHg at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Uncontrolled diabetes defined as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt; 12%.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Stroke or myocardial infarction within 90 days of baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Severe generalised disease resulting in a life expectancy shorter than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during&#xD;
             dosing of study treatment. Effective contraception methods included:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the participant). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) was not acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilisation (surgical bilateral oopthorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, this was acceptable only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman was confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilisation (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female&#xD;
                  participants on the study, the vasectomised male partner was to be the sole&#xD;
                  partner for that participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other&#xD;
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate&lt;1%),&#xD;
                  for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In the case of use of oral contraception, women were to be stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The use of an effective contraception method was to continue for 4 months&#xD;
                  post-vitrectomy and injection of the investigational product, in line with the&#xD;
                  follow-up period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because the experimental investigational product in this study may affect an&#xD;
                  unborn baby, males participating in this study were not to father a baby while on&#xD;
                  the study, and for 4 months following the injection of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women were considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they&#xD;
                  had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical&#xD;
                  profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or had surgical&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation, at least&#xD;
                  six weeks prior to the study. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman was confirmed by follow-up hormone level&#xD;
                  assessment was she considered to be not of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Participation in any study involving an investigational drug or device within the past&#xD;
             30 days or ongoing participation in a study with an investigational drug or device.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any clinical evidence that the Investigator felt would place the participant at&#xD;
             increased risk with the investigational product.&#xD;
