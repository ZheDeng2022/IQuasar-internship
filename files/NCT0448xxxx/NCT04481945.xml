    <textblock>
      Successful endodontic treatment depends primarily on the elimination of infecting&#xD;
      microorganisms. This is done by chemo-mechanical preparation of root canals, which is not&#xD;
      enough and microorganisms might still survive. Thus, from the main requirements of sealers is&#xD;
      to have antibacterial properties and adaptability. Those requirements are needed to kill&#xD;
      persisting bacteria after obturation and provide effective seal. Therefore, nanosilver and&#xD;
      chitosan inserted to BC sealer and so the antibacterial activity will be assessed on E.&#xD;
      faecalis using direct contact test after the setting of the sealer, and the results will be&#xD;
      reported using percentage reduction of the colony forming units. Besides, adaptability will&#xD;
      be assessed using scanning electron microscope.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of endodontic therapy is to clean and shape the root canals. This is done by&#xD;
      means of instruments and chemical irrigants in order to effectively control the pulpal and&#xD;
      periapical infection. That chemomechanical preparation aims to reduce the microorganisms&#xD;
      count but cannot completely eliminate it. This is mainly due to (i) anatomical complexity and&#xD;
      access limitations (ii) incompetent chemomechanical preparations leaving surfaces untouched&#xD;
      (iii) ineffectual irrigation. Besides, despite an accurate chemomechanical preparation,&#xD;
      infection may persist in 20-33% of cases, even if intracanal medicament is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment failure may also occur due to microleakage, which occurs due to interfacial gaps&#xD;
      between the gutta-percha and the sealer, the sealer and the dentin, or through voids within&#xD;
      the sealer. Fifty eight percent of treatment failures happen due to incomplete obturation and&#xD;
      that's why, hermetic seal is the main factor associated with the success of root canal&#xD;
      treatment . Therefore, disinfection, gap-free, three dimensional obturation are the main&#xD;
      requisites for treatment standards in endodontics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another reason for treatment failure is presence of persisting bacteria. Enterococcus&#xD;
      faecalis is a resistant bacterium commonly retrieved from obturated root canals with post&#xD;
      treatment disease (apical periodontitis). This pathogen is believed to be highly virulent; it&#xD;
      can invade dentinal tubules, adhere, overcome environmental challenges and form biofilm..&#xD;
      Besides, it can resist intracanal disinfectants and medicaments. Therefore, the best approach&#xD;
      to resolve this is by using a sealer with broad spectrum antibacterial action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideal root-canal sealer should be able to kill microorganisms on direct contact on the&#xD;
      dentinal walls and those present deep inside the dentinal root canals. That means that it&#xD;
      should be able to diffuse inside the dentinal tubules to entomb and kill surviving bacteria.&#xD;
      Besides, it should be capable of perfectly sealing the prepared canal to block any space and&#xD;
      nutrients needed for bacterial growth. Finally, endodontic sealers that retain flowability&#xD;
      and antimicrobial properties may help eliminate microorganisms in the root canal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dspite the fact that most sealers have antibacterial constituents, their antibacterial&#xD;
      activity is eventually lost after setting. Besides, even if it doesn't, these constituents&#xD;
      have to be liberated from the set sealer matrix to fulfill their function. Then again, their&#xD;
      release would be accompanied by disintegration of the sealer, interfacial gaps and later on&#xD;
      bacterial recolonization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover,the current root filling materials aren't enough for reaching a complete, gap-free&#xD;
      obturation. That would be due to the dimensional changes and lack of adhesion between Gutta&#xD;
      percha and dentin. And that is why endodontic sealers are used. Thus, the adaptability of the&#xD;
      sealer to the dentin is the main factor influencing microleakage and reinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nanotechnology is the science of producing materials in nano-dimensions by re-location and&#xD;
      re-arrangement of atoms to prepare materials with better properties. It is considered a great&#xD;
      advancement in the field of medicine. It can be beneficial in producing material with&#xD;
      superior properties by enhancing surface to volume ratio. Besides, having antibacterial&#xD;
      nanoparticles are shown to have better antibacterial action than their powder counterparts.&#xD;
      That would be due to their higher surface area and charge density which favor their&#xD;
      interaction with the negatively charged bacterial surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance in pathogens is a major challenge in field like biomedicine. Chemical&#xD;
      antimicrobial agents depend on binding to specific receptor for their antimicrobial action,&#xD;
      which by time lead to multidrug resistance. . On the other hand, antibacterial nanoparticles&#xD;
      such as nanosilver interact with multiple targets in the bacterial cell. Therefore, providing&#xD;
      the bacteria with the least chance of gaining resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of silver ions. Silver ions are highly reactive. They start by&#xD;
      binding to proteins on the bacterial cell leading to structural changes, which leads to cell&#xD;
      distortion and death. Silver ions also can inhibit the bacterial replication, by binding and&#xD;
      denaturing its DNA. Moreover, they can react with thiol group of proteins, followed by DNA&#xD;
      condensation resulting in the cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, silver nanoparticle's potential disadvantage is its toxicity towards mammalian&#xD;
      cells. A number of studies proved that silver is safe as long as it's used in small&#xD;
      concentrations. A study assessed the tissue response of silver nanoparticles dispersion&#xD;
      embedded in fibrin sponge and implanted in polyethylene tubes. They concluded that silver&#xD;
      nanoparticles dispersion was biocompatible at low concentrations. Another study stated that&#xD;
      silver nanoparticles at low concentrations are effective against microorganisms without any&#xD;
      toxic effect on eukaryotic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is a natural cationic biopolymer which can overcome the silver&#xD;
      nanoparticles shortcomings and still provide an antibacterial efficacy. Chitosan (CS) is&#xD;
      usually obtained by the alkaline deacetylation of chitin, which is the main component of the&#xD;
      exoskeleton of crustaceans. CS has an excellent antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal&#xD;
      properties, as an antibacterial, it works better on gram negative than gram positive.&#xD;
      Besides, the addition of CS nanoparticles into zinc-oxide eugenol sealer in a membrane&#xD;
      restricted assay. They proved that CS improved the antibacterial property suggesting that it&#xD;
      can diffuse and penetrate dentinal tubules and anatomical complexities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of CS and stated that it's contact-mediated killing. It starts by&#xD;
      electrostatic attraction of positively charged CS with negatively charged bacterial cell&#xD;
      membrane. That is followed by altered cell permeability, resulting in rupture of cells and&#xD;
      leakage of the intracellular components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, as reflected earlier, successful endodontic treatment depend on disinfecting the&#xD;
      canals and providing a hermetic seal. That's why; this study's target is to assess the&#xD;
      antibacterial efficacy and adaptability of bioceramic sealer when incorporated with&#xD;
      nanosilver and chitosan respectively.&#xD;
