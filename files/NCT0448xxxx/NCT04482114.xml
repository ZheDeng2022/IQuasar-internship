      -  Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Patients with pulmonary&#xD;
           nodules often undergo multiple computed tomography (CT) examinations for diagnostic and&#xD;
           follow-up purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purpose: The main objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of&#xD;
           ultra-low dose CT using deep learning-based reconstruction in the detection of pulmonary&#xD;
           nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abstract: Despite recent advances, lung cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed&#xD;
           cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide because it is often diagnosed at&#xD;
           advanced stages that are not surgically curable. Nevertheless, early detection of lung&#xD;
           cancer allows surgical resection, offers curative treatment and the best chance of&#xD;
           survival. There is currently no screening program in France, but individual screening&#xD;
           can be carried out depending on risk factors. Many pulmonary nodules are discovered each&#xD;
           year, most of which are benign. The challenge is to distinguish malignant lesions from&#xD;
           the multitude of benign lesions. One of the most effective criteria is the doubling time&#xD;
           of the nodules which leads to multiple follow-up examinations requiring ionizing&#xD;
           radiation to assess the size and growth of the nodules. Great efforts are currently&#xD;
           being made by CT manufacturers in order to reduce the radiation with equivalent&#xD;
           diagnostic performance. Patients who were referred to our department for an unenhanced&#xD;
           low-dose chest CT (LD CT) for pulmonary nodules check-up or follow-up, and had consented&#xD;
           to participate in the study, will undergo an additional ultra-low dose acquisition&#xD;
           (ULDCT, &lt;0,25 mSv, similar to standard two-view chest X-Ray) with deep learning-based&#xD;
           reconstruction (DLIR). The main objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic&#xD;
           performance between ULD and LD CT protocols for the detection of pulmonary nodules. The&#xD;
           impact of dose reduction will be assessed in this context. The data from each&#xD;
           examination will be blindly interpreted from the results of the other one. No follow-up&#xD;
           will be required for the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Image quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The signal-to-noise ratio or SNR is calculated on areas of interest placed manually on the image (pulmonary parenchyma, axillary fat and surrounding air).&#xD;
This ratio is calculated by the average signal strength in these areas, divided by the standard deviation of the signal in outdoor areas such as the surrounding air.&#xD;
The quality of the image is estimated by a score ranging from 0 (poor quality) to 3 (excellent quality) determined subjectively by the operator.</description>
