  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study, is trying to determine the highest dose of magnesium that can be given&#xD;
      safely to people with malignant mesothelioma receiving intraoperative chemotherapy with&#xD;
      cisplatin who are at risk for acute kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name(s) of the study drug involved in this study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  magnesium sulfate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a phase 1 pilot study, which is the first time investigators are&#xD;
      examining larger doses of magnesium in patients receiving cisplatin and the effect of&#xD;
      intravenous magnesium administration on blood magnesium levels. In previous studies it was&#xD;
      found that patients with lower blood magnesium levels were at higher risk of acute kidney&#xD;
      injury. The study is looking to determine the best dose(s) of intravenous magnesium to&#xD;
      administer safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants. The purpose of&#xD;
      the study is also to determine the dose of intravenous magnesium needed to achieve a target&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved magnesium for people with&#xD;
      mesothelioma receiving cisplatin but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment at&#xD;
      participant's preoperative visit with their thoracic surgeon. Intravenous magnesium will be&#xD;
      administered in the hospital, the night prior to surgery, and take place over 36 hours.&#xD;
      Participants will followed for 4 days on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 10 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

    <description>Starting the night before surgery participants will receive intravenous infusion of magnesium over approximately 36 hours. Dosage amounts will vary among participants as the study is determining the highest dose of magnesium that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects. The first 5 participants of the study will all receive the same dose of magnesium. The decision to test other doses of magnesium in 5 additional participants will depend on magnesium levels and dose tolerance outcomes in the first 5 participants.&#xD;
Participants will be followed for 4 days and undergo blood test to measure magnesium levels at the time of hospital admittance, the morning prior to the surgery, twice immediately after surgery, and twice a day for 3 days after the surgery.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults ≥18 years with malignant mesothelioma admitted for HIOCC. Because no dosing or&#xD;
             adverse event data are currently available on the use of intravenous magnesium&#xD;
