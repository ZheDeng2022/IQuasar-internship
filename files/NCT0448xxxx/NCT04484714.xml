  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the safety and feasibility a&#xD;
      12-week virtually supported home-based aerobic and resistance exercise program progressing&#xD;
      cancer survivors with Multiple Myeloma to meet standards identified in the 2019 Exercise&#xD;
      Guidelines for Cancer Survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be measuring recruitment, adherence, completion, cost tracking, as well as&#xD;
      fitness and quality of life outcomes. The study will be a single-group prospective before and&#xD;
      after study that will help inform a future larger-scale project. We will aim to recruit 25&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Health Research Ethics Board of Alberta Cancer Committee will approve this study.&#xD;
      Participants will participate in a combined resistance and aerobic exercise program biweekly&#xD;
      for 12 weeks. Exercise sessions will be supported and progressive in nature, between 40 and&#xD;
      75 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: fitness testing and quality of life scales will be administered before and after&#xD;
      the intervention. Scores will be compared to evaluate changes over the course of the&#xD;
      intervention. Safety and feasibility information will be collected throughout the study and&#xD;
      evaluated to determine program feasibility. Program satisfaction will be evaluated using a&#xD;
      satisfaction survey.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM), a cancer of the plasma cells in bone marrow, is associated with&#xD;
      osteolytic bone destruction, leading to deformities, chronic pain, reduced mobility and&#xD;
      functioning, fatigue, and risk of fracture. Although incurable, newly developed therapies are&#xD;
      extending survival, but some with significant side-effects. Patients may be living longer but&#xD;
      with lasting, debilitating side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise has been proposed as a way to optimize patient function and quality of life in the&#xD;
      face of lasting symptom burden. However, current evidence-informed exercise guidelines for&#xD;
      cancer survivors may not be appropriate for those with bone fragility, including those with&#xD;
      MM, as they are based on findings from studies in breast and prostate cancers. In MM&#xD;
      specifically, the literature presents mixed results, and several studies have limited&#xD;
      generalizability, reproducibility, or were underdosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of a 12-week&#xD;
      virtually supported home-based aerobic and resistance exercise program that aims to progress&#xD;
      individuals to the 2019 Exercise Guidelines for Cancer Survivors in a sample of cancer&#xD;
      survivors with multiple myeloma, as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment rate: ≥ 21 participants consenting to the study over a 7-month recruitment&#xD;
           period (primary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion rate: ≥ 80% of participants consenting to the study complete the 12-week&#xD;
           assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety: no increase in the rate of bony events above those estimated to occur in the&#xD;
           target population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence: average completion of ≥ 75% of the exercise prescription amongst participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will aim to recruit 25 participants from clinics at the local cancer hospital, the local&#xD;
      disease-group support society, and from the currently accruing Alberta Cancer Exercise&#xD;
      program. Subjects will be screened for eligibility and if they meet all eligibility criteria,&#xD;
      an information letter of the study will be provided, and they will be asked to contact the&#xD;
      investigators if interested in taking part in the study. All participants will be required to&#xD;
      provide written informed consent as per the Health Research Ethics Board of Alberta: Cancer&#xD;
      Committee (HREBA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will participate in a 12-week virtually supported home-based aerobic and&#xD;
      resistance exercise program, twice weekly using the Heal-Me application. Sessions will be&#xD;
      completed as virtual live classes or supported follow-along independent home workouts.&#xD;
      Sessions will progress in duration and difficulty over the course of the program, aiming to&#xD;
      have participants meet the 2019 Exercise Guidelines for Cancer Survivors by the end of the&#xD;
      program. Each session will include aerobic exercise (i.e. walking, cycling, or cardio&#xD;
      circuit), and a full-body resistance training routine using free weights, body weight&#xD;
      exercises, and/or bands, followed by balance and stretching exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: Demographic and medical information will be presented using median and range and&#xD;
      percentage for interval and nominal data, respectively. Descriptive statistics (mean ± SD and&#xD;
      frequencies) will be used to report safety and feasibility measures. Adherence will be&#xD;
      tracked as the percentage of total training load prescribed that was actually completed.&#xD;
      Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests will be used to compare and pre- and post-intervention fitness&#xD;
      assessment and quality of life scores. All analyses will be conducted using Stata/MP (version&#xD;
      13.0, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX), with alpha set to 0.05.&#xD;
