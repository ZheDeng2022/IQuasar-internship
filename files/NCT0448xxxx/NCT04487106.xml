    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well azacitidine, venetoclax, and trametinib work in&#xD;
      treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome that&#xD;
      has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Chemotherapy drugs,&#xD;
      such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Venetoclax and trametinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. The goal of this study is learn if the combination of azacitidine,&#xD;
      venetoclax, and trametinib can help to control acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine overall survival rate at 1 year of the regimen in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (Cohort A) II. To determine the complete remission&#xD;
      (CR)/complete remission without recovery of counts (CRi) rate of the regimen in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). (Cohort B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess other efficacy endpoints (CR rate, minimal residual disease negativity by flow&#xD;
      cytometry, relapse-free survival, event-free survival, and overall survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess proportion of patients proceeding to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety of the combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the impact of baseline genomic alterations on response and survival of the&#xD;
      combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate clonal evolution from diagnosis to relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION (CYCLE 1): Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes or&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7, venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28, and&#xD;
      trametinib PO QD on days 1-28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION (CYCLES 2-24): Patients receive azacitidine IV over 30-60 minutes or SC on days&#xD;
      1-7, venetoclax PO QD on days 1-21, and trametinib PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 23 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
