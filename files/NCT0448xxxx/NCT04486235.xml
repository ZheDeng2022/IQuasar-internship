      This study tests the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of using a brief&#xD;
      pamphlet in the primary care waiting room focused on promoting patient-initiated&#xD;
      weight-related discussions in primary care appointments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a chronic and complex disease that many national and professional organizations&#xD;
      recommend be discussed frequently in primary care. However, rates of weight-related&#xD;
      communication in primary care are suboptimal. When patients and physicians communicate about&#xD;
      weight (defined as usage of any the 5As-ask, assess, advise, agree, and/or assist-in a&#xD;
      weight-related conversation), patients are more likely to improve dietary habits, demonstrate&#xD;
      more motivation for health behavior change, attempt weight loss treatment, and lose more&#xD;
      weight as compared to patients who do not engage in weight-related communication with their&#xD;
      physicians. Interventions have attempted to increase the rates of weight-related&#xD;
      communication in primary care. However, they have focused solely on physicians and have only&#xD;
      yielded modest efficacy. Intervention with patients on proposed patient-related barriers may&#xD;
      be key to improving the rate of weight-related communication in primary care. The waiting&#xD;
      room prior to appointments is an underutilized intervention setting. Prior waiting room&#xD;
      interventions have shown promising results for increasing health communication between&#xD;
      patients and physicians. However, no prior study has focused on weight-related communication.&#xD;
      Thus, this study aims to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an&#xD;
      experiential pamphlet delivered in the waiting room targeting patient-related barriers to&#xD;
      weight communication.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention participants reported acceptability, as measured by the Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire (Hunsley, 1992). This is a 6-item scale that asks the participant to rate several metrics of acceptability with Likert scale responses (individual items range 1-7, one item is reverse scored). A higher score indicates greater acceptability, a score of 21 is the benchmark for acceptability. Overall range of 6-42.</description>

This is a 6-item scale that asks the participant to rate several metrics of acceptability with Likert scale responses (individual items range 1-7, one item is reverse scored). A higher score indicates greater acceptability, a score of 21 is the benchmark for acceptability. Overall range of 6-42.</description>
