      The purpose of this research is to adapt and evaluate the efficacy of an existing family&#xD;
      based intervention to be delivered via telehealth to child welfare-involved (CWI) youth and&#xD;
      their caregiver of origin.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to adapt and evaluate the efficacy of an existing empirically&#xD;
      supported, family-based affect management intervention to be delivered via telehealth. There&#xD;
      are two versions of this intervention: 1) a dyadic version to be delivered to CWI youth and&#xD;
      their caregiver of origin, and 2) a caregiver-only version to be delivered to any caregiver&#xD;
      (including kinship caregivers) of a CWI youth. The study involves iteratively adapting the&#xD;
      intervention with feedback from youth and caregiver participants and stakeholder partners, as&#xD;
      well as evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
