  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The joint ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias recommend, for patients at&#xD;
      low/moderate CV risk with raised LDL-C, a set of measures collectively defined as &quot;lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions&quot;, with use of drugs only if the LDL-C levels cannot be controlled with such&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions. &quot;Lifestyle interventions&quot; also includes food supplements. The reason&#xD;
      is the following: a simple &quot;dietary advice&quot; has been shown (Cochrane review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis, Rees et al, 2013) to achieve a modest reduction of total-C and LDL-C. The&#xD;
      review reports: Dietary advice reduced total serum cholesterol by 0.15 mmol/L (95% CI 0.06 to&#xD;
      0.23) and LDL cholesterol by 0.16 mmol/L (95% CI 0.08 to 0.24) after 3 to 24 months.&quot; An&#xD;
      average reduction of LDL-C by 0.16 mmol/L (6.2 mg/dL) is definitely insufficient to control&#xD;
      the level of LDL-C in those subjects. Therefore, those subjects would lose motivation to keep&#xD;
      dieting. In this context, use of supplements would significantly amplify the result of diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant proportion of ischemic cardiovascular events are believed to be supported by&#xD;
      the coexistence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, smoking, and others. The aggregation of these factors is accompanied by a&#xD;
      significant increase in the risk of cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational studies shown the existence of a relationship between cholesterolemia and&#xD;
      coronary heart disease, clearly showing that subjects with even modestly increased total&#xD;
      cholesterol values over time develop both fatal and non-fatal vascular events with a higher&#xD;
      frequency compared to subjects with similar characteristics, but with lower basal values of&#xD;
      cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous controlled intervention studies, on the other hand, have shown that there is a close&#xD;
      correlation between cholesterol reduction and cardiovascular risk; in fact, reductions in the&#xD;
      plasma concentration of total and LDL-C, obtained through lifestyle modification or specific&#xD;
      drugs, result in reductions in the incidence of major coronary events. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      these interventions has been demonstrated both in subjects in primary prevention and in&#xD;
      patients in secondary prevention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has defined in the ATP III report the&#xD;
      target values of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to be reached with interventions on food and / or&#xD;
      pharmacological habits to perform an effective cardiovascular prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the atherogenic action of hypercholesterolemia is largely attributable to a direct&#xD;
      damage action on the vascular endothelium, recent studies suggest that the activation of a&#xD;
      low-grade systemic pro-inflammatory state, typical of the patient with cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors, in turn would play a role in the determinism of endothelial damage and atheroma&#xD;
      degeneration of the arteries. It is believed that the systemic inflammation, documented by&#xD;
      the determination of some humoral signs of inflammation (e.g. C-reactive protein,&#xD;
      interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), may contribute to increase of cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk; it also seems that elevated plasma levels of the aforementioned markers can exert a&#xD;
      synergistic pro-atherogenic action with the various cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammatory state can modulate the atherosclerotic process at various levels,&#xD;
      determining endothelial activation, promoting leukocyte chemotaxis in the sub-intimal space&#xD;
      of the arterial wall and therefore the formation of an atheromatous plaque rich in&#xD;
      inflammatory cells; the latter represents the lesion responsible for the vast majority of the&#xD;
      coronary and cerebrovascular events observed in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been identified as an indicator of systemic inflammation and a&#xD;
      predictor of cardiovascular risk. In the AFCAPS / TexCAPS study, subjects with normal LDL-C&#xD;
      levels and low levels of HDL-C were shown to encounter a greater number of coronary ischemic&#xD;
      events as baseline hsCRP levels increased. On the contrary, in the Justification for the Use&#xD;
      of statins in Prevention-an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), the&#xD;
      treatment with rosuvastatin in subjects with high hsCRP was associated with a significant&#xD;
      reduction of CV events even in patients with low LDL-C level.&#xD;
