  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with serious mental illness (SMI) are disproportionately affected by medical&#xD;
      comorbidity, earlier onset of disease, and 10 to 25 years reduced life expectancy compared to&#xD;
      the general population. These high rates of morbidity and early mortality are associated with&#xD;
      inadequately managed medical and psychiatric illnesses. A recent systematic review found nine&#xD;
      effective self-management interventions that address medical and psychiatric illnesses in&#xD;
      adults with SMI. However, there has been limited adoption of these interventions due to both&#xD;
      provider and consumer-based factors. Provider-based barriers consist of the lack of an&#xD;
      adequate workforce with the capacity, time, and knowledge of effective approaches to&#xD;
      self-management support for adults with SMI and chronic health conditions. Consumer-based&#xD;
      barriers associated with limited participation in self-management programs include lack of&#xD;
      access, engagement, and ongoing community-based support for persons with SMI. Peer support&#xD;
      specialists have the potential to address these barriers as they comprise one of the fastest&#xD;
      growing sectors of the mental health workforce, have &quot;lived experience&quot; in self-management&#xD;
      practices, and offer access to support in the community. However, challenges need to be&#xD;
      resolved for peers to be effective providers of evidence-based interventions. For example,&#xD;
      peers are frequently trained to provide &quot;peer support&quot; described as &quot;giving and receiving&#xD;
      help founded on key principles of respect, shared responsibility, and mutual agreement of&#xD;
      what is helpful&quot;. Peer support has been associated with increased sense of control, ability&#xD;
      to make changes, and decreased psychiatric symptoms. Despite benefits, peer support does not&#xD;
      adhere to evidence-based practices for psychiatric and medical self-management and does not&#xD;
      follow protocols that ensure fidelity and systematically monitor outcomes. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that mobile technology has the potential to overcome these limitations of peer&#xD;
      support by providing real-time guidance in fidelity adherent delivery of a peer-delivered,&#xD;
      technology-assisted evidence-based self-management intervention (PDTA-IIMR). The investigator&#xD;
      will build the necessary expertise to pursue a career developing and testing novel approaches&#xD;
      to peer-delivered evidence-based self-management interventions. Training will include:&#xD;
      development of peer-delivered interventions; development and design of mobile&#xD;
      health-supported interventions; and intervention clinical trials research. Concurrently, this&#xD;
      study includes refinement of the intervention protocol with input from peers and consumers&#xD;
      and conducting a pilot study evaluating the feasibility and potential effectiveness of&#xD;
      PDTA-IIMR compared to routine peer support for N=6 peers and N=40 adults with SMI and chronic&#xD;
      health conditions. Outcomes include feasibility, medical and psychiatric self-management&#xD;
      skills, functional ability, and mortality risk factors and examine self-efficacy and social&#xD;
      support as mechanisms on outcomes.&#xD;
