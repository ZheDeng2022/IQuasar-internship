  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess exercise patterns during home-based or center-based&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation participation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants enrolled in either home-based or center-based cardiac rehabilitation will be&#xD;
      instructed to wear an accelerometer device for 7-days at baseline, 4-weeks, 8-weeks, and&#xD;
      12-weeks, to objectively measure their physical activity level during the cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation program. A questionnaire will also be completed by the participant at baseline&#xD;
      and 12-weeks to subjectively measure their physical activity level, based on self-report&#xD;
      activities over the previous 7-days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment in home-based versus center-based cardiac rehabilitation will be based on the&#xD;
      availability of cardiac rehabilitation facilities and/or patient preference. There is no&#xD;
      random allocation or assignment to groups by the study team.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in minutes spent in moderate-vigorous physical activity, measured by accelerometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4-weeks, 8-weeks, and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in minutes at a moderate-vigorous activity intensity are objectively measured by an accelerometer device that senses movement. The device captures the number of minutes a participant spends in moderate-vigorous activities per day, and will be worn by the participant for 7-days. A higher number of minutes per day indicates a greater physical activity level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in minutes spent in moderate-vigorous physical activity, measured by questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in minutes at a moderate-vigorous activity intensity are subjectively measured (self-reported) using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The IPAQ captures the number of minutes a participant spends in moderate-vigorous activities per day, based on participant's reporting of the previous 7-days. A higher number of minutes per day indicates a greater physical activity level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in minutes spent in inactive (sedentary) behavior, measured by accelerometry.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4-weeks, 8-weeks, and 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in minutes spent in inactive (sedentary) behavior, measured by an accelerometer device that senses movement. The device captures the number of minutes a participant spends inactive per day, and will be worn by the participant for 7-days. A higher number of minutes per day of inactive time indicates increased sedentary behavior.</description>
