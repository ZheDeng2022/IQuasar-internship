    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, 2-part, double-blind (sponsor-unblinded), randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      first time in human (FTIH) study, that includes both single-ascending and multiple-ascending&#xD;
      dose phase to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK3882347 in&#xD;
      healthy adult men and Woman of Non Childbearing Potential (WONCBP). Part 1 will be the single&#xD;
      ascending dose (SAD) phase and Part 2 will be the multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase. Each&#xD;
      participant in the SAD cohort will receive a single dose of GSK3882347 or placebo (PBO) in&#xD;
      3:1 ratio and in Part 2 (MAD), participants will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      active treatment and placebo. Part 1 will consist of two cohorts with a maximum of&#xD;
      four-period for each cohort, the food effect evaluation will be conducted in last period&#xD;
      (Period 4) in only one of the cohorts based on the observed human pharmacokinetics (PK). Part&#xD;
      2 will consist of maximum of four cohorts for each of the MAD dose or placebo.&#xD;
