  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urological dysfunction is common in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and its prevalence&#xD;
      has been reported at a high rate of 32-97%. Bladder dysfunction is associated with a&#xD;
      significant deterioration in the quality of life of people with MS. In chronic diseases such&#xD;
      as MS, patients experiences need to be measured directly in order to have information about&#xD;
      patients perceptions about the effect of the disease on quality of life. However, there are a&#xD;
      small number of valid and reliable Turkish scales on this subject.SF-Qualiveen is a validated&#xD;
      scale for patients with MS who assess the urinary-specific quality of life by examining the&#xD;
      impact of a wide range of bladder problems.The aim of our study is to make the Turkish&#xD;
      cultural adaptation, validity and reliability of the SF-Qualiveen scale.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to reveal the Turkish cultural adaptation, validity and reliability&#xD;
      of the SF-Qualiveen scale. In our study, Sf-Qualiveen and Urogenital Distress Inventory&#xD;
      (UDI-6) scales will be used. Pre-testing will be done in 10 patients with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis.Then, the validity and reliability of the scale will be performed in 80 patients&#xD;
      with multiple sclerosis.&#xD;

    <description>After the pre-test is completed, if necessary, arrangements will be made, and then the validity and reliability of SF-Qualiveen will be made in 80 individuals with Multiple Sclerosis.First of all, participants will be asked to complete two questionnaires (SF-Qualiveen and Urinary Distress Inventory). Two weeks after this assessment, they will be asked to respond to SF-Qualiveen again.</description>
