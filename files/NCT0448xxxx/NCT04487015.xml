  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The carbohydrate periodisation framework is a widely accepted nutritional intervention&#xD;
      strategy in the field of sports nutrition. However, despite the validity of this approach, it&#xD;
      is reported that athletes find it difficult to stick to this behaviour and that the support&#xD;
      required is highly personalised, and as a result time consuming for the coach. Prior research&#xD;
      has suggested that a digital environment can deliver better personalised dietary&#xD;
      interventions to better support athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a digital&#xD;
      approach (a menu planner app with coach support), and gain understanding on the strategy to&#xD;
      implement coach support according to app engagement in the digital approach to improve&#xD;
      dietary carbohydrate periodisation behaviours in athletes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted in two consecutive parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For part one, to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the digital approach,&#xD;
      participants are recruited to use the app for 6 weeks and were given coach support, where&#xD;
      coaches message (MesC) and call (ad-hoc Call) and the participants. A control group (no app)&#xD;
      is also separately recruited to compare with the menu planner group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For part two, to gain better understanding on the strategy to implement coach support with&#xD;
      the menu planner app according to app engagement, a pilot multiple assignment randomized&#xD;
      trial (SMART) design is conducted. Participants are equally randomised to either receive a&#xD;
      stringent engagement criteria strategy or relaxed adherence criteria strategy. A stringent&#xD;
      engagement criteria strategy requires the user to use the app at least twice a week at stage&#xD;
      1, and at least 3 times a week at stage 2 to be considered a responder at stage 1 and stage 2&#xD;
      (R1 and R2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A relaxed engagement criteria strategy requires the user to use the app at least once a week&#xD;
      in week 1 of using the app at stage 1, and at least 2 times a week at stage 2, to be&#xD;
      considered a responder at stage 1 and stage 2 (R1 and R2). Non-responders for both criteria&#xD;
      strategies at stage 1 and 2 (NR1 and NR2) will be re-randomised to either continue with the&#xD;
      app only or additional coach support (MesC + ad-hoc Call).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline wise,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Participants will first receive app for 1 week and will be categorised as responder&#xD;
      (R1) or non-responders (NR1) at the end of the 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Responders to stage 1 (R1) will continue with the menu planner for 1 week.&#xD;
      Non-responders to stage 1 (NR1) will either continue with the menu planner or receive&#xD;
      additional coach support (MesC + ad-hoc Call) for 1 week. Participants are categorised again&#xD;
      as responder (R2) or non-responders (NR2) at the end of the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: Responders to stage 2 (R2) will only have menu planner for 2 weeks. Non-responders&#xD;
      to stage 2 (NR2) will either have menu planner only or receive/continue with additional coach&#xD;
      support (MesC + ad-hoc Call) for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SMART trial will take a total of 4 weeks to complete and have up to two randomisation&#xD;
      points per participant. All re-randomisations are done at 1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At week 6 (for part I of study) and week 4 (part II of study)</time_frame>
    <description>A binary success of whether dietary periodisation behaviour has improved in the participant measured by the &quot;periodisation behaviour questionnaire&quot; (in the process of submitting the paper on validation of questionnaire). The scale is 1- does not periodise, 2-periodises energy but not carbohydrate, and 3-periodises both. Higher score indicates better periodisation behaviour. Only score of 3 is considered success.</description>

    <measure>Change in dietary self-efficacy from baseline to week 4, 6</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (week 0) and at week 6 (for part I of study) and week 4 (part II of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The dietary self-efficacy will be assessed using a self-efficacy scale. This questionnaire have been validated in the general population (Stich, Knauper and Tint, 2009). The scale is a 5-point scale from 1 for not confident at all, to 5 for very confident. Higher score indicates higher self-efficacy.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline (week 0) and at week 6 (for part I of study) and week 4 (part II of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The beliefs about consequences scale has not yet been validated but has been adapted from previous research on beliefs about capabilities by Wallin, Bostr√∂m and Gustavsson (2012). The scale is a 5-point sale from 1- not at all to 5- extremely. Higher scores indicate higher beliefs about consequences.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline (week 0)</time_frame>
    <description>The nutrition causality orientation scale is a measure of the need for autonomy in nutrition-related decisions. It is not yet validated but is adapted from previous research on the validated health causality orientation scale (Smit and Bol, 2020). The scale is a 7-point scale, with 1 being strongly disagree to 7 being strongly agree.</description>

    <description>The app-based menu planner (MP) given to the participants has an automated carbohydrate periodisation menu planning tool, an educational and motivational nutrition content (infographics, video and text articles), and recipes. Participants using the app will input their training schedule into the app to produce their own menu plans. The behaviour change techniques (BCT) underlying the intervention are goal &amp; planning, feedback &amp; monitoring, shaping knowledge, natural consequences, comparison of behaviour, comparison of outcome, associations, repetitions, reward &amp; threat, regulation and antecedents.</description>
