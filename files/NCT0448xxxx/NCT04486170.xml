  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single centered randomized control study for postpartum patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with hypertension. Participants that meet inclusion criteria will be approached&#xD;
      while they are inpatient. After enrollment, all study subjects will receive an automated&#xD;
      blood pressure cuff and instructions on how to use it. Study participants in the intervention&#xD;
      group will be provided with educational material. The investigators hypothesize education in&#xD;
      postpartum women with hypertension can improve patient compliance with attendance at&#xD;
      postpartum care appointments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study group: postpartum women with a diagnosis of either chronic hypertension,&#xD;
      gestational hypertension, preeclampsia without severe features, preeclampsia with severe&#xD;
      features, chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia with and without severe&#xD;
      features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: postpartum patients that meet the inclusion criteria will be approached&#xD;
      postpartum while they are still hospitalized. Once the study subjects are enrolled, they will&#xD;
      receive the same automatic blood pressure cuff and basic teaching on how to use it. All study&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to check their blood pressure once a day. The study subjects will be&#xD;
      advised that if systolic blood pressure is &gt; 160 or the diastolic blood pressure &gt;110, the&#xD;
      study subjects are asked to remain seated and repeat the BP measurement in 15 minutes, if&#xD;
      still elevated the study subject will be advised to call labor and delivery or proceed to&#xD;
      labor and delivery triage for further evaluation. All study subjects will be asked to follow&#xD;
      up for a blood pressure check 3-10 days after discharge home. All study subjects will be&#xD;
      weighed prior to discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study subject is then randomized to the control or intervention group. Both groups will&#xD;
      receive a survey. After the intervention group undergoes the educational component, this will&#xD;
      be the last time the study subjects meet with the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected on an excel spreadsheet. Patient identifiers will be removed once&#xD;
      the study is completed. However, de-identified data may be used for future studies. The&#xD;
      database will be password protected on an excel spreadsheet and secured behind the Medstar&#xD;
      Washington Hospital Center firewall computers. Access to these databases is restricted to the&#xD;
      PI and the co-investigators. The data will be statistically analyzed in order to answer the&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis: At Washington hospital center, the current attendance within 10 day&#xD;
      postpartum follow up appointments is 40% and at the 6 week appointment it is 70%. Based on&#xD;
      this data the investigator wants to evaluate if this postpartum education intervention can&#xD;
      cause a 100% difference in attendance within 10 days postpartum: 40% attendance which is the&#xD;
      current attendance rate (control) versus 80% (goal for the intervention group): enrollment of&#xD;
      46 patients is required.&#xD;
