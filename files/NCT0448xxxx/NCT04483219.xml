      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib or&#xD;
      regorafenib in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody in TKI (fruquintinib or&#xD;
      regorafenib)-responded MSS/pMMR metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the later-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) can bring&#xD;
      benefits to subjects. However, the overall efficacy of treatment is still low. The programmed&#xD;
      cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade alone in MSS/pMMR mCRC is inefficiency, highlighting a&#xD;
      need for strategies that converse the immunity suppressive to immunity supportive&#xD;
      microenvironment. Fruquintinib and regorafenib are multi-target TKI mainly for angiogenesis,&#xD;
      which has the following characteristics: cause tumor necrosis and release a lot of new&#xD;
      antigens, improve the microenvironment of immunosuppression, and induce tumor vascular&#xD;
      normalization. In addition to killing tumor cells, fruquintinib and regorafenib could also&#xD;
      converse the immunity suppressive to immunity supportive microenvironment, which could&#xD;
      sensitize PD-1 blockade, ultimately improve the prognosis of patients with MSS/pMMR mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study is a single-arm, multicenter phase II clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of fruquintinib or regorafenib in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody in&#xD;
      TKI (fruquintinib or regorafenib)-responded MSS/pMMR metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, the 9-month PFS rate in subjects receiving TKI followed by TKI in&#xD;
      combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, will be used as primary outcome measures and 53 subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After fully informed and signed the informed consent, the subjects will receive one cycle of&#xD;
      TKI (fruquintinib or regorafenib) treatment after enrollment. According to response to TKI,&#xD;
      the subjects will be divided into three arms. The definition of response to TKI are as&#xD;
      follows: (1) obvious response to TKI (arm A)：effective imaging changes, including reduction&#xD;
      of target lesion diameter to CR, PR or shrunken SD (based on response evaluation criteria in&#xD;
      solid tumors, RECIST v 1.1), or cavitation in metastatic lung lesions, or decrease in the&#xD;
      density of liver metastatic target lesions ≥15%; (2) general response to TKI (arm B):&#xD;
      enlarged SD (based on RECIST v 1.1); (3) poor response to TKI (arm C): PD (based on RECIST v&#xD;
      1.1). TKI in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody will be administered in arm A. The subjects&#xD;
      in arm C will exit the study. The subjects in arm B will continue to take TKI for another one&#xD;
      cycle. After that, the obvious response subjects will be entered group A, the general&#xD;
      response subjects will keep in arm B and continue the TKI monotherapy, and the poor response&#xD;
      subjects will exit the study. The administration of arm A or B will be last until disease&#xD;
      progression or intolerable toxicity，anti-PD-1 antibody can be applied for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first two imaging evaluations would be performed every 4 weeks after the beginning of&#xD;
      treatment to evaluate TKI response, and then once every 6 weeks, until the end of treatment,&#xD;
      withdrawal of informed consent or death. The TKI response would be assessed according to&#xD;
      RECIST v1.1 criteria and effective imaging changes (cavitation in metastatic lung lesions, or&#xD;
      decrease in the density of liver metastatic target lesions ≥15%). The efficacy of TKI&#xD;
      followed by TKI in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody would be evaluated based on&#xD;
      immune-related RECIST (iRECIST) v1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 expression, T lymphocyte infiltration, T lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood,&#xD;
      granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio, tumor mutant burden (TMB), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA),&#xD;
      exosomes，etc.，will be measured and monitored during the treatment. In addition，the safety&#xD;
      evaluation will be carried out according to the standard of adverse reaction classification&#xD;
      (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE v5.0)&#xD;
