  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to describe the safety profile of fingolimod in the Taiwanese&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis population. This study aims to collect the safety data in patients newly&#xD;
      initiated on fingolimod for one year.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-month, prospective, interventional, multi-center study to monitor safety in&#xD;
      adult patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in Taiwan who based on&#xD;
      local practice are newly starting fingolimod at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-four patients will be included in this study in line with the study inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. After entering this study, the participants will continue to be treated&#xD;
      for MS based on local practice. The patient will be taking fingolimod 0.5mg per day.&#xD;
      Protocol-mandated procedures and visits for safety data collection will be conducted in&#xD;
      addition to the required examinations according to the clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient experienced an interruption of fingolimod treatment that requires a&#xD;
      re-evaluation of FDO, the patient will be discontinued from the study. If the treatment&#xD;
      interruption does not require a FDO when re-starting fingolimod, the patient can continue to&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The adverse events of special interest (AESI) include macular edema, abnormal liver function(ALT, AST or GGT &gt; 5x upper normal limit), and severe lymphocytopenia(lymphocyte &lt; 200 cells/μL).</description>

    <description>The ARR will be calculated as total number of relapses experienced divided by total number of days of follow-up, and the ratio multiplied by 365. For patients withdraw from the study or switch to an alternative MS therapy prior to 12 month, the total number of days in study is defined as the number of days from baseline to the last date in study.</description>

    <description>Pulse (beats/min - bpm) data will be summarized as descriptive statistics for change from baseline value (both for the period 6-hours post first dose and for further visit assessments). The frequency and percentage of notable vital sign abnormalities will be summarized.

    <description>Blood pressure(BP)(mmHg) data will be summarized as descriptive statistics for change from baseline value (both for the period 6-hours post first dose and for further visit assessments). The frequency and percentage of notable vital sign abnormalities will be summarized. Notable criteria for systolic BP is ≥160 mm Hg or Increase of ≥20 mm Hg from baseline Or ≤ 90 mm Hg or Decrease of ≥ 20 mm Hg from baseline. Notable criteria for diastolic BP is ≥ 100 mmHg or Increase of ≥ 15 mm Hg from baseline Or ≤ 50 mmHg or Decrease of ≥ 15 mm Hg from baseline.</description>
