  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, 2-arm parallel group trial in&#xD;
      infants aged 6 months (26 weeks) at enrollment, who are no longer breastfed, and who are&#xD;
      ready but have not yet started complementary feeding. They will be fed one of two different&#xD;
      isocaloric feeding regimens (Experimental [EXPL] or Control [CTRL]) consisting of different&#xD;
      follow-up formulas (FUFs) and infant cereals (ICs). The main purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the glucose response of these two different complementary feeding regimens. All&#xD;
      enrolled infants will participate in the trial for approximately 6 months.&#xD;
