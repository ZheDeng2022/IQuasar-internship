  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People suffering from chronic pain exhibit changes in the way the central nervous system&#xD;
      processes pain. Some of the changes in the central nervous system are associated with how the&#xD;
      brain adapts to the process of different stimuli. There are several physiological mechanisms&#xD;
      that regulates how the brain adapts to changes and one of these mechanisms is called&#xD;
      homeostatic plasticity (or equilibrium plasticity ). In healthy participants homeostatic&#xD;
      plasticity mechanisms have been tested and considered normal, whereas in patients with&#xD;
      chronic conditions, such as low back pain, this mechanism was shown to be dysfunctional.&#xD;
      However, it is unknown when this difference in the pain system develops. It is possible that&#xD;
      homeostatic mechanism becomes impaired during early stages of pain. This experiment will&#xD;
      investigate the effect of capsaicin-induced pain on homeostatic plasticity in healthy&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of capsaicin-induced pain on homeostatic&#xD;
      plasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised crossover design will be used to evaluate the effect of capsaicin-induced pain&#xD;
      on homeostatic plasticity using cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Each&#xD;
      participant will take part in four experimental sessions during which homeostatic plasticity&#xD;
      and corticomotor excitability will be induced and measured in the left primary motor cortex.&#xD;
      Participants will receive - in randomised order - capsaicin or placebo patch placed on the&#xD;
      dorsal part of the right hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will attend four sessions, being two consecutive sessions separated by two&#xD;
      weeks (i.e. wash-out period). During the experiment, participants will be seated comfortably&#xD;
      with hands and arms at rest. First, the electromyography electrodes will be placed at the&#xD;
      right first dorsal interosseous muscle to be used for assessing the corticomotor excitability&#xD;
      by recordings of motor evoked potentials by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the&#xD;
      left primary motor cortex. Then, the cap for tDCS on the left primary motor cortex will be&#xD;
      mounted. The optimal scalp position (hot spot) for TMS stimulation will be identified and&#xD;
      marked with a pen on the cap for standardisation. A 5 x 7 cm capsaicin/placebo patch will be&#xD;
      placed on participants' right hand. After 30 minutes of patch application, baseline measures&#xD;
      of pain and motor-evoked potentials will be taken. Then, the homeostatic plasticity induction&#xD;
      process will take place followed by motor-evoked potentials recordings every 15 minutes up to&#xD;
      45 minutes post protocol. Participants will be divided in 2 groups, one group will receive&#xD;
      ice over the patch as to reduce pain intensity to minimum of 1 in a numeric rating scale; the&#xD;
      other group will proceed without ice. Homeostatic plasticity will be induced and measured as&#xD;
      previously described. The patch will be left in place for 24 hours, at which point&#xD;
      participants will return to the laboratory and homeostatic plasticity will once again be&#xD;
      induced and measured. After a wash-out period of two weeks, participants will go through an&#xD;
      identical process but at this time with a different patch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homeostatic plasticity will be induced in the left primary motor cortex using tDCS applied&#xD;
      for 7 minutes followed by an interval of 3 minutes and another block of 5 minutes of&#xD;
      stimulation. A constant current of 2mA will be transmitted through the tDCS system, using two&#xD;
      25 cm2 electrodes placed into holes of a cap over the hot spot and right supraorbital area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size calculation was conducted using α of 0.05, β of 0.80 and effect size of 0.29&#xD;
      based on motor evoked potential (MEP) analysis of previous studies resulting in a target of&#xD;
      22 participants. To account for differences in designs 24 participants will be included,&#xD;
      being 12 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data distribution will be assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. A mixed analysis of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA) will be conducted on mean MEPs: within factors Intervention (Capsaicin and Placebo),&#xD;
      Time (baseline, 0 min, 15 min, min, 30 min, 45 min), Time with pain (immediate, post pain&#xD;
      relief post prolonged pain); and between factor (ice , no ice). A Greenhouse-Geisser&#xD;
      correction will be used if Mauchly's test shows that sphericity cannot be assumed.&#xD;
      Adjustments will be made for multiple post-hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni correction.&#xD;
      Results will be interpreted according to the level of statistical significance p≤0.05.&#xD;
