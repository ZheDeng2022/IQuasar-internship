      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of zinc supplementation on depression in SSRIs-treated MDD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: Depression is the single largest contributor to global disability as has been ranked&#xD;
      by WHO (2015), in humans including both male and female.Studies have suggested that&#xD;
      conventional presently available anti-depressive medicines are effective for one third to&#xD;
      one-half (19-34%) of the patients suffering from depression, leaving the rest of patients to&#xD;
      suffer from recurrence or incomplete cure. Researchers throughout the world are involved to&#xD;
      obtain new pharmacotherapy for the treatment of MDD. Zinc is an important micronutrient of&#xD;
      the human body which is implicated as an essential component in various systemic wellbeing&#xD;
      including the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study would be randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective&#xD;
      interventional trial and it would be conducted in the Department of Pharmacology and in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Department of Psychiatry, BSMMU, from date of approval by the IRB to&#xD;
      August 2020. A total of 100 patients suffering from mild to moderate major depression will be&#xD;
      selected following to inclusion and exclusion criteria and serum Zinc levels will be&#xD;
      assessed. The diagnosis of patients suffering from MDD and the selection of drugs and dosage&#xD;
      would be performed by a senior professor of the Psychiatry department. After completing the&#xD;
      necessary formalities including the informed consent of the patients, the patient would&#xD;
      undergo a selected questionnaire (DASS-21) to assess his/her degree of severity of the&#xD;
      disease. The patients would be randomly allocated into two groups: group A (control group)&#xD;
      and B (intervention group). Group A would consist of 50 patients who will receive a placebo&#xD;
      with SSRIs for 8 weeks. Group B would consist of 50 patients who will receive SSRIs plus Zinc&#xD;
      sulfate (30mg/day) orally for 8 weeks, after which at follow up, the severity of depression&#xD;
      will be assessed. The blood sample will be collected to measure serum zinc level at baseline&#xD;
      and again after 8 weeks of therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and of the World Medical&#xD;
      Assembly. Patients will be informed about the study in easy language and then informed&#xD;
      consent will be taken. The study has no potential risk to the patients. Confidentiality will&#xD;
      be strictly maintained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression (MDD) is a major global health problem. The number of people suffering from major&#xD;
      depressive disorder was reported as around 300 million (about 4.4% of the world's population)&#xD;
      in 2015. The total number is assumed to increase to 18.4% from 2005 to 2015. Depression is&#xD;
      more common in females compared to males (female: male = 5.1:3.6). Years lived with a&#xD;
      disability are about 50 million people due to major depressive disorder and this disease has&#xD;
      been claimed to be a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and also suicidal death. In&#xD;
      Bangladesh, the prevalence of depressive disorder is about 4.1% and the percentage of total&#xD;
      years lived with a disability (DALY) is about 7.1%. Within this number, some people suffer&#xD;
      additionally from anxiety disorders and some suffer from both anxiety disorder and MDD.&#xD;
      However, MDD has been assumed to occupy the place of the second cause of disability by 2020,&#xD;
      and MDD, therefore, demands attention and alerts in clinical psychiatry. Depression impairs&#xD;
      quality of life at the level of personal, familial, and social aspects and in the severe&#xD;
      form, may lead to thoughts of committing suicide. Suicidal death (about 8,00000 per year)&#xD;
      have been reported throughout the world in recent reports and are increasing gradually.&#xD;
      Conventional antidepressants are the medicines used to treat MDD. Increasing 5HT&#xD;
      concentrations at the synapses of the amygdala, frontal cortex, or the limbic region by SSRI&#xD;
      or TCA or other drugs administration remains the primary object of therapy. About 19-34% of&#xD;
      MDD patients show a reasonable level of response to the SSRIs while about 15-50% of patients&#xD;
      show dissatisfactory response or recurrence. This fact is a subject of concern and invite&#xD;
      pharmacological intervention either in the form of adjunct drugs or new drug discoveries.&#xD;
      Recent researches have revealed that a significant role of zinc in MDD patients due to its&#xD;
      antidepressant effects. Some studies reported that there is no effect of zinc supplementation&#xD;
      on depression in MDD patients. Because of the conflicted reports, this study has been&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the effect of zinc supplementation on depression in MDD patients treated&#xD;
      with SSRI. Results of this study may be helpful to advocate the regular use of zinc&#xD;
      supplementation as an adjunct to SSRI therapy in MDD. The study would be randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective interventional trial and it would be conducted&#xD;
      in the Department of Pharmacology and in collaboration with the Department of Psychiatry,&#xD;
      BSMMU, from the date of approval by the IRB to August 2020. A total of 100 patients suffering&#xD;
      from mild to moderate major depression will be selected following to inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and serum Zinc levels will be assessed. The diagnosis of patients suffering from MDD&#xD;
      and the selection of drugs and dosage would be performed by a senior professor of the&#xD;
      Psychiatry department. After completing the necessary formalities including the informed&#xD;
      consent of the patients, the patient would undergo a selected questionnaire (DASS-21) to&#xD;
      assess his/her degree of severity of the disease. The patients would be randomly allocated&#xD;
      into two groups: group A (control group) and B (intervention group). Group A would consist of&#xD;
      50 patients who will receive a placebo with SSRIs for 8 weeks. Group B would consist of 50&#xD;
      patients who will receive SSRIs plus Zinc sulfate (30mg/day) orally for 8 weeks, after which&#xD;
      at follow up, the severity of depression will be assessed. The blood sample will be collected&#xD;
      to measure serum zinc level at baseline and again after 8 weeks of therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
      The regularity of medicine intake will be ensured over the telephone, counting the tablets,&#xD;
      and from the patient's compliance sheet. The study entails almost no potential risk to the&#xD;
      patients which will be explained to the patients together with the fact that he/she would be&#xD;
      free to leave the study at any time and that he/she would receive free of cost treatment in&#xD;
      case of any adverse reactions. Statistical analysis will be obtained by SPSS (Statistical&#xD;
      Package for Social Science). Results will be presented in tables and graphical figures as&#xD;
      applicable. Calculated 'p' value may suggest the level of significance (significant at p â‰¤&#xD;
      0.050). The study will follow the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and of the World&#xD;
      Medical Assembly. Patients will be informed about the study in easy language and then&#xD;
      informed consent will be taken. The study has no potential risk to the patients.&#xD;
      Confidentiality will be strictly maintained.&#xD;
