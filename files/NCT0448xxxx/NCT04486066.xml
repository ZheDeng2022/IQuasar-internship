  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately fifty percent of Veterans report chronic pain. Management of chronic pain is&#xD;
      often compounded by other life problems, including depression and posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder. Use of opioids for pain management entails risk of harm, and effective&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic approaches to chronic pain management are needed. Mindfulness-Based Stress&#xD;
      Reduction (MBSR) and group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain (CBT-CP) are&#xD;
      programs that teach skills to improve functionality and quality of life for people with&#xD;
      chronic pain. However, studies of MBSR and the group form of CBT-CP for chronic pain remain&#xD;
      limited. In the proposed trial, MBSR will be compared to CBT-CP and usual care, with&#xD;
      assessment of pain interference and other outcomes at 6-month follow-up. If MBSR and group&#xD;
      CBT-CP are shown to be effective in improving outcomes, it would support use of these&#xD;
      modalities for chronic pain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Pain is one of the most common reasons Veterans seek health care. Mental health&#xD;
      conditions (including PTSD, anxiety, and depression) are estimated to co-occur for 30-50% of&#xD;
      Veterans with chronic pain. Current recommendations for pain management include an&#xD;
      integrative approach informed by the biopsychosocial model. It is increasingly recognized&#xD;
      that use of opioids for pain management is associated with risk of harm, yet treatment&#xD;
      studies of non-pharmacologic approaches remain limited. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction&#xD;
      (MBSR) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) teach skills intended to&#xD;
      enhance functionality and quality of life in the face of chronic pain. The proposed&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial will evaluate if MBSR and CBT-CP each result in improvements in&#xD;
      pain interference that are superior to usual care. Two hundred twenty-two Veterans with&#xD;
      chronic musculoskeletal pain will be randomized to MBSR, CBT-CP or usual care. Measures&#xD;
      pertaining to the primary outcome of pain interference will be collected at baseline, at the&#xD;
      post-MBSR/CBT-CP time point, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. In addition, measures of pain&#xD;
      intensity, depression, and treatment satisfaction will be applied to more fully characterize&#xD;
      the impact of MBSR relative to CBT-CP and usual care. Exploratory analyses will assess if&#xD;
      outcomes differ for MBSR and CBT-CP, the impact of the interventions on opioid use and&#xD;
      indicators of suicidality, and whether Veteran characteristics assessed at baseline function&#xD;
      as treatment moderators. Aims: Primary Aim: Assess if MBSR and CBT-CP each result in greater&#xD;
      reductions in the pain interference subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) as compared to&#xD;
      usual care, from baseline to 6 months post-treatment. Secondary Aim: Evaluate if MBSR and&#xD;
      CBT-CP are each superior to usual care in producing improvements in pain severity, treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction, and depression. Exploratory Aim 1: Evaluate whether outcomes for patients&#xD;
      randomized to MBSR and CBT-CP differ for changes in pain interference, pain severity,&#xD;
      depression, and treatment satisfaction. Exploratory Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of MBSR and&#xD;
      CBT-CP on utilization of opioid analgesics and markers of suicidality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 3: Evaluate moderators of response to MBSR and CBT-CP to lay the groundwork&#xD;
      for identifying Veterans more likely to succeed in one or the other treatment. Potential&#xD;
      moderators assessed will include: age, gender, baseline depressive symptoms, anxiety&#xD;
      sensitivity, and pain catastrophizing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A three-arm randomized controlled trial comparing MBSR, CBT-CP and usual care.&#xD;
      Participants: 222 Veterans at a large urban VA facility with chronic musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;
      Interventions: Group MBSR or group CBT-CP, each 8 weeks in duration. Analyses: Mixed models&#xD;
      with assess whether MBSR, CBT-CP each produce greater reductions in outcome variables from&#xD;
      baseline to follow-up compared to usual care. Implications: If MBSR and CBT-CP are each shown&#xD;
      to be superior to usual care for treatment of chronic pain among Veterans, it would support&#xD;
      providing MBSR and CBT-CP for this population.&#xD;

    <description>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the most widely used non-pharmacologic intervention for chronic pain and a version of CBT specifically addressing chronic pain (CBT-CP) has been developed for use in VA with Veterans.

At our site, the CBT-CP format has been adapted for clinical use (i.e., as part of usual clinical care) to 8 sessions in a group format, while retaining all essential elements.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must meet criteria for chronic musculoskeletal pain, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  musculoskeletal pain of low back&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  cervical spine, or extremities (hip, knee, or shoulder)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pain for at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pain severity (worst or average pain score 4)(i.e., score of 4 or greater on BPI items&#xD;
             3 or 5) and average pain interference (BPI items 9A-9G) rated 3 of 10 over prior week,&#xD;
             as measured using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        At baseline, the MINI psychiatric interview will determine psychiatric exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  uncontrolled psychotic disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  current bipolar affective disorder with mania&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  current suicidal or homicidal ideation with intent in the last month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  inpatient psychiatric admission within the past month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  severe medical conditions that would limit participation (e.g., Class III or IV heart&#xD;
             failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pending back surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional exclusion criteria include prior formal participation in MBSR or CBT-CP. The&#xD;
        investigators will include subjects with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD; defined by the MINI)&#xD;
        but exclude those for whom alcohol use poses a safety threat (defined as current drinking&#xD;
        and a past-year history of alcohol-related seizures or delirium tremens). The investigators&#xD;
        will also include those with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and other Substance Use Disorder&#xD;
        (SUD; each defined by the MINI).&#xD;
