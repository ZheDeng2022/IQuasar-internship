  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of CDK4/6 inhibitors has brought hope to breast cancer patients resistant to&#xD;
      endocrine therapy. In the mouse model, pyrotinib maleate combined with CDK4/6 inhibitor&#xD;
      exhibits higher anti-tumor activity than any anti-tumor drug alone. Moreover, the toxicity of&#xD;
      the combined therapy does not increase compared with monotherapy. This provides a good&#xD;
      preclinical model for the treatment of breast cancer by pyrotinib maleate combined with&#xD;
      CDK4/6 inhibitor. Based on above, it is hypothesized that pyrotinib maleate, CDK4/6 inhibitor&#xD;
      SHR6390 and aromatase inhibitor letrozole in combination can provide a better neoadjuvant&#xD;
      strategy for stage II-III triple-positive breast cancer.&#xD;

      This single-center, single-arm, open-label trial will include 89 patients with stage II-III&#xD;
      triple-positive breast cancer (Simon's two-stage design). After providing written informed&#xD;
      consent, the participants will undergo combined treatment of pyrotinib maleate, CDK4/6&#xD;
      inhibitor SHR6390, and letrozole. The effectiveness of the combined treatment will be&#xD;
      evaluated by MRI every two treatment cycles. If the disease progresses, the participant will&#xD;
      withdraw from the trial. If the combined treatment has identified effectiveness, the&#xD;
      participant will undergo surgical treatment within 4 weeks (over 2 weeks) after termination&#xD;
      of the neoadjuvant treatment. The patients will be followed up for 5 years.&#xD;
