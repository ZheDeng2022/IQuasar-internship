    <textblock>
      This randomized trial is evaluating whether socioeconomically disadvantaged Medicare patients&#xD;
      at increased risk of hospitalization experience fewer hospitalization if those patients are&#xD;
      offered care in: 1) ACCT, where patients receive care from different physicians in the&#xD;
      hospital and the clinic settings and have access to nurse and social worker care coordination&#xD;
      services, 2) CCP where patients receive care from one physician in the inpatient and&#xD;
      outpatient settings or 3) C4P which adds screening of unmet social needs, community health&#xD;
      worker support and arts and culture programming to CCP. The study will determine how these&#xD;
      programs affect patient activation and engagement in care, satisfaction with care, general&#xD;
      health and mental health, and goal attainment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health disparities and the health of communities are influenced both by the health care&#xD;
      system and by the social context in which people live. Accordingly, interventions that seek&#xD;
      to meaningfully reduce disparities should consider patients' medical and social needs. The&#xD;
      fragmentation of medical care is one aspect of the health care system that adversely affects&#xD;
      health, perhaps particularly for socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals with more&#xD;
      limited resources to bridge gaps in care. Indeed, while many care coordination programs have&#xD;
      been developed, evidence supporting their effectiveness is quite limited and especially for&#xD;
      vulnerable populations. This study will fill important gaps in evidence concerning the&#xD;
      effects of 3 diverse care coordination models on hospitalization rates for a&#xD;
      socioeconomically disadvantaged population at increased risk of hospitalization that is&#xD;
      served by the University of Chicago Medicine (UCM). Secondary outcomes include patient&#xD;
      activation and engagement with care, satisfaction with care, general health and mental health&#xD;
      and personal goal attainment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first model is an example of a commonly implemented class of care coordination models&#xD;
      that relies primarily on the use of care coordinators. The specific care coordinator (CC)&#xD;
      model that is being studied - the Partners HealthCare Care Management Program (PHCMP) - was&#xD;
      initially developed and studied by Partners HealthCare. In PHCMP, &quot;high-risk&quot; patients&#xD;
      (defined primarily as ≥2 hospitalizations in the year before enrollment) have access to nurse&#xD;
      care coordinators who seek to help manage the patient's care across the continuum. UCM's&#xD;
      Medicare Shared Savings Plan Accountable Care Organization has recently implemented a model&#xD;
      based on PHCMP that it calls the Ambulatory Care Coordination Team (ACCT). In ACCT, nurses&#xD;
      and social workers provide proactive care coordination to &quot;high-risk&quot; patients. CC and ACCT&#xD;
      are representative of common care coordination models implemented nationally. The fact that&#xD;
      these models typically involve hiring additional staff and increase the number of hand-offs&#xD;
      may explain why programs such as these have often failed to produce desired improvements in&#xD;
      health outcomes or decreases in utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second model is a novel care delivery program called the Comprehensive Care Physician&#xD;
      (CCP) program. The CCP model seeks to more effectively integrate inpatient and outpatient&#xD;
      care for patients at increased risk of hospitalization by offering them care from the same&#xD;
      physician in the inpatient and the outpatient settings so that these patients can benefit&#xD;
      from the advantages of continuity in the doctor patient relationship. Since 2012, the&#xD;
      investigators have developed and tested this model at UCM in a randomized trial funded by the&#xD;
      Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation comparing CCP to standard care (SC) in which&#xD;
      patients receive inpatient and outpatient care from different doctors and do not have access&#xD;
      to care coordinators. The investigators enrolled 2,000 patients in this study, of whom ~90%&#xD;
      are African American, with a median income of ~$20,000 per year and 1-year mortality rate of&#xD;
      15-20%. The results are striking: care ratings on Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare&#xD;
      Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) measures correspond to the 95th percentile nationally for CCP&#xD;
      patients vs. the 80th for SC, about 30% of CCP patients have a 1 point improvement in&#xD;
      self-rated mental health status (e.g., from good to very good) compared to SC patients,&#xD;
      hospitalizations are 20% lower over 1 year follow-up and 26% lower for CCP patients who&#xD;
      experienced ≥2 hospitalizations in the year before enrollment. We think the efficacy of this&#xD;
      model comes from the deep connection that the CCP team develops with patients, understanding&#xD;
      thise patients as individuals and recognizing and beginning to address the deeper social&#xD;
      determinants of their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third model, the Comprehensive Care, Community and Culture Program (C4P), builds on the&#xD;
      CCP program to better engage patients in their care. C4P was motivated by the finding that&#xD;
      ~30% of patients who enrolled in the CCP program did not engage with it despite having&#xD;
      expressed interest in the program and that a wide range of social factors might be barriers&#xD;
      to their engagement. To better address social determinants of health, C4P builds on CCP by&#xD;
      adding 1) systematic screening of 17 domains of unmet social needs, 2) access to a community&#xD;
      health worker and 3) access to community-based arts and culture programming. Preliminary&#xD;
      findings from a pilot of C4P indicate that unmet social needs are diverse, highly&#xD;
      concentrated in a small number of patients and linked to each other, presenting barriers to&#xD;
      addressing these needs. However, unmet needs were also found to cluster in ways that&#xD;
      suggested actionable strategies to address needs more effectively. Early results suggest that&#xD;
      C4P increases patient activation and engagement in care compared to CCP and SC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While we have rigorously compared CCP to SC and performed a pilot study of C4P, CCP and SC at&#xD;
      UCM, we have not compared CCP or C4P to the more commonly-used CC model, nor have we&#xD;
      performed an adequately powered study comparing CCP and C4P. The rigorous findings comparing&#xD;
      these models that we will generate are sorely needed by patients and health systems to inform&#xD;
      choices about care coordination models, and particularly for socioeconomically disadvantaged&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 2 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To compare the effect of 3 models of care on hospitalization (primary outcome) and&#xD;
      patient activation, engagement in care, satisfaction, health outcomes and goal attainment&#xD;
      over 1 year for patients at increased risk of hospitalization: 1) a care coordinator (CC)&#xD;
      model in which patients receive inpatient and outpatient care from different physicians with&#xD;
      access to care coordinator services for patients identified as at high risk of&#xD;
      hospitalization, 2) the Comprehensive Care Physician (CCP) program in which patients at&#xD;
      increased risk of hospitalization can receive inpatient and outpatient care from the same&#xD;
      physician and 3) the Comprehensive Care, Community and Culture Program(C4P), which enhances&#xD;
      CCP care with systematic screening for unmet social needs, access to a community health&#xD;
      worker and access to programming to better engage patients and address their unmet social&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine whether the effects of the 3 models differ based on the number of&#xD;
      hospitalizations that a patient has experienced in the year before entering these models of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description: This study is a randomized clinical trial that compares 3 approaches to&#xD;
      care for patients at increased risk of hospitalization: 1) ACCT in which patients receive&#xD;
      inpatient and outpatient care from different doctors with the option to receive care from UCM&#xD;
      physicians and care coordination from nurses and social workers who manage their care with&#xD;
      the larger clinical team, 2) CCP in which patients receive care from the same UCM physician&#xD;
      in the inpatient and outpatient settings and 3) C4P in which patients receive care from a CCP&#xD;
      in addition to systematic screening of unmet social needs and access to a community health&#xD;
      worker and community based arts and culture programming. Patients are insured by Medicare or&#xD;
      Medicare and Medicaid, be at increased risk of hospitalization based on a history of prior&#xD;
      hospitalization or emergency department use and be recruited from mixed, but predominantly&#xD;
      low-income communities on Chicago's South Side. A total of 3,000 patients will be recruited,&#xD;
      with 1,000 patients in the ACCT, CCP and C4P arms. The primary outcome is hospitalization&#xD;
      because of its importance to both patients and health systems. Our primary measure of&#xD;
      hospitalization is the number of hospitalizations over 1 year measured in Medicare claims&#xD;
      data. Other outcomes are patient activation and engagement in care (measured using the&#xD;
      Patient Activation Measure and the rate of completion of primary care visits), satisfaction&#xD;
      with care (measured using HCAHPS scores), self-rated general and mental health status, and&#xD;
      goal attainment.&#xD;
