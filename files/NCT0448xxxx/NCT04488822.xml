  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess pexidartinib in adult participants with symptomatic TGCT that is&#xD;
      associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations and not amendable to improvement&#xD;
      with surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with symptomatic TGCT will be administered pexidartinib 400 mg twice daily&#xD;
      continuously with 28-day treatment cycle until criteria for discontinuation are reached.&#xD;
      Participants who complete primary endpoint assessments may be eligible to continue receiving&#xD;
      pexidartinib until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, the occurrence of other&#xD;
      termination criteria, or withdrawal from the study. Eligible participants' status will be&#xD;
      collected every 6 months as a long term follow-up at least 2 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Asian Participants With Symptomatic Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (TGCT) Achieving Complete or Partial Response to Pexidartinib Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 at Week 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 25 postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response (CR) and partial responses (PR) will be assessed based on centrally-read magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). A CR is defined as disappearance of all tumors and a PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target tumors using the baseline sum diameters as the reference.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Symptomatic Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (TGCT) Achieving Complete or Partial Response Based on Tumor Volume Score (TVS) by Centrally Reviewed MRI Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 25 postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) will be assessed using tumor volume score (TVS). A CR is defined as disappearance of all tumors and a PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target tumors using the baseline sum diameters as the reference. TVS is a semi-quantitative MRI scoring system that describes tumor mass and is based on 10% increments of the estimated volume of the maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath involved. A tumor that is equal in volume to that of a maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath was scored 10; a score of 0 indicated no evidence of tumor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline For Range of Motion (ROM) Score in Participants Receiving Pexidartinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 25 postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion (ROM) of the joint will be assessed by a qualified, independent, and blinded or third-party assessors at the clinical site. Measurements will be recorded in degrees. At baseline, the plane of movement with the smallest relative value (worst) will be identified and this plane will be used for evaluating the relative change of motion subsequently. Only the plane with the worst impaired ROM at baseline will be selected for subsequent analyses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Score in Participants Receiving Pexidartinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 25 postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) physical function scale will be used to assess physical function of the upper and lower limbs. The scale ranges from 1 defined as 'unable to do' or 'cannot do' to 5 defined as 'without any difficulty' or 'not at all', where higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall Response of Pexidartinib Based on RECIST 1.1 and TVS by Centrally Reviewed MRI Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 157 postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The overall number of responses and the number of participants with and without disease progression will be assessed. Tumor Volume Score (TVS) is a semi-quantitative MRI scoring system that describes tumor mass and is based on 10% increments of the estimated volume of the maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath involved. A tumor that is equal in volume to that of a maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath is scored 10; a score of 0 indicates no evidence of tumor. The overall number of responses and the number of participants with and without disease progression will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response of Pexidartinib Based on RECIST 1.1 and TVS by Centrally Reviewed MRI Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 157 postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (DOR) based on RECIST 1.1 is defined as the date of the first recorded response to the first date of documented disease progression. Tumor Volume Score (TVS) is a semi-quantitative MRI scoring system that describes tumor mass and is based on 10% increments of the estimated volume of the maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath involved. A tumor that is equal in volume to that of a maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath is scored 10; a score of 0 indicates no evidence of tumor. The Duration of response of participants with and without disease progression will be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Reporting Frequent (≥10%) Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Preferred Term</measure>
    <time_frame>After the first dose of treatment up to 28 days after the last dose, up to approximately 1 year 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as adverse events that starts or worsens after the first dose of treatment and within 28 days after the last dose. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0 will be used to grade adverse events. Any Grade and Grade ≥3 (severe) TEAEs will be reported. TEAEs will be coded using MedDRA version 17.1.</description>
