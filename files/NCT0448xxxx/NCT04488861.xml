  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the feasibility of a translational research clinic for pregnancies&#xD;
      conceived by in vitro fertilisation (IVF). A group of at least 120 pregnancies (of which, at&#xD;
      least 80 IVF-conceived) will be followed from early pregnancy to delivery, in order to gain&#xD;
      early insights into the growth of the baby before birth, the physical and emotional&#xD;
      adaptation of the mother to the pregnancy and how the placenta works. The investigators will&#xD;
      collect preliminary data on how these factors may differ between pregnancies conceived with&#xD;
      and without IVF, and between different IVF treatment modalities such as fresh or &quot;frozen&quot;&#xD;
      embryo transfer IVF. The study aims to understand the practicalities of such a clinic, to&#xD;
      identify barriers to participation in the clinic, to assess the uptake of different research&#xD;
      measurements and to identify key measurements/time points with the greatest potential to&#xD;
      identify and understand the origin of fetal growth and maternal adaptation differences after&#xD;
      IVF conception in a full scale study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to test the feasibility of establishing the first&#xD;
      IVF-conceived pregnancy antenatal clinic specifically to collect longitudinal data relating&#xD;
      to the growth of the baby in the womb, how the mother's heart and blood vessels adapt to the&#xD;
      increased workload of pregnancy, and how the mother's emotional health (particularly stress&#xD;
      and anxiety) varies throughout pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of the study protocol will be assessed using stop/go (or progression)&#xD;
      criteria, to help determine whether future, larger scale studies of the same should be&#xD;
      commenced. The information gathered to answer the primary and secondary outcomes of the&#xD;
      study's primary objective will be essential for understanding, and overcoming, potential&#xD;
      barriers to recruitment to future cohort studies within the clinic. It will enable the&#xD;
      researchers to plan future studies with sufficient sample size to answer the specified&#xD;
      question, realistic recruitment targets and timescales to achieve this, and using&#xD;
      investigations that are shown to be acceptable to the majority of individuals in the target&#xD;
      population. The secondary objective of the study is to gather preliminary data relating to&#xD;
      the effects of fresh and frozen embryo transfer IVF on fetal, maternal and placental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is based on the design of several successful pregnancy cohort studies (such as the&#xD;
      Tommy's Project), which run through five translational research clinics in St. Mary's&#xD;
      Hospital, Manchester University Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust:&#xD;
      VELOCITY clinic, Lupus in Pregnancy service, Manchester Placenta Clinic, Rainbow clinic and&#xD;
      Manchester Antenatal Vascular Service. The START clinic replicates the model of care offered&#xD;
      through these existing clinics, offering the same levels of specialised, continuity of care&#xD;
      to individuals who have conceived by IVF. These successful recruitment and retention within&#xD;
      these studies gives confidence in the acceptability of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a cohort study. This is where individual participants can be divided into&#xD;
      groups by specified characteristics, in this case whether or not they had conceived by IVF or&#xD;
      not (or sub-categorised by individual factors within the IVF treatment process, such as&#xD;
      whether the embryo was transferred fresh or after a period of cryopreservation). No active&#xD;
      intervention (medicine or procedure) will be administered during the study. However, it is&#xD;
      known that health outcomes of individuals participating in research may be influenced by the&#xD;
      experience of participating in the study itself. For this reason the investigators will also&#xD;
      recruit &quot;control&quot; participants (those who have conceived without IVF, either spontaneously or&#xD;
      with medication to aid the release of eggs, known as ovulation induction). By comparing the&#xD;
      two groups, this will enable the research to isolate the specific effects of the&#xD;
      IVF-conception, from the effects of being highly monitored in a research study. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to recruit a minimum of 120 individuals across a period of three years,&#xD;
      with approximately 4 individuals who have conceived by IVF to every 1 individual who has&#xD;
      conceived without IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appointments in the START clinic will be arranged roughly 4-6 weekly (at approximately 9, 17,&#xD;
      23, 28, 33, 37 and 41 weeks). At each appointment the patient will be reviewed by a doctor&#xD;
      and midwife from a small team of clinicians who will provide continuity of care. Routine&#xD;
      scheduled antenatal care will be performed, along with additional measurements of fetal and&#xD;
      placental growth and cardiovascular function, questionnaires relating to environmental&#xD;
      exposures, modifiable risks, and emotional health, and samples of maternal blood, urine,&#xD;
      saliva and hair. More frequent appointments will be scheduled according to local hospital&#xD;
      guidance if complications of pregnancy are suspected or confirmed, this may mean that&#xD;
      clinical measurements and ultrasound examinations are performed more frequently than at the&#xD;
      planned study visits. Questionnaires and biological samples will only be&#xD;
      administered/obtained at the (study visit closest to) stated gestational intervals.&#xD;
      Participants will be made aware of which measurements are part of standard antenatal care and&#xD;
      which investigations are for research; research measurements will be analysed blinded to&#xD;
      participant identity/pregnancy outcome after conclusion of the pregnancy and will not&#xD;
      contribute to their care during or after the pregnancy. Participants can decline particular&#xD;
      investigations entirely or on occasion without detriment to their overall care. Where&#xD;
      necessary, according to the individual needs of the participant, antenatal care will be&#xD;
      shared with community midwives and other antenatal services where additional appointments are&#xD;
      required outside the stated schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At birth, the placenta and fetal blood contained within it after clamping of the umbilical&#xD;
      cord, will be collected. Placental tissue may be used immediately after birth in experiments&#xD;
      to study how it functions, or small amounts may be processed and stored (according to local&#xD;
      standard operating procedures) for later assessment of its structure and functional&#xD;
      footprint. Should histopathological examination of the placenta be indicated for clinical&#xD;
      reasons (&lt;5% of all pregnancies), the remaining placental tissue will be made available for&#xD;
      this purpose according to standard local protocols for combined research and&#xD;
      histopathological placental examination; otherwise unused placental tissue will be disposed&#xD;
      sensitively according to local National Health Service procedures. Prior to discharge from&#xD;
      the hospital, and preferably within 3 days of birth, the baby will be measured (using a tape&#xD;
      measure) once for head, abdominal and thigh circumference, and length. Their skinfold&#xD;
      thickness (to measure fat depth) over the shoulder blade and under the upper arm will be&#xD;
      measured using purpose-built callipers. The baby will be kept warm and comfortable&#xD;
      throughout, and the examination paused or stopped should the baby show distress, need feeding&#xD;
      or changing or any medical intervention be required.&#xD;
