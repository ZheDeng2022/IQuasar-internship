  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess validity of extended duplex ultrasound examination for&#xD;
      diagnosis of proximal deep vein thrombosis performed by general intensive care unit nurses in&#xD;
      the critically ill patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit are in increased risk of&#xD;
      proximal deep vein thrombosis despite thromboprophylactic measures. Diagnostic method of the&#xD;
      first choice is Point-of-Care ultrasound examination. This method is usually performed by a&#xD;
      trained intensive care physician. However, if this examination could be performed by trained&#xD;
      nurses, its availability would be greatly increased. The results of the investigator's pilot&#xD;
      study showed that general nurses are able to diagnose proximal deep vein thrombosis in&#xD;
      critically ill patients by compression ultrasound test with a sensitivity of 88,9 % and a&#xD;
      specificity of 99 %. Before implementation of this examination into the optional competencies&#xD;
      of general nurses, the results need to be confirmed in a larger group of patients. This is&#xD;
      the goal of proposed clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective observational study, the patients will be investigated by extended duplex&#xD;
      ultrasound (compression ultrasound test combined with colour doppler imaging in the range&#xD;
      from the groin to the popliteal region) by a trained nurse and on the same day, the&#xD;
      examination will be repeated by a trained physician - intensivist. The results of the&#xD;
      examinations of each patient will be blinded until both tests will be performed.&#xD;
