      Until recently, there was no validated scoring tool to assess recovery after childbirth.&#xD;
      Ciechanowicz et al. developed and validated a postpartum recovery score for women with a&#xD;
      caesarean section (scheduled or unscheduled): the ObsQoR-11. The psychometric validation of&#xD;
      the ObsQoR-11 confirms its reliability, its response to change, its acceptability and its&#xD;
      feasibility (average filling time of 2 minutes, and the possibility to print the&#xD;
      questionnaire on one page). The use of this score allows the investigators to quantify the&#xD;
      quality of the patient's recovery between 0 and 110 (0 being a really poor recovery, and 110&#xD;
      a total recovery), by allocating a score from 0 to 10 for each item.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then, the initial version of ObsQoR-11 has evolved into a smaller version, ObsQoR-10,&#xD;
      for which the pain items have been merged. Similarly, by assigning a score from 0 to 10 for&#xD;
      each item, the ObsQoR-10 score allows to quantify the quality of the patient's recovery&#xD;
      between 0 and 100 (0 being a very poor recovery, and 100 being full recovery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no translations of this score into another language, but the&#xD;
      investigators can easily assume that they will be done in the near future. French remains the&#xD;
      fifth most spoken language in the world. The investigators therefore feel it is necessary to&#xD;
      validate the translated version of the ObsQoR-10 score.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recovery after childbirth (by caesarean section or vaginal delivery) is a complex process,&#xD;
      depending on the characteristics of the patient, the anaesthesia, and the need for surgery or&#xD;
      an instrumental device. This event is a source of stress, anxiety and pain, and can also lead&#xD;
      to postpartum complications. Studies evaluating interventions during childbirth traditionally&#xD;
      focus on mortality and morbidity which, although important, do not describe the patient's&#xD;
      experience or the quality of her recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scores for measuring the quality of post-operative recovery have been developed. These&#xD;
      scoring tools accurately measure post-operative recovery by looking at some dimensions of the&#xD;
      patient's experience. However, they have been developed and validated in non-obstetrical&#xD;
      patients. They therefore contain aspects of recovery that are not relevant to delivery and&#xD;
      postpartum. Furthermore, they do not include key elements, such as the ability to care for&#xD;
      the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, there was no validated scoring tool to assess recovery after childbirth.&#xD;
      Ciechanowicz et al. developed and validated a postpartum recovery score for women with a&#xD;
      caesarean section (scheduled or unscheduled): the ObsQoR-11. This multidimensional score is a&#xD;
      questionnaire of 11 items evaluating: moderate pain, severe pain, nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      feeling of discomfort, shivering, feeling of comfort, ability to mobilize, ability to carry&#xD;
      the newborn, ability to feed, ability to groom alone, and finally feeling of self-control.&#xD;
      The psychometric validation of the ObsQoR-11 confirms its reliability, its response to&#xD;
      change, its acceptability and its feasibility (average filling time of 2 minutes, and the&#xD;
      possibility to print the questionnaire on one page). The use of this score allows to quantify&#xD;
      the quality of the patient's recovery between 0 and 110 (0 being a really poor recovery, and&#xD;
      110 a total recovery), by allocating a score from 0 to 10 for each item.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This tool has the advantage of efficiently evaluating the concept of immediate postpartum&#xD;
      recovery, with an acceptable feasibility for both the patient and the caregivers. Since then,&#xD;
      the initial version of ObsQoR-11 has evolved into a smaller version, ObsQoR-10, for which the&#xD;
      pain items have been merged. Similarly, by assigning a score from 0 to 10 for each item, the&#xD;
      ObsQoR-10 score allows to quantify the quality of the patient's recovery between 0 and 100 (0&#xD;
      being a very poor recovery, and 100 being full recovery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no translations of this score into another language, but the&#xD;
      investigators can easily assume that they will be done in the near future. French remains the&#xD;
      fifth most spoken language in the world. The investigators therefore feel it is necessary to&#xD;
      validate the translated version of the ObsQoR-10 score.&#xD;

    <description>The ObsQoR-10F questionnaire consists of 10 items assessing different aspects of postpartum recovery: physical comfort and pain, physical independence and emotional status. It takes two minutes to complete all the items. If the patient is not able to read the questionnaire herself, a third person can ask the questions orally to the patient. If the patient has returned home with her child, she can be contacted by phone to complete the questionnaire. Each item is scored from 0 to 10 and the total score is the sum of the score for each item, which is a score from 0 to 110.</description>
