  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to determine the incidence of dysphagia and vocal fold mobility&#xD;
      impairment (VFMI) in individuals undergoing throacic surgical procedures. It also seeks to&#xD;
      determine the impact of postoperative swallowing impairment on health-related outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing impairment and VFMI are common, yet often overlooked, complications of thoracic&#xD;
      surgical procedures. The true incidence of both dysphagia and VFMI in this patient population&#xD;
      is unclear due to a lack of rigorous study using instrumental assessment techniques and&#xD;
      validated outcomes in all patents undergoing thoracic surgery. The study is therefore aimed&#xD;
      to determine the incidence of dysphagia and VFMI in this patient population and to&#xD;
      characterize impairment profiles related to swallowing safety and efficiency. In addition,&#xD;
      the study is also aimed to assess the relative impact of VFMI and dysphagia on health-related&#xD;
      outcomes such as length of hospital stay, pneumonia, sepsis, reintubation, and discharge&#xD;
      status&#xD;

    <measure>Penetration Aspiration Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a validated measure used by trained blinded clinicians to assign ratings of safety to swallowing bolus trials. The development and use of an 8-point, equal-appearing interval scale (8 being best; 1 being worst) to describe penetration and aspiration events are described. Scores are determined primarily by the depth to which material passes in the airway and by whether or not material entering the airway is expelled.</description>

    <measure>Yale Residue Severity Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a validated measure used by trained blinded clinicians to assign ratings of efficiency to swallowing bolus trials. The Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale was developed, standardized, and validated to provide reliable, anatomically defined, and image-based assessment of post-swallow pharyngeal residue severity as observed during fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). It is a five-point ordinal rating scale based on residue location (vallecula and pyriform sinus) and amount (none, trace, mild, moderate, and severe).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Vocal Fold Mobility Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>During a Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES), the vocal folds will be visualized using a small camera passed through the open nasal passage. The patient will be asked to make a series of vocal tasks so that we can visualize their movement, any immobility will be notated.</description>
