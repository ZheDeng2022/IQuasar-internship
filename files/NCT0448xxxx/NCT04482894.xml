  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the potential benefit of early and continued&#xD;
      palliative care (PC) consultation on end of life issues.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will be randomized to either an intervention group or a standard&#xD;
      of care group. Participants in the intervention group will participate in regular visits with&#xD;
      a palliative (or supportive) care specialist, while participants in the standard of care&#xD;
      group will only see palliative care specialists if the clinician requests a referral. All&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete monthly questionnaires regarding their general&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have a greater chance of being assigned to the intervention group than to the&#xD;
      standard of care group. On average, in every 5 people randomized, 3 will be randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention and 2 will be randomized to standard of care.&#xD;

    <description>Participants on this arm will see a palliative care specialist twice a week while they are in the hospital and about every other week when they are out of the hospital. If participants see their oncologist less often than every other week while they're out of the hospital, then visits with the palliative care specialist would be timed to occur on the same day as the oncologist visit. Participants will complete a questionnaire about once a month.</description>
