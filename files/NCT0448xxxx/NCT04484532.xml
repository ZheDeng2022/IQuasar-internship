      This pilot research trial studies the antibody response to high-dose seasonal influenza&#xD;
      vaccination in patients with myeloid malignancy receiving chemotherapy and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Evaluating antibody response to high-dose seasonal influenza vaccine may serve as&#xD;
      a basis for vaccine recommendations in patients with myeloid malignancies and provide&#xD;
      insights into the status of the immune system in these patients.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the antibody response to influenza vaccination in patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) receiving hypomethylating agents&#xD;
      (decitabine or azacytidine) compared to normal healthy controls and those patients with&#xD;
      similar disorders receiving cytarabine containing intensive chemotherapy or best supportive&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To collect and store blood samples at different time points (prior to and after&#xD;
      vaccination) for assessment of influenza specific T-cell subsets using tetramers by flow&#xD;
      cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 14 days of baseline influenza titer, patients receive trivalent influenza vaccine&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM) on day 0 (patients in cohorts 1 and 5 receive the vaccine at any time,&#xD;
      patients in cohorts 2 and 3 receive the vaccine between days 14-25 of hypomethylating agent&#xD;
      therapy course, and patients in cohort 4 receive the vaccine between days 21-365 from onset&#xD;
      of cytotoxic chemotherapy). Patients then undergo titer assessment at days 25-90 and days&#xD;
      115-185.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 4-6 months post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The geometric mean (GMT) and standard deviation of antibody titers will be calculated by cohort at the baseline assessment and 1-3 months post vaccination time points. Antibody response is assessed using the outcome measures: seroprotection, seroconversion, and GMT. Seroprotection is defined as an hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer &gt;= 1:40 of each individual influenza antigen. Seroconversion is defined as &gt;= 4-fold increase in post-vaccination titer of each individual influenza antigen. The seroprotection and seroconversion rates will be reported by age strata, cohort, and time-point (1-3 months and 4-6 months post vaccination) using 95% confidence intervals obtained using Jeffrey's prior method. The GMT at each time-point will be compared using one-sided permutation T-tests about the log-transformed data. The GMT ratio (GMTR) between 1-3 months post vaccination and baseline will also be calculated and reported by cohort using a 95% confidence interval.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>T-cell subset population assessed using flow cytometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4-6 months post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>T-cell subset populations will be correlated with antibody responses to influenza vaccination. Blood samples will be collected and stored at different time-points for assessment of T-cell response to influenza vaccination using influenza specific tetramer staining by flow cytometry. The seroprotection and seroconversion rates will be reported by cohort and time-point (1-3 months and 4-6 months post vaccination) using 95% confidence intervals obtained using Jeffrey's prior method. The rates will be compared between the lenalidomide and healthy control cohorts using one-sided Barnard's tests. The GMTR between 1-3 months post vaccination and baseline will also be calculated and reported by cohort using a 95% confidence interval.</description>
