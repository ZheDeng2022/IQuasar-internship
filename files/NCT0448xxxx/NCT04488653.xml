    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of Oligopin® will be compared against a placebo to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect on metabolic risk factors in subjects with metabolic syndrome. During the 84-day study&#xD;
      period it is hypothesized that HDL cholesterol will increase and systolic blood pressure will&#xD;
      decrease therefore lowering CVD risk factors after supplementation with Oligopin®.&#xD;
      Additionally, it is hypothesized that Oligopin® supplementation will reduce fasting glucose&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a combination of risk factors for chronic conditions such as&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). These risk factors include obesity&#xD;
      (particularly abdominal obesity), high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, low&#xD;
      high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and elevated fasting blood glucose. MetS reflects&#xD;
      overnutrition and sedentary lifestyles as the prevalence of MetS increases concomitantly with&#xD;
      these lifestyle choices. Most recent estimates suggest that approximately 19.1% of the&#xD;
      Canadian population, 34.2% of the US population, and 24.3% of the European population have&#xD;
      MetS. Significantly, the prevalence of MetS in adults aged 18-39 has increased dramatically&#xD;
      over the last 2 decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MetS commonly precedes the development of CVD and is associated with a 2-fold increase in the&#xD;
      risk of CVD mortality. MetS also increases the risk of developing T2D and is suggested to be&#xD;
      extremely prevalent (90-95%) in Caucasian individuals diagnosed with T2D. Indeed, the&#xD;
      presence of even one MetS risk factor early in life increases the chances of developing a&#xD;
      chronic disease later in life. Currently, MetS risk factors are estimated to be present in&#xD;
      4.8-7% of individuals from 18 to 30 years of age. Therefore, preventing the development of or&#xD;
      treating these risk factors earlier in life could reduce the development of chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenic mechanisms of MetS remain to be fully elucidated, however insulin resistance&#xD;
      (IR) appears to play a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of the syndrome.&#xD;
      Abdominal obesity is a well-known contributor to IR. Abdominal fat accumulation increases the&#xD;
      supply of free fatty acids (FFAs) to the liver and indirectly results in an increase in&#xD;
      plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and a decrease in HDL cholesterol. IR also&#xD;
      elevates fasting blood glucose levels due to the suppression of hepatic glycogen synthesis&#xD;
      and impairs postprandial glucose control by reducing insulin stimulated glucose uptake by&#xD;
      peripheral tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for natural interventions that aid in the prevention and treatment of MetS&#xD;
      risk factors as the prevalence of overnutrition and sedentary lifestyles continues to&#xD;
      increase. This study will assess the ability of Oligopin® to improve abdominal obesity,&#xD;
      fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose and insulin response, and HDL-cholesterol levels&#xD;
      as these outcomes reliably predict an individual's MetS risk. Oligopin® is a French Maritime&#xD;
      Pine Bark Extract (FMPBE) obtained from the pine tree Pinus pinaster. It is rich in low&#xD;
      molecular weight oligomeric procyanidins (OPC) with 20% of OPCs in the form of dimers as&#xD;
      compared to the most studied FMPBE Pycogenol®, which contains only 5% of OPCs as dimers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Oligopin® supplementation was shown to reduce CVD risk factors. In a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, Oligopin® consumption increased HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol levels and reduced systolic blood pressure and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) levels in&#xD;
      stage 1 hypertensive individuals. This is significant as low HDL was reported to be the most&#xD;
      prevalent risk factor for the development of MetS in young adults. FMPBE supplementation has&#xD;
      also been shown to reduce fasting glucose levels in individuals with T2D. Interestingly,&#xD;
      FMPBE is a potent inhibitor of α-glucosidase, which catalyses the breakdown of&#xD;
      oligosaccharides in the small intestine to permit glucose resorption. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      possible that Oligopin® may reduce fasting glucose levels and control postprandial&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of Oligopin® to improve markers of metabolic risk in subjects with MetS.&#xD;
