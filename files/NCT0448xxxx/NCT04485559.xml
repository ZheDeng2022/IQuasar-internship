      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib and everolimus in&#xD;
      treating pediatric and young adult patients with low grade gliomas that has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent). Trametinib acts by targeting a protein in cells called MEK and disrupting tumor&#xD;
      growth. Everolimus is a drug that may block another pathway in tumor cells that can help&#xD;
      tumors grow. Giving trametinib and everolimus may work better to treat low grade gliomas&#xD;
      compared to trametinib or everolimus alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of trametinib given orally in combination&#xD;
      with everolimus in pediatric and young adult patients with low-grade gliomas (LGGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the toxicity profile and define the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the&#xD;
      combination of trametinib and everolimus in pediatric and young adult patients with recurrent&#xD;
      LGGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of trametinib and everolimus when given in&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the objective response rate and the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) of&#xD;
      LGGs to this therapy in the context of a phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess quality of life (QOL) and cognitive measures in pediatric and young adult&#xD;
      patients with LGGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify potential predictive biomarkers to targeted therapy in pediatric and young&#xD;
      adult patients with LGGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess endocrine outcomes in pediatric and young adult patients with LGGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore magnetic resonance (MR) quantitative measures of relative cerebral blood&#xD;
      volume, permeability and apparent diffusion coefficient within the region of hyperintensity&#xD;
      on T2-weighted images as markers of disease response and/or progression in comparison to&#xD;
      institutional evaluation of disease response and/or progression and quantitative measures of&#xD;
      tumor response as determined by central review (based upon both area and volumetric&#xD;
      measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive a combination of trametinib orally (PO) and everolimus in either of two&#xD;
      dosing scheduled (continuous and intermittent). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      1 year, then every 6 months for 5 years from the start of therapy.&#xD;

    <description>We will employ the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design to find the MTD for both continuous and intermittent dosing schedules. The BOIN design is implemented in a simple way similar to the traditional 3+3 design, but is more flexible and possesses superior operating characteristics that are comparable to those of the more complex model-based designs, such as the continual reassessment method (CRM).</description>

    <measure>Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)</measure>

This computation is implemented by the shiny app &quot;BOIN&quot; available at http://www.trialdesign.org. Specifically, select as the RP2D the dose for which the isotonic estimate of the toxicity rate is closest to the target toxicity rate.</description>
