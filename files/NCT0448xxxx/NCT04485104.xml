  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      GWP42003-P compared with standard of care (SOC) antiepileptic drug (AED) assessed during the&#xD;
      17-week treatment period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be comprised of 2 parts: Part A will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of cannabidiol oral solution (OS) compared with SOC treatment for a period of 17 weeks in&#xD;
      participants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The duration of Part A will be&#xD;
      approximately 29 weeks total, which includes a 1- to 2-week screening period, a 4-week&#xD;
      baseline period, and a 17-week treatment period (including a 2- to 5- week titration period).&#xD;
      For participants who do not wish to continue into Part B of the trial, there will be an up to&#xD;
      2-week taper period and a safety follow-up period (4 weeks after the end-of-taper visit).&#xD;
      Part B will be available to participants who complete Part A of the trial and continue to&#xD;
      meet all eligibility criteria, and for participants whom the investigator feels continued&#xD;
      treatment in Part B represents a favorable risk-benefit assessment for the participant. Part&#xD;
      B will evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of cannabidiol OS for a period of 52&#xD;
      weeks in participants with TSC. All participants in Part B will receive cannabidiol OS. The&#xD;
      duration of Part B will be approximately 59 weeks total, including a 2- to 5-week titration&#xD;
      period for those participants randomized to SOC treatment only in Part A of the trial, a&#xD;
      2-week taper period, and a safety follow-up period (4 weeks and end-of-taper visit).&#xD;
