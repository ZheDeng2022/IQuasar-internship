  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hoped that a medicine called TAK-951 will eventually be used to treat nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting. Before then, the sponsor needs to understand how the body processes TAK-951 in&#xD;
      healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check for side effects from TAK-951 when given at a slow and fast infusion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn how much TAK-951 participants can receive without getting side effects from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a single infusion of either TAK-951 or placebo. In this study, a&#xD;
      placebo looks like TAK-951 but does not have any medicine in it. Participants will receive&#xD;
      either a low dose or high dose of TAK-951. The infusion will take from 1-3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the study clinic for about 4 days to receive the study medicine&#xD;
      (TAK-951 or placebo) and check for side effects. They will have follow-up visits at the&#xD;
      clinic about 2 weeks and 4 weeks after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-951. The study will evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and PK of TAK-951 in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 40 healthy participants. Each cohort will have 8&#xD;
      participants to be randomized and a minimum of 3 cohorts will be evaluated. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to receive TAK-951 or placebo in a 6:2&#xD;
      ratio in one of the following 3 cohorts, which will remain undisclosed to the participant and&#xD;
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 (Low Dose): TAK-951 20 mcg Infusion Over 60 Minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 (High Dose): TAK-951 1 mg Infusion Over 60 Minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: TAK-951 1 mg Infusion over 120 Minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel dosing will be done in first 2 participants in each cohort. The dosing in rest of&#xD;
      the cohort will done if there are no significant safety or tolerability concerns. Additional&#xD;
      2 cohorts, each cohort with 8 participants may be added in study to evaluate additional&#xD;
      intravenous dosing regimen after clinical data analysis of first 3 cohorts. Dosing of the&#xD;
      subsequent cohort will be based on the analysis of the previous cohort's data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is up to 57 days. All participants will return to clinic after 14&#xD;
      and 28 days after the last visit to the clinic for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
