      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate bintrafusp alfa monotherapy in participants&#xD;
      with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who express high levels of HMGA2 as determined by a&#xD;
      centralized reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participants have histologically or cytologically confirmed TNBC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor, and&#xD;
             progesterone receptor expression must be documented (criteria for defining TNBC are&#xD;
             outlined in the protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have received at least one line of systemic therapy for metastatic&#xD;
             disease and have progressed on the line of therapy immediately prior to study entry.&#xD;
             There is no limit to the number of prior therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may prescreen for HMGA2 expression while on preceding treatment, however&#xD;
             screening should only occur if in the opinion of the Investigator, the participant&#xD;
             would likely be eligible for study within 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of either archival tumor tissue or fresh core or excisional biopsy of a&#xD;
             tumor lesion (primary or metastatic, excluding bone biopsies) is mandatory to&#xD;
             determine HMGA2 expression level prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HMGA2 high tumor expression is required and will be determined by a central lab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 0 to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants have a life expectancy greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 12 weeks as judged&#xD;
             by the Investigator at study start&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants have adequate hematological, hepatic and renal and coagulation function&#xD;
             as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections are in general&#xD;
             eligible if the criteria as defined in the protocol are met (Food and Drug&#xD;
             Administration [FDA] Guidance on Cancer Clinical Trial Eligibility, March 2019)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections&#xD;
             are in general eligible if the criteria as defined in the protocol are met (FDA&#xD;
             Guidance on Cancer Clinical Trial Eligibility, March 2019)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with active central nervous system (CNS) metastases causing clinical&#xD;
             symptoms or metastases that require therapeutic intervention are excluded.&#xD;
             Participants with a history of treated CNS metastases (by surgery or radiation&#xD;
             therapy) are not eligible unless they have fully recovered from treatment,&#xD;
             demonstrated no progression for at least 4 weeks, and are not using steroids for at&#xD;
             least 7 days prior to the start of study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have received prior cancer treatment with any other&#xD;
             immunotherapy or checkpoint inhibitors, or any other immune-modulating monoclonal&#xD;
             antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants that received any organ transplantation, including stem-cell&#xD;
             transplantation, but with the exception of transplants that do not require&#xD;
             immunosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with significant acute or chronic infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an&#xD;
             immunostimulatory agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with clinically significant cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
             including: cerebral vascular accident/stroke, myocardial infarction, unstable angina,&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, or serious cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
