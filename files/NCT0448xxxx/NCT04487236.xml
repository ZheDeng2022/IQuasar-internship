  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase 1, multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      PK and efficacy of ZN-A-1041 as a monotherapy or in combination with Capecitabine in patients&#xD;
      with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors with or without brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of three phases: phase 1a (dose escalation with ZN-A-1041&#xD;
      monotherapy), phase 1b (dose escalation with ZN-A-1041 and Capecitabine combination therapy)&#xD;
      and phase 1c (dose expansion with ZN-A-1041 and Capecitabine combination therapy).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1a of the study will adopt the &quot;modified 3+3&quot; dose escalation design with a total of 7&#xD;
      planned dose levels. Patients with HER2-positive advanced solid tumor (including those with&#xD;
      brain metastases) will be enrolled to receive a single-dose administration of ZN-A-1041&#xD;
      followed by multiple-dose administration of ZN-A-1041.Phase 1b of the study will adopt the&#xD;
      &quot;traditional 3+3&quot; dose escalation design with a total of 2 planned dose levels. The dose&#xD;
      levels will be determined based on the MTD identified in the phase 1a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 1b, patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (including those with brain&#xD;
      metastases) will be enrolled to receive multiple doses of ZN-A-1041 in combination with&#xD;
      Capecitabine. Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with brain metastases were planned to&#xD;
      be enrolled in the Phase 1c of the study to receive ZN-A-1041 in combination with&#xD;
      Capecitabine. The dose levels will be determined based on the recommended doses obtained from&#xD;
      the Phase 1b study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each phase of the study includes a screening period, a treatment period and a follow-up&#xD;
      period. During the trial, the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy data of ZN-A-1041 as&#xD;
      monotherapy and in combination with Capecitabine in the subjects will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed, thereby providing RP2D for the subsequent clinical trials.&#xD;
