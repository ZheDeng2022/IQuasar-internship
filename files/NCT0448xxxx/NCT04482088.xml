    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about occupational therapy for youth with autism in a&#xD;
      traditional clinic environment, and in an equine environment. 20 youth with autism will&#xD;
      participate in 10 weeks of occupational therapy in a clinic environment, followed by 10 weeks&#xD;
      of occupational therapy in an equine environment. Caregivers will complete online surveys&#xD;
      about their child's behavior. Occupational therapists and other stakeholders will provide&#xD;
      feedback about the interventions. The therapy sessions that involve horses will be&#xD;
      videotaped, and a researcher will look at the behaviors of the horses involved in the&#xD;
      intervention. We will use the results of this study to improve the quality of both&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of occupational therapy in an equine environment (OTEE) for youth with autism. As a&#xD;
      feasibility study, this study aims to accomplish several key development tasks. Specifically,&#xD;
      this study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Create a safe, feasible, and manualized control group that controls for non-animal&#xD;
           critical elements of the OTEE intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess welfare of the therapy horses that are integrated into the OTEE intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Enhance the OTEE manual by increasing standardization, while still allowing for&#xD;
           individualization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. We will implement a longitudinal design, where caregivers will complete outcomes&#xD;
      measures at 1)pre-test, 2) after their child participates in 10 weeks of occupational therapy&#xD;
      in a clinic environment and 3) after 10 weeks of occupational therapy in an equine&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. Youth with ASD will be screened for inclusion in a 2-part process that includes&#xD;
      1) an online survey and 2) virtual screening visit using Microsoft Teams. After completing 10&#xD;
      weeks of occupational therapy in a clinic environment, youth will then participate in an&#xD;
      additional screening visit and re-evaluation for OTEE to ensure they a) are able to mount and&#xD;
      ride a horse (with assistance) for 10 minutes while following safety rules, and b) meet all&#xD;
      PATH Intl criteria for participation in equine-assisted services. Twenty youth with autism&#xD;
      and their caregivers will be enrolled in the study. Occupational therapists that deliver the&#xD;
      interventions and other stakeholders (i.e. program coordinators, etc.) will also be asked to&#xD;
      be research participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy Evaluation. Each youth and caregiver will participate in an occupational&#xD;
      therapy evaluation at Temple Grandin Equine Center (or virtually, depending on COVID&#xD;
      guidelines in 2021) that include an occupational profile, semi-structured interview, social&#xD;
      skills checklist, and collaborative goal setting. Therapists and caregivers will jointly&#xD;
      determine three goals for each youth with autism in the domains of self-regulation, social&#xD;
      communication, or social play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy in a Clinic (Control Group). The occupational therapy in a clinic&#xD;
      environment will occur at Temple Grandin Equine Center on CSU's foothills campus. We will&#xD;
      recruit occupational therapists to deliver the intervention who a) are licensed and&#xD;
      registered occupational therapists, and b) have at least 1-year of experience providing&#xD;
      occupational therapy to youth with autism. Included therapists will receive 5 hours of&#xD;
      training before each 10-week intervention session, as well as participate in 1-hour case&#xD;
      conferences every other week throughout the 10 week intervention session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth with autism will be paired into dyads based on social communication and self-regulation&#xD;
      abilities. Dyads will attend 10 weekly 60-minute sessions of occupational therapy that follow&#xD;
      a general structure: greeting, activities in a play room, parent debrief, and goodbyes.&#xD;
      Therapists will design intervention activities based on the following critical elements:&#xD;
      direct instruction of goal behavior; activities in the playroom that elicit the goal&#xD;
      behavior; positive reinforcement of goal behaviors; use of behavioral techniques to scaffold&#xD;
      goal performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hearts and Horses Screening Visit and Re-evaluation. Each youth will attend an additional&#xD;
      screening visit for the second portion of the study, to ensure they can safely ride a horse&#xD;
      with assistance and meet all medical and behavioral standards set forth by PATH Intl for&#xD;
      participation in equine-assisted services. Caregivers will be asked to bring the Hearts and&#xD;
      Horse enrollment packet, that includes physician signature that the youth can ride a horse.&#xD;
      Then, youth will ride a horse for 15 minutes. Finally, caregivers and youth will participate&#xD;
      in re-evaluations with an occupational therapist, to update or set new goals for 10 weeks of&#xD;
      OTEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTEE Intervention (Intervention group). The OTEE intervention will occur at Hearts and Horses&#xD;
      Therapeutic Riding Center. The occupational therapists who will deliver the intervention are&#xD;
      licensed and registered, have completed training by the American Hippotherapy Association,&#xD;
      are PATH Intl registered instructors, and have experience delivering occupational therapy in&#xD;
      an equine environment to youth with autism. Included therapists will receive 5 hours of&#xD;
      training before each 10-week intervention session, as well as participate in 1-hour case&#xD;
      conferences every other week throughout the 10-week intervention session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth with autism will be paired into dyads based on social communication and self-regulation&#xD;
      abilities. Dyads will attend 10 weekly 60-minute sessions of OTEE. Sessions follow a general&#xD;
      structure: greetings, activities with horses, parent debrief, goodbyes. Therapists design&#xD;
      intervention activities based on these critical elements: a) incorporation of horses to&#xD;
      optimize attention and engagement (includes use of equine movement to facilitate optimal&#xD;
      arousal) b) direct instruction of goal behavior, c) activities with horses that elicit the&#xD;
      goal behavior, d) positive reinforcement of goal behaviors, and e) use of behavioral&#xD;
      techniques to scaffold goal performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equine Welfare. OTEE sessions will be videotaped. Noldus software will be used to analyze&#xD;
      equine behaviors using an applied ethogram, a behavioral scoring system in horses&#xD;
      incorporated in equine-assisted services that determines the presence or absence of stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fidelity. Dr. Peters will rate the fidelity of 25% of intervention and control sessions.&#xD;
      Therapists will also provide self-ratings of fidelity for 20% of intervention and control&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures. All youth/caregiver outcome measures will be collected three times: once&#xD;
      before occupational therapy in a clinic environment, once before OTEE, and once after OTEE.&#xD;
      Caregivers will be asked to complete online surveys that include the following assessments:&#xD;
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist- Community (ABC-C) irritability and hyperactivity sub-scales,&#xD;
      Social Responsiveness Scale Second Edition (SRS-2), Pediatric Evaluation of Disability&#xD;
      Inventory Computer Adaptive Test for Autism Spectrum Disorders (PEDICAT-ASD), Emotional&#xD;
      Dysregulation Inventory (EDI), and World Health Organization Quality of Life- Brief&#xD;
      (WHOQOL-Brief). After each 10-week session, an occupational therapist blinded to treatment&#xD;
      condition will call each caregiver and conduct a semi-structured interview in order to rate&#xD;
      the child's performance on occupational performance goals using goal attainment scaling&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapists will be asked to fill out feedback forms every other week during case conferences,&#xD;
      to gather immediate feedback on intervention delivery. After the evaluations/re-evaluations,&#xD;
      therapists will be asked to complete a short survey about the feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of the evaluations. At the conclusion of each 10-week session, therapists and other&#xD;
      stakeholders (i.e. program coordinator, etc.) will be asked to complete short surveys about&#xD;
      intervention acceptability, as well as attend a 1-hour audiotaped focus group to gather&#xD;
      feedback on the intervention manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis. To assess feasibility and acceptability, we will calculate rates of&#xD;
      attendance, attrition, fidelity, assessment completion, safety events, and satisfaction. We&#xD;
      will conduct content analysis of focus group and feedback form data to inform intervention&#xD;
      and control manual revisions. Preliminary efficacy will be assessed using appropriate&#xD;
      parametric or non-parametric statistics.&#xD;
