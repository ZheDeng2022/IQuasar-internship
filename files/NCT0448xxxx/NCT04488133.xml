      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes following treatment&#xD;
      with nusinersen in participants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) who previously received&#xD;
      onasemnogene abeparvovec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability; and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes following treatment with nusinersen in participants with SMA who previously&#xD;
      received onasemnogene abeparvovec.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) Section 2 Motor Milestones Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 778</time_frame>
    <description>Section 2 of the HINE is used to assess motor milestones of the participants. It is composed of 8 motor milestone categories: voluntary grasp (0 to 3), ability to kick in supine position (0 to 4), head control (0 to 2), rolling (0 to 3), sitting (0 to 4), crawling (0 to 4), standing (0 to 3), and walking (0 to 3). Total HINE score is the sum of points from each item and can range from 0 to 26, with higher scores depicting better level of ability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 778</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal assessment such as an abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a birth defect or is a medically important event..</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants who Achieved Motor Milestones as Assessed by World Health Organization (WHO) Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 778</time_frame>
    <description>The motor milestones as defined by WHO criteria includes the following six test items: sitting without support, hands-and-knees crawling, standing with assistance, walking with assistance, standing alone, and walking alone.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 778</time_frame>
    <description>The CHOP INTEND test is designed to evaluate the motor skills of infants with significant motor weakness. It includes 16 items (capturing neck, trunk, and proximal and distal limb strength) structured to move from easiest to hardest with the grading including gravity eliminated (lower scores) to antigravity movements (higher scores). All item scores range from 0-4. The total score ranges from 0-64, with higher scores depicting better response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 778</time_frame>
    <description>The HFMSE is a tool used to assess motor function in children with SMA. The original 20 item Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (HFMS) was expanded to include 13 additional items to improve sensitivity for the higher functioning ambulant population. Participants will be asked to complete a specific movement and are then graded on the quality and execution of that movement. Higher scores indicate higher levels of motor ability. The overall score is the sum of the scores for all activities, with a maximum score of 66 with higher scores depicting better ability to perform activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 778</time_frame>
    <description>The RULM is developed to assess upper limb functional abilities participants with SMA. This test consists of upper limb performance items that are reflective of activities of daily living. The RULM is scored from 0 to 37 points, with higher scores indicating better function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Death or Permanent Ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 778</time_frame>
    <description>Permanent ventilation is defined as tracheostomy or â‰¥16 hours ventilation/day continuously for &gt;21 days in the absence of an acute reversible event.</description>
