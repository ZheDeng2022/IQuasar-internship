        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female participants who are at least 18 years of age on the day of signing informed&#xD;
             consent with histologically confirmed diagnosis of cervical carcinoma will be enrolled&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Cervical cancer is a disease of the female genital tract. No male patients will be&#xD;
             enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (see Appendix&#xD;
             3), not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) as defined in Appendix 3 OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance in Appendix 3 during the&#xD;
                  treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant must have recurrent cervical cancer and have a low potential for cure with&#xD;
             radiation therapy or surgery alone and:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. May have received up to 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Platinum sensitizing agents&#xD;
             for radiation therapy are considered a chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written&#xD;
             informed consent for the trial, which includes compliance with the requirements and&#xD;
             restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously&#xD;
             irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such&#xD;
             lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have provided archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy&#xD;
             of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE)&#xD;
             tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to&#xD;
             archived tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;

         10. Have adequate organ function as defined in the following table (Table 1). Specimens&#xD;
             must be collected within 10 days prior to the start of study treatment. Before&#xD;
             patients can be enrolled, they must have normal laboratory values as outlined in Table&#xD;
             1. Labs must also fall within normal limits prior to infusion.&#xD;

             dose of treatment (see Appendix 3). If the urine test is positive or cannot be&#xD;
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Note: in the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and&#xD;
             the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be&#xD;
             performed and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with&#xD;

             Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require&#xD;
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted&#xD;

             carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Stage 1, grade 1 endometrial carcinoma.&#xD;

             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to confirm the absence&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical&#xD;
