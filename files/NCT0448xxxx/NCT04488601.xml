      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial into the safety and efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      clinical measures of aging in an older adult population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the effects of low and high&#xD;
      doses of intermittent Rapamycin on a weekly schedule. The researchers aim to establish a&#xD;
      long-term safety profile, determine the long-term efficacy of Rapamycin in reducing clinical&#xD;
      aging measures, and biochemical and physiological endpoints associated with declining health&#xD;
      and aging in healthy older adults.&#xD;
