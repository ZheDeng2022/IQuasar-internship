      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, which entails the destruction of knee cartilage and&#xD;
      remodeling of the adjacent bone, is one of the leading causes of disability among elderly&#xD;
      adults. Consequences of severe knee OA, including loss of mobility and limited daily&#xD;
      activities, affect individuals and society economically. The World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      Global Burden of Disease Study, conducted in 21 epidemiological regions worldwide, reported a&#xD;
      26.6% increase in the burden of knee OA from 1990 to 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current therapies for OA include various over the counter analgesics, a number of&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intra-articular injections of corticosteroids&#xD;
      or hyaluronic acid, plus tramadol and other opioid analgesics to relieve severe pain. , While&#xD;
      these therapies can alleviate symptoms in the near term, their ultimate impact on the&#xD;
      pathophysiologic progression of OA is limited. In addition, there are considerable side&#xD;
      effects associated with the use of these drugs. Total joint replacement is typically the&#xD;
      final and only effective solution for relieving pain and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, OA sufferers always turn to natural nutraceuticals to ease their pain and&#xD;
      discomfort. These products are commonly used because they are well tolerated and considered&#xD;
      safe. Nutraceuticals are defined as functional foods, natural products, or parts of food that&#xD;
      provide medicinal, therapeutic, or health benefits, including the prevention or treatment of&#xD;
      disease. Currently, glucosamine and chondroitin are the two most commonly used nutraceuticals&#xD;
      in humans to alleviate pain associated with arthritis. However, recent randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials and meta-analysis of these supplements have shown only small-to-moderate symptomatic&#xD;
      efficacy in OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It therefore seems appropriate to explore other natural supplements/ingredients. There is&#xD;
      growing interest in hydrolyzed collagen (or collagen hydrolysate [CH]) as a nutraceutical&#xD;
      supplement because collagen-derived peptides harbor a variety of interesting biological&#xD;
      properties. CH has been found to down-regulate inflammatory markers involved in joint&#xD;
      inflammation and cartilage degradation such as interleukins (ILs), IL-6, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-12&#xD;
      as well as monocyte-chemoattractant-1 (MCP-1) in chondrocytes induced with IL-1 beta. In&#xD;
      addition, CH reduces bone resorption in an in vitro model for regulation of osteoclastic&#xD;
      differentiation and bone resorption by RANKL system (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CH has received considerable attention in relieving OA-associated symptoms. The hypothesis of&#xD;
      how CH may reduce OA-associated symptoms includes providing bioavailable substrate (building&#xD;
      blocks) for the collagen fibrillar network, which provides tensile strength for the matrix of&#xD;
      articular cartilage. Oesser et al. in a series of preclinical studies, demonstrated that CH&#xD;
      passes across the mucosal barrier in the small bowel as a complete peptide that is no longer&#xD;
      subject to enzymatic cleavage, accumulates in cartilage tissue, and stimulates production of&#xD;
      type II collagen (the major protein in articular cartilage) and proteoglycans in the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix of cartilage. , , In addition to these preclinical studies, open label,&#xD;
      comparative, and prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and experimental&#xD;
      findings have been published, with several studies providing evidence of a beneficial effect&#xD;
      on measurements of joint health from the administration of collagen hydrolysate in a variety&#xD;
      of patient populations, mostly OA patients. , , , , , CH per day for 3 months produced an&#xD;
      improvement in joint health or function, such as reduction in pain,11,12,14 decreased&#xD;
      dependency on pain medications,14 and improvement in leg strength.16 Given these&#xD;
      observations, the investigators develop a supplementation of chicken essence with additive of&#xD;
      CH-Brands Essence of Chicken plus CH (BEC-CH). The CH is derived from chicken cartilage. It&#xD;
      is a soluble naturally occurring matrix of hydrolyzed collagen type II, chondroitin sulfate,&#xD;
      and hyaluronic acid. The composition is similar to that of the human articular cartilage&#xD;
      lining found in the synovial joints. Regarding BEC, it has been consumed for decades as a&#xD;
      health tonic for energy boosting and fatigue recovery. In fact, BEC supplementation has been&#xD;
      clinically proven to accelerate the recovery from exercise by increasing the rate of&#xD;
      clearance of plasma lactate and ammonia and hence reduces muscle fatigue. However, all of&#xD;
      these data are based on supplementation of either BEC of CH per se in clinical or in in vitro&#xD;
      settings. Thus, it is crucial to investigate the efficacy of both BEC and CH when taken in&#xD;
      combination on joint, bone, and muscle function. To answer these questions and to investigate&#xD;
      its tolerability and efficacy, this randomized, double-blind, four-arm pilot study is thus&#xD;
      carried out. It is hypothesized that supplementation with BEC-CH might relieve joint&#xD;
      discomfort, restore joint function, and also be beneficial to bone and muscle.&#xD;
