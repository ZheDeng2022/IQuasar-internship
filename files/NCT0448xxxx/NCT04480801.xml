  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned as a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial to determine the&#xD;
      effect of thermal evaluation in preventing diabetic foot ulcers in patients with Type II&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease caused by insufficient production of insulin&#xD;
      hormone in the pancreas gland or inefficient use of the insulin produced. Diabetic neuropathy&#xD;
      that occurs in 60-70% of patients with DM is reported to be the most important factor&#xD;
      increasing the risk of diabetic foot. Determining risk factors in diabetic foot and&#xD;
      attempting to eliminate or mitigate these factors have been found to be a simple, inexpensive&#xD;
      and evidence-based tool that can be used at home by patients. This study will contribute to&#xD;
      the current literature on the effectiveness of thermal assessment in preventing diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers. The study was planned as a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      determine the effect of thermal assessment on preventing diabetic foot ulcers in patients&#xD;
      with Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM). For the sample of the study, compared to those with&#xD;
      thermal evaluation, the study reported that the probability of developing diabetic feet was&#xD;
      10.3 times higher than those without thermal evaluation program, 48 patients (thermal&#xD;
      evaluation group: 24 people; control group: 24 people) were included in the study. It was&#xD;
      decided that 30 patients were lost during data collection and 35 patients were included in&#xD;
      each study group and the study was completed with a total of 70 patients. The patients&#xD;
      included in the study will be assigned to the experimental group (thermal evaluation group)&#xD;
      and control group by block randomization method according to the randomization list in a&#xD;
      ratio of 1: 1. In the study, block randomization was performed by a statistician based on the&#xD;
      current disease year (diabetes year) and the degree of diabetic foot risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the implementation of the study, permission was obtained from the ethics committee of&#xD;
      Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Medical Faculty, Non-Drug and Medical Device Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee, and work permit was obtained from Necmettin Erbakan University Meram&#xD;
      Medical Faculty Hospital Chief Physician. Patients included in the study sample will be&#xD;
      informed before the study that the purpose of the study and participation in the study is in&#xD;
      line with the principle of volunteering, and &quot;Informing and Consent of Volunteers Consent&#xD;
      Form&quot; will be signed.&#xD;

      Evaluation of the Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the evaluation of the descriptive data obtained from the research, number, percentage,&#xD;
      average and standard deviation will be used; The conformity of the data to normal&#xD;
      distribution will be determined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and normal distribution curve,&#xD;
      Skewness and Kurtosis test, and when the data show normal distribution, parametric tests will&#xD;
      be used, and nonparametric tests will be used in the analysis of data that do not conform to&#xD;
      the normal distribution. Significance will be evaluated within the confidence interval of&#xD;
      95%, p &lt;0.05 will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      İmplementation of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      After vascular evaluation, neuropathy evaluation, and physical evaluation of the foot,&#xD;
      individuals with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes aged 18 and over will be formed the sample&#xD;
      group. Once the sample group is determined, participants will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      experimental and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the experimental group will be given foot care in the clinic and will be&#xD;
      taught to the patient and / or their relatives. The foot care video will be uploaded to the&#xD;
      patient and / or relative's phone. Thermal evaluation will be done. The application of the&#xD;
      thermal evaluation, the foot areas to be applied and how to record the results of the&#xD;
      application will be taught to the patient and / or their relatives. In addition, the thermal&#xD;
      evaluation video will be uploaded to the phone of the patient and / or their relative. While&#xD;
      the participants in the experimental group were discharged; Blood glucose monitoring chart,&#xD;
      Checklist to record foot care interventions, Thermal evaluation registration form, Daily step&#xD;
      number registration form will be provided and participants will be invited to check every 2&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will be given foot care in the clinic and will be taught to&#xD;
      the patient and / or their relatives. The foot care video will be uploaded to the patient and&#xD;
      / or relative's phone.While the participants in the control group were discharged; Blood&#xD;
      glucose monitoring chart, Checklist to record foot care interventions will be provided and&#xD;
