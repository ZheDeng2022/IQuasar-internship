    <textblock>
      COMICE is a randomised, double blind placebo controlled Phase II trial. The trial is&#xD;
      recruiting 108 patients with advanced recurrent cervical cancer who have completed their 1st&#xD;
      line chemotherapy for advanced/recurrent disease. Patients will be randomised to either&#xD;
      placebo Cediranib and Olaparib or active Cediranib and Olaparib and will remain on treatment&#xD;
      until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Patients will&#xD;
      be assessed for disease progression every 8 weeks through CT/MRI imaging. The primary end&#xD;
      point is Progression Free Survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the 4th most prevalent female cancer worldwide. In the UK there are around&#xD;
      3,207 new cases each year (2013) and 890 deaths (2012)&#xD;
      (http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-t&#xD;
      ype/cervical-cancer). It is the most common cancer in females under 35 with the majority of&#xD;
      cases diagnosed in women aged 25-64. There is a large unmet need for active treatments in&#xD;
      metastatic and recurrent cervical cancer patients. Although early-stage and locally advanced&#xD;
      cancers may be cured with radical surgery, chemoradiotherapy or both, there are limited&#xD;
      options for patients with metastatic disease or persistent/ recurrent disease after&#xD;
      platinum-based chemoradiotherapy. Patients treated with chemotherapy for metastatic or&#xD;
      relapsed cervical cancer respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy (overall response rate&#xD;
      [ORR] of 30-35%) with a median overall survival of less than a year. The recent publication&#xD;
      of a phase III randomised controlled trial GOG 240 demonstrating a 3.7 month improvement in&#xD;
      median overall survival with the addition of bevacizumab to combination chemotherapy has&#xD;
      offered some hope for these patients. The ORR and progression free survival (PFS) were also&#xD;
      improved in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
      The advantage seen with bevacizumab persisted in some subsets of patients including those&#xD;
      aged 48-56 years, and those with recurrent /persistent disease. Bevacizumab was also&#xD;
      effective in patients who had undergone pelvic irradiation. This was the first time a&#xD;
      targeted agent had significantly improved OS in gynaecological cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High tumour angiogenesis is associated with poor survival when cervical cancer is treated&#xD;
      with radiotherapy and high tumour vascularity is a significant prognostic factor independent&#xD;
      of tumour radiosensitivity. A relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#xD;
      expression and OS has been demonstrated in patients treated with radiotherapy, and a review&#xD;
      of multiple biomarker studies in cervix cancer has highlighted the importance of VEGF as an&#xD;
      adverse prognostic factor. Targeting VEGF in cervical cancer may potentially exploit the role&#xD;
      of human papilloma virus (HPV, particularly subtypes 16 and 18) in the causation of cervical&#xD;
      cancer. The role of HPV in oncogenesis relates to the E6 and E7 proteins, with the former&#xD;
      promoting degradation of p53 while E7 inactivates retinoblastoma protein. Degradation of p53&#xD;
      may be responsible for activation of angiogenesis through production of VEGF and&#xD;
      downregulation of a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, thrombospondin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cediranib is a highly potent inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of VEGF receptors 1-3&#xD;
      (VEGFR 1-3.) The recently published CIRCCa study demonstrated an increased PFS, VEGF-R&#xD;
      receptor inhibition and response rate with the addition of cediranib to carboplatin and&#xD;
      paclitaxel chemotherapy. This was accompanied by a manageable increased toxicity&#xD;
      (specifically diarrhoea and hypertension) with no detriment to QOL. The median PFS was&#xD;
      35weeks and 29 weeks in the cediranib and placebo arms respectively (HR 0.58 p= 0.032).&#xD;
      Understanding which patients are most likely to derive benefit from these agents requires&#xD;
      further evaluation as a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors including Olaparib may have potential activity&#xD;
      in cancers deficient in DNA repair genes or signalling pathways that mitigate DNA repair.&#xD;
      PARP inhibitors have demonstrated selectivity for cells harbouring homologous recombination&#xD;
      (HR) deficiencies such as those with BRCA mutations. HR deficient cells are unable to&#xD;
      maintain genomic integrity in the presence of large numbers of DNA DSBs and are therefore&#xD;
      sensitive to PARP inhibition. The activity of PARP inhibitors in not limited to those with&#xD;
      BRCA mutations and may demonstrate synthetic lethality in cancers deficient in other proteins&#xD;
      mitigating DNA repair, such as those with mutations in Fanconi anaemia complementation group&#xD;
      (FANC) proteins. Thus synthetic lethality may be more broadly applied to cancers with an&#xD;
      impaired HR pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well recognised that persistent genital infection with high risk strain(s) of HPV is&#xD;
      necessary for the development of cervical cancer. Cells expressing high risk HPV oncoproteins&#xD;
      (E6 and E7, see above) demonstrate increased levels of DNA damage and chromosomal&#xD;
      instability, which may be a consequence of replicative stress; a process which is associated&#xD;
      with a number of cancer-prone syndromes. There is also evidence that HPV oncoproteins inhibit&#xD;
      the activation of DNA repair checkpoints, promote inappropriate DNA repair checkpoint&#xD;
      recovery and inhibit the activation of DNA repair mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current therapeutic modalities for cervical cancer exploit the sensitivity of these tumours&#xD;
      to DNA damaging agents such as ionising radiation and platinum chemotherapeutic agents. Poly&#xD;
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors reduce the DNA repair capacity of cells and can&#xD;
      induce synthetic lethality in cancers with underlying defects in DNA repair mechanisms such&#xD;
      as BRCA mutations (Scott, Swisher, and Kaufmann 2015). The investigators therefore postulate&#xD;
      that the action of HPV oncoproteins will lead to increase rates of DNA damage and reduced&#xD;
      efficiency of DNA repair, leading in turn to increased susceptibility to PARP inhibitors.&#xD;
