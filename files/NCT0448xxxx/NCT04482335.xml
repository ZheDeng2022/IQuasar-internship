  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit patients referred to the Rheumatology Out-patient departments.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited to the study or control groups (healthy or disease controls who&#xD;
      will be age and sex-matched) as needed. The study will first open to recruitment at&#xD;
      Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and then open at other NHS Trusts.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to participate in longitudinal (clinical/imaging/biosample) data&#xD;
      and/or sample collection that will improve our understanding of underlying disease mechanisms&#xD;
      and identify improved diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers to understand&#xD;
      progression of disease and drug response or resistance.&#xD;

      Main Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent to this ethics' main programme will permit collection of routinely collected data and&#xD;
      use for research activities. Patients may be recruited at any point along their disease&#xD;
      continuum (e.g. time of initial diagnosis, before/after a new treatment intervention, at time&#xD;
      of disease flare or stable state).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with established disease who are recruited to the study during their follow up&#xD;
      appointments will have pre-existing results and clinical documentation. These retrospective&#xD;
      data may also be collected where possible using information documented in case-notes and/or&#xD;
      hospital information systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some study-specific information will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the main study, participants will be offered the opportunity to consent to&#xD;
      participate in one or more sub-studies which include the additional research procedures&#xD;
      (entitled 'basic biological' and 'synovial biopsy'). It will be possible for patients to&#xD;
      participate in more than one sub-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sub-studies aim to explore the mechanisms that may underlie change over the disease&#xD;
      continuum, not just at disease initiation. In particular, the researchers would wish to&#xD;
      obtain samples and imaging that coincide with a change in disease profile as well as with&#xD;
      loss of disease control. Acquiring pre- and post-treatment blood/tissue samples and images&#xD;
      would allow the investigation of changes in disease pathogenesis, the role of specific&#xD;
      therapies, and identification of treatment response indicators. The researchers would&#xD;
      therefore ask the permission of some individuals to obtain samples or images at additional&#xD;
      time-points to coincide with events along their disease continuum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic Biological sub-study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sub-study will facilitate identification of prognostic markers of disease, mechanism and&#xD;
      predictive markers of drug response. As part of an in-house investigation of biomarkers and&#xD;
      mechanisms, DNA, serum, plasma, synovial joint fluid, and urine may be collected and stored.&#xD;
      Patients will have the opportunity to consent separately to the genetic (DNA) component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 75mls of blood may be taken to enable the range of experimental studies. The&#xD;
      samples will be taken at relevant clinical time points related to diagnosis, disease profile,&#xD;
      disease activity state and/or treatment related time points; thus samples may be taken at one&#xD;
      time point or repeated depending on the individual study objective and status of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synovial biopsy sub-study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to consent to a synovial biopsy of an affected joint to provide&#xD;
      synovial tissue for research purposes. Synovial joint fluid may also be collected as part of&#xD;
      the biopsy procedure. This will be performed by a trained clinician within our department by&#xD;
      ultrasound-guidance. Depending on the research question being addressed, biopsy may be taken&#xD;
      at time of diagnosis; or before and after starting a new drug treatment; or at time of a&#xD;
      change in disease activity/flare (that may/may not lead to change in therapy). If repeat&#xD;
      biopsy is taken, this is typically 3 or 6 months after starting a new therapy; or may be a&#xD;
      later time point if evaluating for change in disease characteristics and tissue biology over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>• Main study - Change in Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28)</measure>
    <time_frame>through to study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>• The Disease Activity Score (DAS) assessment is a derived measurement with differential weight given to each component. The DAS28 is calculated at every visit. The components of the DAS28 ESR score assessment are: Tender/ Painful Joint Count (28), Swollen Joint Count (28); ESR, Subject General Health VAS assessment (0-100). The components of the DAS28 CRP score assessment are: Tender/Painful Joint Count (28); Swollen Joint Count (28), CRP, and the Subject General Health VAS assessment (0-100). The DAS score ranges from 0-10 and higher scores indicate high disease activity. A DAS28 value of &gt;5.1 indicates high disease activity, 3.2 &lt;DAS28 ≤5.1 and DAS28 ≤3.2 are defined as moderate and low disease activity. Patients may be considered to be in remission phase if DAS28 is &lt;2.6</description>
