      A single arm study evaluating the continued efficacy, safety and tolerability of ofatumumab&#xD;
      in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis who are transitioning from aCD20 mAb therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm multi-center, study in approximately 100 participants with relapsing&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis who were previously treated with aCD20 mAb therapy. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will receive open label ofatumumab 20 mg subcutaneous monthly for 12 months following initial&#xD;
      loading regimen of 20 milligrams subcutaneous doses on Days 1, 7 and 14. Assessments will&#xD;
      include but are not limited to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assessed for quality by&#xD;
      central reading center, multiple Patient Reported Outcome measurements and safety&#xD;
      assessments. Participants that do not continue onto commercial ofatumumab or another therapy&#xD;
      within one month of the End of Study Visit must continue into the safety Follow Up phase,&#xD;
      consisting of every 3 month visits including B cell monitoring until they are able to start&#xD;
      on commercial ofatumumab or switch to another therapy or until their B cells are repleted&#xD;
      defined as a B cell concentration greater than the individual participant's baseline value or&#xD;
      greater than the lower limit of normal. All participants will have a safety follow-up phone&#xD;
      call at 30 days post study.&#xD;

    <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) will be used to evaluate the participants' satisfaction with Ofatumumab. The TSQM-9 is a psychometrically sound and valid participant reported outcome to measure participants' satisfaction with medication and a good predictor of adherence across different types of medication and participant population. The TSQM-9 is a 9 item questionnaire having a global satisfaction score ranging from 0-100. The questionnaire consists of 3 domains: satisfaction, convenience and effectiveness (3 items each). The domain scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing higher satisfaction on that domain.</description>

C-SSRS SI severity subscale ranges from 0 (no SI) to 5 (active SI with plan and intent).</description>
