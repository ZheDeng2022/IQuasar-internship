  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Access to surgery is reported to be significantly lower in low income countries like Nigeria,&#xD;
      and upwards of 5 billion people globally lack safe access to surgery. The investigators&#xD;
      intend to answer the question, what is the burden of access to acute care surgery alongside&#xD;
      their determinants in the University College Hospital, Ibadan (UCH). The expected results&#xD;
      from this study will provide basis for evidence-based policy aimed at improving&#xD;
      time-to-emergency surgery and thus improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional doctors' survey and a prospective case records review would be the study&#xD;
      designs; using a minimum of fifty-one participants and case records respectively. The doctors&#xD;
      will be selected randomly from all the surgical services and the emergency department in the&#xD;
      UCH, ensuring a fairly equal allocation. The case notes will be of patients in the UCH&#xD;
      requiring emergency surgery that had surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from this study will be entered and analysed using STATA/MP 15.0 (Stata Corp, College&#xD;
      station, TX).&#xD;

      Introduction The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) mandates that to improve health and&#xD;
      health equity, every global citizen has a right to improved essential and emergency surgical&#xD;
      care and States are morally obliged to ensure this (Chawla, Rutkov, Garber, Kushner, &amp;&#xD;
      Stewart, 2017). These were ratified by the World Health Assembly Resolution 68.15 that made&#xD;
      access to quality and timely Emergency and Essential Surgical Care and Anaesthesia (EESCA) a&#xD;
      component of the Universal Health Coverage (Chawla, Rutkov, Garber, Kushner, &amp; Stewart,&#xD;
      2017). It is accepted that prompt access to surgical care is cardinal for the reduction of&#xD;
      the potentially associated morbidity and mortality inherent in surgical conditions (Scott, et&#xD;
      al., 2016). Care following trauma has been proposed as a model for accessing indiscriminate&#xD;
      care, as care seeking here is mostly guided by injury severity (Scott, et al., 2016); hence,&#xD;
      we would use trauma related metrics to present a rationale for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Civilian trauma mortality have been postulated to follow the so-called tri-modal death peaks,&#xD;
      50% of those mortalities -representing the first peak- present emergency care physicians with&#xD;
      the dilemma of almost sudden death (occurring within seconds to minutes), thus they very&#xD;
      rarely survive past the trauma field (Solomon, Warwick, &amp; Nayagam, 2010). The other 50% is&#xD;
      distributed as 30% and 20% for the second and third peaks respectively. These casualties are&#xD;
      actually capable of presenting for care, as the second peak deaths will occur within minutes&#xD;
      to hours and is nicknamed 'Golden hour' because a carefully executed trauma algorithm will&#xD;
      ensure to avert a mortality in that situation; attention here is placed on carefully&#xD;
      identifying potentially catastrophic haemorrhage of the overt or covert forms, the efficient&#xD;
      and rapid establishment of haemostasis and treatment of circulatory shock (Solomon, Warwick,&#xD;
      &amp; Nayagam, 2010). The third peak deaths may represent a failure of preventing and treating&#xD;
      infections as well as failure to co-manage other morbidities in these patients; there is a&#xD;
      resultant two-week interval before such septic processes are significantly established to&#xD;
      threaten survival of the post-acute phase trauma patient (World health statistics 2019:&#xD;
      monitoring health for the SDGs, sustainable development goals. Licence: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO.,&#xD;
      2019; Solomon, Warwick, &amp; Nayagam, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of problem Poisoning, motor vehicle crashes and firearm injuries are the leading&#xD;
      causes of Emergency Room (ER) visits in the United States of America (USA); clearly, with the&#xD;
      exception of poisoning, trauma-related causes necessitate most visits in the USA, in&#xD;
      accordance with reports of trauma being the leading cause of death for persons under 45 years&#xD;
      of age in the USA (Gani, Sakran, &amp; Canner, 2017; Carr, et al., 2017). The annual&#xD;
      trauma-related ER visits in the US are about 29 million visits, resulting in 2.8 million&#xD;
      hospitalizations and 180 thousand deaths (Carr, et al., 2017) and the American region's Road&#xD;
      Traffic Mortality Rate (RTMR) at 15.6 per 100,000 (World health statistics 2019: monitoring&#xD;
      health for the SDGs, sustainable development goals. Licence: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO., 2019).&#xD;
      These are despite that 88.3% of the American population have access to high level trauma&#xD;
      centres (Carr, et al., 2017), the American region has a Universal Health Coverage (UHC)&#xD;
      service coverage index of 78% and Density of Medical Doctors (DMD) of 23.3 per 10,000&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is worthy of note that globally, five billion people lack access to safe and affordable&#xD;
      surgery when needed, irrespective of the fact that globally 312 million surgical procedures&#xD;
      are done annually, only about 6% of these are done in the poorest countries (Watters, Guest,&#xD;
      Tangi, Shrime, &amp; Meara, 2018). This is against the fact that in 2016 the low and middle&#xD;
      income earning countries account for 93% of the 1.3 million people reported to have had road&#xD;
      traffic accidents (RTA) and the upwards of 50 million people that were injured (World health&#xD;
      statistics 2019: monitoring health for the SDGs, sustainable development goals. Licence: CC&#xD;
      BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO., 2019). Their survival may have been improved if the Healthy people 2020&#xD;
      benchmark on access to trauma care of 60 minutes could be met (Carr, et al., 2017); well this&#xD;
      isn't the case as in 2016, RTMR per 100,000 population was 26.6, 27.5 and 19.2 in the African&#xD;
      region, low and middle income earning countries unlike 8.3 in the high income earning&#xD;
      countries and the UHC service coverage indices were 44%, 78% and 73% respectively for the&#xD;
      African, American and European regions respectively and a similar tale for the DMD per 10,000&#xD;
      population at 2.8, 23.3 and 33.8 for the African, American and European regions respectively&#xD;
      (World health statistics 2019: monitoring health for the SDGs, sustainable development goals.&#xD;
      Licence: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;

      in the University College Hospital Ibadan&#xD;
