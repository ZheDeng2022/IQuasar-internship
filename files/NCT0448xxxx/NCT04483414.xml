    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to examine the ability of Gallium-68 (68Ga) Prostate-Specific&#xD;
      Membrane Antigen-11 (PSMA-11) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to&#xD;
      detect sites of recurrent prostate cancer in patients with biochemical recurrence previously&#xD;
      treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) or external beam radiation (EBRT) and to assess&#xD;
      treatment response to subsequent salvage therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In developed countries, prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men and the third&#xD;
      leading cause of death in men. Following primary therapy for prostate cancer, a substantial&#xD;
      number of patients will recur either locally in the pelvis or in extra pelvic locations.&#xD;
      Approximately 20-30% of patients' status post RP will recur and up to 60% patients treated&#xD;
      with EBRT will recur, as detected by rising serum levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
      after original therapy. This phenomenon is referred to as biochemical recurrence (BCR), as&#xD;
      the elevated PSA usually occurs in advance of obvious clinical or radiologic evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the performance of 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT in detecting the&#xD;
      location (localized versus extra pelvic) of BCR and advanced metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;
      compared to conventional imaging. In addition, we will evaluate its performance in assessing&#xD;
      interim and post salvage therapy response compared to conventional imaging, including pelvic&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and bone scintigraphy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with suspected BCR of prostate cancer following initial treatment with either&#xD;
             prostatectomy or definitive EBRT of the prostate or patients with known metastatic&#xD;
             prostate cancer who have failed systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients being considered for salvage therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of&#xD;
             0-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be medically stable as judged by the patient's physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to lie still for 20-40 minutes for the PET/CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with BCR and no known lesions should not be on antiandrogen therapy at the&#xD;
             time of scans. Patients with known metastases who are currently being treated with&#xD;
             anti-androgen therapy may remain on this medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have or have had a biopsy proven concurrent other malignancy, excluding&#xD;
             skin cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not weigh more than the maximum weight limit for the PET /CT scanner&#xD;
             table (&gt; 200 kg or 440 pounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to 68Ga PSMA-11. Furosemide will not be administered to patients with&#xD;
             known allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be claustrophobic.&#xD;
