      This study will recruit 60 subjects, in sum of 30 families. We will measure 2 indoor&#xD;
      environments (living room and bedroom) for All-in-one monitoring the indoor air quality, in&#xD;
      which collected culturable fungus and bacteria indoor to calculate colony forming unit (CFU).&#xD;
      We will apply Kore Technology (MS-200) (Electron Ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry,&#xD;
      EI-TOF-MS) to measure the indoor volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) before intervention and&#xD;
      perform repeated measurements of VOCs and the concentration of phytoncides before&#xD;
      intervention and one week later after placing potted plants into indoor environments (living&#xD;
      room and bedroom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, this study aims to investigate the clinical utility of potted mint plants in&#xD;
      reducing indoor bacterial and fungal growth and indoor air pollution, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      benefits. Furthermore, the possible application of indoor potted mint plant in antiviral&#xD;
      influenza or pneumonia in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The contribution of air pollution is a very important public health issue for human health.&#xD;
      Indoor air quality may have more influence on human health than outdoor air pollution.&#xD;
      Previous studies indicate indoor air pollution which causes respiratory disease has been&#xD;
      associated with cardiovascular disease. Besides, some studies showed that indoor CO2&#xD;
      concentration was positively correlated with virus detection and bacterial concentration in&#xD;
      the air, and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) was detected in many poorly ventilated&#xD;
      indoor environments. Mint can release chemical substance to inhibit viruses and bacteria.&#xD;
      Among the components, the menthol and terpineol induced vasodilation so as to reduce blood&#xD;
      pressure. For the pilot study we have finished the qualitative and quantitative research in&#xD;
      chemical components released by the mint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the indoor air quality and the distribution of fungal&#xD;
      and bacterial concentration in the indoor environment, analyze the effect of potted mint&#xD;
      plants on indoor air quality, fungal and bacterial concentration, and explore the correlation&#xD;
      between the intervention of potted mint plants and cardiovascular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit 60 subjects, in sum of 30 families. We will measure 2 indoor&#xD;
      environments (living room and bedroom) for All-in-one monitoring the indoor air quality, in&#xD;
      which collected culturable fungus and bacteria indoor to calculate colony forming unit (CFU).&#xD;
      We will apply Kore Technology (MS-200) (Electron Ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry,&#xD;
      EI-TOF-MS) to measure the indoor volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) before intervention and&#xD;
      perform repeated measurements of VOCs and the concentration of phytoncides before&#xD;
      intervention and one week later after placing potted plants into indoor environments (living&#xD;
      room and bedroom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to identify microbiology; simultaneously, we record the outdoor&#xD;
      environment and indoor ventilation. To assess subjects' cardiovascular health, we use&#xD;
      DynaPulse to evaluate their cardiovascular function, and make them equipped with Holter&#xD;
      electrocardiography (ECG) to continuously monitor the trend of heart rate variability (HRV)&#xD;
      before and after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, this study aims to investigate the clinical utility of potted mint plants in&#xD;
      reducing indoor bacterial and fungal growth and indoor air pollution, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      benefits. Furthermore, the possible application of indoor potted mint plant in antiviral&#xD;
      influenza or pneumonia in the future.&#xD;
