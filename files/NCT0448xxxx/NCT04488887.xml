  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinal imaging is a corner stone in diagnosis of most retinal disorders. Standard imaging&#xD;
      techniques e.g. fluorescein angiography and color fundus photography have a lot of&#xD;
      limitations including limited resolution, invasive nature in cases of fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography, and inability to segment the retina, accordingly, and only 2D image is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a recent noninvasive imaging technique&#xD;
      that allows for volumetric visualization of eye vasculature. OCTA has shown promise in better&#xD;
      elucidating the pathophysiology of several retinal vascular diseases. Swept-source OCTA uses&#xD;
      long wavelength ̰ 1,050nm, which can penetrate through deeper layers of the eye and can&#xD;
      traverse opacities of media such as cataracts, hemorrhages and vitreous opacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomographic angiograms can further be manually or automatically segmented&#xD;
      with preprogrammed software to highlight individual layers of the retina, optic nerve head&#xD;
      choriocapillaris, and choroid. The user can either analyze en face images extending from the&#xD;
      inner limiting membrane to choroid or use automated views to locate a vascular or structural&#xD;
      lesion within the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different quantitative metrics has been extracted from enface OCTA images including vessel&#xD;
      density, FAZ area, choriocapillaries flow deficit, intercapillary area and fractal dimension.&#xD;
      These metrics are helpful in evaluation the retinal perfusion and used by physicians to&#xD;
      assess various retinal vascular disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although some previous literatures had discussed the repeatability of OCTA metrics, however,&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation of widely used metrics in various retinal condition has not be done.&#xD;
      Additionally, recent data suggest that various methods of calculation of these metrics my&#xD;
      yield final different results of the same metric.&#xD;

      This will be prospective cross-sectional study. This research will be done in the period&#xD;
      between 1 August and 31 December 2020 and will include 80 eyes from patients with following&#xD;
      disorders:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Patients with diabetic retinopathy Group 2: Patients with myopia Group 3: patients&#xD;
      with choroidal neovascularization Group 4: control eyes with no retinal disease. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: Patients above 18 years in age with any of above retinal condition and clear media&#xD;
      allowing for imaging will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will include; Maculopathies (hereditary or acquired), optic nerve head&#xD;
      pathologies (tilted disc, drusen, optic disc edema, atrophy, etc.), optic neuropathies&#xD;
      (demyelinating, infectious, ischemic, etc.), adjusted IOP for central corneal thickness more&#xD;
      than 21 mmHg, surgery-induced corneal edema and dense cataracts that can disrupt images,&#xD;
      history of vasoactive agents (calcium antagonists, nitric oxide, etc.) use, systemic diseases&#xD;
      (vasculitis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc.) and any previous ocular surgery, patients&#xD;
      with bad quality images or complicated surgeries will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be subject to Full ophthalmologic examination and OCTA imaging.&#xD;
      High-quality 3 x 3 mm and 6 x 6 mm OCTA macular scans and 4.5 × 4.5-mm papillary scan with&#xD;
      strong signal-noise ratio and adequate centration on the fovea and optic nerve head&#xD;
      respectively will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient 10 successive scans will be generated to allow for the analysis of&#xD;
      repeatability. Patient will be imaged in the same day at two different OCTA devices Dri&#xD;
      Triton (Topcon, Japan) and Cirrus OCT (Zeiss, USA) to investigate the reproducibility of the&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automated segmentation will be used to evaluate superﬁcial and deep capillary retinal plexus&#xD;
      projections. If errors in segmentation were detected, manual correction would be performed.&#xD;
      The superﬁcial retinal capillary plexus (SCP) was delineated with an inner boundary at the&#xD;
      internal limiting membrane (ILM) and an outer boundary 10 µm inside the inner plexiform layer&#xD;
      (IPL). The deep retinal capillary plexus (DCP) was segmented with an inner boundary 10 µm&#xD;
      inside the IPL and an outer boundary at 10 µm beneath the outer plexiform layer (OPL). In&#xD;
      addition, the total retinal capillary plexus (TCP) was manually customized by selecting the&#xD;
      inner boundary at the ILM and the outer boundary set at 40 µm above the retinal pigment&#xD;
      epithelium (RPE) to avoid any ﬂow signals from choriocapillaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the following metric from enface OCT angiogram; vessel density, vessel&#xD;
      density, intercapillary area, fractal dimension and skeletonized vessel density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every included patient in this study will have unique code number referring to the file where&#xD;
      all his data will be kept confidential. Only macula and optic disc will be imaged.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients' personal data will be hidden during using of these images. All&#xD;
      patients' data will be used for scientific research only and will be kept totally&#xD;
      confidential. Comprehensive explanation of all aspects of this study will be given to&#xD;
      patients before their participation in it, an informed consent will be obtained from the&#xD;
      patients before their enrolment in the study. Although no documented adverse effects from&#xD;
      OCTA imaging on the patients to date, however, any unexpected risks appeared during the&#xD;
      research will be cleared to the participants and the ethical committee on time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS software (version 25; SPSS, Inc., Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA). the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) will&#xD;
      be calculated. ICC is the correlation between two variables measured at the same time point,&#xD;
      with values ranging from 0 to 1 (&lt;0.40, poor; 0.40-0.59, fair; 0.60-0.74, good; 0.75-1.00,&#xD;
      excellent). The CV (%) will be calculated as 100 × standard deviation/overall mean, and a&#xD;
      value &lt;10% represents good repeatability of the measurement.&#xD;
