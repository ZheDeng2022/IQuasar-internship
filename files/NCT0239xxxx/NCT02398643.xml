  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease primarily caused by&#xD;
      smoking. COPD creates a tremendous burden to the healthcare system, as disease exacerbations&#xD;
      result in frequent, prolonged hospitalizations. While originally considered a disease&#xD;
      specific to the lung, data has shown that COPD is associated with substantial cardiovascular&#xD;
      (CV) morbidity and mortality. Exacerbations of COPD requiring hospitalization result in&#xD;
      marked patient deterioration, and heightened CV risk. The cause of the increased CV risk with&#xD;
      stable COPD, and the exaggerated CV risk during exacerbations of the disease are unknown;&#xD;
      however, it may be due to chronic inflammation which is exacerbated with a flare-up of the&#xD;
      disease, and/or chronic inactivity which is similarly worsened with bed-rest during a&#xD;
      hospitalization. Despite the impact of COPD on healthcare, there are relatively few studies&#xD;
      examining how COPD inpatient care impacts on patient outcomes, inflammation and CV risk.&#xD;
      Disease management programs, such as pulmonary rehabilitation and patient self-management&#xD;
      education, are part of guideline therapy for COPD; however, these are not regularly&#xD;
      implemented following a hospitalization, and how these interventions affect patient outcomes,&#xD;
      behavior, physical activity, inflammation and CV risk have not been well studied. The&#xD;
      proposed long-term project will examine how early referral to chronic disease management&#xD;
      programs after hospital discharge, affect patient outcomes. This study will provide&#xD;
      invaluable information about outpatient management for a disease which has a tremendous&#xD;
      impact on healthcare.&#xD;

      Purpose: To examine the impact of early pulmonary education (PE) following hospital discharge&#xD;
      on QoL, pulmonary/CV outcomes and AECOPD hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Studies have shown that education improves self-efficacy and QoL in COPD. Whether&#xD;
      these improvements translate to increased exercise tolerance, physical activity, reduced CV&#xD;
      risk and hospitalizations in patients recently discharged from hospital requires examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients who receive early education will have improved QoL, pulmonary/CV&#xD;
      outcomes, and less COPD hospitalizations in the 6 months following hospital discharge.&#xD;
      Education will improve self efficacy, physical activity and QoL while reducing CV risk as&#xD;
      compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design &amp; Subject Recruitment: In Calgary, patients discharged following an AECOPD&#xD;
      hospitalization are referred to the Calgary COPD and Asthma Program (CCAP) where they are&#xD;
      seen by a Certified Respiratory Educator 1-2 times within the month following discharge. For&#xD;
      this study, patients will be recruited from the CCAP program and randomized into receiving&#xD;
      usual care; general education sessions over the month following discharge, or the&#xD;
      experimental arm; focused education following discharge from hospital. Patients found to have&#xD;
      an acute cardiac injury, mobility issues or residence outside the greater Calgary area will&#xD;
      be excluded. All education visits will be 1hr in length, and occur at a local outpatient&#xD;
      clinic. The education will focus on patient self-management and will use Living Well with&#xD;
      COPD supporting literature (www.livingwellwithcopd.com) designed to improve patient&#xD;
      self-management and physical activity. All patients will be followed up 6 months after&#xD;
      discharge and will be interviewed to assess disease status, management review and if there&#xD;
      has been a history of recurrence or relapse of the AECOPD. Hospital admissions and length of&#xD;
      stay will be obtained through electronic medical records as described above. Patient&#xD;
      assessments will include: quality of life, 6min walk, dyspnea, self-efficacy, physical&#xD;
      activity, pulse wave velocity (PWV), vascular function and systemic inflammation (TNF, MMP-2,&#xD;
      IL-6 and CRP). All data will be collected before, immediately and 6 months after education.&#xD;
      The control group will have the same data collected at the same scheduled time. See above for&#xD;
      descriptions of methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Handling: Data will be entered onto a secure anonymized database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: The influence of education on QoL, 6min walk, dyspnea, self-efficacy, physical&#xD;
      activity, pulse wave velocity, vascular function and systemic inflammation will be evaluated&#xD;
      using a multivariate mixed-model multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with treatment&#xD;
      (education vs. usual care) being a fixed between-group variable and time (pre, immediate&#xD;
      post, 6months post) as a repeated variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Based on previous work, a total sample size of 140 (70 in each group) will be&#xD;
      sufficient to detect a clinically significant difference in QoL and a significant difference&#xD;
      in hospital readmission rates. Based on outhe investigators r recent work, this sample could&#xD;
      detect a 10% difference in PWV and physical activity.&#xD;
