  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses infect millions of people throughout the tropics and subtropics each year. The&#xD;
      development of a dengue vaccine is an important health priority. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      immunologic and clinical response to two dengue vaccines, given 9 months apart, in healthy&#xD;
      adults with no history of previous flavivirus infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue is a mosquito-borne flavivirus. There are 4 types of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2,&#xD;
      DENV-3, and DENV-4), each of which can cause mild illness to life-threatening disease. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunologic and clinical response to two dengue&#xD;
      vaccines (rDEN1Δ30 and rDEN2Δ30-7169), given 9 months apart, in healthy adults with no&#xD;
      history of previous flavivirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the rDEN1Δ30 vaccine or a placebo vaccine&#xD;
      at Day 0. Additional study visits will occur at Days 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90,&#xD;
      180, and 240. At Day 270, all participants will receive the rDEN2Δ30-7169 vaccine. An&#xD;
      inpatient (overnight) stay will occur on Days 274 through 284, with participants being&#xD;
      discharged on Day 284, if they meet the study criteria. Additional visits will occur at Days&#xD;
      286, 291, 298, 326, 360, and 450. Study visits will include blood collection and a physical&#xD;
      examination. Participants will monitor and record their temperature 3 times a day for several&#xD;
      days after each vaccination.&#xD;
