      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the early and late effects of Transcranial Led&#xD;
      Therapy (TLTC) in memory and executive functions in patients with moderate and severe TBI&#xD;
      history (TBI time longer than 3 months).&#xD;

      In the current study patients in the outpatient center - Neurotrauma Unit at University of&#xD;
      SÃ£o Paulo (HCFMUSP) diagnosed with moderate / severe blunt head trauma that meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be divided randomly and blindly in two groups: Group A (n = 15) will&#xD;
      receive stimulation through active helmet and Group B (n = 15) given placebo stimulation or&#xD;
      sham through the inactive helmet. All patients will be subjected to 3 times of&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment: Study 1 (E1) - up to 4 weeks before the start of TLTC&#xD;
      sessions; Study 2 (E2) - a week after the end of TLTC; and Study 3 (E3) - three months after&#xD;
      the intervention. The evaluations will take in order to verify the early and late effects of&#xD;
      TLTC in attention, memory and executive functions in patients with moderate and severe TBI.&#xD;
