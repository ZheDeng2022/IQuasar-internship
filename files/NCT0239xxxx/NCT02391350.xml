  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain and sciatica is a common condition resulting in high costs and disability for&#xD;
      society and affected individuals. Presently there is a lack of evidence for what treatments&#xD;
      may help this condition early in the course of care. Improved early management could reduce&#xD;
      risks for persistent disability and high costs. The goal of this project is to examine the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and costs associated with adding a physical therapy program to early&#xD;
      management of patients with low back pain and sciatica within primary care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is a common and costly condition. When accompanied by sciatica, risks for&#xD;
      persistent disability and future invasive treatments increase. Most patients with LBP and&#xD;
      sciatica enter the healthcare system in primary care. Optimal primary care management is&#xD;
      currently unclear and little data are available to assist clinicians and inform patients of&#xD;
      the likely effects of common options. Practice guidelines agree that imaging, spinal&#xD;
      injections and surgeries should be reserved for patients whose symptoms do not diminish&#xD;
      within 4-8 weeks, yet utilization rates for these procedures are increasing rapidly, partly&#xD;
      due to the uncertainty of what options may be offered to patients for initial treatment.&#xD;
      Physical therapy is considered an option in the initial management period, but is used&#xD;
      inconsistently. It is currently unclear what can be expected from early physical therapy for&#xD;
      patients with LBP and sciatica, and what if any long-term effect it may have on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes or future healthcare utilization. The investigators research team has conducted a&#xD;
      series of clinical trials to clarify the evidence for the most effective physical therapy&#xD;
      procedures for patients with LBP and sciatica, and is now in a position to evaluate if the&#xD;
      use of early, evidence-based physical therapy can reduce the risk of future disability,&#xD;
      healthcare utilization and costs. The proposed study is a randomized trial comparing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of usual, guideline-based initial management of newly consulting patients with&#xD;
      LBP with sciatica with or without the addition of early physical therapy. Specific aims are&#xD;
      to compare the clinical effectiveness, costs (direct and indirect), and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      the addition of physical therapy. All patients will be managed with advice, education and&#xD;
      medication. One group will also receive 6-8 sessions of physical therapy Outcomes will&#xD;
      include measures of disability, pain, psychological distress, healthcare, utilization, and&#xD;
      costs over 1 year. This study will permit an examination of the effectiveness and costs&#xD;
      associated with the use of early physical therapy within primary care for patients with acute&#xD;
      LBP and sciatica. The results of this study will provide needed information to assist&#xD;
      clinicians and inform patients of their options for initial management of this common&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;

Physical therapy will be based on evidence and prior research evaluating a centralizing treatment program for patients with LBP and sciatica.

Each session will include a brief assessment, treatment with centralizing exercises and spinal mobilizations. Mechanical traction is an optional component. Patients will be provided handouts and instructed to perform assigned exercises at home every 4-5 hours on days between sessions.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited from February 2015 through October, 2018. Recruitment was done in 2 health systems (University of Utah and Intermountain Healthcare) in Salt Lake City, Utah. Potential participants were identified using electronic health records and were sent a letter about the study after completing a primary care visit. A research team made follow-up telephone calls to identify those interested in meeting with a research assistant to determine eligibility and provide consent.</recruitment_details>

Physical therapy will be based on evidence and prior research evaluating a centralizing treatment program for patients with LBP and sciatica.

            <description>Patients will be managed by primary care provider with a stepped care approach supported by current practice guidelines. Initial management will include education and re-assurance for the first 4 weeks following the primary care visit.

Physical therapy will be based on evidence and prior research evaluating a centralizing treatment program for patients with LBP and sciatica. The first physical therapy session will be scheduled within 3 days after enrollment and 6-8 sessions will be administered in the first 4 weeks. Each session will include a brief assessment, treatment with centralizing exercises and spinal mobilizations. Mechanical traction is an optional component. Patients will be provided handouts and instructed to perform assigned exercises at home every 4-5 hours on days between sessions.&#xD;
