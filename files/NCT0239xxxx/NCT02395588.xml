      This study will test if standardized care helps patients feel better, if it can be&#xD;
      implemented in rural hospitals, and find out which healthcare processes and outcomes are most&#xD;
      important to heart failure patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this research are to: 1) Conduct a quasi-experimental study of rural hospitals to&#xD;
      test if guideline-based care (standardized patient education, making a post discharge&#xD;
      appointment with the patient's provider and calling the patient at 48 hours to reinforce HF&#xD;
      education) improves patient outcomes (better self-care, and lower readmissions at 7 and 30&#xD;
      days post discharge); 2) Identify hospital (staffing, practice environment, costs) and&#xD;
      provider (evidence-based practices) characteristics associated with better implementation of&#xD;
      heart failure patient care processes; and 3) Determine which healthcare processes and&#xD;
      outcomes are most important to heart failure patients. A quasi-experimental study with mixed&#xD;
      methods will be used. The sample consists of HF patients (N=40, 20 each hospital) and nurses&#xD;
      who care for HF patients on study units (N=90, 45 each hospital) from 2 rural hospitals.&#xD;
      Survey data will be collected from patients (baseline, discharge, 48 hours and 7 days post&#xD;
      discharge) and nurses (baseline, during patient education, on patient discharge). Secondary&#xD;
      data will be collected quarterly on nurse staffing and once for patient readmission within 30&#xD;
      days of discharge. Structured patient interviews will be conducted with 10 HF patients in&#xD;
      person to determine which health care processes and outcomes are most important to them. Both&#xD;
      patients and nurses will be engaged to inform study procedures and outcomes consistent with&#xD;
      the tenants of patient-centered outcomes research.&#xD;

    <description>Prior to discharge. Survey data will include descriptive characteristics, depression, heart failure knowledge. After patient education is complete prior to discharge patients will complete a readiness for discharge scale and heart failure self-care survey.&#xD;
Phone call 48 hours after discharge. Discharge instructions will be reinforced.&#xD;
Phone call 7 days after discharge. Survey data will include self management, complications, and satisfaction care.&#xD;
Secondary data 30 days post discharge. The hospital electronic medical record system will be queried to determine if the patient has been readmitted within 30 days of discharge for heart failure or non-heart failure causes.</description>
