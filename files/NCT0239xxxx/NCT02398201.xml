  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather preliminary data on whether bezafibrate can improve&#xD;
      cellular energy production in mitochondrial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondrial diseases are rare inherited disorders that arise due to deficient energy&#xD;
      production within the cells of the body. Consequently, the typical clinical features arise in&#xD;
      organs with high energy requirements. Mitochondrial disorders exhibit highly variable&#xD;
      clinical effects, both between individuals and within families. Characteristic symptoms&#xD;
      include muscle weakness (myopathy), hearing loss, migraine, epilepsy and stroke like episodes&#xD;
      in addition to diabetes and heart problems. Mitochondrial disorders can therefore impact&#xD;
      considerably on both quality of life and life expectancy. Despite this, no proven disease&#xD;
      modifying treatments are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical studies have identified that several existing medications improve mitochondrial&#xD;
      function. Of these, bezafibrate has the best supportive data and, because it is already&#xD;
      licensed as a treatment for high blood fats, has a well characterised side effect profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will therefore conduct a feasibility study of bezafibrate in people with&#xD;
      mitochondrial myopathy. Ten affected participants will be recruited and will receive a&#xD;
      titrating course of bezafibrate three times daily for 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial disorders are genetically determined metabolic diseases affecting approximately&#xD;
      1 in 5000 people. Current strategies for treating mitochondrial disorders are limited, and&#xD;
      restricted to alleviating symptoms. A recently published Cochrane review did not identify any&#xD;
      disease modifying treatments of proven benefit. There is therefore an urgent and currently&#xD;
      unmet need for treatments that modify the underlying biochemical deficit and disease&#xD;
      trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving deficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathways through induction of&#xD;
      mitochondrial biogenesis is a potential approach to the treatment of mitochondrial disorders.&#xD;
      This involves stimulating transcription factors for both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes&#xD;
      simultaneously in order to up-regulate respiratory chain (RC) gene expression. This role is&#xD;
      fulfilled by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α); a&#xD;
      pivotal transcriptional co-factor widely considered the master regulator of mitochondrial&#xD;
      biogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PGC-1α interacts with a number of transcription factors. These include α, β/δ and γ isoforms&#xD;
      of the peroxisomal proliferator activated receptors (PPARs). This group of ubiquitously&#xD;
      expressed nuclear receptors is activated by binding of fatty acids. Subsequently,&#xD;
      transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is induced, thereby&#xD;
      enabling cellular metabolic shift from glycolysis. Additionally, PGC-1α co-activates estrogen&#xD;
      related receptor alpha (ERRα); nuclear respiratory factors (NRF) 1 and 2 (transcription&#xD;
      factors bound to promoter regions of target nuclear genes involved in the respiratory chain);&#xD;
      and TFAM (transcription factor A mitochondrial), which modulates mitochondrial DNA&#xD;
      transcription and replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PGC-1α expression is induced through cold exposure, starvation and exercise. The PPARs,&#xD;
      AMP-protein activated kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) also increase PGC-1α activity and&#xD;
      provide a means through which this pathway can be pharmacologically manipulated. Indeed,&#xD;
      several compounds have been identified that exert their effect in this way including:&#xD;
      bezafibrate and the glitazones (PPAR agonists); metformin and AICAR (AMPK); and resveratrol&#xD;
      (Sirt1). Of these, bezafibrate, glitazones and metformin have established relevance in&#xD;
      diabetes and hyperlipidaemia. Their mechanism of action also provides a rationale for their&#xD;
      use in other metabolic disorders such as obesity and mitochondrial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed,bezafibrate has shown promise as a disease modifying pharmaceutical agent in&#xD;
      pre-clinical studies using both cellular and animal models of mitochondrial myopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular models of mitochondrial disease have demonstrated improvements in a variety of&#xD;
      measures of mitochondrial function when grown in a bezafibrate enriched medium. This has&#xD;
      included a cell line comparable to the specific patient group we propose to review in this&#xD;
      feasibility study. Furthermore, a mouse model of mitochondrial myopathy has demonstrated&#xD;
      improvement in clinically relevant outcomes including time to disease manifestation and life&#xD;
      span.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase II, open label, non-randomised feasibility study aims to build on the work&#xD;
      obtained in pre-clinical studies and provide proof of principle data in humans affected with&#xD;
      the most common form of mitochondrial muscle disease. This study is not designed to provide&#xD;
      proof of efficacy. However, should bezafibrate exert a demonstrable molecular effect here,&#xD;
      the investigators anticipate the need for larger, randomised trials of bezafibrate in the&#xD;
      future. An additional aim of this feasibility study, is therefore obtaining the relevant data&#xD;
      to determine how many patients the investigators would need in a larger trial; and what&#xD;
      biochemical and clinical measurements the investigators would use to determine drug effect in&#xD;
      such a trial.&#xD;
