    <textblock>
      This is a phase I open-label study to evaluate the safety of ALLO-ASC-DFU in diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers patients. ALLO-ASC-DFU is a hydrogel sheet containing allogenic adipose-derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells. Adipose-derived stem cells have anti-inflammatory effect and release&#xD;
      growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor&#xD;
      (HGF), which can enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide an&#xD;
      new option in treating a diabetic foot ulcer.&#xD;
