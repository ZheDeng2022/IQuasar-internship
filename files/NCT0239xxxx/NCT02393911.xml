    <textblock>
      Currently, the pathogenesis of Localized Provoked Vulvodynia (LPV) has not been elucidated.&#xD;
      Few observations may point to involvement of the microbiome: the association of LPV with&#xD;
      preceding chronic recurrent candidiasis, and the reports of the beneficial effect of a diet&#xD;
      avoiding oxalate on Vulvodynia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in the new field of microbiome research focus on the composition of overall&#xD;
      microorganisms in our body and their impacts on our health. Changes in the composition of the&#xD;
      vaginal microbiota (dysbiosis) have been linked with different health and disease states. We&#xD;
      have also shown recently that women can be divided into 2 groups according to the composition&#xD;
      of their vaginal microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will compare the vaginal microbiome of women with severe LPV, not treated&#xD;
      by diet and otherwise healthy, to women without LPV (we will also compare our results to the&#xD;
      NIH HMP data). Vaginal pH and date of menstrual cycle will be checked. We propose that&#xD;
      dysbiosis in the vaginal microbiota may trigger the development of LPV.&#xD;

      Vulvodynia - vulvar pain. The exact etiology has not been elucidated yet, and therapy is&#xD;
      often unsatisfactory. Two main types of Vulvodynia exist, with the far more common type being&#xD;
      Localized provoked vulvodynia (LPV), also known as Vestibulodynia, and in the past -&#xD;
      Vestibulitis. This study will concentrate on this common disorder which affects young women,&#xD;
      whose quality of life deteriorate significantly by the inability to experience vaginal sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaginal microbiome The new field of microbiome research focuses on the composition of&#xD;
      overall microorganisms in the human body and their impacts on our human health. Amazingly,&#xD;
      the number of microbial cells within our body is 10 times greater than the sum of all our&#xD;
      human somatic and germ cells, and they carry 150 times more genetic information than our own.&#xD;
      Changes in the composition of the vaginal microbiota (dysbiosis) have been linked with&#xD;
      different health and disease states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vagina is colonized with around 108-109 bacteria/mL vaginal fluid which is comparable to&#xD;
      the small intestine. Recently, the NIH Human Microbiome Project characterized the bacterial&#xD;
      communities across the human body and found that the vagina harbors low complexity bacterial&#xD;
      communities. These communities had the lowest alpha diversity (within sample diversity) among&#xD;
      the different body sites and low beta diversity (between sample diversity) at the genus&#xD;
      level. This diversity was high at the species level due to distinct Lactobacillus spp. The&#xD;
      communities were sampled at the sub sites that included the posterior fornix, mid vagina and&#xD;
      the vaginal introitus. There was little distinction between the three sites hence we will&#xD;
      focus on posterior fornix. The vaginal communities of healthy women, have also been&#xD;
      repeatedly observed to occupy one of five states, four dominated by Lactobacillus spp. and&#xD;
      one by higher overall microbial diversity. Shifts between the community structures within&#xD;
      individuals (dysbiosis) are associated with disease states so it would be interesting to&#xD;
      study whether women with LPV belong to a different enterotype than healthy women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaginal microbial communities have been shown to change during different stages in a&#xD;
      woman's life and to influence pregnancy. As early as 1930, Cruickshank and Baird described&#xD;
      changes in the vaginal bacterial communities that occurred between the 5th and 7th month of&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010 a study was undertaken among Amerindian women to examine the microbial vaginal&#xD;
      signature at term in relation to delivery mode (n=9). Variability in vaginal taxa was noted&#xD;
      between subjects particularly for Lactobacillus species. Metagenomic analysis of the vaginal&#xD;
      microbiome in a cross-sectional study of 24 healthy pregnant women and 60 non-pregnant&#xD;
      controls at three vaginal sites (introitus, posterior fornix and midvagina) found the&#xD;
      richness and diversity of the vaginal microbiome to be reduced in pregnancy in ways that did&#xD;
      not appear to be driven by BMI, race or ethnicity . As pregnancy progressed and as proximity&#xD;
      to the uterus increased, less diversity and richness were noted. Lactobacillus species were&#xD;
      enriched in pregnancy, which the authors postulated may be biologically significant as lactic&#xD;
      acid bacteria produce bacteriocins that may reduce the risk of ascending infections. It has&#xD;
      also been proposed that the vaginal microbiota has the potential to influence the conception&#xD;
      process by influencing the local production of proinflammatory cytokines which in turn impact&#xD;
      the survival rate and motility of sperm cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaginal microbiome and Vulvodynia Several microorganisms have been discussed for presumed&#xD;
      role in LPV development: LPV is frequently associated with preceding chronic recurrent&#xD;
      candidiasis, LPV may be produced in a mouse model by repeated vulvovaginal fungal infection,&#xD;
      the difficulty in treating women with concomitant LPV and candidiasis (complicated LPV), the&#xD;
      reports of the beneficial effect of treatment with combined antibiotics, aimed at eradicating&#xD;
      H. pylori peptic condition (although H. pylori has not been detected in LPV tissues).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect evidence of the role of the microbiome with the development of LPV may be deduced&#xD;
      from the beneficial effect (14.3 - 50%), reported by some authors, of a diet avoiding oxalate&#xD;
      and rich in Calcium citrate, on LPV. As women with LPV consume more oxalate - although not&#xD;
      significantly, we suspect that the variability in response rate may be due to the indirect&#xD;
      effect of the diet - through changes in the microbiome, which may be affecting LPV severity.&#xD;
      In addition, the adverse effect of oral contraceptive pills (OCP) in increasing LPV symptoms;&#xD;
      OCP tend to change the composition of the vaginal microbiota, consequent to their effect of&#xD;
      thinning and dehydrating the vaginal mucosa. These finding prompt us to further inquire the&#xD;
      possible association of vaginal microbiome dysbiosis and the development of LPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will first compare the vaginal microbiome of women with severe LPV, not&#xD;
      treated by diet and otherwise healthy, to women without LPV (we will also compare our results&#xD;
      to the NIH HMP data). At the second stage we will characterize the effect of a three-month&#xD;
      low oxalate diet on the vaginal microbiota of women with LPV and on the outcome compared to a&#xD;
      group of patients with LPV not treated by diet. Vaginal pH and date of menstrual cycle will&#xD;
      be checked. We propose that dysbiosis in the vaginal microbiota may trigger the development&#xD;
      of LPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vulvodynia subtype:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research will study women with localized provoked Vulvodynia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only secondary type of LPV will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LPV diagnosis will be based on documenting first two Friedrich's criteria for vulva&#xD;
           vestibulits syndrome: patient's complaint of entry dyspareunia, a positive Q-tip test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only women suffering from levels II or III dyspareunia according to Marinoff : Level II&#xD;
           is where the pain prevents intercourse from taking place on most occasions; and Level&#xD;
           III where pain results in total apareunia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Protocol This will be a double blind, prospective study comparing the microbiome of&#xD;
      women with severe LPV to women without LPV, and to compare the effect of consuming the low&#xD;
      oxalate diet with calcium citrate supplements for one month on the microbiome of women with&#xD;
      LPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local Institutional Review Board approval has been requested. Every woman participating&#xD;
      in the study will sign an informed consent prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will consist of 35 women:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meeting first two Friedrich's criteria for vulva vestibulitis syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed by a gynecological examination with Localized Provoked Vulvodynia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed with a Level II or III degree of the syndrome according to Marinoff Control&#xD;
           group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group will consist of 35 consecutive women who are referred to the&#xD;
           departments of the co-investigators. Presentation of LPV is an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment, the women will be questioned about possible inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and fill in the ISSVD Vulvodynia questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women found suitable for the study will undergo a Q-tip test to confirm the diagnosis of&#xD;
      Vestibulodynia. Women of the LPV group will be instructed to consume a &quot;low oxalate diet&quot;&#xD;
      with calcium citrate supplements, as recommended by Solomons et al for the duration of at&#xD;
      least one month, to assess its impact on the vaginal microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical pain scores and vulvar sensitivity by Q-tip test will be repeated after one month&#xD;
      and compared to the clinical pain scores at the beginning of the study. Subjective evaluation&#xD;
      will be carried out by comparing personal data from questionnaires filled in at enrollment&#xD;
      and one month later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation will be performed by an experienced vulvar expert, using the pain&#xD;
      intensity scale (The 11 points (0-10) pain intensity numerical rating scale-PI-NRS), in seven&#xD;
      foci throughout the vestibule (the Q-tip test) and by comparing patients' responses to&#xD;
      questionnaires evaluating pain during intercourse or other activities (riding a&#xD;
      bicycle/horse), before and after diet.&#xD;
