  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to compare overall survival in older adults with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who receive reduced intensity conditioning hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplant (RIC HSCT) versus those who do not receive HSCT.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MDS is a hematologic malignancy characterized by cytopenias, bone marrow failure, and a risk&#xD;
      of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). HSCT is the only curative therapy for MDS.&#xD;
      Despite its increasing use among older patients (age greater than 60), more data are needed&#xD;
      to assess outcomes of HSCT in older adults compared to other therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observational study, patients with MDS presenting at the study institutions are&#xD;
      screened for disease characteristics that indicate that they are potentially appropriate for&#xD;
      HSCT (both high-risk disease and fit for the procedure). Patients who meet inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study are entered into a clinical database&#xD;
      and followed for overall survival. Patients also complete quality of life (QoL) assessments&#xD;
      at enrollment and two years afterward, with the goal of investigating potential relationships&#xD;
      between QoL and MDS treatment (HSCT vs. non-HSCT strategies).&#xD;

        Eligible patients will be 60 to 75 years old with a diagnosis of MDS or related disorder&#xD;
        (eg, MDS/MPD or CMML) who have disease that is advanced enough to warrant RIC HSCT (defined&#xD;
        by high-risk cytogenetics OR int-2 or high-risk on IPSS OR transfusion dependence as&#xD;
        defined by WPSS) and who are physically fit enough to undergo RIC HSCT as assessed by&#xD;
        pre-determined measures of organ function. Patients whose baseline donor status is known&#xD;
        will be excluded; however, knowledge of HLA status is allowed as long as a donor search has&#xD;
        not been performed.&#xD;
