  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People facing serious health threats increasingly use Internet health support communities to&#xD;
      obtain informational support, emotional support and other resources. This study introduces&#xD;
      software algorithms similar to those used by social media sites to put people in touch with&#xD;
      helpful information and social interactions. Participants from the American Cancer Society's&#xD;
      Cancer Support Network will have access to this online support group using the default&#xD;
      interface that orders content by broad content category and date or with a new interface that&#xD;
      highlights communication content and people that match users' interests and needs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Internet support groups (ISGs) are online communities where people come together to exchange&#xD;
      information, emotional support and other resources. They are an important resource for&#xD;
      patients grappling with serious medical conditions. Although participation in health-related&#xD;
      ISGs has been associated with significant reductions in participant-reported depression,&#xD;
      anxiety and other indicators of psychological distress, many ISG members leave too soon to&#xD;
      benefit. In a parallel study, we are using state-of-the art machine learning and automated&#xD;
      language analysis techniques to assess the types of interactions that keep people&#xD;
      participating in these groups and that lead to improved psychosocial well-being and health&#xD;
      quality of life and how these interactions develop. The clinical trial described here uses&#xD;
      these technologies and insights from our empirical research to build, deploy, and evaluate&#xD;
      interventions that improve the interactions in Internet health support groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will develop and pilot-test interventions to encourage effective communication processes&#xD;
      identified in our empirical research. Participants from the American Cancer Society's Cancer&#xD;
      Support Network will access this support group using either the default interface that orders&#xD;
      content by disease diagnosis and date or with a new interface that sometimes highlights&#xD;
      communication content and people who match their interests and needs. We will test whether&#xD;
      mood, satisfaction with interactions and engagement in the group increase following&#xD;
      interventions that (a) increase participants' receipt of individualized support from others;&#xD;
      (b) provide participants with opportunities to offer support to others; (c) facilitate&#xD;
      participants' expression of emotions; and (d) help participants form relationships with&#xD;
      compatible peers. In a series of small, randomized experiments, we will examine how these&#xD;
      interventions affect participants' communication behaviors as well as short-term engagement&#xD;
      and satisfaction with their online interactions.&#xD;

    <description>Volunteers from the American Cancer Society's Cancer Survivors' Network (CSN) will see some of their messages delivered using CSN's default ordering, which shows messages within a conversational thread ordered by time stamp. Conversational threads are nested within a broad topic-based forum, like breast cancer or colorectal cancer survivors.&#xD;
Note that this is a within-participant trial, so that all participants participate in all arms of the trial. Messages, not people, are randomly assigned to condition.</description>
