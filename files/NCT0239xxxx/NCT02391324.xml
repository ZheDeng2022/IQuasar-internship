  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robot assisted gait training is seen as a promising intervention for improving the walking&#xD;
      abilities of children with cerebral palsy, but research to support its effectiveness compared&#xD;
      to best practice physical therapy is lacking. This research consists of a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) and a qualitative descriptive study that is linked with the RCT. The&#xD;
      goal of the RCT is to compare: 1) a walking training program with the Lokomat速 robotic device&#xD;
      (LOK), 2) a functional physical therapy program (fPT) that includes activities to enhance&#xD;
      balance/co-ordination/endurance and advanced motor skills conducted over 'real ground', 3) a&#xD;
      combined Lokomat速 + functional physical therapy (LOK+fPT) program, and 4) a regular&#xD;
      maintenance therapy condition (CONT) for ambulatory children and youth with CP (aged 5- 18&#xD;
      years). The three intervention programs will consist of sixteen 50-minute sessions given&#xD;
      twice weekly over 8 to 10 weeks. The primary objective of the RCT is to compare the four&#xD;
      groups with respect to walking-related motor skills as measured by the Gross Motor Function&#xD;
      Measure. The secondary objectives are to compare each intervention's impact on walking&#xD;
      abilities, individualized goals, fitness, balance, physical activity levels, child's belief&#xD;
      in ability to do physical activity, participation and quality of life. The investigators will&#xD;
      also evaluate the extent of carryover or progress 3 months after the intervention. The&#xD;
      qualitative part of the study will consist of interviews of children and parents after they&#xD;
      have finished the study intervention. The information from the interviews will assist us with&#xD;
      interpretation of the outcome results (areas of impact and amount of change) from the RCT. In&#xD;
      particular, the interviews will 1) provide insight into their experiences with the trial&#xD;
      interventions, 2) identify the mobility-related outcomes that are important to families and&#xD;
      the factors that influence their preferences, and 3) explain the family values, experiences&#xD;
      and contextual factors that influenced participation in the study. This research will provide&#xD;
      information needed to allow clinicians and families to make informed choices about Lokomat&#xD;
      therapy and physical therapy options in relation to their child's functional goals and&#xD;
      abilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood physical disability, affecting&#xD;
      2.0-2.5 in 1000 children. CP represents a group of disorders of movement and posture with&#xD;
      impairments (e.g., muscle weakness, decreased selective motor control, alterations in muscle&#xD;
      tone, and impairment of postural control) that collectively affect functional mobility. About&#xD;
      65% of children/youth with CP use minimal or no assistive devices (leg braces, walkers,&#xD;
      and/or wheelchairs) to walk (i.e., Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Levels&#xD;
      I and II) while children in GMFCS Levels III - V require varying degrees of bracing, walkers&#xD;
      and other walking devices, wheelchairs, or assistance from others for mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic Assisted Gait training devices are increasingly used with children with CP to improve&#xD;
      their gait related motor skills. The Lokomat速 (LOK) is a commercially available robot&#xD;
      assisted gait training system that uses robotics to simulate walking. It facilitates&#xD;
      inter-limb co-ordination and gait cycle timing and provides variable degrees of body weight&#xD;
      support and guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study represents the first adequately powered RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of robot&#xD;
      assisted gait training for children with CP. The qualitative aspect will give contextual&#xD;
      information to assist with interpretation of the RCT and provide valuable information about&#xD;
      families' experiences with the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research questions for this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) What is the comparative effectiveness of robot assisted gait training (LOK) and fPT&#xD;
      program for improving gait related motor skills of ambulatory children and youth with CP? ii)&#xD;
      Does combining LOK and fPT result in greater improvements in gait related motor skills of&#xD;
      ambulatory children and youth with CP than robot assisted gait training or fPT alone? iii)&#xD;
      What are families' experiences with trial participation and what implications do they have&#xD;
      for interpretation of the quantitative results and the use of robot assisted gait training&#xD;
      and fPT in clinical settings?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This trial is a concurrent, mixed methods study. Specifically, the quantitative arm&#xD;
      is a multi-centre RCT with four groups (22 factorial design, i.e., LOK absent/present, fPT&#xD;
      absent/present) with two periods of post-intervention assessments (immediate and 3 months&#xD;
      later). The RCT is linked with an interpretive descriptive qualitative study arm. The three&#xD;
      study sites are Holland Bloorview (Toronto, Ontario, Canada), Glenrose Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Hospital (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) and Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (Chicago, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants - Children aged 5-18 with CP, GMFCS levels II and III. Inclusion/Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria included in protocol in documents section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization - Following the baseline assessment, participants will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      one of the four groups using computer-generated random sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Physical therapist assessors and data analysts will be blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TreatmentThere are three intervention groups: 1) LOK, 2) LOK + fPT, 3) fPT, and 4) one&#xD;
      maintenance therapy control (CONT) arm. All three intervention groups will receive two&#xD;
      50-minute sessions per week, conducted over 8 -10 weeks. Children in all four groups can&#xD;
      continue to participate in 'maintenance therapy'. Each child will be assigned to a treatment&#xD;
      team of two trained PTs who will share responsibility for the 8 to 10 week intervention&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOK - two 50-minute sessions on the Lokomat速 per week. The study manualized LOK walking&#xD;
      protocol provides methods for progressing/tracking including a 5-minute over ground walking&#xD;
      session after the LOK to facilitate transfer of motor learning from the Lokomat to usual&#xD;
      walking devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fPT Participants will Two 50-minute sessions per week. The manualized motor-learning based&#xD;
      protocol forms the basis for this intervention. Its focus is on balance and multi-plane&#xD;
      gait-based motor skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOK + fPT group protocol: Participants will alternate between LOK and one fPT session per&#xD;
      week for the duration of the 8 to 10 week intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring co-interventionsMaintenance therapies such as home stretching and strengthening&#xD;
      routines can be continued for all 4 groups throughout the study because these therapies have&#xD;
      questionable efficacy, and will likely be equally used across all four groups as they are&#xD;
      common PT recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes - All study outcomes will be measured pre-/post-intervention (&lt; 10 days&#xD;
      pre-intervention and post-completion), and at 3m follow-up (+/- 10 day window) by trained&#xD;
      physical therapists. Data will be entered into REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome - The primary outcome measure is the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66&#xD;
      Dimensions D (Stand) and E (Walk/Run/Jump).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes - Secondary outcomes are measures of walking capacity(6 minute walk test)&#xD;
      fitness (adapted shuttle run test), balance (Pediatric Berg Balance Scale, Quality Function&#xD;
      Measure (FM), and Activities Balance Confidence Scale), functional abilities (PEDI-CAT),&#xD;
      physical activity levels (accelerometry), participation (Participation and Environment&#xD;
      Measure for Children and Youth), physical activity self-efficacy (Self-Efficacy for Physical&#xD;
      Activity), individualized goal attainment (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)&#xD;
      and Goal Attainment Scaling), and quality of life (KidScreen and Students' Life Satisfaction&#xD;
      Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis - Data will be described (e.g., means, standard deviations, frequencies)&#xD;
      for each intervention group and each stratification variable. Mixed-effects multiple linear&#xD;
      regression models will be developed for each outcome with centre as a random effect, centre&#xD;
      by intervention as an interaction (to assess centre effect), and other important variables&#xD;
      (e.g., age and GMFCS level) as covariates. All main analyses will be based on intent-to-treat&#xD;
      with secondary analyses of those with &gt;80% adherence to their intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Component&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three objectives of the concurrent qualitative component are to explicate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Child and parent experiences with the trial interventions and the values and previous&#xD;
           experiences that shape their perceptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The mobility related outcomes that are important to families and factors that influence&#xD;
           these views.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Child and family values, experiences and contextual factors that influenced&#xD;
           participation in the trial, including the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Interpretive description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample selection- The investigators will invite a subset of child-parent dyads from each of&#xD;
      the active interventions in the RCT. In addition, parents of children who were eligible but&#xD;
      declined to participate in the RCT will be invited to participate in the qualitative&#xD;
      component to address objective #3. The estimated sample size is (i.e., 6 child/parent dyads&#xD;
      plus 3 parents from each site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection - Parents will participate in 45-60 minute semi-structured, individual&#xD;
      interviews conducted by one member of the research team. Participating parents of children in&#xD;
      the RCT will be interviewed at 2 points within the trial: i) after completion of the COPM and&#xD;
      prior to receiving the intervention, and ii) within one month of intervention completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children from the RCT will participate in individual interviews at the end of their LOK/fPT&#xD;
      intervention. A customizable &quot;tool box&quot; of age-appropriate child-friendly techniques&#xD;
      including photographs and comic captioning, vignettes, and sentence starters will be used in&#xD;
      a 30-45 minute semi-structured interview with the child without the parent present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis Interviews will be digitally audio-recorded, transcribed&#xD;
      verbatim by a professional transcriptionist, de-identified and imported into NVivo for data&#xD;
      management. Two researchers will collaboratively identify general coding categories. The&#xD;
      researchers will meet to establish consensus on the coding.&#xD;
