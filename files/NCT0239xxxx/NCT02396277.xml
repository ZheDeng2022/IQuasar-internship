  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immobilization after radius fracture seems to increase the risk of developing a Complex&#xD;
      regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a condition associated with pain, increased skin sensitivity&#xD;
      and reduced epidermal nerve density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether 5-week immobilisation leads to functional&#xD;
      and structural sensory changes, and whether the changes are associated with persistent pain.&#xD;
      The investigators plan an explorative, pilot study on six consenting patients immobilised&#xD;
      after a distal radius fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline measurements will be recorded at the day of or the day after trauma:&#xD;
      Demographics, psychological and physical comorbidity, pain characteristics and intensity,&#xD;
      hand function, health related quality of life (HRQOL), quantitative sensory testing will be&#xD;
      recorded while skin biopsies are analyzed for epidermal nerve fiber density. Following&#xD;
      variables such as pain characteristics and intensity, hand function, health related quality&#xD;
      of life, quantitative sensory testing and skin biopsies will be reassessed when the cast is&#xD;
      removed and two months later.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Distal radius fracture is a prevalent injury, affecting 15.000 cases in Norway every year.&#xD;
      About 5% of these patients suffer from longlasting pain and some develop a serious and&#xD;
      chronic CRPS. Patients subjected to hand surgery frequently report pain one month after cast&#xD;
      removal, and further examinations have revealed vascular and trophic changes, and increased&#xD;
      sensitivity to pressure and cold as well as elevated skin levels of proinflammatory&#xD;
      mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term immobilization seems to increase the risk of developing CRPS symptoms. In a Danish&#xD;
      study healthy volunteers demonstrated increased hyperalgesia to cold and mechanical stimuli&#xD;
      even after 4-week immobilization which may indicate an early change in the nerve function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CRPS patients skin biopsies have demonstrated reduced epidermal nerve fiber density, but&#xD;
      such data are lacking after radius fracture and during early stage of CRPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this explorative, observational, pilot study is to investigate whether radius&#xD;
      fracture followed by 5-week of immobilization, leads to functional and structural changes of&#xD;
      the sensory system which are reversed after remobilization and whether the sensory changes&#xD;
      are associated with persistent pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are: 1) Patients with an immobilised arm following a radius fracture develops&#xD;
      a) early cutaneous hypersensitivity (hyperalgesia and allodynia) for mechanical og thermal&#xD;
      stimuli and b) reduced epidermal nerve fiber density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) The changes of the sensory system are reversed after 2-month remobilization. 3) The&#xD;
      functional and structural changes are correlated with patient reported outcome measures&#xD;
      (PROM) such as disability of arm, shoulder and hand (DASH), with pain intensity (NRS),&#xD;
      duration of the pain and HRQOL .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be included throughout 2015, and results will be analyzed within&#xD;
      December 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self reported: Demographics (age, gender, civil state, education, working status, social&#xD;
      security benefits) and clinical data of comorbidity, pain characteristics (DN4) and intensity&#xD;
      (NRS), blood pressure, smoking /other kind of nicotine use, pain medication, and assessment&#xD;
      scales for mental distress (HSCL 25), pain catastrophizing (PCS), hand function (DASH), and&#xD;
      HRQOL (EQ5D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations: Quantitative sensory testing (tactile and thermal stimuli) and skin biopsies&#xD;
      are carried out 10 cm proximal to fracture line on the dorsum of the affected arm.&#xD;
      Measurements for predictor analyses will only be performed at baseline while outcome&#xD;
      measurements will be performed prior to and just after removal of the cast as well as two&#xD;
      months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regression analyses will be performed to identify other predictors for the changes in sensory&#xD;
      nervous system including blood pressure, smoking /other kind of nicotine use, medication,&#xD;
      age, gender, and comorbidity. Longitudinal analyses of numerical outcome (ANOVA repeated&#xD;
      measurement) will be carried out for outcome measurements such as pain intensity,hand&#xD;
      function, HRQOL, sensory thresholds and epidermal nerve fiber density.&#xD;
