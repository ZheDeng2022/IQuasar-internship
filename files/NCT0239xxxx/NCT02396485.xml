    <textblock>
      After institutional review approval, pregnant women that are scheduled for elective cesarean&#xD;
      delivery will be approached for participation in the study. The study informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained. The study's time frame inclusive will be from 2013 till 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to regular diet within 6 hrs postoperative (Early group) versus&#xD;
      remaining nothing per os (NPO, i.e nothing per mouth) for 12hrs, and the diet then advanced&#xD;
      as tolerated after 12hrs (Routine Group) as standard postoperative protocol in the&#xD;
      investigators' institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome will be time to pass flatus. Secondary outcomes will include hospital length&#xD;
      of stay, postoperative nausea, vomiting and patient satisfaction. Randomization will be&#xD;
      performed using a computer generated random list of numbers assigning patients to the 2&#xD;
      groups of the study. This list of random number assignments will be kept secure in an opaque&#xD;
      envelope until the end of the study. Patients in the Early group will be started on regular&#xD;
      diet within 6 hrs of surgery, whereas the routine group patients will be kept strict NPO&#xD;
      12hrs, and clear liquid diet will be started after 12hrs. Diet will be advanced as tolerated,&#xD;
      i.e. if clears were tolerated or flatus or bowel movement occurred, patients will be started&#xD;
      on solid foods. If diet not tolerated, a full liquid diet will be given instead. Consequently&#xD;
      if patient tolerated full liquid diet, a regular diet will be then initiated. Patients will&#xD;
      be discharged home only if they tolerate solid food with absence of emesis, have flatus or&#xD;
      bowel movement. Time Zero is defined as time of skin incision.&#xD;

      After institutional review approval, pregnant women that are scheduled for elective cesarean&#xD;
      delivery will be approached by Principal investigator or any of the co-investigators for&#xD;
      participation in the study during the the preoperative visit which coincides with the same&#xD;
      day of scheduled cesarean in a private patient room. . Prospective subjects will be&#xD;
      presenting for their preoperative appointment (same day of scheduled cesarean delivery) in&#xD;
      labor and delivery and will be asked to participate in the study. The study will be explained&#xD;
      as in the consent form and if agreed patients will elect either to or not to participate in&#xD;
      the study after all risks and benefits are explained. Data to be collected will consist of&#xD;
      time in minutes of passing flatus, time in minutes of having a bowel movement, hospital&#xD;
      length of stay, postoperative nausea, vomiting and presence of ileus (unable to tolerate&#xD;
      diet, abdominal distention, no bowel movement nor flatus, abdominal x-ray demonstrating&#xD;
      air/fluid levels in bowel). Patients will be contacted once to twice a day for assessment of&#xD;
      data points mentioned above. If elected to participate consents will be obtained.&#xD;
      Randomization will be done at time of consents. The study's time frame inclusive will be from&#xD;
      2013 till 2016.&#xD;
