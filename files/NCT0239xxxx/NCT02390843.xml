    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial with new experimental drugs such as simvastatin in combination with&#xD;
      topotecan and cyclophosphamide in the hopes of finding a drug that may work against tumors&#xD;
      that have come back or that have not responded to standard therapy. This study will define&#xD;
      toxicity of high dose simvastatin in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      evaluate for cholesterol levels and IL6/STAT3 pathway changes as biomarkers of patient&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy resistance is a major cause of treatment failure in pediatric solid tumors.&#xD;
      STAT3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3) is a transcription factor that&#xD;
      promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. Pediatric solid tumors&#xD;
      such as neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) tumors such as glioblastoma and medulloblastoma have aberrant STAT3 signaling.&#xD;
      In neuroblastoma, bone marrow production of interleukin 6 (IL-6), a STAT3 activating&#xD;
      cytokine, is associated with poor prognosis. Thus STAT3 and its cognate ligand, IL-6, are&#xD;
      rational therapeutic targets in pediatric solid and CNS tumors. HMG-CoA&#xD;
      (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors, or &quot;statins&quot;, lower LDL (low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein) cholesterol by inhibiting the rate-limiting step in cholesterol&#xD;
      biosynthesis. Pleiotropic properties of statins have been found to not only contribute to&#xD;
      lowering the risk of heart disease, but decrease the incidence of cancer as well, leading to&#xD;
      their use in clinical trials for adult solid and CNS tumors. Statins have been shown to&#xD;
      inhibit IL-6 mediated STAT3 activation to prevent the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells&#xD;
      to injured heart tissue in adult patients. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, will augment chemotherapy effects to improve&#xD;
      survival of patients with refractory or relapsed pediatric solid and CNS tumors. This is a&#xD;
      Phase I trial of simvastatin in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide for&#xD;
      refractory and/or relapsed solid or CNS tumors of childhood, in which the investigators will&#xD;
      define toxicity and evaluate cholesterol levels and IL6/STAT3 pathway changes as biomarkers&#xD;
      of patient response.&#xD;
