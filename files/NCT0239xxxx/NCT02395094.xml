    <textblock>
      Children can experience high levels of anxiety immediately prior to surgery. In fact, this&#xD;
      can be the most stressful part of the whole surgical experience for children. Anxiety before&#xD;
      surgery is associated with problems after surgery; such as short-term increased need for pain&#xD;
      medication and long-term sleep disturbances or behaviour change. Child Life, a program run in&#xD;
      some North American children's hospitals has developed ways to reduce children's anxiety&#xD;
      prior to surgery. These techniques can include role-play or story books amongst others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to look at the benefits of the Child Life techniques on&#xD;
      anxiety levels of children and their caregivers just prior to receiving anesthesia in the&#xD;
      operating room. The study will include children between the ages of 3 and 10 years old,&#xD;
      needing day case surgery lasting less than 2 hours, and having never had surgery before. They&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to either not receive any intervention by Child Life or to receive&#xD;
      Child Life intervention in the period prior to their surgery, when they are waiting in the&#xD;
      Surgical Day Care Unit. Anxiety levels of the children and their caregivers will be measured&#xD;
      as they arrive in the hospital and immediately prior to anesthesia, to see if there is a&#xD;
      lower level of anxiety in the group receiving the Child Life intervention.&#xD;

      RESEARCH DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial that will assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of immediate preoperative Child Life intervention in reducing preoperative&#xD;
      anxiety prior to induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial will compare two groups of children&#xD;
      undergoing induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (Standard Procedure) will receive BCCH standard care, which consists of topical&#xD;
           anesthetic cream, waiting with parents in the playroom in the surgical daycare unit&#xD;
           preoperatively, parental presence in the operating room (OR), the BC Children's Hospital&#xD;
           (BCCH) 'parent hug' and standard distraction techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (Child Life) will receive Child Life intervention applicable to the individual&#xD;
           patient, on the day of surgery in addition to standard practice techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures will be the scores from validated observer ratings of anxiety at&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia. A trained research assistant (RA) will observe and score the child's&#xD;
      anxiety using the following validated tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale - short form (m-YPAS-SF), designed&#xD;
           specifically to assess the preoperative anxiety in children aged 3 to 12 years, using&#xD;
           real-time observational assessment of the child's anxiety-indicating behaviours&#xD;
           (activity, vocalizations, emotional expressivity and state of arousal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Perioperative Adult Child Behavioral Interaction Scale (PACBIS), designed for&#xD;
           real-time evaluation of perioperative anxiety behaviours of children and parents, which&#xD;
           include child coping behaviours and parent-positive/negative behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline anxiety score and randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the child's arrival in the Surgical Day Care Unit (SDCU), a baseline observational anxiety&#xD;
      score will be taken by the RA (at t0), using the m-YPAS-SF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RA will then leave SDCU prior to randomization, which will be carried out by the Child&#xD;
      Life specialist. Consented subjects will be randomly assigned into one of two groups to&#xD;
      receive either Standard Procedure (n = 30) or Child Life (n = 30). Groups will be randomized&#xD;
      using computer generated random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SDCU:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the baseline anxiety scores and randomization, the child will then follow as per&#xD;
      SDCU policy. If the child has been randomized to receive Child Life intervention (Group 2),&#xD;
      then the Child Life specialist will carry out the interventions, prior to the child coming to&#xD;
      the OR. All other processes will be as standard: the anesthesiologist and dentist making&#xD;
      their preoperative visit, analgesic premedication being given, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child Life specialists work around other clinical activities. In some cases, there may not be&#xD;
      enough time to provide sufficient Child Life guidance; for example, some patients are 'fast&#xD;
      tracked' if the OR is running ahead of schedule or if the family arrives late. If the&#xD;
      participant is in group 2, we will require that the Child Life specialist be able to spend a&#xD;
      minimum of 15 minutes with the child and family. If that is not possible, the family will be&#xD;
      excluded from further participation in the study and from any data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, if the case is delayed by &gt; 1 hour or is postponed to another day, the family will&#xD;
      be excluded from further participation in the study and from any data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the OR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will enter into the OR with one caregiver, according to BCCH standard policy.&#xD;
      Distraction will consist of the usual techniques employed by the attending anesthesiologist&#xD;
      and OR staff. These techniques will not be standardized or altered for the purpose of the&#xD;
      study and may include such measures as bubbles, storytelling, video, or music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RA will be present in the OR and score the subject's state anxiety (m-YPAS-SF) and the&#xD;
      anxiety behaviours of the subject/parent (PACBIS) at the time (t1) of IV insertion or attempt&#xD;
      at IV insertion. Planned mask inductions of anesthesia will be excluded, but in some cases,&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist may elect to proceed with a mask induction after attempting an IV&#xD;
      insertion. The m-YPAS-SF and PACBIS scoring will still be possible during the initial attempt&#xD;
      at IV insertion.&#xD;
