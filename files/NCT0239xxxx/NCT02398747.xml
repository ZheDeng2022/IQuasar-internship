    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      continuous and/or intermittent dosing of AZD2014 when given orally to patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid malignancies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-centre study of AZD2014 administered orally in Japanese patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid malignancies. The study design allows an evaluation of each cohort with&#xD;
      intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients. In this study, a minimum of&#xD;
      3 and a maximum of 6 evaluable patients will be enrolled in each cohort; approximately 24&#xD;
      evaluable patients in total. The total number of patients enrolled will depend upon the&#xD;
      number of screen failures, number of cohorts and number of evaluable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, preliminary efficacy and PK (single and multiple dose) are evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a single dose of AZD2014 on Day 1 (to allow assessment of single dose&#xD;
      PK), then after a minimum of 48 hours washout period continuous or intermittent twice daily&#xD;
      dosing of AZD2014 will be initiated. The washout period of 48 hours may be extended depending&#xD;
      on emerging data from previous cohorts.Doses and schedules to be evaluated will be agreed by&#xD;
      AstraZeneca and the Safety Review Committee (SRC).&#xD;
