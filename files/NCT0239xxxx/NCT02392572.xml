    <textblock>
      The goal of Phase I of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of&#xD;
      ONC201 alone or in combination with low dose cytarabine (LDAC) that can be given to patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory AML, ALL, or MDS. The goal of Phase II of this study is to learn&#xD;
      if the dose of ONC201 given alone or in combination with LDAC that is found in Phase I can&#xD;
      help to control the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the study drug will be studied in both phases of this study. This is the first&#xD;
      study using ONC201 in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ONC201 given alone or in combination with LDAC is in a very early stage of development for&#xD;
      use in humans. Providing direct medical benefit to you is not the purpose of this study.&#xD;
      While Phase II will look at the effectiveness of the study drug given alone or in combination&#xD;
      with LDAC, the main purpose of this study is to learn about the safety of the drug.&#xD;

      Study Groups If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be enrolled&#xD;
      in a study group (Arm) based on the type of disease you have and/or when you joined this&#xD;
      study. Up to 15 groups of up to 6 participants per group will be enrolled in Phase I of the&#xD;
      study, and up to 20 participants will be enrolled in Phase II. All will take part at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Phase I Arms A, B, C, D or E, the dose and frequency of ONC201 alone&#xD;
      or in combination with LDAC you receive will depend on when you join the study. The first&#xD;
      group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of ONC201. If no intolerable side&#xD;
      effects are seen, the next group of participants will receive a higher dose than the group&#xD;
      before them. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of ONC201 is found. The dose&#xD;
      you receive may be too low to have an effect on your disease, or so high that it causes bad&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Phase II, you will receive ONC201 alone or in combination with LDAC at&#xD;
      the highest dose level that was tolerated by participants in the Phase I portion of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Arms A, B, C, and D, each study drug cycle is 21 days. If you are enrolled in Arm E or in&#xD;
      the Phase 2 study, each cycle will be 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take ONC201 capsules by mouth as directed by your doctor 2 hours before or after a&#xD;
      meal. If you vomit after taking ONC201, you should not retake the dose. Your doctor will tell&#xD;
      you how many capsules to take and how often to take them (either 1 or 2 times every week,&#xD;
      depending on what group you are assigned to). You must not crush or chew the capsules or&#xD;
      dissolve them in liquid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LDAC will be injected under the skin on Days 3-12 of each 4 week cycle. You or your caregiver&#xD;
      will be taught how to inject the LDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a study drug diary to write down any missed doses. You will give your study&#xD;
      drug diary to the study doctor at each clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your dose may be increased or decreased if you have any side effects, if you respond to the&#xD;
      study drug, or if the doctor thinks that the next higher dose level is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including vital signs, weight, and discussion about any&#xD;
           other medications you are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have 1 EKG before your dose of study drug and then 3 more times over the next 2&#xD;
           hours after the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for PK testing 5 times over the next 24 hours&#xD;
           after the dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for PD testing before your dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Arm D, during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected for PK&#xD;
      testing at pre-dose, and at 30 minutes (± 15 minutes), 2 hours (± 30 minutes), 4 hours (± 30&#xD;
      minutes), and 6 hours (± 30 minutes) after you receive ONC201 on Day 1 and Day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Arm E, during Cycle 1, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected for PK testing at&#xD;
      pre-dose, and 30 minutes (± 15 minutes), 2 hours (± 30 minutes), 4 hours (± 30 minutes), and&#xD;
      6 hours (± 30 minutes) after you receive ONC201 on Days 1, 2, 3, 12, 22 and 23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 2-4 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 2 only, you will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for PK and/or PD testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG, vital signs, and discussion about any other medications you are&#xD;
           taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 8 only, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK and PD testing. On Day 22&#xD;
           of Cycle 1 (Arm E only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and&#xD;
           beyond&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including vital signs and a discussion of any other&#xD;
           medications you are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG before your dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK and PD testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Cycle 2 only, you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy for PD testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 21 of Cycle 3, and then any time the doctor thinks it is needed after that, you will&#xD;
      have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy for cytogenetic, biomarker, and PD testing. Biomarkers are&#xD;
      found in the blood/tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 month after your last dose of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including vital signs and a discussion of any other&#xD;
           medications you are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK and PD&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check&#xD;
           for any genetic mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. ONC201 is not FDA-approved or commercially available. It is&#xD;
      currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study&#xD;
      drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 120 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
