      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in reproductive medicine have generated a demand for more accurate imaging&#xD;
      methods for identifying the specific cause of female infertility and other gynecologic&#xD;
      disorders. Virtual hysterosalpingography is an emerging modality in which aspects of the&#xD;
      established technique of hysterosalpingography are combined with the cutting-edge technology&#xD;
      of multidetector computed tomography (CT) to allow a comprehensive and highly accurate&#xD;
      evaluation of both the female reproductive system and the pelvic anatomy generally. Unlike&#xD;
      ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, multidetector CT is capable of&#xD;
      depicting both the external and internal surfaces of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and other&#xD;
      pelvic organs, providing high-resolution data that are suitable for two- and&#xD;
      three-dimensional reconstructions and virtual endoscopic views. Thus, virtual&#xD;
      hysterosalpingography may prove to be superior to other noninvasive modalities for evaluating&#xD;
      tubal patency. Moreover, in comparison with conventional hysterosalpingography, which may&#xD;
      involve cervical clamping, virtual hysterosalpingography is painless. Because of the health&#xD;
      risks associated with ionizing radiation, the use of another modality (eg, MR imaging, US)&#xD;
      may be preferred if the presence of a focal uterine lesion is strongly suspected. However,&#xD;
      virtual hysterosalpingography with multidetector CT may provide a diagnostic advantage in&#xD;
      complex cases.&#xD;

      Infertility is a common problem that affects one in six couples. It is defined as the&#xD;
      inability to get pregnant after a reasonable time (12 months) of sex without using birth&#xD;
      control measures. The causes of the increased prevalence of infertility are difficult to&#xD;
      establish. This increase could be due to several factors such as the postponement of the time&#xD;
      when it is decided to have children, alterations in semen quality, changes in sexual&#xD;
      behavior, etc. The study of the infertile couple has always been focussed on different&#xD;
      factors: ovulatory (20%), utero-tubal (30%) , the migration of sperm (10%) and male (30%).&#xD;
      About 40% of all infertile couples exhibit a combination of factors and about 15% do not&#xD;
      display any objective alteration leading to a definite diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last two decades major changes occurred in the approach to infertility. With the&#xD;
      introduction of new assisted reproductive technologies, the development of molecular biology&#xD;
      and novel diagnostic imaging methods, there have been major advances in the evaluation and&#xD;
      treatment of couples considered infertile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is the useful imaging method for evaluating the fallopian tubes&#xD;
      and uterine cavity. Scanning is performed in the follicular phase of the cycle and is carried&#xD;
      out in an X-ray fluoroscopy. Indications for HSG have been reduced with the introduction of&#xD;
      new diagnostic methods, actually being basically an essencial technique used in the study of&#xD;
      the factors responsible for infertility as well as recurrent abortions. On the downside,&#xD;
      exposure to radiation and use of impingement of the cervix during the procedure, with the&#xD;
      possible complications mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to technological advances, a new technique based on CT studies has been developed, and it&#xD;
      is called virtual Hysterosalpingography (HSG-V). It is performed with a multislice CT scanner&#xD;
      with high resolution and quality of images. It is a noninvasive study and needs none pinch&#xD;
      the cervix. It has the ability to assess blockages and defects or other uterine and tubal&#xD;
      problems, besides appreciating for abnormalities that may cause the inability of a couple to&#xD;
      achieve pregnancy. Also reveals the organs of the pelvis in its entirety and fallopian tubes,&#xD;
      and inside its walls. This helps to detect the presence of polyps, adhesions, fibroids,&#xD;
      narrow tubes, or occupying lesions light. Compared with conventional HSG, the advantage is&#xD;
      that it is non-invasive, painless and takes only a few seconds, conditions that provide women&#xD;
      with greater comfort. Moreover, it provides the doctor with more complete information than&#xD;
      the conventional method, because it provides two-dimensional and three-dimensional endoscopic&#xD;
      images. Additionally, the radiation received by the patient is less than that required in the&#xD;
      conventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the female pelvis is the largest study performance&#xD;
      evaluation of pelvic pathology (endometriosis, fibroids, adenomyosis, etc.). Contributing to&#xD;
      this characteristics of being non-invasive and does not use ionizing radiation. It has high&#xD;
      resolving power for the assessment of ovarian and uterine pathology, being especially useful&#xD;
      for cases where ultrasound is inconclusive. It also plays a dual role in the case of uterine&#xD;
      malformations: It allows the extension and/or confirmation of the ultrasound diagnosis and&#xD;
      evaluates the associated malformations, mainly of the urinary system. Major limitations of&#xD;
      the MRI are low availability, presence of a pacemaker or metallic foreign bodies. A relative&#xD;
      advantage is its lower cost compared to the HSG-V, and lower cost if making multiple&#xD;
      conventional studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current assessment of the patient with infertility involves several studies to determine the&#xD;
      causative factor. The virtues of the MRI position it as an integrative alternative to&#xD;
      conventional multi-modal methods in the study of the female pelvis.&#xD;
