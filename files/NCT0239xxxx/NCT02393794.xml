      Study combination use of cisplatin plus romidepsin and nivolumab in metastatic triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) or BRCA mutation-associated locally recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related death&#xD;
      in American women. Despite recent improvement in the treatment of breast cancer, 40,000 women&#xD;
      per year still die in the U.S.as a result of breast cancer. Once the disease has gotten worse&#xD;
      (progressed) after standard chemotherapy treatments, there are limited treatment options and&#xD;
      the likelihood for patients to recover is very small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be done in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will determine the highest dose of romidepsin that is safe and tolerable to take in&#xD;
      combination with cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will determine if taking romidepsin (at the dose determined in Phase I) in&#xD;
      combination with cisplatin and nivolumab is safe and effective in treating patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will complete before Phase II begins.&#xD;
