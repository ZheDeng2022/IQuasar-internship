    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well 11C-choline (carbon C 11 choline) and 18F-choline&#xD;
      (fluorine F 18 choline) positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging&#xD;
      works in diagnosing patients with unfavorable intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Diagnostic procedures, such as 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR may help find and diagnose&#xD;
      prostate cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the ability of 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR to detect and localize prostate&#xD;
      cancer within the prostate gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the ability of 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR to detect the specific location of&#xD;
      metastatic prostate cancer within pelvic lymph node regions in patients undergoing radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the comparative performance of 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR to already available&#xD;
      imaging scans (bone scan, sodium fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography&#xD;
      [NaF PET/CT], multiparametric1H magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], and/or pelvic CT scans) for&#xD;
      detecting and localization of disease within the prostate, lymph nodes, and distant&#xD;
      metastatic sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the temporal distribution of 11C- and 18F-choline radiotracer in patients.&#xD;
      The tissue uptake, retention, and clearance will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare regions of uptake on the 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR to that on the sentinel&#xD;
      lymph node imaging scans in patients undergoing sentinel lymph node-guided extended pelvic&#xD;
      lymph node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo 11C- and 18F-choline whole-body PET/MR imaging. After completion of study&#xD;
      treatment, patients are followed up for 3 hours&#xD;

    <description>A spearman rank correlation test was performed to test the correlation of K1 with K1max. Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ) determines the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. The Spearman correlation coefficient is reported in values from +1 to -1. A ρ= +1 indicates a perfect association of ranks, a ρ = zero indicates no association between ranks and a ρ = -1 indicates a perfect negative association of ranks. The closer ρ is to zero, the weaker the association between the ranks.</description>

    <description>The system of pathological staging is developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and is divided into 5 stages: stage 0 (zero) and stages I through IV (1 through 4). A spearman rank correlation test was performed to test the correlation of SUVmax with a patient's baseline pathological stage. Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ) determines the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. The Spearman correlation coefficient is reported in values from +1 to -1. A ρ= +1 indicates a perfect association of ranks, a ρ = zero indicates no association between ranks and a ρ = -1 indicates a perfect negative association of ranks.

    <time_frame>After surgery, Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPRA is a 5 item questionnaire completed by the clinicians with a total score range from 0-10 calculated using points assigned to: age at diagnosis, PSA at diagnosis, Gleason score of the biopsy, clinical stage and percent of biopsy cores involved with cancer. A CAPRA score of 0 to 2 indicates low-risk, a score of 3 to 5 indicates intermediate-risk, and a score of 6 to 10 indicates high-risk. A spearman rank correlation test was performed to test the correlation of SUVmax with a patient's CAPRA score after surgery. Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ) determines the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. The Spearman correlation coefficient is reported in values from +1 to -1. A ρ= +1 indicates a perfect association of ranks, a ρ = zero indicates no association between ranks and a ρ = -1 indicates a perfect negative association of ranks.

        <title>Correlation of SUVmax of Primary Tumors With Serum Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Level</title>
        <description>A spearman rank correlation test was performed to test the correlation of SUVmax with a patients baseline PSA. Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ) determines the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. The Spearman correlation coefficient is reported in values from +1 to -1. A ρ= +1 indicates a perfect association of ranks, a ρ = zero indicates no association between ranks and a ρ = -1 indicates a perfect negative association of ranks. The closer ρ is to zero, the weaker the association between the ranks.</description>

        <description>The system of pathological staging is developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and is divided into 5 stages: stage 0 (zero) and stages I through IV (1 through 4). A spearman rank correlation test was performed to test the correlation of SUVmax with a patient's baseline pathological stage. Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ) determines the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. The Spearman correlation coefficient is reported in values from +1 to -1. A ρ= +1 indicates a perfect association of ranks, a ρ = zero indicates no association between ranks and a ρ = -1 indicates a perfect negative association of ranks.

        <description>The CAPRA is a 5 item questionnaire completed by the clinicians with a total score range from 0-10 calculated using points assigned to: age at diagnosis, PSA at diagnosis, Gleason score of the biopsy, clinical stage and percent of biopsy cores involved with cancer. A CAPRA score of 0 to 2 indicates low-risk, a score of 3 to 5 indicates intermediate-risk, and a score of 6 to 10 indicates high-risk. A spearman rank correlation test was performed to test the correlation of SUVmax with a patient's CAPRA score after surgery. Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ) determines the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. The Spearman correlation coefficient is reported in values from +1 to -1. A ρ= +1 indicates a perfect association of ranks, a ρ = zero indicates no association between ranks and a ρ = -1 indicates a perfect negative association of ranks.
