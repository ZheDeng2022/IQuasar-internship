      This is a clinical protocol, randomized, crossover, double-blind (patient and data analyst)&#xD;
      will be held. The study protocol is registered in clinicalTrials.gov - NCT02398344.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with AVE will be recruited from the physical therapy clinics of the Universidade&#xD;
      Nove de Julho - Sao Paulo, Brazil. The participants will be recruited and selected based on&#xD;
      the following eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample of 20 the participants (05 participants in each level of motor impairment&#xD;
      - mild, moderate, marked and severe) will taken. This value will assumed, based on studies of&#xD;
      Okano et al.²⁰ evaluating HRV after tDCS in 10 athletes and Vandermeeren et al.²⁶ that&#xD;
      evaluated the effect of tDCS over the cardiorespiratory system in 30 healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the primary outcome will considered the heart rate variability, validated for the&#xD;
      population of adults with hemiparesis after a stroke and a variable considered secondary&#xD;
      outcome, by correlating the functional capacity with the severity of the stroke, the 6-minute&#xD;
      walk test, considering the cardiorespiratory fitness and the patient's mobility before and&#xD;
      after the application of tDCS and correlate whether there are differences on the immediate&#xD;
      effect of tDCS applied in both cerebral hemispheres (right and left).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Initially, participants will be screened at University Nine July physical therapy&#xD;
      clinics at São Paulo. Individuals who meet the eligibility criteria will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study, being included after agreement by signing the Instrument of&#xD;
      Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following description of the evaluation procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification form: After screening, an identification sheet of the selected volunteers will&#xD;
      be filled in, containing the following information: name, date of birth, age (years and&#xD;
      months), topographic diagnosis of stroke, classification of the type of stroke (hemorrhagic&#xD;
      or ischemic), weight (kg), height (cm), blood pressure (BP), classification of functional&#xD;
      severity according to Fulg Meyer ²⁷ (Mild, Moderate, marked and severe) time since injury,&#xD;
      area of committed member, carried out therapies and how long, muscle strength of the paretic&#xD;
      body side according to Kendall et al. ²⁸ and Ashworth ²⁹.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Mobility Scale: This scale will be used for screening, in order to assess how the&#xD;
      individual moves in the environment to achieve their interaction in everyday life with family&#xD;
      and the social environment. The FMS provides scores in three different lengths (5m, 50m and&#xD;
      500m), relating to mobility at home, school and community. The classification is performed&#xD;
      according to the patients needs in assistance to movement and according to the distance ²⁵.&#xD;
      The included patient should wander at least 50 m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be recorded on a card and then the patients will informed about the&#xD;
      experimental procedures, including previous recommendations to each test: have a light meal&#xD;
      in the days of the tests; abstain from caffeine and alcohol intake and / or smoking, avoid&#xD;
      moderate or excessive effort the day before and on test day, have a good night's sleep and&#xD;
      present ourself in comfortable clothes and shoes that allow good mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function tests: spirometry evaluation EasyOne Plus Diagnostic Sprometry System® in&#xD;
      order to identify the presence of lung function changes measured by forced expiratory volume&#xD;
      in the first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), peak flow expiratory (PEF) and FEV1&#xD;
      / FVC ratio, according to the criteria of the American Thoracic Society ³⁰. Spirometric&#xD;
      indices will be presented in absolute terms and as a percentage of the reference values.&#xD;
      Volunteers must complete at least three acceptable and reproducible forced expiratory&#xD;
      maneuvers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory muscle strength: Respiratory muscle strength will be obtained through maximal&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), which measures the&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, respectively, and will be obtained by the method&#xD;
      of Black &amp; Hyatt³¹. In order to accomplish these steps, it uses a scaled manometer in cm H2O,&#xD;
      with an operating range of ± 300 cmH2O adapter equipped with nozzles and containing a safety&#xD;
      valve through a bore, 2mm in diameter, in order to prevent increased pressure in the oral&#xD;
      cavity generated exclusively by facial²⁴ muscle contraction. The MIP is obtained by a maximal&#xD;
      inhalation maneuver starting from a maximum expiration and MEP obtained by a maximum&#xD;
      exhalation maneuver starting from maximum inspiration. Each maneuver will be maintained for a&#xD;
      minimum of two to three seconds. The MIP and MEP performed three times for each patient, and,&#xD;
      for analysis, will count the highest value obtained ³².&#xD;
&#xD;
      FulgMeyer scale (EFM) - The motor impairment assessment instruments measure the level of&#xD;
      motor recovery of hemiplegic patients, highlighting the motor test procedure in Hemiplegia.&#xD;
      The proposed measures in the FSM are based on neurological examination and sensory-motor&#xD;
      activity of upper and lower limbs in order to identify selective and synergistic activity&#xD;
      patterns of patients who suffered strokes. This scale was constructed following the&#xD;
      hypothesis that restoration of motor function in hemiplegic patients follow a defined course.&#xD;
      It is represented by a three-point ordinal scale that is applied in every item: 0- can not be&#xD;
      performed, partially performed 1- and 2 - fully realized. The total of this scale is 100&#xD;
      points for normal motor function, where the maximum score for the upper end is 66 and the&#xD;
      lower 34. The motor evaluation includes measurement of motion, coordination and reflex&#xD;
      activity of shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, hip, knee and ankle determining a score according&#xD;
      to the motor impairment level, where less than 50 points indicates a severe motor impairment;&#xD;
      85-95 moderate; 50-84 remarkable and 96-99 light ²⁷.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Heart rate variability will be analyzed in four stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resting 01: The heart rate (HR) is captured by means of a heart rate monitor (RS800 CX)&#xD;
           with online data transmitted to a computer, over a period of 10 minutes of rest.&#xD;
           Individuals will be instructed to remain recumbent for 10 minutes, avoiding any activity&#xD;
           and without sleep, after this examination the patient will remain in the sitting&#xD;
           position posture for over 10 minutes following the same guidelines given above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In exercise: After the initial 20 minutes of rest, the patient will start the six-minute&#xD;
           walk test. The FC will be collected through the same heart rate monitor throughout the&#xD;
           walk test, as well as in post exercise recovery (for 2minutes). In this recovery the&#xD;
           patient will remain in the sitting position, and will be instructed to not verbalize and&#xD;
           not move during the evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Electrical stimulation by direct current (Home): After the walk (6MWT) and the recovery&#xD;
           of hemodynamic parameters to baseline parameters, stimulation with tDCS in sitting&#xD;
           position posture starts, and during stimulation HR will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 6 minute walk test 02: After finishing the tDCS, the patient should again perform the&#xD;
           6MWT through the same guidelines of the American Thoracic Society ³⁰, assessing the FC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the test there will be given a continuity of HRV analysis for 2 minutes with the&#xD;
      patient in the sitting position, without verbalizing and without moving , in order to analyze&#xD;
      the behavior of the autonomic nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-minute walk test - a reliable measure for assessing physical fitness and functional&#xD;
      mobility ³⁰. The test quantifies in meters the distance traveled by the individual in six&#xD;
      minutes. It is performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the American&#xD;
      Thoracic Society ³⁰.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the walk test the patient will be told to stop if he feels bad, there will always be a&#xD;
      researcher on the side to avoid possible falls during the test run and will be monitored by&#xD;
      the oximeter (More Fitness MF-417®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5.1. Stimulation procedures transcranial direct current The transcranial electrical&#xD;
      stimulation DC (tDCS) will be performed with a tag device 1 CH Tct Research tDCS Simulator&#xD;
      model 101® by means of two surface sponge electrodes , (non-metallic) 5-7 cm2 in humidified&#xD;
      saline, with a 2mA current.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be submitted to four experimental conditions, and the order distributed by&#xD;
      randomization through manila envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. tDCS anode on the left temporal cortex (T3) and cathode on the contralateral&#xD;
           supraorbital region;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. tDCS sham on left temporal cortex (T3) and cathode on the above-orbitalcontralateral&#xD;
           region;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. tDCS anode on the right temporal cortex (T4) and cathode on the contralateral&#xD;
           supraorbital region;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. tDCS sham on right temporal cortex (T4) and cathode on the contralateral supra orbital&#xD;
           region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol 1 and 2: The anode electrode will be positioned on the left temporal cortex (T3),&#xD;
      located 40% of the distance from the left side of Cz point following the international 10-20&#xD;
      system electroencephalogram and the cathode electrode on the region supra orbital&#xD;
      contralateral to the anode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol 3 and 4: The anode electrode will be positioned on the right temporal cortex (T4)&#xD;
      and cathode positioned on the left supraorbital region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active stimulation application time or placebo 20 minutes. In all sham stimulation, electrode&#xD;
      placement procedures will also be performed like the procedures with anodic tDCS, the left&#xD;
      and right temporal cortex, however, the stimulator is turned on for 30 seconds only, and the&#xD;
      patient will be told that he will feel a slight initial tingling, but it will reduce,&#xD;
      disappear or remain during the 20 minutes of application. Thus, individuals will feel it&#xD;
      initially, but receive no stimulation in the remaining time. This procedure is a valid form&#xD;
      of control in challenge studies transcranial direct current ³³. The equipment itself has a&#xD;
      sham configuration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Okano et al. ²⁰, before receiving any of the experimental conditions&#xD;
      (transcranial direct-current stimulation (anodic or sham), individuals must rest for a period&#xD;
      of 10 minutes (sitting comfortably), so that the cardio respiratory variables return to&#xD;
      baseline measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two study conditions (anodic stimulation and sham) will be performed with an interval of&#xD;
      48 hours ³⁴ and always in the same period of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protective measures to subjects Patients will be exposed to minimal risk during the search,&#xD;
      trying to be controlled at all times by the researcher, who will accompany and monitor all&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory changes, giving support if the patient has imbalance or discomfort, and&#xD;
      interrupting the action immediately if necessary.&#xD;
