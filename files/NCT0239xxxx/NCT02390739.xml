      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patient with&#xD;
      metastatic thyroid cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing&#xD;
      them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a&#xD;
      type of virus (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to&#xD;
      the patient. This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are modifying&#xD;
      the patient s white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-thyroglobulin&#xD;
      incorporated in the retrovirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if these tumor fighting cells (genetically modified&#xD;
      cells) that express the receptor for the thyroglobulin molecule on their surface can cause&#xD;
      thyroid tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;Adults 18 and older with thyroid cancer that has the thyroglobulin molecule on tumor&#xD;
      surfaces&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and&#xD;
      undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as&#xD;
      needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will&#xD;
      undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti- thyroglobulin cells.&#xD;
      {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the&#xD;
      patient.}&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital&#xD;
      for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-thyroglobulin cells and aldesleukin. They will&#xD;
      stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests,&#xD;
      and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as&#xD;
      long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We generated a murine T-cell receptor (mTCR) that recognizes human thyroglobulin (hTG)&#xD;
           in the context of HLA-A0201 and constructed a single retroviral vector that contains its&#xD;
           alpha and beta chains and will confer hTG recognition to HLA-A0201+ PBL on transduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A0201+, hTG+ target cells, anti-TG mTCR transduced T cells&#xD;
           secrete significant amounts of IFN- &gt;= with high specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of administering PBL transduced with this anti-TG mTCR in&#xD;
           concert with preparative lymphodepletion and high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2;&#xD;
           aldesleukin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if these mTCR-transduced PBL can mediate the regression of TG-expressing&#xD;
           tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are HLA-A*0201 positive and 18 years of age or older must have&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Advanced TG-expressing thyroid cancer (including those with bone-only disease) which has&#xD;
      progressed after surgery (if indicated) and radioiodine ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may not have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and&#xD;
           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of these cells to retroviral vector supernatant&#xD;
           containing replication-incompetent virus encoding the anti-TG mTCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen&#xD;
           of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day 0 patients will receive their PBL transduced with the anti-TG mTCR and then begin&#xD;
           high dose aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted approximately 4-6 weeks&#xD;
           after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II optimal design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The objective will be to determine if the combination of high dose aldesleukin,&#xD;
           lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, and anti-TG mTCR-gene engineered lymphocytes is able&#xD;
           to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor&#xD;
           of a modest 20% PR + CR rate (p1=0.20).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of up to 68 patients may be required; approximately 25 patients in the phase I&#xD;
           portion of the study and 43 (41, plus an allowance of up to 2 non-evaluable) patients in&#xD;
           the phase II portion of the study.&#xD;

                  thyroid cancer (to include radioactive iodine for iodine-avid tumors and surgery&#xD;
                  (if indicated)) and have been either non-responders (progressive disease) or have&#xD;
                  recurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than 1 cm in diameter and&#xD;

          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this&#xD;
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can&#xD;
             have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental&#xD;
             treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;

             hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the presence of&#xD;
             antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
             o. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the&#xD;
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.&#xD;

             r. More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time&#xD;
             the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients toxicities must have&#xD;
             recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or vitiligo).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks, as&#xD;
        long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the&#xD;
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined&#xD;
&#xD;
             Immunodeficiency Disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active systemic infections (e.g. : requiring anti-infective treatment), coagulation&#xD;
             disorders or other major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or&#xD;
             immune system, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive&#xD;
             pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in&#xD;
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune&#xD;
