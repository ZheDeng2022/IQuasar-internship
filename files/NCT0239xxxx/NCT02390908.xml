  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is increasingly recognized as a key factor in morbidity and mortality among&#xD;
      HIV-positive individuals and represents an important public health concern, given its&#xD;
      associations with medication non-adherence, increases in viral load, poor immunologic&#xD;
      outcomes (lower cluster of differentiation 4, or CD4, counts), drug resistance, lower health&#xD;
      care utilization, comorbidities (HIV/viral hepatitis coinfection), and poor health outcomes&#xD;
      overall. Adherence to HIV medications has a double public health benefit, both in terms of&#xD;
      slowing disease progression and improving health outcomes among HIV-positive individuals and&#xD;
      in helping to curb the sexual transmission of HIV. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      implement a multisite comparative effectiveness trial in real-world clinical settings with&#xD;
      three intensities of treatment to test the clinical and cost effectiveness of an efficacious,&#xD;
      theory-based behavioral intervention (PLUS) in improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (ART) and alcohol-related outcomes among HIV-positive individuals who drink alcohol at&#xD;
      harmful or hazardous levels. The study is being conducted in collaboration between the Center&#xD;
      for HIV Educational Studies and Training (CHEST) at Hunter College at the City University of&#xD;
      New York (CUNY) and the Spencer Cox Center for Health at the Institute for Advanced Medicine,&#xD;
      Mount Sinai Health System.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol consumption at harmful or hazardous levels among HIV-positive persons exacerbates&#xD;
      health problems and accelerates HIV disease progression. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has&#xD;
      been the single most important treatment for people living with HIV to optimize viral&#xD;
      suppression and slow disease progression. Adherence to ART has considerable public health&#xD;
      implications, particularly given that optimal adherence decreases morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      decreases the potential for the development of drug resistant strains of HIV, and reduces HIV&#xD;
      infectiousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project PLUS (Positive Living through Understanding and Support) was the first (and to our&#xD;
      knowledge only) theory-based behavioral intervention, which integrates motivational&#xD;
      interviewing and cognitive-behavioral skills training, to demonstrate significant&#xD;
      improvements in viral load, CD4 cell count, and self-reported adherence among a racially and&#xD;
      ethnically diverse sample of HIV-positive women and men enrolled in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial, and the first intervention for hazardous drinkers to demonstrate any significant&#xD;
      effects. A clinic-based replication is the crucial next step in studying the intervention's&#xD;
      effectiveness in the real world when delivered by HIV clinic providers to their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with medical providers at the Spencer Cox Center for Health at the Institute&#xD;
      for Advanced Medicine, Mount Sinai Health System, the largest provider of HIV medical care in&#xD;
      the New York City area, our goals are to better understand alcohol-related outcomes among&#xD;
      HIV-positive persons over the lifespan and to conduct a multisite comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      trial with three intensities of treatment-the PLUS intervention, an enhanced treatment as&#xD;
      usual (eTAU) condition, and treatment as usual (TAU) condition-to test the clinical and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the PLUS intervention in reducing alcohol use and improving ART&#xD;
      adherence, viral load, and CD4 counts among HIV-positive hazardous drinkers. This study has&#xD;
      the potential to exert a sustained and powerful impact on the effectiveness of ART&#xD;
      interventions for HIV-positive persons with problematic drinking.&#xD;

    <description>Standard of care HIV-1 viral load results were run using local laboratories and results were abstracted from EMR data, indicating the participant's most recent viral load result. Each viral load result indicates the number of HIV copies in a milliliter (copies/mL), and raw values were log-transformed to deal with non-normal distribution. Minimum and maximum log-viral load values in the current sample were 1.28 and 6.07, respectively.</description>

The AUDIT is a 10-item, widely-used screening questionnaire consisting of three questions related to drinking frequency, three questions on dependence, and four questions on problems caused by alcohol over the past three months. Scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater alcohol use.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>174 participants were enrolled in the experimental arms of PLUS. An additional 120 comparison patients, in regular care at sites but not enrolled in the study, had their electronic medical records (EMR) accessed. They were not considered enrolled in the study, as they did not sign informed consent, and did not receive intervention. Data for this &quot;No-Treatment EMR Control&quot; group included viral load, CD4 and demographics but not study measures (alcohol and drug use severity, medication adherence).</recruitment_details>

          <title>Drug Use DAST Score</title>
          <description>Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10; Skinner, 1982). This measure was used to characterize a participant's drug use and consequences in the past three months. Participants respond yes (yes = 1) or no (no = 0) to nine items such as &quot;Are you always able to stop using drugs when you want to?&quot;. Total/summed scores on the DAST-10 range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater drug use and associated problems.</description>
          <population>Drug Use data is only available for the 174 participants who received the intervention. The 120 patients whose EMR records were extracted for viral load and CD4 results did not have data for this variable and were thus not included in analyses.</population>
