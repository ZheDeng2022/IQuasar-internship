      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some people with cancer have solid tumors. Others have refractory leukemia. This doesn t go&#xD;
      away after treatment. Researchers want to see if a drug called PLX3397 can shrink tumors or&#xD;
      stop them from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To find the highest safe dose and side effects of PLX3397. To see if it helps treat certain&#xD;
      types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People ages 3 22 with a solid tumor or leukemia that has returned or not responded to&#xD;
           cancer therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Phase II, people ages 3 31 with a Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Associated&#xD;
           Plexiform Neurofibroma (PN) that cannot be removed with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans or other tests of the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take PLX3397 as a capsule once daily for a 28-day cycle. They can do&#xD;
           this for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study, participants will have many tests and procedures. They include repeats&#xD;
           of the screening tests. Participants will keep a diary of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with solid tumors will have scans or x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with NF1 PN will have MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with leukemia will have blood tests. They may have a bone marrow sample&#xD;
           taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants may have a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When finished taking PLX3397, participants will have follow-up visits. They will repeat&#xD;
           the screening tests and note side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II will follow the same procedures as Phase I above, but participants will also&#xD;
           fill out questionnaires about their pain and quality of life.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Traditional therapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer have focused on cytotoxic agents&#xD;
           and, more recently, targeted inhibition of cellular signaling pathways through the use&#xD;
           of small molecule kinase inhibitors. Despite these interventions, significant numbers of&#xD;
           pediatric cancer patients develop recurrent and resistant disease. Targeting the tumor&#xD;
           microenvironment is a promising but incompletely explored strategy for the treatment of&#xD;
           pediatric cancer and non-cancer tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This trial will begin to explore the disruption of the interaction between neoplastic&#xD;
           cells and the myeloid component of the tumor microenvironment as a treatment strategy&#xD;
           for pediatric cancers and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) related plexiform neurofibromas&#xD;
           (PN) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PLX3397 is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of class III protein tyrosine&#xD;
           kinases including Kit, CSF1R (colony stimulating factor 1 receptor)/Fms (Feline&#xD;
           McDonough Sarcoma), and oncogenic Flt3 (Fms like tyrosine kinase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Evaluate the safety and tolerability of PLX3397, and determine a recommended&#xD;
           phase II dose of PLX3397 in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors including&#xD;
           NF1 MPNST and brain tumors or refractory leukemias, limited to acute myelogenous&#xD;
           leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Determine the anti-tumor activity of PLX3397 in patients with NF1 PN.&#xD;
           Objective response rate (ORR) will be defined as the proportion of patients with a&#xD;
           partial response (PN volume decrease greater than or equal to 20% determined by&#xD;
           volumetric MRI analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor type:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Phase I: Children (greater than or equal to 3 and lessthan or equal to 21 years of&#xD;
                age) with recurrent or refractory solid tumors including primary neoplasms of the&#xD;
                central nervous system and patients with NF1 and MPNST, or Children (greater than&#xD;
                or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 21 years of age) with refractory leukemias&#xD;
                (AML or ALL) (Phase 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Phase II: Patients with NF1 and inoperable PN, that cause morbidity (greater than&#xD;
                or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 35 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must have adequate performance status, be able to swallow tablets, may not be&#xD;
           pregnant or breastfeeding, and have adequate major organ function. Subjects with history&#xD;
           of severe or uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or&#xD;
           active infection, symptomatic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, or history of&#xD;
           prolonged QT syndrome will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Using a rolling-six phase I design with 2-6 subjects per dose level and standard&#xD;
                definitions of MTD (during cycle 1) and DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PLX3397 will be administered orally (200 mg capsules) once daily on a continuous&#xD;
                basis for cycles of 28 days without a rest period between cycles. Patients must be&#xD;
                able to swallow intact capsules. Dosing will be based on body surface area (BSA),&#xD;
                and the total weekly dose will be rounded to within 10% of calculated dose using a&#xD;
                dosing nomogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At the MTD, the recommended phase II dose level will be expanded to up to 12&#xD;
                patients with attempts made to enroll at least 3 patients with refractory solid&#xD;
                tumors and 3 patients with refractory acute leukemia (ALL and AML) to gain more&#xD;
                experience with the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of PLX3397 in these disease&#xD;
                cohorts. Attempts will be made to enroll equal numbers of patients between the ages&#xD;
                of 3 and 12 years and over 12 years of age to gain pharmacokinetic and safety data&#xD;
                over a broad age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A Simon 2-stage design will be used: 9 evaluable patients with NF1 and inoperable&#xD;
                PN that cause morbidity will be enrolled on the initial stage, and if greater than&#xD;
                or equal to 1/9 patients have a response (PN volume decrease greater than or equal&#xD;
                to 20% compared to baseline), enrollment will be expanded to a total of 17&#xD;
                evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Impact of therapy on patient-reported outcomes will be evaluated in patients with&#xD;
                PN. This study will assess both general health-related qualify of life (QOL) and&#xD;
                pain (pain intensity and pain interference) as patient-reported outcomes (PROs).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To complete both Phase I and Phase II portions, a maximum of (24 + 17= 41 plus up&#xD;
                to 6 to replace inevaluable patients) 47 patients will be accrued in 2 to 2.5&#xD;
                years.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Phase I: Patients must have recurrent or refractory solid tumors or acute&#xD;
                  leukemia (limited to AML or ALL) or have been intolerant of prior therapies,&#xD;
                  confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI, e.g., solid tumors including&#xD;
                  rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, soft tissue sarcomas. These may include primary&#xD;
                  neoplasms of the central nervous system, such as high-grade (WHO grade III-IV)&#xD;
                  glioma. Patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) or optic pathway&#xD;
                  glioma are exempt from histologic verification. For DIPG typical MRI findings&#xD;
                  must be present which include hypo- or isointense on T1-weighted imaging,&#xD;
                  hyperintense on FLAIR or T2-weighted imaging, epicenter in the pons in the face&#xD;
                  of a typical clinical presentation. Optic pathway glioma are located in the optic&#xD;
                  pathway and are typically hypo- or iso-intense on T1 and hyperintense on&#xD;
                  T2-weighted images.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In addition, patients with NF1 and with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor&#xD;
                  (MPNST).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Phase II: inoperable PN causing morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and&#xD;
                  neck lesions that could compromise the airway or great vessels, brachial or&#xD;
                  lumbar plexus lesions that could cause nerve compression and loss of function,&#xD;
                  lesions that could result in major deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or&#xD;
                  significant cosmetic problems, lesions of the extremity that cause limb&#xD;
                  hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful lesions in patients with NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Histologic confirmation of PN tumor is not necessary in the presence of&#xD;
                  consistent clinical and radiographic findings but should be considered if&#xD;
                  malignant degeneration of a PN is clinically suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A PN is defined as a neurofibroma that has grown along the length of a nerve and&#xD;
                  may involve multiple fascicles and branches. A spinal PN involves two or more&#xD;
                  levels with connection between the levels or extending laterally along the nerve.&#xD;
                  In addition to PN, all study subjects must have either positive genetic testing&#xD;
                  for NF1 confirmed in a CLIA certified laboratory or have at least one other&#xD;
                  diagnostic criterion for NF1 listed below (NIH Consensus conference):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Six or more cafe-au-lait macules (greater than or equal to 0.5cm in&#xD;
                       prepubertal subjects or greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in post pubertal&#xD;
                       subjects)&#xD;

                    -  Patients must have relapsed after or be refractory to effective standard&#xD;
                       therapies. For NF1 PN there is no standard medical therapy, and therefore no&#xD;
                       requirement for prior therapy. There are no limits on number of prior&#xD;
                       therapeutic regimens.&#xD;

             age and Lansky greater than or equal to 50% for patients less than or eqal to 16 years&#xD;
             of age. Subjects who are wheelchair bound because of paralysis will be considered&#xD;
             &quot;ambulatory&quot; when they are up in their wheelchair. Subjects have to be able to travel&#xD;
             to the NIH for evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy:&#xD;

             agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after&#xD;
             administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse&#xD;
             events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be discussed with the&#xD;
             study chair.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Contraception: Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use an&#xD;
                       effective method of birth control during treatment and for 1 month after&#xD;

                       an acceptable method of birth control while on study drug and for at least&#xD;
                       one week after last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are pregnant or breast feeding or who become pregnant while enrolled&#xD;
             on this trial will be excluded from participation, due to the unknown effects of&#xD;
             PLX3397 on a growing fetus or newborn child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors will not be eligible to&#xD;
             participate in the phase II portion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing treatment with any other cancer therapy or investigational agent, with the&#xD;
             exception of IT chemotherapy for leukemia, when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who require therapy with warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active untreated infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known chronic Hepatitis B or C, or HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to PLX3397 or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with PT and/or INR higher than or equal to 1.5 time upper limit of normal,&#xD;
             unless patients have lupus anticoagulant in which case they are eligible if cleared by&#xD;
             hematology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drugs that strongly inhibit or potentiate CYP3A4:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  During Phase I: patients who have received these drugs within 14 days or within 5&#xD;
                  half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to study initiation will be&#xD;
                  excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  During Phase II: These drugs should be avoided if possible, as these drugs could&#xD;
                  increase or decrease blood levels of PLX3397.&#xD;
