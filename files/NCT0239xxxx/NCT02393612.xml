    <textblock>
      Sarpogrelate hydrochloride, a selective 5-HT2A antagonist, has been widely used as an&#xD;
      anti-platelet agent for the treatment of PAD. DP-R202 is a new Sarpogrelate hydrochloride&#xD;
      product improved patient's convenience and disadvantage of dosage regimen of previous drug.&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of DP-R202 and Anplag® Tab in&#xD;
      patients with PAD&#xD;

      1. Design This clinical trial is 12 weeks, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel&#xD;
           group, phase 3 study which registered patients in total 25 institutions appointed as&#xD;
           national clinical trial institution, it was conducted by receiving IRB(institutional&#xD;
           review board) approval from each institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Target patients were aged over 20 years old male or female lower limb peripheral artery&#xD;
           occlusion patients with fontaine stage II/III, who has lower limb pain or symptoms like&#xD;
           leg stretching or numbing, lower limb pain degree is over 40 mm evaluated by VAS at&#xD;
           screening, and ABI (ankle-brachial index) ≤0.9 or stenosis rate over &gt;50%, diagnosed&#xD;
           with PAD and voluntarily agreed to participate in clinical study and signed study&#xD;
           consent form. In addition, exclusion criteria were patients who received peripheral&#xD;
           related surgery within 1 month of clinical study participation, Fontaine stage 4, NYHA&#xD;
           class 3-4, uncontrollable hypertension patients (systolic BP ≥ 180 mmHg, diastolic BP ≥&#xD;
           110 mmHg), patients with history of cerebrovascular disease(cerebral infarction,&#xD;
           cerebral hemorrhage and etc.) within 6 months prior to clinical trial participation,&#xD;
           patients with uncontrollable diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 9%), and patients with renal&#xD;
           insufficiency (creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL). Study subjects who met subjects criteria and&#xD;
           recruited were total 151 subjects (study group: 75 subjects, comparator group: 76), and&#xD;
           among these, 16 subjects (study group: 7 subjects, comparator group: 9 subjects) were&#xD;
           dropouts therefore, total study subjects who completed study was 135 subjects (study&#xD;
           group: 68 subjects, comparator group: 67 subjects). Dropout reasons were 'clinical trial&#xD;
           plan violation' for 3 subjects (comparator group: 3 subjects), ' consent withdrawal' for&#xD;
           8 subjects( study group: 5 subjects, comparator group: 3 subjects), ' fail to follow up'&#xD;
           for 1 subject (comparator group: 1 subject), 'adverse event' for 3 subjects ( study&#xD;
           group: 1 subject, comparator group: 2 subjects), ' other reasons' for 1 subjects ( study&#xD;
           group) and there was no dropout due to 'lack of efficacy'. Selected subjects were&#xD;
           stratified by 1:1 ratio and randomly assigned to investigational product or comparator&#xD;
           by Fontaine Stage II or Fontaine Stage III using block randomization method and&#xD;
           double-blind was applied to both investigator and study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Administration Method Investigational product was DP-R202 (sarpogrelate hydrochloride&#xD;
           300 mg: DreamPharma, Inc.), and comparator was Anplag® Tab (sarpogrelate hydrochloride&#xD;
           100 mg: Yuhan Corp.). Administration period to subjects was 12 weeks, study group took&#xD;
           investigational product, DP-R202 1 tab once(morning) and took placebo, Anplag® Tab 1&#xD;
           tab/once, 3 times/day, and comparator group took investigational product, Anplag® Tab 1&#xD;
           tab/once, 3 times/day and took DP-R202, placebo 1 tab once(morning).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Administration dosage of test drug was conducted as fixed dosage and dosage fluctuation&#xD;
           based on subject's condition was not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Efficacy and Safety Assessment Parameter Subjects visited at 4, 8, and 12 weeks&#xD;
           including baseline visit (visit 2) at 4 weeks interval (total 4 times) and took efficacy&#xD;
           and quality of life assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variation in lower limb pain (VAS) comparing baseline with 12 weeks point as a primary&#xD;
      efficacy Assessment parameter, variation in lower limb pain (VAS) and coldness 5-point scale&#xD;
      comparing baseline with 4, 8 weeks, ankle brachial pressure index (ABI), ankle systolic&#xD;
      pressure (ASP), quality of life assessment index(SF-36), Maximum Walking Distance (MWD), Pain&#xD;
      Free Walking Distance (PFWD), and investigator's general assessment(VAS) at 4, 8, and 12&#xD;
      weeks as secondary efficacy assessment parameters, efficacy was measured. Pain and coldness&#xD;
      test was measured using pain and coldness felt by subject 24 hours prior to the visit, MWD&#xD;
      and PFWD was measured only on subjects who was determined to be possible to measure, and&#xD;
      asked to record daily degree of lower limb pain every day from baseline till the end of&#xD;
      clinical trial only with subject who can record it. Also, adverse even, laboratory test,&#xD;
      vital sign, weight measurement were conducted for efficacy assessment. Physical test and&#xD;
      vital sign were conducted at screening visit, administration begins, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after&#xD;
      administration and urine pregnancy test and laboratory test were conducted at screening&#xD;
      visits and 12 weeks after administration. ECG test was conducted at screening visit, 4, 8,&#xD;
      and 12 weeks after administration. Laboratory test criteria were hematological test, blood&#xD;
      chemical test, blood coagulation test and urine test.&#xD;
