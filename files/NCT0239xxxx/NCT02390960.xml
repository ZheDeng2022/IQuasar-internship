  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, single-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover study in&#xD;
      men with ED. A single 2 gram dose of SST-6006 topical cream 5% w/w (formulated to deliver 100&#xD;
      mg of sildenafil) or a topical placebo cream will be applied to the penile shaft and glans.&#xD;
      There are 4 study phases: the Initial Patient Screening Phase (Visit 1, an Off Site 4-Week&#xD;
      Run-in Period and Visit 2), the Final Patient Screening Phase (Visit 3), the SST-6006/Placebo&#xD;
      Double-Blind Dosing Phase (Visits 4-5), and the Follow-up Phase. Primary outcomes will be be&#xD;
      evaluated at Weeks 7 and 8 of the study&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Initial Patient Eligibility: Visit 1 (Day 1) After the patient provides written informed&#xD;
      consent, the initial screening procedures will be performed. Patients who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be instructed on completion of the SEP Diary, the need for a one&#xD;
      week washout of any ED medications before starting the Off-Site 4-Week Run-In Period and that&#xD;
      the use of any ED medications will be prohibited throughout the entire 4-week duration and up&#xD;
      until the completion of Visit 5. Site staff will contact patients by phone between 4 and 7&#xD;
      days following Visit 1 (on Days 4- 7) to communicate eligibility (met laboratory parameters&#xD;
      and the one week washout) to participate in the Off-Site 4-Week Run-In Period. Site staff&#xD;
      will also schedule the Topical Placebo RigiScan Qualification Visit (Visit 2) to be within&#xD;
      two days of completion of the 4-Week Run-In Period for eligible patients. Ineligible patients&#xD;
      will be instructed to discard their SEP Diary and will be discontinued from further study&#xD;
      participation Off-Site 4-Week Run-In Period (Day 8-35) Eligible patients will participate in&#xD;
      an Off-Site 4-Week Run-In Period during which time they will attempt intercourse a minimum of&#xD;
      4 times. Use of any ED medications will be prohibited throughout the entire 4-week duration&#xD;
      and up until the completion of Visit 5. Patients will be asked to maintain a Sexual Encounter&#xD;
      Profile (SEP) diary during the 4-Week Run-In Period to be completed after each intercourse&#xD;
      attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical Placebo RigiScan Qualification: Visit 2 (Day 36 [+ 2 days]) Patients who successfully&#xD;
      complete the 4-Week Run-In will be instructed to complete the IIEF questionnaire at the&#xD;
      beginning of Visit 2. Eligible patients must have documented mild-moderate ED as demonstrated&#xD;
      by a score of 11-21 in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Erectile Function&#xD;
      domain of the IIEF questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will then complete a single-blind (patient) 60 minute plethysmography&#xD;
      procedure using placebo cream to familiarize patients with the plethysmography device (i.e.&#xD;
      RigiScan) and evaluate the placebo response with Visual Sexual Stimulation (VSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who demonstrate a topical placebo response (i.e. achieve an erection of ≥ 60%&#xD;
      rigidity at the base of the penis for a cumulative duration of &gt; 4 minutes) will be&#xD;
      ineligible for further study participation. Any patients with an adverse dermatologic&#xD;
      reaction to the placebo cream will be excluded from further participation in the study but&#xD;
      will be followed until normalization of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data for all patients, regardless of continued eligibility, will be included in the&#xD;
      database as patients will have been exposed to IP (placebo cream only) during this visit.&#xD;
      There will be a 7 (± 1) day washout period between Visits 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Sildenafil RigiScan Qualification: Visit 3 (Day 43 [± 2 days]) Patients who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will then complete the Oral Sildenafil RigiScan Qualification visit,&#xD;
      consisting of a single-blind (patient) plethysmography procedure with 60 minutes of VSS to&#xD;
      evaluate the patient's response to oral sildenafil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not respond to oral sildenafil (i.e., do not achieve ≥ 60% rigidity at the&#xD;
      base of the penis for a cumulative duration of &gt;15 minutes and an EHS Score of 3 or 4) will&#xD;
      be excluded from further study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 7 (± 1) day washout period between Visit 3 and Visit 4 (i.e., the first visit&#xD;
      in the SST-6006/Placebo Double-Blind Dosing Phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SST-6006/Placebo Double-Blind Dosing Phase: Visits 4 &amp; 5 (Days 50 and 57 [± 2 days]) Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to a sequence of dosing (i.e., placebo cream then SST-6006 or&#xD;
      SST-6006 then placebo cream). The SST-6006/Placebo Double-Blind Dosing Phase will consist of&#xD;
      two plethysmography procedures with 60 minutes of VSS. One will evaluate the patient's&#xD;
      response to SST-6006 and the other will evaluate the patient's response to placebo cream.&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to complete a 4-Point Erection Hardness Scale (EHS) immediately&#xD;
      following completion of the plethysmography procedure at each visit. There will be a 7 (± 1)&#xD;
      day wash-out between Visit 4 and Visit 5.&#xD;

    <description>Sildenafil (SST-6006) is a preserved, white to off-white, topical cream. The active ingredient is 5% sildenafil citrate by weight. During the SST-6006 dosing period, penile plethysmography will be utilized to evaluate efficacy of SST-6006 verses placebo cream. The plethysmography session will be approximately 75 minutes. This includes a 15 minute 'baseline' period where patients are told to remain in the flaccid state and 60 minutes during which time patients will watch a series of erotic videos.</description>
