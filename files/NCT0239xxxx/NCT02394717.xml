    <textblock>
      The investigators long term-goal is to help YMCA programs across the nation successfully&#xD;
      acheive the Y of USA &quot;Healthy Eating and Physical Activity Standards&quot;. Our objective here is&#xD;
      threefold. First, the investigators will work with South Carolina YMCA leadership to achieve&#xD;
      the &quot;Healthy Eating and Physical Activity Standards&quot; and implement our HEPA Strategies in&#xD;
      YMCA programs across the state, evaluate the uptake of and adherence to the standards and&#xD;
      strategies, and identify factors that influence their implementation. Second, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the impact of acheiving the standards on children's MVPA and the&#xD;
      serving and consumption of FV and water during the programs. Third, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the costs associated with and the cost-effectiveness of meeting the standards in&#xD;
      terms of improvements in activity and healthy eating.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators research team developed a conceptual framework that identifies critical&#xD;
      modifiable levers within Out of School Time programs that can be altered and/or strengthened&#xD;
      to reach policy or standards goals. These include the policy environment at the national,&#xD;
      state and local levels; characteristics of the individual site, program leadership, staff,&#xD;
      and children; and existing outside organizational partnerships. This framework was informed&#xD;
      by complex systems change, social ecology, systemic capacity building , and the literature on&#xD;
      the impact of public health policy that identifies key elements of the system to be targeted&#xD;
      as well as possible influences on those elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viewing OST programs as complex systems, &quot;Healthy Eating and Physical Activity Standards&quot;&#xD;
      represent one of many leverage points within a system. Existing efforts to implement&#xD;
      standards rest solely upon the voluntary adoption of the standards, with little to no other&#xD;
      changes to the OST program setting. It is clear from our preliminary work and comprehensive&#xD;
      reviews that OST programs are falling short of meeting goals set forth in the standards.&#xD;
