  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is the most effective long-term treatment of morbid obesity treatment, so&#xD;
      you can maintain weight loss enduringly with improvement or resolution of comorbidity and&#xD;
      mortality reduction. All bariatric surgery techniques in postoperative induce a significant&#xD;
      reduction in food intake and / or absorption of nutrients and therefore may be associated&#xD;
      with a risk of nutritional deficiency, which increases over the years after surgery. One of&#xD;
      the nutrients whose absorption is affected significantly is iron, women of childbearing age&#xD;
      segment most vulnerable being. A significant percentage of these women require oral&#xD;
      supplementation with high doses of iron and often parenteral treatment is needed for&#xD;
      digestive intolerance or therapeutic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The liposome orally administered iron could represent a therapeutic alternative&#xD;
      in women of childbearing age, previously undergone bariatric surgery that currently require&#xD;
      parenteral iron therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of oral iron liposome female patients&#xD;
      previously undergone bariatric surgery that currently require parenteral replacement therapy,&#xD;
      as well as the impact on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: a single center, open, prospective, interventional, in 40 women of childbearing age,&#xD;
      previously undergone bariatric surgery, which currently require intravenous iron therapy&#xD;
      chronically. Subjects will be divided into 2 parallel groups: 20 cases and 20 controls&#xD;
      matched for age, level of Hb, year after surgery and percentage of weight lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: This study will allow us to identify an alternative treatment with oral iron in&#xD;
      the case of patients with severe iron deficiency after bariatric surgery, which currently&#xD;
      require parenteral iron therapy due to intolerance to current oral products or therapeutic&#xD;
      failure. At the same time it could help reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of&#xD;
      life of these patients, who will not have to enter periodically in solitary day hospital for&#xD;
      administration of parenteral iron.&#xD;

      This project is proposed with the aim of exploring the efficacy and tolerability of liposome&#xD;
      orally administered iron in female patients previously undergone bariatric surgery (gastric&#xD;
      bypass) currently receiving parenteral iron therapy chronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) .- A significant percentage of patients undergoing bariatric surgery have iron deficiency&#xD;
      and chronic complication. In the investigators series, approximately 100 women require&#xD;
      intravenous iron therapy in a chronic (10% of all patients undergoing bariatric surgery to&#xD;
      date), significantly increasing costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) .- The liposomal form of iron does not depend on gastric pH and increased&#xD;
      bioavailability is not dependent on the presence of the digestive dudodeno circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) .- Increased iron absorption and tolerability allow us to remove chronic intravenous&#xD;
      iron therapy in the case of these patients. Thus, majoraria quality of life by reducing&#xD;
      healthcare costs and avoiding adverse reactions associated with the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of oral iron liposome female&#xD;
      patients previously undergone bariatric surgery that currently require parenteral replacement&#xD;
      therapy for chronic form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) .- To evaluate the change in the levels of Hb, ferritin, iron, transferrin saturation at&#xD;
      4, 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) .- Lay the foundation for future study of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in&#xD;
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery.&#xD;
