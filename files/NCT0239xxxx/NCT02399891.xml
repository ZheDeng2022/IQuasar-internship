      Cohort study aimed at evaluating the incidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after&#xD;
      myocardial infraction (MI) and assessing the prognostic utility of change in ejection&#xD;
      fraction (EF) over the initial 12 months after MI.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering a myocardial infraction (MI) may have from minimal to extensive myocardial&#xD;
      damage. While severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction that persists beyond the initial 2-3&#xD;
      months of an MI is a predictor of sudden death, the prognostic significance of less severe LV&#xD;
      dysfunction after MI is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is significant clinical value in quantifying LV function after the recovery phase of an&#xD;
      MI. This information is vital in guiding the breadth and duration of therapies known to&#xD;
      improve prognosis (beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin blockers, anticoagulants, and&#xD;
      others). Further, it will identify patients in whom other therapies, such as an implantable&#xD;
      cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), are recommended. Yet, no guidelines to guide clinical&#xD;
      decision making in terms of collecting follow-up ejection fraction (EF) data in such patients&#xD;
      who do not also have overt heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The Acute Myocardial Infarction Quality Assurance (AMIQA) project proposes to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. document clinical practice by collecting data on the proportion of patients with initial&#xD;
           LV dysfunction after MI without a follow-up EF assessment arranged,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. collect follow-up EF data in patients with initial LV dysfunction post-MI and evaluate&#xD;
           the prognostic significant of EF early and late after MI as well as factors associated&#xD;
           with the change in value, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. educate physicians regarding the importance of EF reassessment after MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up LV assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current guidelines do not clearly provide clear indications to the appropriate timing or&#xD;
      modality of follow up left ventricular assessments. We have chosen to define an adequate&#xD;
      follow up LV assessment to occur within 2 to 12 months post-myocardial infarction, measured&#xD;
      by any modality such as echocardiography, cardiac MRI, or nuclear perfusion scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the relationship of changes in EF after MI with clinical variables such as&#xD;
           age, gender, co-morbid conditions, MI characteristics, and the prescription of&#xD;
           pharmacological agents after MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the relationship of changes in EF after MI with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methodology and Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. determining the existing practice of assessing left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
           following myocardial infarction within the Calgary region (Quality Assurance);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. determining the factors associated with LVEF improvement, stability and decline post-MI&#xD;
           and the relationship of these with outcome (Prognostic Factor Study);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. educating the clinical community about the importance of follow up LVEF assessments and&#xD;
           reporting the findings of this through presentations, educational materials and/or&#xD;
           academic publications (Knowledge Dissemination)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (NSTEMI or STEMI) undergoing cardiac catheterization at the Foothills Medical Center, who&#xD;
      have significant left ventricular impairment upon initial LV assessment as defined as at&#xD;
      least:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least mod dysfunction (LVEF &lt; 0.40) if no prior history of MIs (i.e. first MI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More than mild-moderate dysfunction (LVEF &lt; 0.45) if prior history of MI Exclusion&#xD;
           criteria include: patients lost to follow up by their family physician or primary&#xD;
           cardiologist, and patients who are deceased who do not have a follow-up EF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified using the APPROACH (Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome&#xD;
      Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (www.approach.org)) database. All patients will have&#xD;
      provided written, informed consent as part of their participation in APPROACH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMIQA Phase I: Quality Assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part One (Quality Assurance) will include patients with an MI occurring between July 1, 2010&#xD;
      to November 30, 2011 (15 months). The list of patients who have had myocardial infarctions&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac catheterization at the Foothills Medical Center between these dates can be&#xD;
      obtained through the APPROACH database. For the patients that meet the initial inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for significant LV dysfunction post-MI, the study group will determine if a follow&#xD;
      up LVEF assessment has been performed within 2 to 12 months post-MI by contacting the&#xD;
      patient's family physician and/or primary cardiologist for any records of LVEF measurements,&#xD;
      and searching through the following electronic databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMIQA Phase II: Prognostic Factor Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part Two (Prognostic Factor Study) will include patients with myocardial infarctions&#xD;
      occurring on December 5, 2011 until December 5, 2012 (12 months). The list of patients who&#xD;
      have had myocardial infarctions undergoing cardiac catheterization at the Foothills Medical&#xD;
      Center between these dates can be obtained through the APPROACH database. For the patients&#xD;
      that meet the initial inclusion criteria for significant LV dysfunction post-MI (as described&#xD;
      in section 5.1), the study group will contact the patient, the patient's family physician,&#xD;
      and/or patient's primary cardiologist to order a follow up LVEF measurement within 2 to 12&#xD;
      months post- myocardial infarction. That is, all patients that have significant LV&#xD;
      dysfunction will undergo follow up LVEF measurements between December 5, 2011 and December 5,&#xD;
      2012. Modalities for follow up LVEF measurements will include echocardiogram, cardiac MRI,&#xD;
      and nuclear perfusion imaging at the discretion of the family physician or primary&#xD;
      cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These follow up LVEF measurements will be entered into the APPROACH database in order to&#xD;
      allow us to evaluate the clinical significance of changes in EF after MI and prognostic&#xD;
      significance of initial versus follow-up EF values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMIQA Phase I: Quality Assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will be entered into a database and summary statistics will be created (e.g.&#xD;
      proportion of follow up LVEF assessments completed post-MI (Aim 5.1), choice of modality for&#xD;
      follow up LVEF assessment, etc.) Data collected from the surveys will be entered into a&#xD;
      database and analyzed in SAS or Stata. Summary statistics will be created from the data&#xD;
      collected in the surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Myocardial Infarction Quality Assurance (AMIQA) Project Research Protocol - Updated Feb&#xD;
      29, 2012&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMIQA Phase II: Prognostic Factor Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of AMIQA Phase II, LVEF assessments will be entered into the APPROACH database. The&#xD;
      study will compare initial LVEF measurements post-MI to follow-up LVEF measurements, and&#xD;
      assess for improvement, stability and deterioration of LVEF and the factors associated with&#xD;
      these changes in LVEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has received ethics approval by the Conjoint Health Research and Ethics Board of&#xD;
      the University of Calgary. Patients will be identified using the APPROACH database have&#xD;
      provided written, informed consent as part of their participation in APPROACH. Only the&#xD;
      research team will know the names and contact information of the patients included in the&#xD;
      study, and this information will be kept confidential.&#xD;
