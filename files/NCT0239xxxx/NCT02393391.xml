    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain results from damage to or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous&#xD;
      system, rather than stimulation of pain receptors. Diagnosis is suggested by pain out of&#xD;
      proportion to tissue injury, dysesthesia (eg, burning, tingling), and signs of nerve injury&#xD;
      detected during neurologic examination. Although neuropathic pain responds to opioids,&#xD;
      treatment is often with adjuvant drugs (eg, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, baclofen,&#xD;
      topical drugs). Neuropathic pain (e.g. phantom limb pain, CRPS, postherpetic neuralgia,&#xD;
      postsurgical pain syndromes, CLBP etc.) remains a challenging condition to treat because it&#xD;
      is commonly refractory to classical pharmacological and to surgical treatment approaches.&#xD;
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a widespread and costly problem for which few interventions&#xD;
      are effective. An increased focus on the study of the nervous system and its involvement in&#xD;
      pain disorders has documented complex neuronal activity and structural changes at a&#xD;
      peripheral, as well as at spinal cord and cortical levels indicating a neuropathic element in&#xD;
      CLBP. Accumulated evidence suggests that neuropathic pain in general and CLBP specifically&#xD;
      might be associated to brain cortical plastic changes. Thus an ideal rehabilitative approach&#xD;
      should aim to reverse them. In line with this idea, the investigators suggest an innovative&#xD;
      noninvasive intervention aimed at alleviating neuropathic pain. New rehabilitative approaches&#xD;
      have been proposed to try and reverse this cortical reorganization. Results of several&#xD;
      studies have shown that motor cortex stimulation with epidural electrodes or repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) are&#xD;
      effective in reducing pain in patients with central pain refractory to treatment.&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an easily applied and safe technique by&#xD;
      which brain activity can be modulated noninvasively and can decrease pain in patients with&#xD;
      refractory central pain. The investigators hypothesized that focal-tDCS treatment personally&#xD;
      customized to each patients basal neuronal network properties would result in both acute and&#xD;
      long term pain relief for neuropathic pain patients.&#xD;

    <description>Each patient will undergo initial diagnosis with NIBS algorithm utilizing EEG measurements combined with TMS. Initial diagnosis will last 10 minutes in which EEG measurement will be recorded 5 minutes and then in combination with TMS for another 5 minutes with no more than 500 TMS stimuli applied to cortex at low frequency of up to 5Hz. EEG recording will be analyzed by NIBS algorithm which will propose a course of treatment with the following limitations: stimulation of 2mA (32, 33) current after 30 seconds ramp up of 0.1mA increments, 20 min for each session, twice a week</description>
