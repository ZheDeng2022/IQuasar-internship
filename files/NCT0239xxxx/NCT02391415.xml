  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal of Serum Institute of India Limited (SIIL) is the development of a recombinant urease&#xD;
      C-deficient listeriolysin expressing BCG vaccine strain (VPM1002) as a safe, well tolerated&#xD;
      and efficacious vaccine against tuberculosis (TB) for residents in endemic areas and persons&#xD;
      at risk in non-endemic areas. The new vaccine should be at least as potent as the current&#xD;
      strain and should be safer than BCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preceding phase-IIa trial was the first investigation of VPM1002 in newborn infants in a&#xD;
      high burden setting in South Africa. The vaccination of HIV-unexposed infants with VPM1002&#xD;
      indicated again safety, tolerability and immunogenicity sufficient to proceed in HIV-exposed&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a multiple site trial in South Africa to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity in HIV-unexposed and -exposed newborn infants.&#xD;

             protocol, hypothermia in the infant will be defined as an axillary body temperature &lt;&#xD;
             36.0°C measured by digital thermometer on at least 2 occasions not less than 6 hours&#xD;
             apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinically suspected newborn sepsis.&#xD;

          7. Concomitant treatment with medication that may significantly affect immune function&#xD;
             (e.g. systemic corticoids, immunosuppressive drugs) before study vaccination.&#xD;
             Antibiotics given before study vaccination would further constitute exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
