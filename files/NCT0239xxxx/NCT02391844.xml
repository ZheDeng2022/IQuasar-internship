      This is a pilot trial using this product in patients for the management of pain after&#xD;
      outpatient arthroscopic knee surgery. This is an open-label study and the two active&#xD;
      ingredients are well known pharmacologic entities.&#xD;

      The objective of this single center is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Oxycodone&#xD;
      Extended Release (MNK-795) in postoperative pain following common musculoskeletal surgical&#xD;
      procedures. Knee surgery being the most common surgery performed in the US, the investigators&#xD;
      chose the model. The investigators also want to look at the flexible-dosing and titration&#xD;
      which is the common way pain managed by clinicians. This is an open-label study of MNK 795 to&#xD;
      be described in the procedures section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Change in pain from baseline (before taking the first dose of study medication) measured on&#xD;
      NRS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient/Investigator Global assessment of treatment satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety evaluation with adverse event monitoring&#xD;
