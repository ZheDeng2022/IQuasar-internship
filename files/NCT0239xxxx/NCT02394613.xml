  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a major cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, caused by retinal nerve cell&#xD;
      (RGC) death. This is currently identified only after significant vision loss has already&#xD;
      occurred with an early event in, and a potential marker of, this process being RGC&#xD;
      &quot;apoptosis&quot; (a form of cell death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the tolerability and safety of ANX776, as part of the new&#xD;
      Detection of Apoptosing Retinal Cells (DARC) technique. This has been developed by the&#xD;
      laboratory of DARC IP holder and grant applicant: Prof. M. Francesca Cordeiro. A secondary&#xD;
      aim is to initially establish the ability of DARC to identify RGC apoptosis in the diagnosis&#xD;
      of glaucoma in healthy and progressive glaucoma/glaucoma-suspect/ocular hypertensive&#xD;
      patients. As a positive control for this secondary aim of this study, patients with&#xD;
      Non-arteritic Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION) will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, each patient will undergo several ophthalmological examinations, imaging of&#xD;
      the back of the eye using established clinical devices, and blood sampling for studying the&#xD;
      safety and toxicology profile of ANX776.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The understanding of the safety profile of ANX776 is crucial for the use of DARC in patients,&#xD;
      and its application as a potentially powerful new clinical tool with which to identify&#xD;
      patients with early glaucoma before their vision is lost. If successful, it opens the door to&#xD;
      directly observing effects of glaucoma treatments, including the assessment of new,&#xD;
      breakthrough therapies.&#xD;
