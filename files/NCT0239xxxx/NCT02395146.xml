    <textblock>
      Thyroid surgeons place an enormous amount of importance and rightly so to the preservation of&#xD;
      the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) during thyroidectomies. A good knowledge of the anatomy&#xD;
      of the nerve and meticulous dissection technique and intraoperative identification of the&#xD;
      nerve are crucial to the anatomic and functional integrity of the nerve. The use of&#xD;
      intraoperative neural monitoring to aid the surgeon in the identification of the RLN has&#xD;
      gained acceptance and is considered standard practice in several units. However, lesser&#xD;
      emphasis has been placed historically on the identification and preservation of the external&#xD;
      branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN) during thyroid surgery. The EBSLN supplies the&#xD;
      cricothyroid muscle that controls pitch variation during phonation. Unlike damage to the&#xD;
      recurrent laryngeal nerve which manifests readily as vocal cord paralysis, intraoperative&#xD;
      damage to EBSLN is difficult to assess postoperatively as visual assessment of the larynx is&#xD;
      not indicative of the integrity of the nerve. Injury of the EBSLN can cause weakness or&#xD;
      complete paralysis of the ipsilateral cricothyroid muscle. Patients may report a deeper voice&#xD;
      or an inability to produce high pitched sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may also complain of weakness, tightness of the voice, and require extra effort to&#xD;
      speak. Of note, voice changes with EBSLN injury are subtle in the general population but can&#xD;
      be devastating in patients who depend on their voice for a living. Importantly, EBSLN injury&#xD;
      is reported in upto 50% of thyroid surgery in contrast to 12% of recurrent laryngeal nerve&#xD;
      injury during thyroid surgery. The new guidelines published in the Laryngoscope recommend&#xD;
      routine intraoperative neural monitoring of EBSLN. The Investigators have a functional system&#xD;
      in use currently for monitoring recurrent laryngeal nerve intraoperatively and propose to&#xD;
      study the impact of monitoring the EBSLN using the same neural monitoring device to improve&#xD;
      voice results following thyroid surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thyroid surgery can result in change in the voice. This is because two nerves controlling the&#xD;
      voice quality are situated very close anatomically to the thyroid gland and are at risk of&#xD;
      damage during the surgery. One of the nerves that is called the recurrent laryngeal nerve&#xD;
      controls the movements of the voice cords and is more readily identifiable and its injury is&#xD;
      also detected easily by direct examination of the voice box as reduced/absent movement of the&#xD;
      voice cord. It gets damaged in upto 1% of thyroid surgeries. The other nerve that is of&#xD;
      interest to our study is called the superior laryngeal nerve, and its external branch (EBSLN)&#xD;
      controls the pitch of the voice cord by supplying a muscle called the cricothyroid. This&#xD;
      nerve is difficult to see and is reported to be damaged in 50% of thyroid surgeries. Its&#xD;
      damage cannot be picked up on direct examination of the larynx and voice changes are subtle&#xD;
      though devastating for individuals who depend on their voice for their livelihood singers&#xD;
      actors etc. The Investigators would like to study if using a nerve monitor that is used to&#xD;
      check the RLN during thyroid surgery can also be used to check the EBSLN. The Investigators&#xD;
      hope that this could reduce the chances of damaging the nerve significantly. If the study&#xD;
      shows good preservation of the EBSLN with the nerve monitor the Investigators will be able to&#xD;
      make it a standard procedure during thyroid surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators plan to recruit patients undergoing thyroid surgery involving one half of&#xD;
      the thyroid gland. They will be given all the information about the study and consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. If they agree to participate they will be divided into two groups randomly those&#xD;
      who will have the intraoperative EBSLN monitoring and those who will not. All patients will&#xD;
      have a preoperative voice assessment in the speech therapy unit which will involve filling in&#xD;
      a voice questionnaire and undergoing a glottography (pitch assessment) They will then undergo&#xD;
      the surgery Approximately 3 months after the surgery they will have another voice assessment&#xD;
      using the voice questionnaire and the glottography. At this time they will also have an EMG&#xD;
      assessment of the cricothyroid muscle which is the best method to check the function of the&#xD;
      EBSLN. No further procedures/assessments will be undertaken.&#xD;
