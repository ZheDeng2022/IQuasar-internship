  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine presence and volume of monosodium urate (MSU)&#xD;
      crystal deposits as determined by dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) imaging in gout&#xD;
      subjects treated with allopurinol with and without visible tophi.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DECT is a technique that enables visualization of MSU crystal deposits by analysis of the&#xD;
      chemical composition of the scanned materials. This study will determine the extent of MSU&#xD;
      crystal volume in the hands/wrists, feet/ankles, and knees as determined by DECT of subjects&#xD;
      with gout taking a dose of at least 300 mg allopurinol daily for the past 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with gout on allopurinol with and without tophi to be assessed using DECT imaging&#xD;
      for crystal deposition with assessments, which include patient and provider assessments of&#xD;
      disease severity and pain, prior to and after the scan.&#xD;

             Investigator and/or Medical Monitor, might create undue risk to the subject or&#xD;
             interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the protocol requirements&#xD;
             (including dual energy computed tomography imaging), or to complete the study.&#xD;
