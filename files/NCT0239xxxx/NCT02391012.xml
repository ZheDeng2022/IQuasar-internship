      Fecal microbial treatment (FMT) is a treatment that utilizes the microbiota of a healthy&#xD;
      intestine as a probiotic preparation. The feces of a healthy individual is fluidized and than&#xD;
      inserted into the intestinal tract of a sick individual, assuming that the healthy flora will&#xD;
      colonize and cure the intestine. There are reports of the efficacy of this treatment for&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease but currently the numbers are small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      aim: To investigate whether use of FMT will bring improvement for colitis in IBD patients .&#xD;
      Methods: The patients will undergo full colonoscopy, the stool preparation will be infused&#xD;
      through the colonoscope during withdrawal of the instrument.&#xD;

      Back ground: intestinal microbiota have a central role in disease pathogenesis, either in a&#xD;
      form of a &quot;permissive&quot; role or as a direct pathogenic cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile colitis; irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and IBD have all been connected&#xD;
      to a disturbance in the equilibrium of intestinal microbiome. But the causative mechanism is&#xD;
      not yet known. (5-10) . Various bacteria including lactobacillus acidophilus and&#xD;
      bifidobacterium bifidus are being empirically used as treatment for many intestinal ailments.&#xD;
      The cause of inflammatory bowel disease in unknown but evidence is gathering that excessive&#xD;
      immune reaction of intestinal immune system to microflora combined with a genetic&#xD;
      predisposition are responsible for the chronic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal microbial treatment (FMT) is a treatment that utilizes the microbiota of a healthy&#xD;
      intestine as a probiotic preparation. The feces of a healthy individual is fluidized and that&#xD;
      inserted into the intestinal tract of a sick individual, assuming that the healthy flora will&#xD;
      colonize and cure the intestine. Previous work had shown success in fecal transplantation as&#xD;
      a treatment for clostridium difficile colitis. There are also reports of the efficacy of this&#xD;
      treatment for inflammatory bowel disease but currently the numbers are small. A review by&#xD;
      Anderson et al describes 17 studies reporting treatment of IBD by FMT. (12). In 9 cases it&#xD;
      was done to treat IBD and in 8 cases for intestinal infection in IBD patients. Altogether 41&#xD;
      cases were reported , In some the FMT was inserted through a nasogastric tube directly to the&#xD;
      duodenum, in some be colonoscopy and in some by an enema. A significant clinical improvement&#xD;
      was reported in 19/25 patients. 13/17 stopped IBD treatment , 15/24 entered full clinical&#xD;
      remission. In all 15 patients treated for infection the treatment was successful. No sever&#xD;
      adverse effects were reported, Fever was developed in 8 cases and in one case there was&#xD;
      exacerbation of colitis after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: To investigate whether use of FMT will bring improvement of at least 2 points in&#xD;
      partial mayo score in ulcerative colitis patients, or 70 points in CDAI of patients with&#xD;
      Crohn's colitis. One month after FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement will be defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Ulcerative colitis: a decrease of at least 2 points in the partial mayo score, and a&#xD;
      decrease of at least 1 point in endoscopic Mayo score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Crohn's disease: A decrease of at least 70 points in Crohn's disease activity index&#xD;
      (CDAI) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 40 patients aged 18-80 years, with histological and endoscopic diagnosis of&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis or crohn's colitis who did not respond to either thiopurines or tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exacerbation will be defined as partial mayo score higher then 3, with either CRP higher than&#xD;
      0.5 or endoscopic mayo score &gt;1 in ulcerative colitis and CDAI higher them 220 and C reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP) higher than 0.5 in Crohn's colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool will be donated by the patients choice either from a relative, preferably a partner to&#xD;
      minimize possible transference of an infective agent, alternatively samples will be ordered&#xD;
      from &quot;open biom&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic disease activity will be defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic Mayo score:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal or inactive disease: 0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability): 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions): 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration): 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple endoscopic score Crohns disease (SES-CD):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Segments of intestine: Rectum,Sigmoid and left colon, Transverse colon,Right colon, Ileum for&#xD;
      each segment the Presence of: ulcers,Ulcerated surface, Affected surface, Presence of&#xD;
      narrowing, and number of affected segments will be evaluated and the total score sumed, The&#xD;
      SES-CD will than be calculated as follows: TOTAL - 1.4 X (number of affected segments) =&#xD;
      E-CDI&#xD;
&#xD;

      Treatment protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Both donor and recipient will sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Both donor and recipient will do the above mentioned laboratory tests, the investigator&#xD;
           will verify that the results are negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recipient will be prepared for colonoscopy with 3 liters of polyethylene glycol&#xD;

           through the colonoscope during withdrawal of the instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. If no improvement within 7 days, the patient will be offered the option of another FMT&#xD;

      month for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months repeat colonoscopy + biopsies + stool samples. Colonoscopy does not have to be&#xD;
      complete but has to include the segment that was inflamed in the first colonoscopy.&#xD;
