  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to perform a prospective randomized study and compare the incidence&#xD;
      of surgical wound infection between mastectomy wounds irrigated with triple antibiotic&#xD;
      solution (one side) and 0.05% CHG (opposite side) in patients undergoing bilateral breast&#xD;
      reconstruction. Each patient will receive triple antibiotic solution on one breast and the&#xD;
      CHG on the other breast.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast reconstruction with tissue expander (TE) remains the gold standard of breast&#xD;
      restoration after mastectomy. During the first stage of reconstruction, a TE is placed under&#xD;
      chest muscles and slowly inflated postoperatively over the period of several weeks. After&#xD;
      desired volume of TE is achieved it is exchanged for permanent breast prosthesis during&#xD;
      another surgery (second stage of reconstruction). Postoperative wound infection after&#xD;
      placement of TE can lead to devastating consequences both for patients and a surgeon.&#xD;
      Frequently, surgical site infection requires additional surgeries and resulting in the&#xD;
      removal of TE and long term IV antibiotic therapy. Therefore, during breast reconstruction&#xD;
      procedures all possible measures are implemented to reduce postoperative infection rate.&#xD;
      Several studies demonstrated that intra-operative irrigation of surgical wounds with&#xD;
      antibiotic containing solution before insertion of breast TE decreases postoperative&#xD;
      infection rate. This approach is currently adopted as a standard of care within plastic&#xD;
      surgery clinical community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to perform a prospective randomized study and compare the incidence&#xD;
      of surgical wound infection between mastectomy wounds irrigated with triple antibiotic&#xD;
      solution (one side) and 0.05% CHG (opposite side) in patients undergoing bilateral breast&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;
