  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injuries to the genitalia are of concern to the military with emphasis placed on the surgical&#xD;
      reconstruction and psychological health of these Wounded Warriors. However, despite&#xD;
      significant surgical advances in microvascular surgery and autologous free tissue transfer,&#xD;
      conventional reconstructions cannot truly replace the complicated structures and functions of&#xD;
      the penis including the urethra, erogenous sensation, and erectile corporal bodies.&#xD;
      Conventional reconstruction poses several challenges: patients may not have sufficient donor&#xD;
      tissue due to other injuries or previous surgery; multiple operations are often needed to&#xD;
      restore the neophallus; the final reconstruction only approximates the penis' native form;&#xD;
      recreating the urethra is challenging and the new urethra is prone to stricture and fistula&#xD;
      formation; the erectile function necessary for sexual intercourse is often lacking; and&#xD;
      insufficient protective sensation can lead to penile implant extrusion, infection, subsequent&#xD;
      explantation or loss of the reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose this clinical trial to determine functional outcomes and quality of&#xD;
      life for Wounded Warriors and civilians who choose to undergo penile allotransplantation. The&#xD;
      investigators will combine extensive experience performing total penile reconstruction in a&#xD;
      large population affected by congenital, traumatic, and therapeutically extirpated&#xD;
      Genitourinary deformities and expertise in reconstructive transplantation using an&#xD;
      immunomodulatory protocol to for this study. The investigators anticipate penile&#xD;
      transplantation can potentially replace &quot;like with like,&quot; restoring the appearance, anatomy,&#xD;
      and function of the recipient in a manner far superior to autologous reconstruction. This&#xD;
      project will establish the ability to perform penile allotransplantation using an&#xD;
      immunomodulatory protocol and will compare outcomes with conventional phalloplasty patient&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a non-randomized subject self-controlled clinical trial to implement a&#xD;
      cell-based immunomodulatory protocol for penile allotransplantation. An intermediate&#xD;
      deliverable is achieving allograft survival and functional return with reduced&#xD;
      dosing/frequency of maintenance immunosuppression on steroid-free monotherapy (tacrolimus)&#xD;
      immunosuppression. The long-term deliverable and goal is to demonstrate superior outcomes&#xD;
      when compared to satisfaction and QOL in conventional phalloplasty patients 12-60 months&#xD;
      post-transplant.&#xD;

      Specific Aims: 1) To assess the feasibility and function of penile allotransplantation in&#xD;
      Wounded Warriors and civilians who have lost their penis due to battle or traumatic injury,&#xD;
      using an immunomodulatory protocol to reduce immunosuppression; 2) To assess pre-to-post&#xD;
      changes in QOL in patients who undergo penile allotransplantation.&#xD;
