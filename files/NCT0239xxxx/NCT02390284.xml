  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a progressive disease resulting in blindness. Determining the onset of the&#xD;
      disease, predicting its severity and the benefit of pressure lowering eye drops is key to&#xD;
      clinical management aimed at maintaining useful vision with advancing age. This study will&#xD;
      longitudinally monitor a population of glaucoma suspects (with positive factors for the&#xD;
      disease but with normal vision) with noninvasive pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and other&#xD;
      standard eye tests for glaucoma. The PERG measures the function of retinal ganglion cells&#xD;
      (RGCs) that are the parent neurons of the optic nerve. RGCs may become dysfunctional before&#xD;
      dying and their function restored with pressure-lowering eye drops. Glaucoma suspects with&#xD;
      abnormal PERG will be randomized to treatment with eye drops, while those with normal PERG&#xD;
      will be left untreated. All patients will be monitored with PERG, Optic Coherence Tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) and other ancillary tests every 6 months over 4 years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PERG is recorded from small metallic buttons taped on the skin similarly to an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, with the difference that the electrodes are around the eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only physical contact you will experience is a gentle cleaning of the skin with an&#xD;
      alcohol prep pad. During the test you must look with both eyes at a Television (TV) display&#xD;
      for about 3 minutes. During the follow up period you may be asked to take one more PERG test&#xD;
      lying down in a bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will cause a momentary increase of your eye pressure similar to the one that occurs&#xD;
      during your normal sleep. This may help to understand whether or not your optic nerve&#xD;
      functions normally when the pressure in your eye increases. For OCT evaluation, the pupil has&#xD;
      to be dilated with drops as you did before for your eye exam. You have to briefly look at a&#xD;
      mark inside the instrument one eye at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERG and OCT will be performed during the same day of your visit with the eye doctor. If you&#xD;
      have already done these tests in the past, as part of another study or as part of your&#xD;
      standard treatment, the results of these tests will be obtained from your record, and be&#xD;
      included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are a participant in the Observation Group, you will be monitored with PERG, OCT, and&#xD;
      standard clinical examinations every six months until close of study. If you are a&#xD;
      participant in the Medication Group you will be also treated with eye drop medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are certain risks and discomforts that may be associated with this research. You should&#xD;
      be aware that you are at risk of developing glaucoma whether you participate in the study or&#xD;
      not. It is not known whether the risk of developing glaucoma is reduced by eye drops to lower&#xD;
      eye pressure; the study will attempt to answer this question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the PERG, the only significant risk to you is a small chance of a rash to the cleansing&#xD;
      agent for skin electrodes, which should go away without treatment. For OCT, there is a rare&#xD;
      risk to you of an allergic reaction to the drops used to dilate your pupils. The risk is even&#xD;
      lower if you did not have any reaction during your previous eye exams. In case of an allergic&#xD;
      reaction, your eye doctor will immediately treat it. If you had previous problems with pupil&#xD;
      dilation, you may wish to speak to your eye doctor about the option of doing this additional&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
