    <textblock>
      IVF (in vitro fertilization) cycles fails more often than they succeed. Surprisingly very&#xD;
      little effort is invested in defining the reasons for failure and possibly finding ways to&#xD;
      improve the success on the next cycle. The investigators believe that the main reasons for&#xD;
      failure are related to oocyte quality and indirectly to the follicle response for a&#xD;
      particular patient. The investigators have developed a panel of biomarkers to assess the&#xD;
      faulty follicular conditions leading to lower oocyte quality. Using these markers would&#xD;
      indicate if a given cycle was characterized by over growth, over-luteinization, early or late&#xD;
      trigger. Indeed our transcriptomics analysis has identified biomarkers of follicles still in&#xD;
      their growth phase at trigger or follicles that have already begun luteinisation compare to&#xD;
      follicle that are at the optimal level of differentiation. Measuring these biomarkers would&#xD;
      allow making a better diagnostic for a given patient and potentially explaining reasons for&#xD;
      failure. The system would also become adjustable to variable COS (control ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation) and individual clinical practices. It is important to realize that this is&#xD;
      applicable to almost all cycle failure and can be done on a pool of follicular cells when&#xD;
      none of the oocytes obtained has led to a pregnancy. This does not resolve uterine problems&#xD;
      but often these are caused by hormonal conditions established by the ovary or the ovarian&#xD;
      treatment. This technology can be applied in all IVF clinics as no special equipment is&#xD;
      required. It would be particularly valuable in clinics where a number of cycles is limited&#xD;
      due to funding, or in clinic where a package of 3 cycles is proposed to the patient. The&#xD;
      patient interest to have a custom treatment increases at each failing cycle as well as the&#xD;
      doctors' interest to succeed. This technology is not clinically validated yet and would&#xD;
      require a period of testing where participating clinics will collect the samples for a&#xD;
      retrospective analysis (presence of biomarkers of follicular problems vs outcome) then in a&#xD;
      prospective analysis where the diagnostic is used in a sub-set of patient to modulate the&#xD;
      second/third cycle compared the outcome to patient with no diagnostic. The increase in&#xD;
      pregnancy rate or cumulative pregnancy rate should reach a minimum of 10 and 25 %&#xD;
      respectively to indicate a significant value.&#xD;

      IVF (in vitro fertilization) cycles fails more often than they succeed. Surprisingly very&#xD;

      participating clinics will collect the samples for a retrospective analysis (presence of&#xD;
      biomarkers of follicular problems vs outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five Canadian IVF clinics have agreed to provide a minimum of 200 anonymized samples with&#xD;
      information on the cycle/patient medical status. From these samples, RNA will be extracted&#xD;
      and the gene expression level will be measured for 3 housekeeping genes and 21 markers&#xD;
      derived from previous studies (Hamel et al 2008 and 2010, Nivet et al 2015 submitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genes leading to the best predictive value of negative outcome will then be classified&#xD;
      according to our understanding of ovarian physiology as key indicator for generating a&#xD;
      diagnostic. The read-outs provided to the clinic would then be one of the 5 following: Too&#xD;
      early trigger, too late trigger, too high stimulation (FSH), too high differentiation (LH) or&#xD;
      time spread response (a combination of immature and over mature follicles)&#xD;
