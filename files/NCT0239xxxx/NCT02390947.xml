  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Famitinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at c-Kit, VEGFR2, PDGFR, VEGFR3, Flt1 and&#xD;
      Flt3, whose anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis effects have been validated in preclinical&#xD;
      tests. In PhaseⅡb study, a significantly improved Progression Free Survival (PFS) was found&#xD;
      in patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with Famitinib compared to placebo. On&#xD;
      the other hand, the toxicity of Famitinib was manageable in both PhaseⅠand Ⅱb studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Famitinib can improve Overall Survival (OS)&#xD;
      compared with placebo in total 540 patients with advanced colorectal cancer who have failed&#xD;
      in previously received at least two lines of standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
