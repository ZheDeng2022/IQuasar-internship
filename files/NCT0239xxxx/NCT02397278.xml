  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about ways to treat a joint problem in the knee called&#xD;
      Juvenile Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD). The goal of this study is to see if injecting&#xD;
      platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the knee can help knee cartilage heal faster, and will try to&#xD;
      determine whether the injections lead to improvements in pain, performance of activities of&#xD;
      daily living, improvements is sports activities and overall function and symptoms reduction.&#xD;
      The investigators will compare PRP treatment to conservative therapy.&#xD;
