    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)&#xD;
      and may affect all segments of the digestive tract. These are diseases of multifactorial&#xD;
      origin in which environmental and genetic factors are predominant.The EPIMAD registry, the&#xD;
      world's largest epidemiological register for IBD, identifying all incident cases in the four&#xD;
      departments of the North West of France showed between 1988 and 2007, an increase in the&#xD;
      annual incidence of MC 71 % (6.5 / 105 (1988-1990) 11.1 / 105 (2006-2007) p &lt;0.0001) in the&#xD;
      age group 10-19 years. At the same time, the annual incidence of UC decreased 4.3 / 3.5 105&#xD;
      inhabitants / 105 inhabitants (20%), with phenotypic presentation remained stable. The&#xD;
      increase in the incidence of CD will contribute to increase its weight in the health system,&#xD;
      particularly in the pediatric CD frequently associated with an aggressive phenotype causing&#xD;
      specific complications such as malnutrition, pubertal delay or thrive. These complications&#xD;
      have a important impact on the quality of life with a long-term risk of functional&#xD;
      disability. They may be associated with increased mortality. Immunosuppressants&#xD;
      (azathioprine, methotrexate) have been used in pediatric forms only from the 90s and anti-TNF&#xD;
      antibodies (infliximab and adalimumab), until the 2000s. These new therapeutic classes have&#xD;
      profoundly changed the management of pediatric IBD. Although there is little data on the&#xD;
      impact of these new treatments, early introduction of immunosuppressive and anti-TNFs seems&#xD;
      to influence the natural history of IBD diagnosed in pediatric age. Anti-TNFs appear to be&#xD;
      associated with more frequent and deeper remission. With the advent of these new treatment,&#xD;
      new therapeutic targets such as endoscopic mucosal healing and more recently the deep&#xD;
      remission combining clinical remission, biological and endoscopic, appears. However there is&#xD;
      no data in the general population assessing the impact of new treatments and new therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies in the pediatric population. Potential risks associated with the increasing use&#xD;
      and early use of biological treatments in this particular population remain to be determined&#xD;
      in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this study is that changes in therapeutic strategies in IBD diagnosed&#xD;
      before 17 yeras old could influence the cumulative incidence of surgical resection and&#xD;
      complications specific to this population as failure to thrive and delayed puberty, insertion&#xD;
      socio-professional, the extension of the disease, hospitalization rates, and the rate of&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
