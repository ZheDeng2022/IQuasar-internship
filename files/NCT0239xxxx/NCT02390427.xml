  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about the combination of Taselisib with&#xD;
      other drugs in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Taselisib is an investigational&#xD;
      drug which works by blocking a protein called PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) that helps&#xD;
      cancer cells grow. This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from&#xD;
      these studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of Taselisib to be used with&#xD;
      other drugs in further clinical studies. This is an open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation phase Ib&#xD;
      study to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD) and to identify the recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) of Taselisib. This study will be conducted in 4 separate arms. (A-D).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided in two parts, a combination dose finding escalation part (Part 1) and a&#xD;
      dose combination expansion part (Part 2). Participants will enter only one Part (either 1 or&#xD;
      2) and receive study drugs from only one combindation of study drugs, know as arms, as&#xD;
      assigned by the main study physician. The study includes four different arms as listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Taselisib with Trastuzumab emtansine (also called T-DM1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Taselisib with Trastuzumab emtansine and Pertuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C: Taselisib with Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm D: Taselisib with Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and Paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Since we are looking for the highest dose of Taselisib that can be administered&#xD;
      safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have breast cancer,&#xD;
      not everyone who participates in Part 1 of this research study will receive the same dose of&#xD;
      the Taselisib. The dose participants get will depend on the number of participants who have&#xD;
      been enrolled in the study before and how well they have tolerated their doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each combination dose will only be given to a group of 3 - 6 participants. The results from&#xD;
      each group will be reviewed and depending on the results, a different combination dose or&#xD;
      schedule may be investigated in the next group of participants or the same combination dose&#xD;
      taken by a participant may be repeated with the next group of participants to investigate&#xD;
      these results further (a different schedule means that instead of taking doses once every&#xD;
      day, participants may take them only on some days in the week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: The doses in this part will be based on the best combination doses from Part 1. This&#xD;
      part will look at the potential side effects and see how your cancer responds to the drug.&#xD;
