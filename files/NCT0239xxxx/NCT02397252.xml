      The proposed study seeks to compare the diagnostic performance of Human Papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
      testing in self-collected samples via the Eve Medical self-collection system© (Eve) with&#xD;
      standard physician-collected samples for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia&#xD;
      grade 1 or worse (CIN1+) and cervical cancer among women referred for colposcopy. The&#xD;
      performance of the Eve sample will also be compared with that of a second self-sample via a&#xD;
      cobas® PCR Female swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1000 adult women with an abnormal Pap test at the level of an atypical squamous&#xD;
      cells of undetermined significance or worse squamous or glandular abnormality (i.e., ASCUS+)&#xD;
      or an abnormal co-test (ASCUS+ and HPV-positive) result will be recruited over a period of 12&#xD;
      months via colposcopy clinics located at the Jewish General Hospital, St-Mary's Hospital, and&#xD;
      the McGill University Health Centers (Royal Victoria Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating women will undergo three cervical or cervicovaginal sampling techniques: 1)&#xD;
      self-sampling using the Eve Medical self-collection system©; 2) self-sampling using a cobas®&#xD;
      PCR Female swab; and 3) physician-collected sampling. The participants will also fill in a&#xD;
      questionnaire on their experience with the convenience and acceptability of the Eve system,&#xD;
      relative to the other two sampling approaches. The decision as to which self-sample is to be&#xD;
      collected first will be dependent on randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV testing will be done using the cobas® 4800 HPV Test. The liquid medium of within the&#xD;
      cobas® PCR CELL Collection Media with the provider collected sample and the cobas® PCR media&#xD;
      with the two self-collected samples will be used to suspend the cellular material prior to&#xD;
      HPV testing. We have made collaborative arrangements with Dr. Marcel Behr, Chief of the&#xD;
      Department of Clinical Microbiology at the McGill University Health Centre for the HPV&#xD;
      genotyping work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histology-confirmed CIN1+ will form the study outcome or case definition. Sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, and predictive values (along with their respective 95% confidence intervals)&#xD;
      will be calculated for each sample type to evaluate the clinical performance of the various&#xD;
      sampling techniques. We will use CIN1+ as definition of disease but analyses will also be&#xD;
      performed for more stringent definitions, e.g. CIN2+ or CIN3/cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After the discovery that Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the necessary cause of&#xD;
      cervical cancer there have been much interest in the introduction of novel screening&#xD;
      strategies involving HPV DNA testing [1]. HPV DNA testing was shown to have higher&#xD;
      sensitivity in detecting cervical cancer and its precursors and greater reproducibility than&#xD;
      Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology screening and has been therefore proposed as the primary&#xD;
      screening method for the future. In high-income countries, cases of cervical cancer continue&#xD;
      to develop among unscreened and under-screened women [2]. Factors discouraging women from&#xD;
      attending routine screening include fear of pain or discomfort, lack of time or perceived&#xD;
      inconvenience, cultural or religious concerns, and poor socioeconomic status [3]. For a&#xD;
      screening program to be effective high coverage is essential and thus attendance is a&#xD;
      critical requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the high sensitivity of molecular HPV testing to detect cervical cancer precursors&#xD;
      there is great potential for screening coverage to be increased by inviting non-attendant to&#xD;
      provide self-collected vaginal samples. Providing these women with a simple, convenient, and&#xD;
      inexpensive means of self-testing may improve cervical screening participation [3].&#xD;
      Self-sampling is also an attractive approach to assist screening in poor countries, which&#xD;
      typically do not have structured cervical cancer screening programs while having to bear the&#xD;
      greatest burden of cervical cancer morbidity and mortality [4]. Self-sampling can also&#xD;
      enhance the value of post-HPV vaccination surveillance by allowing a more efficient&#xD;
      monitoring of HPV type distribution in populations. Finally, self-sampling represents a good&#xD;
      research tool to assist prospective studies of genital HPV infection and natural history of&#xD;
      cervical neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically for cervical cancer screening, it has been shown that self-collected&#xD;
      cervicovaginal specimens from women who received proper instruction for collecting them yield&#xD;
      HPV test results that are comparable to those in specimens collected by physicians [5-8].&#xD;
      Women also prefer self-sampling relative to clinician-provided samples, provided that they&#xD;
      can be assured that they are told how to properly collect the sample [8, 9]. Although there&#xD;
      is conceivably some loss of sensitivity and specificity in screening for cervical cancer in a&#xD;
      specimen that is not directly collected from the ecto- and endo-cervix the overall accuracy&#xD;
      of the HPV testing results (to identify presence of cervical precancerous lesions) is still&#xD;
      superior to that of physician-collected Pap smears. Therefore, replacing a more&#xD;
      anatomically-correct specimen (the one collected with direct visualization of the cervix by a&#xD;
      primary healthcare provider) with one collected from the vagina (and thus diluted with&#xD;
      exfoliated cells from a wider epithelial surface area) is compensated by the high sensitivity&#xD;
      of the molecular screening approach [6, 10, 11]. Performance of screening seems also to be&#xD;
      unaffected by storage and transport of the self-sample swabs, irrespective of whether they&#xD;
      have been kept dry or transferred and resuspended into a liquid transport medium [10, 12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A critical feature in enhancing women's acceptance and adherence with the self-sampling&#xD;
      approach for cervical cancer screening and HPV surveillance studies is the convenience of the&#xD;
      device used for collection. Dacron and polyester swabs are simple, common, and inexpensive.&#xD;
      However, they are inconvenient and not isolated within a sheath that prevents contact of the&#xD;
      sampling area with mucosal surfaces in the labia and vaginal opening. Ideally, sampling&#xD;
      devices should be anatomically correct to facilitate insertion and the sampling surface that&#xD;
      will retain the exfoliated cells should be protected from contact with the labia and lower&#xD;
      vaginal mucosa while the device is inserted, with the objective of sampling cells that are&#xD;
      mostly from the cervix and upper vaginal area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV DNA testing using self-collected cervicovaginal specimens represents a promising strategy&#xD;
      to increase cervical screening participation and thus reduce rates of cervical cancer in&#xD;
      countries with established cervical screening programs. Furthermore, this approach can also&#xD;
      greatly improve the coverage and quality of cervical cancer screening in developing&#xD;
      countries, as well as in remote regions in developed countries, e.g., aboriginal populations&#xD;
      in Northern Quebec and in First Nations territories. Facilitating and improving uptake of&#xD;
      cervical cancer screening would save lives, reduce costs of treating invasive cancer and&#xD;
      potentially reduce inequalities in avoidable mortality caused from cervical cancer.&#xD;
