  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this double-blind crossover study is to assess the effect of single&#xD;
      doses of 50 mg and 300 mg gefapixant (AF-219/MK-7264) on cough reflex sensitivity to&#xD;
      capsaicin in both healthy participants and participants with chronic cough. This study will&#xD;
      also assess the effect of single doses of gefapixant on cough reflex sensitivity to adenosine&#xD;
      triphosphate (ATP) in healthy participants and participants with chronic cough.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30 participants (male and female) who meet all entry criteria will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to treatment with gefapixant or matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a Screening Period, a Baseline Visit (cough participants only), and four&#xD;
      Treatment Periods, with a washout period between treatments. Participants will return after&#xD;
      their last Treatment Visit for a Follow-up Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Screening Visit and during the Treatment Periods, cough sensitivity will be measured&#xD;
      by standard clinical methodology incorporating two cough challenges: 1) capsaicin; 2) ATP.&#xD;
      The ATP challenge will only be performed during the study treatment period. The Baseline&#xD;
      Visit (cough participants only) will occur prior to Treatment Period 1. Daytime cough&#xD;
      monitoring will be performed at the Baseline Visit and during each of the four Treatment&#xD;
      Periods (cough participants only).&#xD;

    <measure>Cough Reflex Sensitivity to Capsaicin Measured by Maximal Cough Response (Emax)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of single doses of 50 mg and 300 mg gefapixant on cough reflex sensitivity to challenge with capsaicin was assessed in male and female healthy participants and participants with chronic cough. Capsaicin-evoked cough challenge was performed 2 hours post-dose in Periods 1 and 2. The maximal cough response (Emax) to capsaicin was assessed. For capsaicin challenge, doubling concentrations from 0.49 μM to 1000 μM were prepared by dilution of stock solutions with saline, and were administered by inhalation. The number of explosive cough sounds occurring within the first 15 seconds after inhalation were recorded. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was used to estimate the Emax. Population pharmacodynamic modeling was performed in NONMEM 7.3. Data exploration, goodness-of-fit plots, statistical analyses, and simulations were performed in Matlab R2015a. Note: All values presented in this table are model-based.</description>

        <title>Cough Reflex Sensitivity to Capsaicin Measured by Maximal Cough Response (Emax)</title>
        <description>The effect of single doses of 50 mg and 300 mg gefapixant on cough reflex sensitivity to challenge with capsaicin was assessed in male and female healthy participants and participants with chronic cough. Capsaicin-evoked cough challenge was performed 2 hours post-dose in Periods 1 and 2. The maximal cough response (Emax) to capsaicin was assessed. For capsaicin challenge, doubling concentrations from 0.49 μM to 1000 μM were prepared by dilution of stock solutions with saline, and were administered by inhalation. The number of explosive cough sounds occurring within the first 15 seconds after inhalation were recorded. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was used to estimate the Emax. Population pharmacodynamic modeling was performed in NONMEM 7.3. Data exploration, goodness-of-fit plots, statistical analyses, and simulations were performed in Matlab R2015a.

          <title>Cough Reflex Sensitivity to Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) Measured by Maximal Cough Response (Emax)</title>
          <description>The effect of single doses of 50 mg and 300 mg gefapixant on cough reflex sensitivity to challenge with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was assessed in male and female healthy participants and participants with chronic cough. ATP-evoked cough challenge was performed 2 hours post-dose in Periods 3 and 4. For ATP challenge, doubling concentrations from 0.227 μmol/mL to 929 μmol/mL were prepared from ATP powder dissolved in saline, and were administered by inhalation. The number of explosive cough sounds occurring within the first 15 seconds after inhalation were recorded. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was used to estimate the Emax. Population pharmacodynamic modeling was performed in NONMEM 7.3. Data exploration, goodness-of-fit plots, statistical analyses, and simulations were performed in Matlab R2015a. Note: All values presented in this table are model-based.</description>

        <description>The effect of single doses of 50 mg and 300 mg gefapixant on cough reflex sensitivity to challenge with ATP was assessed in male and female healthy participants and participants with chronic cough. ATP-evoked cough challenge was performed 2 hours post-dose in Periods 3 and 4. The concentration of ATP required to induce 50% of the Emax (ED50) was assessed. For ATP challenge, doubling concentrations from 0.227 μmol/mL to 929 μmol/mL were prepared by dilution of stock solutions with saline, and were administered by inhalation. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was used to estimate the ED50. Population pharmacodynamic modeling was performed in NONMEM 7.3 using Laplace estimation method.

        <title>Daytime Cough Frequency in Participants With Chronic Cough Who Underwent Capsaicin Challenge</title>
        <description>Daily cough frequency monitoring was performed in participants with chronic cough, who were attached to a digital sound recorder with 2 microphones (a lapel air microphone attached to the participant's clothing and an adhesive chest wall microphone attached to the skin at the top of the sternum). Participants wore the sound recorder from the start of capsaicin challenge to bedtime on Day 1 in Periods 1 and 2. The resulting recording was processed by software which cut out the majority of speech and background noise but retained cough sounds. The investigator listened to the recording and documented the number of coughs per hour.</description>

        <title>Daytime Cough Frequency in Participants With Chronic Cough Who Underwent ATP Challenge</title>
        <description>Daily cough frequency monitoring was performed in participants with chronic cough, who were attached to a digital sound recorder with 2 microphones (a lapel air microphone attached to the participant's clothing and an adhesive chest wall microphone attached to the skin at the top of the sternum). Participants wore the sound recorder from the start of ATP challenge to bedtime on Day 1 in Periods 3 and 4. The resulting recording was processed by software which cut out the majority of speech and background noise but retained cough sounds. The investigator listened to the recording and documented the number of coughs per hour.</description>

        <population>All treated participants with chronic cough who had at least 1 post-dose secondary endpoint assessment of daytime cough frequency in response to ATP challenge</population>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
