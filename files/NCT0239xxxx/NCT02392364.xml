    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of intravitreal Eylea&#xD;
      injections at a set interval, versus a variable dosing schedule (likely longer than one&#xD;
      month), based on a specific individual's disease progression. There will be approximately 50&#xD;
      men and women at least 18 years of age, diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, taking part&#xD;
      in this study at 5 locations in the United States.&#xD;

    <description>Group 1 will receive injections every 4 weeks until diabetic macular edema on the OCT is decreased and stable. At that point, the length of time between injections may increase, depending on how the study eye is doing. The interval between study eye treatments may maintain, increase, or decrease once the variable treatment dosing has begun. This will be determined by an algorithm designed into a computer program</description>
