  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab and azacitidine with&#xD;
      or without ipilimumab when given together and to see how well they work in treating patients&#xD;
      with acute myeloid leukemia that has not responded to previous treatment or has returned&#xD;
      after a period of improvement or is newly diagnosed. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab&#xD;
      and ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving nivolumab, azacitidine and ipilimumab may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of&#xD;
      nivolumab in combination with azacitidine (5-azacytidine) in patients with&#xD;
      refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (Lead-in phase) II. To determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of nivolumab with ipilimumab in&#xD;
      combination with 5-azacytidine in patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML). (Lead-in phase) III. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of nivolumab in&#xD;
      combination with 5-azacytidine in patients with refractory/ relapsed AML. (Phase II) IV. To&#xD;
      determine the overall response rate (ORR) of nivolumab in combination with 5-azacytidine in&#xD;
      older patients (&gt; 65 years) with newly diagnosed AML. (Phase II) V. To determine the overall&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) of nivolumab with ipilimumab in combination with 5-azacytidine in&#xD;
      patients with refractory/relapsed AML. (Phase II) VI. To determine the overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) of nivolumab with ipilimumab in combination with 5- azacytidine in older patients (65&#xD;
      years) with newly diagnosed AML. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the number of patients who achieve a &gt; 50% reduction in blasts on therapy&#xD;
      with either vidaza+nivolumab or vidaza+nivolumab+ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the duration of response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) of patients with refractory/relapsed AML treated with either vidaza+nivolumab or&#xD;
      vidaza+nivolumab+ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the duration of response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) in older patients with newly diagnosed AML treated with this combination with either&#xD;
      vidaza+nivolumab or vidaza+nivolumab+ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study immunological and molecular changes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow in&#xD;
      response to nivolumab and 5-azacytidine therapy or nivolumab with ipilimumab and&#xD;
      5-azacytidine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine induction of hypomethylation and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage during&#xD;
      therapy with this combination and its correlation with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a lead-in phase, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour or subcutaneously (SC) on&#xD;
      days 1-7 or days 1-4 and 7-9. Patients also receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1&#xD;
      and 14 (courses 1-4) or on day 1 (course 5 and all subsequent courses). Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive azacitidine and nivolumab as Arm I. Patients also receive ipilimumab&#xD;
      IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and then every 6 or 12 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6&#xD;
      months for up to 5 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  ARM 1 SALVAGE COHORT: Patients with AML or biphenotypic or bilineage leukemia who have&#xD;
             failed prior therapy; patients with AML should have failed prior therapy or have&#xD;
             relapsed after prior therapy will be eligible for Arm 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ARM 2 SALVAGE COHORT: Patients with AML who have failed up to one prior salvage&#xD;
             therapy (i.e. salvage 1 or 2 status) will be eligible for Arm 2 relapse cohort;&#xD;
             allogeneic stem cell transplant for patients in remission at the time of stem cell&#xD;
             transplant will not be considered a salvage regimen; similarly, hydroxyurea if used&#xD;
             alone will not be considered a salvage regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ARM 1 AND 2 FRONT LINE OLDER COHORT: Patients age 65 years and above with previously&#xD;
             untreated AML who are unfit for or decline standard induction therapy; prior therapy&#xD;
             with hydroxyurea, biological or targeted therapy (e.g. FLT3 inhibitors, other kinase&#xD;
             inhibitors), or hematopoietic growth factors is allowed, however prior therapy with&#xD;
             chemotherapy agents for the disease under study is not allowed; patients may have&#xD;
             received one dose of cytarabine (up to 2 g/m2 administered at presentation for&#xD;
             control) of hyperleucocytosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)&#xD;
             who received therapy for the MDS or CMML and progress to AML are eligible at the time&#xD;
             of diagnosis of AML regardless any prior therapy for MDS or CMML; the World Health&#xD;
             Organization (WHO) classification will be used for AML; prior therapy for MDS or CMML&#xD;
             will not be considered as a prior therapy for AML, hence such patients will be&#xD;
             considered as frontline AML and eligible for the frontline elderly cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, chemotherapy, biological or targeted therapy (e.g.&#xD;
             FLT3 inhibitors, other kinase inhibitors), or hematopoietic growth factors is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 times upper limit of normal (x ULN) (=&lt; 3 x ULN if considered to&#xD;

             5 half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents; the half-life for the therapy in&#xD;
             question will be based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts,&#xD;
             manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drug-administration manuals) and will be&#xD;
             documented in the protocol eligibility document; since the effect of both nivolumab&#xD;
             and 5-azacytidine may be delayed; use of one dose of cytarabine (up to 2 g/m2) or&#xD;
             hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the&#xD;
             start of study therapy and during the study treatment; concurrent therapy for central&#xD;

             study until 3 months after the last treatment; adequate methods of contraception&#xD;
             include: total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
             of the patient; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception;&#xD;
             female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment; in&#xD;
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment; male sterilization (at least 6 months&#xD;
