      Rationale: Chronic pancreatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pancreas which&#xD;
      results in debilitating abdominal pain, decreased productivity and increased health care&#xD;
      costs. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided celiac plexus block (CPB) is routinely used to&#xD;
      treat pain related to chronic pancreatitis. While EUS guided neurolysis for pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      has significant efficacy, the benefit of CPB for chronic pancreatitis pain is controversial&#xD;
      and has not been studied in a rigorous manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess whether EUS guided celiac plexus block decreases suffering,&#xD;
      hospitalization, and opiate requirements related to chronic pancreatitis pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Patients undergoing EUS at Los Angeles County Hospital for painful chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients undergoing EUS to evaluate chronic pancreatitis with a typical visual&#xD;
      analogue pain score &gt;3, regular opiate use, and M ANNHEIM chronic pancreatitis score &gt;6 will&#xD;
      be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arms: Patients will be randomized to 1) diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound 2) endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound with celiac plexus block&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes: The primary outcome will be a decrease in chronic pancreatitis pain assessed&#xD;
      by the visual analogue scale and M ANNHEIM system at 24 weeks compared to immediately prior&#xD;
      to the block. The ability to work and conduct normal activities, opiate medication&#xD;
      requirements, and a Careprep symptom assessment at 24 weeks will also be compared prior to&#xD;
      the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic Plan: The projected response rate to EUS guided CPB is 52%. Given known 30% placebo&#xD;
      response in patients with pain related to chronic pancreatitis we anticipate that 83 patients&#xD;
      will need to participate to demonstrate a difference. We aim to enroll 90 patients in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      1.0 Background and Hypothesis: Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the&#xD;
      pancreas characterized by painful scarring and loss of glandular function.The prevalence of&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis in the United States is estimated to be 0.2 to 5% and results in 86,000&#xD;
      hospitalizations. The majority of patients with chronic pancreatitis will develop significant&#xD;
      abdominal pain which is debilitating and results in a significant burden on the health care&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple approaches, including pancreatic enzymes, narcotic analgesia, celiac plexus block&#xD;
      and surgical ganglionectomy have been used to treat pancreatic pain with variable success.&#xD;
      Injection of local anesthesia agents and steroids into the celiac plexus for pain control has&#xD;
      been used for many years via both surgical and percutaneous approaches. Topical therapy&#xD;
      theoretically prevents the conduction of painful stimuli from the pancreas and addresses&#xD;
      inflammatory changes in the afferent nerves themselves. Splanchnic nerves pass from the&#xD;
      pancreas to the thoracic root ganglia via the celiac ganglia which are the target for&#xD;
      intervention. Nerve changes in chronic pancreatitis including perineural inflammation,&#xD;
      altered diameter, and upregulation of pain neuropeptides (including Substance P) are&#xD;
      associated with increased sensitivity to stimuli from the pancreas (distension and&#xD;
      inflammation) as well as pain independent of stimuli (neuropathic). Endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      allows for close proximity, high resolution assessment of the gastrointestinal tract wall and&#xD;
      adjacent anatomic structures. Physicians are able to perform EUS-guided celiac plexus&#xD;
      injections in the outpatient setting under conscious sedation. The EUS guided approach offers&#xD;
      better visualization of the celiac region and direct access to the celiac plexus. EUS guided&#xD;
      celiac plexus block is a core part of the routine care of patients at Los Angeles County&#xD;
      Hospital with chronic pancreatitis. Celiac plexus block is a recommendation for refractory&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis pain by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that EUS-guided CPB has a beneficial role in treating pain caused&#xD;
      by chronic pancreatitis. A randomized trial by Gress et al looked at the efficacy of&#xD;
      EUS-guided versus CT-guided celiac plexus block for controlling abdominal pain of chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis in 18 patients. They found significant improvement in pain symptoms in patients&#xD;
      randomized to EUS-guided celiac plexus block over a mean time period of 10 weeks. A study by&#xD;
      the same group showed an improvement in overall pain score in 55% at 4 and 8 weeks of&#xD;
      follow-up in 90 patients. Adverse events including diarrhea and infection occurred in 3%. A&#xD;
      comprehensive review by Kaufman et al in 2010 evaluated the efficacy of EUS-guided celiac&#xD;
      plexus block and celiac plexus neurolysis in alleviating chronic abdominal pain due to&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer respectively. A total of 6 studies were included&#xD;
      in their analysis, comprising 221 patients, and found that EUS-guided celiac plexus block was&#xD;
      effective in 51.46% of patients with chronic pancreatitis. EUS-guided celiac plexus&#xD;
      neurolysis (with alcohol) was effective in 72.54% of those with pancreas cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These modest improvement for celiac block for chronic pancreatitis (especially in comparison&#xD;
      to celiac plexus neurolysis in pancreas cancer) have led some investigators to question&#xD;
      whether EUS guided celiac plexus block is an effective treatment for chronic pancreatitis&#xD;
      pain despite its routine use. Prospective randomized controlled studies examining the&#xD;
      efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound guided celiac plexus block are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Objectives and Purpose Our aim is to perform a pilot randomized trial to gauge the degree&#xD;
      to which celiac plexus block performed under endoscopic ultrasound guidance will benefit&#xD;
      patients with chronic pancreatitis. We will assess whether celiac plexus block significantly&#xD;
      decreases pain scores, hospitalization, and pain medication requirements and increases the&#xD;
      ability to return to normal activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Study Design Patients presenting to the Los Angeles County Medical Center and&#xD;
      Gastroenterology Clinic with chronic upper abdominal pain are the focus population of this&#xD;
      study. Patients who are undergoing endoscopic ultrasound for standard clinical care to assess&#xD;
      for chronic pancreatitis will be enrolled. They must have a M-ANNHEIM severity score of 6 or&#xD;
      greater. Additionally, they must have at least intermittent if not chronic pain of intensity&#xD;
      &gt;3 on the visual analogue scale requiring opiate medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures will be performed by experienced endosonographers. The EUS-guided celiac&#xD;
      plexus block will be performed under the guidance of linear array endosonography. A visual&#xD;
      exam will first be performed with the EUS scope or a standard endoscope. Patients found to&#xD;
      have a significant peptic ulcer or other mucosal abnormality will be excluded as the symptoms&#xD;
      may be secondary to peptic disease. An EUS exam will then be performed to determine whether&#xD;
      the patient has findings of chronic pancreatitis. The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis will&#xD;
      be confirmed based on EUS criteria (meeting four or more criteria of hyperechoic foci,&#xD;
      hyperechoic strands, lobularity, cysts, stones, dilation of the main pancreatic duct,&#xD;
      irregular pancreatic-duct margins, presence of side branches and hyperechoic pancreatic&#xD;
      duct-margins).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who are confirmed to have chronic pancreatitis will be randomized (1:1) during the&#xD;
      procedure to celiac plexus block versus no injection treatment. Randomization will be&#xD;
      performed using a computer program with concealed allocation. The research coordinator&#xD;
      obtaining data for follow up visits and the patient will be blinded to randomization. The&#xD;
      endosonographer will not be blinded. Ninety patients will be enrolled (see statistical&#xD;
      considerations for sample size calculation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomized to control will undergo EUS and confirmation of chronic pancreatitis but not&#xD;
      celiac plexus block. Patients in the treatment group will receive celiac plexus block with&#xD;
      10mL 0.25% bupivacaine and 2ml (40mg/cc) triamcinolone which are the standard doses. The 22&#xD;
      gauge needle will be inserted into the base of the celiac plexus via the transgastric&#xD;
      approach and a single injection will be performed. An intravenous antibiotic will be&#xD;
      administered at the time of the block to those in the celiac plexus block group with the&#xD;
      specific agent depending on the patient's allergy profile. The research coordinator obtaining&#xD;
      data for follow up visits and the patient will be blinded to the details of the block (or&#xD;
      lack thereof) procedure but it will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the procedure standard recovery room monitoring including assessment of blood&#xD;
      pressure be performed for 2 hours for both groups. Periprocedural fluid and antibiotic use&#xD;
      for celiac plexus block is not standardized and will be at the discretion of the endoscopist&#xD;
      performing the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed before the procedure, immediately afterward, and at 2 weeks, 6&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, and 6 months following the procedure. At the initial assessment and follow&#xD;
      up visits Visual analogue pain scores will be recorded as well as an assessment of the&#xD;
      ability to work and conduct activities of daily living. Pain medication requirements and&#xD;
      whether symptoms are alleviated by analgesic or disrupt sleep will be noted. The M-ANNHEIM&#xD;
      scoring system will be used to gauge symptoms as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, patients will complete a focused version of the online CarePrep Program during&#xD;
      each visit. The Online CarePrep (OCA) program is used to clinically evaluate patients with&#xD;
      complex symptoms or conditions generally characterized significant physical symptoms,&#xD;
      psychosocial issues, impaired quality-of-life and functional status, disability, and&#xD;
      substance abuse. It has an online format that has been successfully used by outpatient with&#xD;
      various gastrointestinal illness to report multifactorial symptoms. When performed prior to&#xD;
      appointments it appears to facilitate efficient and productive medical visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Side effects/Toxicities to be monitored:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.11 Three most common complications from celiac plexus block include hypotension, transient&#xD;
      diarrhea, transient increase in pain. Extraordinarily rare/theoretical complications include&#xD;
      paralysis, pneumothorax, loss of sphincter function, retroperitoneal bleeding, renal puncture&#xD;
      and prolonged gastroparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.12 Long term toxicities to be monitored after completion of the celiac block during the 6&#xD;
      months the patients are followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Dosage changed based on toxicity There will be no dosage adjustments as the procedure&#xD;
      will be performed once during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Adverse Event Reporting: 4.31 Type of event to be reported and timing of reports. If&#xD;
      patients develop adverse events including hypotension, transient diarrhea, transient increase&#xD;
      in pain, or less common complications of unilateral paresis or paraplegia, pneumothorax, loss&#xD;
      of sphincter function, retroperitoneal bleeding, renal puncture, prolonged gastroparesis or&#xD;
      infection, this will be reported to the principal investigators and will be reviewed by the&#xD;
      study team as well as two staff physicians in the gastroenterology division who are not part&#xD;
      of the study team. This will also be reported to the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients experience any further events that are detected during follow up these will be&#xD;
      coded as A) related to study or B) not related to study. Their severity and A) whether they&#xD;
      were expected or B) not expected will also be recorded. These complications will also be&#xD;
      reported to the principal investigators and will be reviewed by the study team as well as two&#xD;
      staff physicians in the gastroenterology division who are not party of the study team. They&#xD;
      will also be reported to the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.32 Places for submitting reports: Adverse events will be reported to the IRB and data&#xD;
      safety monitoring committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Data Monitoring Committee: The data safety monitoring committee will include the&#xD;
      principal investigators from medicine/gastroenterology as well as the entire study team. Two&#xD;
      outside senior physician from gastroenterology or surgery will also be asked to participate.&#xD;
      Meetings will be convened if adverse events potentially related to the celiac block occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 Statistical Considerations Descriptive statistics will be performed for each group, and&#xD;
      comparisons made to determine if the groups are balanced on the stratification factor of type&#xD;
      of pancreatitis. Patient characteristics will be compared between groups as well to determine&#xD;
      if there is imbalance of other possible covariates. We expect that there will be patients&#xD;
      with chronic pancreatitis secondary to congenital abnormalities of the pancreatic duct,&#xD;
      ethanol abuse, familial, and idiopathic etiologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 90 patients was chosen based on preliminary sample size calculations.&#xD;
      Based on recent studies 30% of patients with pancreatitis type pain in the placebo arm will&#xD;
      derive benefit.16 The predicted response rate of 51.5% for EUS guided celiac block was based&#xD;
      on the large review by Kaufmann et al. For a 2 sided alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, 83&#xD;
      patients would be necessary to show a difference. Statistical analyses will be performed by&#xD;
      biostatisticians at the Biostatistical and Bioinformatics Resource Group within the SC CTSI.&#xD;
