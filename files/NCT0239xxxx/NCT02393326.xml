      Objective: To compare success rates of biodentine partial pulpotomy versus formocresol&#xD;
      pulpotomy treatment of pulpally exposed lower primary molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After caries removal resulted in a pulp exposure, the pulp at the exposed area is amputated&#xD;
      to a depth of 2 mm. The wound surface is irrigated and dried. After homeostasis is obtained,&#xD;
      an assistant drew lots to randomly allocate the case to either the biodentine partial&#xD;
      pulpotomy (PP) or the formocresol pulpotomy (FP) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up for clinical and radiographic evaluation will be carried out at 6-month&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;

      -  Prospective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population: 100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study group: This study sample comprises mandibular primary molars from boys and girls&#xD;
           aged between 3 and 7 years. The children have no systemic diseases according to the&#xD;
           medical history supplied by the parents or guardians. The mandibular primary molars in&#xD;
           this study are selected according to the following clinical and radiographic criteria.&#xD;
           The clinical criteria: the presence of a deep carious lesion, sufficient tooth structure&#xD;
           for restoration with a stainless steel crown, no history of spontaneous pain, tenderness&#xD;
           to percussion or abnormal mobility, abscess, fistula, or swelling of the gingiva, and&#xD;
           with cessation of bleeding after a 2 mm depth of the pulp at the area of the exposure&#xD;
           was amputated. The radiographic criteria: a deep carious lesion in close proximity to&#xD;
           the pulp without furcation or radicular pathology, obliteration of the pulp and root&#xD;
           canal, or internal or external root resorption. Physiologic root resorption, while&#xD;
           included in the criteria, could not be more than one-third of the root length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical technique: All teeth will be treated under local anaesthesia with rubber dam&#xD;
           isolation. After caries removal resulted in a pulp exposure, the pulp at the exposed&#xD;
           area is amputated to a depth of 2 mm using a water-cooled high-speed handpiece with a&#xD;
           #330 high-speed bur. The wound surface is irrigated with sterile saline solution and&#xD;
           dried with cotton pellets to avoid clot formation. After homeostasis is obtained, an&#xD;
           assistant drew lots to randomly allocate the case to either the PP or the FP treatment&#xD;
           group. The child will not know which treatment is assigned to each tooth. For the PP&#xD;
           group, biodentine is gently applied to the wound surface, and then covered with&#xD;
           reinforced zinc oxide-eugenol (IRM_; Dentsply). For the FP group, coronal access is&#xD;
           obtained using high-speed handpiece with a #330 high-speed bur with water spray to&#xD;
           further expose the pulp chamber. Following removal of the coronal pulp and achievement&#xD;
           of homeostasis, a cotton pellet moistened with formocresol (1: 5 Buckley's solution) is&#xD;
           placed on the amputated pulp for 5 min. The pulp stumps is then covered by IRM. After PP&#xD;
           or FP treatment, all teeth are restored with a stainless steel crown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up: the follow-up for clinical and radiographic evaluation will be carried out at&#xD;
           6-month intervals. Treatment is considered a clinical failure if one or more of the&#xD;
           following signs are observed: pain, abscess or sinus opening, tenderness upon&#xD;
           percussion, or abnormal tooth mobility. For radiographic evaluation, the treatment is&#xD;
           rated as a failure when one or more of the following signs are present: furcation or&#xD;
           periapical radiolucency, pathologic external root resorption, or internal resorption.&#xD;
           The treatment is regarded successful if both the clinical and radiographic evaluation&#xD;
           does not indicate any signs of failure.&#xD;
