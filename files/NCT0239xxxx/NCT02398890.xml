      &quot;Purpose: The overall prognosis of oncology patients admitted to intensive care has improved&#xD;
      greatly in recent years, leading to a wider admission policy. Due to a decrease in mortality&#xD;
      in intensive care, more and more patients returning oncological circuit for the continuation&#xD;
      of treatment of the underlying disease The existence of sequelae after the ICU (Intensive&#xD;
      Care Unit) stay, whether renal, cardiac, respiratory or other, may influence the continuation&#xD;
      of the optimal anti -cancer treatments and thus reduce the chances of recovery or evolution&#xD;
      without tumor progression. However, no studies have evaluated the effects of resuscitation on&#xD;
      subsequent cancer treatment strategies. It would thus become better appreciate the long-term&#xD;
      oncology patients discharged alive from the hospital after a stay in intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main purpose of research :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the feasibility of a anti-tumor therapy for patients with progressive solid tumors,&#xD;
      after an intensive care stay for other reason than elective surgery monitoring or securing an&#xD;
      invasive procedure. The possibility of making an anti -cancer treatment will be evaluated by&#xD;
      the treating oncologist and classified total, partial or absent from that defined before or&#xD;
      during the ICU stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective of the research :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the percentage of patients discharged alive from the ICU and dying in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate survival, lifestyle and physical and psychological effects of these patients after&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital over a period of one year. It is understood that all these&#xD;
      secondary endpoints will interfere with the existence of an evolutionary neoplasia not only&#xD;
      with the ICU stay. They will therefore be interpreted with caution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type: observational Study Design: Prognostic study of routine care, national,&#xD;
      prospective, cohort type &quot;&#xD;

      &quot;Nature of evaluated care: Longitudinal follow-up of post- resuscitation intensive care&#xD;
      Concerned population: adult patients with active solid tumor out alive from the ICU and&#xD;
      following-up in oncology in the same hospital as the resuscitator investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: Measure the influence of ICU for patients with solid cancers to continue with&#xD;
      optimal anti -cancer treatment, defined before or during hospitalization in intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: Assess the physical and psychological consequences of ICU stay of&#xD;
      patients Evaluation criteria : Primary endpoint: proportion of patients living, out from ICU&#xD;
      and hospital, can receive optimal cancer treatment later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methodology : Prognostic study of routine care, national, prospective, cohort type.&quot;&#xD;
