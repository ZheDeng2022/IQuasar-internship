  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the side effects and safety, and effectiveness of&#xD;
      combining dabrafenib and trametinib with radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous and ongoing clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      combining both dabrafenib and trametinib compared with dabrafenib alone. This has led to the&#xD;
      approval for the use of both drugs in combination in people with metastatic melanoma with the&#xD;
      BRAF mutation. Melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body may also benefit from&#xD;
      radiotherapy to help reduce symptoms from melanoma. Previous studies have shown that melanoma&#xD;
      may be sensitive to radiotherapy and that it can help to improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention of the CombiRT study is to establish if dabrafenib, trametinib and radiotherapy&#xD;
      combined is a safe and effective treatment for metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

    <description>Palliative radiotherapy in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib Eligible subjects are patients who have been on dabrafenib and trametinib for more than 2 weeks, as the current standard management for advanced stage melanoma.&#xD;
Palliative RT will be delivered to symptomatic or bulky (&gt;2cm) soft tissue, nodal or bony metastases concurrently with dabrafenib and trametinib. Up to 3 areas of disease can be irradiated at the same time.&#xD;
Following RT, dabrafenib and trametinib alone will be continued until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.</description>
