  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common child and&#xD;
      adolescent psychiatric disorders. In recent years, some researchers have become interested in&#xD;
      analyzing neuroendocrine substrate levels in ADHD, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), cortisol and testosterone. Previous work in ADHD has&#xD;
      established a strong heritable component to the phenotype. The STS gene, SULT2A1 gene and TH&#xD;
      gene are associated with the function of DHEA/DHEA-S, and the NR3C1 gene is associated with&#xD;
      the regulation of cortisol. Therefore, the relationship between these genes and the etiology&#xD;
      of ADHD warrants investigation. Moreover, compared to the phenotype, the endophenotypes of&#xD;
      ADHD may be more capable of detecting the underlying neurobiological and hereditary&#xD;
      mechanisms. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the relationships between&#xD;
      neuroendocrine substrates (DHEA, DHEA-S, cortisol and testosterone), candidate genes (STS&#xD;
      gene, SULT2A1 gene, TH gene and NR3C1 gene) and the phenotype and endophenotypes (disease&#xD;
      subtypes, neurocognitive function and response to treatment) of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To complete this work, we will recruit 300 patients with ADHD (probands) and 600 biological&#xD;
      parents of the probands. DNA will be extracted from buccal cells by cheek swab. At baseline,&#xD;
      saliva samples of ADHD patients will be collected between 7:00 and 8:00 am using the passive&#xD;
      drool method, to analyze the levels of neuroendocrine substrates. The patients will undergo&#xD;
      assessment for their clinical symptoms and neurocognitive function. Methylphenidate will then&#xD;
      be administered to the patients and the usual practice followed. At week 4 and week 52,&#xD;
      procedures similar to those performed at baseline will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study may further elucidate the complexity of the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      ADHD. We may determine whether the neuroendocrine system, which contains levels of&#xD;
      neuroendocrine substrates and associated genes, plays a crucial role in the phenotype and&#xD;
      endophenotypes of ADHD. The information may serve as an important reference for the direction&#xD;
      of future study and clinical treatment for patients with ADHD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. We will recruit the patients who meet the criteria for ADHD outlined in the DSM-IV. The&#xD;
           diagnosis will be made by a child psychiatrist in a structured interview using the&#xD;
           Kiddie Epidemiologic Version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia&#xD;
           (K-SADS-E ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The variables of questionnaire from interview include the personal data as below: Age,&#xD;
           gender, family background, the significant pressure on growth, positions and incomes of&#xD;
           parents, and the process of mother's pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For genotyping analysis, DNA of patients and their biological parents will be collected&#xD;
           using cheek swab to collect oral mucosal cells, then put it in the refrigerator at-80°C.&#xD;
           The genotyping of STS gene, SULT2A1 gene, TH gene and NR3C1 gene will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The saliva of patients with ADHD will be collected by passive drool method at 7:00-8:00&#xD;
           in the morning. The saliva specimen which use to analysis endocrine substance&#xD;
           concentration should be placed at - 80 ° C freezer as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The psychiatrist or psychologist will rate patients' symptom severity of the case. The&#xD;
           parents of the patients have to fill in the ASRS, SNAP-IV(parent form) and CBCL. The&#xD;
           teacher of the case has to fill in the SNAP-IV(teacher form) and TRF. The patients were&#xD;
           administered the computerized CPT in a room dedicated to the testing to minimize the&#xD;
           variability of the test conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After the initial assessment, patients with ADHD will begin to receive methylphenidate&#xD;
           (MPH) treatment. Patient care was left to the discretion of the psychiatrists, who were&#xD;
           given no treatment instructions and simply encouraged to manage their patients according&#xD;
           to usual practice. Dosage and drug form can be adjust through the height and weight of&#xD;
           the case and his/her clinical needs. The times and frequency of track back should be&#xD;
           reference the clinical needs, patients and their parents' willingness. During the&#xD;
           follow-up, non-drug therapy. (e.g. Behavioral therapy, Sensory integration therapy) will&#xD;
           not be restricted. If the patients whose condition needs to be treated with drugs other&#xD;
           than MPH, the tests must be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. After four weeks, we will assess the short-term efficacy symptoms and cognitive function&#xD;
           of the patients. Patients will be saked to collect saliva at 7:00-8:00 in the morning¸&#xD;
           after that, to analysis endocrine substance concentration. The behavioral and&#xD;
           neurocognitive assessment will be performed using CGI-S、SNAP-IV(parent form),&#xD;
           SNAP-IV(teacher form), CBCL, TRF and CPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. At week 52, we will assess the long-term efficacy of the cases the symptoms and&#xD;
           cognitive function in the first 52 weeks. We will collect the saliva sampe of ADHD&#xD;
           patients at 7:00-8:00 in the morning. The behavioral and neurocognitive assessment will&#xD;
           be performed using CGI-S、SNAP-IV(parent form), SNAP-IV(teacher form), CBCL, TRF, CPT and&#xD;
           WISC-IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Finally, in K-SADS-E interviews to assess whether the patient is still meet the ADHD&#xD;
           diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV-TR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Saliva sample will be collected into collecting tubes and stored in the refrigerator&#xD;
           at-80°C. The salivary levels of DHEA, DHREA-S, cortisol and testosterone will be&#xD;
           determined using ELISA kits.&#xD;
