  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mood disturbances that lung cancer patients experience during and after chemotherapy have&#xD;
      a debilitating effect on their quality of life. The goal of the proposed project is to&#xD;
      develop and test an intervention that relies on the use of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) to&#xD;
      combat the adverse psychological/emotional consequences of receiving treatment for cancer.&#xD;
      Although VR has been used with success to treat various psychological conditions (e.g.,&#xD;
      phobias, PTSD), its potential in helping cancer patients experience an improved mood and&#xD;
      hence better quality of life has not yet been tested. In this project the investigators will&#xD;
      first develop the virtual content (e.g., natural scenes) that patients will experience within&#xD;
      a Head-Mounted-Display, simulating movement by manipulating a gesture controller. The&#xD;
      investigators will then carry out a randomized, double blind, crossover trial with 50&#xD;
      hospitalized cancer patients to test whether they can benefit psychologically and emotionally&#xD;
      from their interaction with an immersive environment compared to those who will experience a&#xD;
      guided imagery intervention. A positive result will open the route for the future development&#xD;
      of affordable self-administered VR solutions for treating the psychological side-effects of&#xD;
      cancer treatment.&#xD;
