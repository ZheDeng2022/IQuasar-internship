    <textblock>
      Brain metastases are the most common brain tumors in adults. It is estimated that around&#xD;
      10-30% of cancer patients would develop brain metastases during the course of their illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with&#xD;
      brain metastases. WBRT yields high radiologic response rate (27~56%) and is effective in&#xD;
      rapid palliation of neurologic symptoms as well as prolongs time to neurocognitive function&#xD;
      decline caused by intracranial lesions. By using conventional fractionation, 33% of patients&#xD;
      developed late neurocognitive toxicity while memory impairment was the most common symptom.&#xD;
      The incidence is even higher when a formal and sensitive neurocognitive assessment was&#xD;
      prospectively evaluated. With more long-term survivors nowadays, it has become increasingly&#xD;
      important to minimize neurocognitive function decline and maintain quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The function of hippocampus is cooperation in learning, consolidation and retrieval of&#xD;
      information and essential for formation of new memories. Bilateral and unilateral radiation&#xD;
      injury of the hippocampus is known to alter learning and memory formation. Several&#xD;
      preclinical studies support the hypothesis of hippocampus-mediated cognitive dysfunction by&#xD;
      ionizing radiation. Clinical studies show increase in radiation dose to hippocampus is&#xD;
      associated with subsequent neurocognitive function impairment in adult and pediatric&#xD;
      patients. Furthermore, the preliminary result of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0933&#xD;
      suggested hippocampal avoidance significant reduce the mean relative decline at 4 months from&#xD;
      30% in historical cohort with WBRT to 7% in experimental cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed brain structures other than hippocampus are also associated with&#xD;
      radiation-induced decline in neurocognitive function. There is presence of placebo effect for&#xD;
      interventions seeking improvement in neurocognitive function. In present study, a single&#xD;
      blind randomized phase II trial is designed to investigate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      neurocognitive function preservation using conformal WBRT with or without hippocampal&#xD;
      avoidance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institutional, randomized phase II study to assess the neurocognitive&#xD;
      outcome of conformal WBRT with or without hippocampal avoidance in patients with multiple&#xD;
      brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive conformal WBRT with or without hippocampal&#xD;
      avoidance using permuted blocks within strata that are defined by Graded Prognostic&#xD;
      Assessment (GPA) score and baseline neurocognitive status. All patients and co-investigators&#xD;
      except the principal investigator and attending radiation oncologists will be blinded for&#xD;
      treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole brain planning target volume (PTV) will receive 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Treatment&#xD;
      will be delivered once daily, 5 fractions per week, over 2 to 2.5 weeks. Breaks in treatment&#xD;
      should be minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hippocampal Avoidance WBRT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose is prescribed such as 90% of cranial content PTV is covered by the prescription&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum dose to 2% of the PTV (D2%) is 37.5 Gy, and minimum dose to 98% of the PTV (D98%) is&#xD;
      25 Gy. Minimum dose to 100% of the hippocampal avoidance regions is 10 Gy, and dose to any&#xD;
      point within the hippocampal avoidance regions cannot exceed 17 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conformal WBRT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose is prescribed such as 95% of cranial content PTV is covered by the prescription&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum dose to 1% of the PTV (D1%) is 36 Gy, and minimum dose to 99% of the PTV (D99%) is 27&#xD;
      Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up &amp; Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effect evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute (â‰¤ 90 days from WBRT start) toxicities (CTCAE ver.4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Late (&gt; 90 days from WBRT start) toxicities (CTCAE ver.4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional evaluation: at baseline, 2-, 4- ,and 6-month, every 3 months for 12 months until&#xD;
      intracranial disease progression or death after WBRT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported cognitive functioning (two items from EORTC Quality of Life&#xD;
           Questionnaire-C30 Taiwan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life specific for brain neoplasms (EORTC Quality of Life&#xD;
           Questionnaire-Brain Neoplasm Taiwan)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up brain MRI at 4-, 9- ,and 12-month until intracranial disease progression, or&#xD;
           death.&#xD;
