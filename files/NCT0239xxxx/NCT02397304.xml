  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health issue and its association with insulin resistance greatly&#xD;
      increases risks for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Exercise training is&#xD;
      recommended for obese populations, but longitudinal studies indicate aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training in obese individuals in the absence of weight loss has minimal impact on insulin&#xD;
      resistance. High turnover of fat stored within muscle cells (i.e., intramyocellular&#xD;
      triglyceride) during exercise and elevated muscle fitness (i.e., muscle oxidative capacity)&#xD;
      are key features of the enhanced insulin sensitivity observed in endurance-trained&#xD;
      individuals. It could be that longitudinal studies of exercise training in obese individuals&#xD;
      failed to sufficiently stimulate intramyocellular triglyceride turnover during exercise and&#xD;
      muscle oxidative adaptation as a result of failure to consider the impact of recent nutrition&#xD;
      within their study designs. Performing exercise in the fed vs. fasted state can blunt these&#xD;
      exercise responses in non-obese individuals. The researchers will investigate the hypothesis&#xD;
      that an acute bout of aerobic exercise performed in the overnight-fasted versus fed-state can&#xD;
      stimulate greater intramyocellular triglyceride utilization during exercise and enhanced&#xD;
      expression of genes related to muscle oxidative adaptation in obese individuals. The expected&#xD;
      outcomes will help to determine if exercising in the fasted state could be used to optimise&#xD;
      metabolic adaptation to training in obese individuals. The future impact of this research&#xD;
      could be the recommendation of a simple nutritional strategy considering meal timing to&#xD;
      enhance the effects of aerobic exercise training in obese individuals, with potential&#xD;
      long-term benefits for reducing insulin resistance and cardio-metabolic disease risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two thirds of the adult US population is overweight or obese and the prevention and treatment&#xD;
      of obesity is a key priority due to the strain on societal health, well-being and economic&#xD;
      prosperity. Obesity is associated with insulin resistance characterized by a reduced ability&#xD;
      of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and by hyperglycaemia. Obesity&#xD;
      and insulin resistance are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Weight loss through caloric restriction and increasing physical activity levels are the&#xD;
      mainstay of non-surgical/pharmacological treatment for obesity. Weight loss can reduce&#xD;
      insulin resistance although sustainable weight loss is difficult to achieve. Physical&#xD;
      activity can help with weight maintenance but perhaps surprisingly, carefully controlled&#xD;
      longitudinal studies in obese patients indicate aerobic exercise training in the absence of&#xD;
      weight loss has no or at best modest impact on peripheral insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One mechanism by which regular aerobic exercise training ensures high peripheral insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in endurance trained individuals is via stimulation of intramyocellular&#xD;
      triglyceride turnover and muscle fat oxidation, which maintains low muscle levels of fatty&#xD;
      acid metabolites known to interfere with insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake (e.g.,&#xD;
      fatty acyl CoA, diacyglycerols, ceramides). Indirect evidence suggests intramyocellular&#xD;
      triglyceride can be utilized as fuel during aerobic exercise in obese individuals, at least&#xD;
      in the overnight-fasted state. However, the influence of overnight-fasted vs. fed-state&#xD;
      exercise on intramyocellular triglyceride utilization and muscle oxidative adaptation has not&#xD;
      been studied in obesity. This is important to study as fed-state exercise, as compared to&#xD;
      overnight-fasted exercise, blunts exercise-associated increases in intramyocellular&#xD;
      triglyceride utilization, oxidative gene expression, long-term adaptation of muscle oxidative&#xD;
      capacity and resistance to high fat diet induced impairments in oral glucose tolerance in&#xD;
      lean individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the presence or timing of recent nutrition with respect to exercise could be a critical&#xD;
      factor explaining the inability of aerobic exercise training per se to improve peripheral&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity in longitudinal studies in obese populations. Exercising in the&#xD;
      overnight-fasted state could optimize metabolic adaptation to training in obese individuals&#xD;
      with long-term benefits for reduced insulin resistance and cardio-metabolic disease risk.&#xD;
