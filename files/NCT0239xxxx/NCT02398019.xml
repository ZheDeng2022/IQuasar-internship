  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients whom require cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during surgery present systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to blood cell activation and cytokine release to&#xD;
      circulation. SIRS can lead to organ dysfunction due to hemodynamic compromise (vasodilatation&#xD;
      plus leak syndrome) and/or cytokine mediated cell injury. Renal dysfunction is a major&#xD;
      adverse complication after CPB surgery. Investigators hypothesize that the use of an&#xD;
      increased adsorption membrane (OXIRIS®) during CPB is safe and presents low technical&#xD;
      complexity. The safe use of OXIRIS® will reduce cytokine circulatory levels therefore&#xD;
      decreasing SIRS and its systemic effects specially those concerning renal function.&#xD;
      Therefore, patients receiving (OXIRIS®) could potentially present less cardiac&#xD;
      surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI), and lower intensive care unit (ICU) and&#xD;
      hospital length of stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The oXiris® set connection to CPB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PrismafleX eXeed™ II (Baxter) system control unit will be used to deliver CRRT and&#xD;
           thus connected to the CPB circuit through the oXiris® set lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Priming. For oXiris® set priming use 2 L of normal saline according to the software&#xD;
           instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Connection. Using a three-way stopcock, oXiris® set must be connected to the arterial&#xD;
           line just after the oxygenator to derive blood into the oXiris® set and then returned&#xD;
           into the venous reservoir through the return line. No additional vascular access will be&#xD;
           required to deliver treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modality. The Slow Continuous Ultrafiltration modality (SCUF modality) must be selected&#xD;
           with no pre-set ultrafiltration rate (ultrafiltration rate: 0 ml/hr). A blood flow&#xD;
           between 200-300 mL/min was set in the PrismafleX eXeed™ II (blood was derived through&#xD;
           the arterial positive pressure line just after the oxygenator) to be delivered into the&#xD;
           oXiris® set and then returned into the venous reservoir through the return line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All treatments should be delivered after reaching full-flow CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRRT flow, pressure and alarms will be controlled in the PrismafleX eXeed™ II screen,&#xD;
           independently from CPB circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If CPB is stopped for any reason, then PrismafleX eXeed™ II should be stopped&#xD;
           temporarily to avoid alarm warning and/or any harm to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No additional anticoagulation method will be needed besides the systemic anticoagulation&#xD;
           required for the cardiopulmonary bypass pumping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The return line clamp (blue clamp) should be adjusted to reach a slight positive return&#xD;
           pressure in order to avoid low-pressure alarm warning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PrismafleX eXeed™ II weaning instructions. 5-10 min before the end of CPB, start the&#xD;
      blood-return procedure into the venous reservoir of the CPB using 1 L of normal saline.&#xD;
      Connect the solution into the three-way stopcock. Subsequently, set PrismafleX eXeed™ II flow&#xD;
      in 80-100 ml/min. Select STOP in the PrismafleX eXeed™ II screen. Adjust the three-way&#xD;
      stopcock to allow saline to flow into the oXiris® set arterial line an restart PrismafleX&#xD;
      eXeed™ II to return blood into the venous reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Register all manoeuvres, changes and adjustments in software settings and any technical&#xD;
      problem during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oXiris® membrane will be only employed for adsorption (neither convection nor diffusion&#xD;
      will be performed) during all CPB time. Using CPB flow, patient will not require venous&#xD;
      catheter access neither changes in CPB normal settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oXiris® membrane set is composed of a 1.5 m2 copolymer of acrylonitrile and sodium&#xD;
      methylsulfonate (AN 69) with polyethylenimine treated surface and adhered heparin during&#xD;
      set´s fabrication [oXiris® (Baxter Gambro)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood samples collected during study will be obtained from CPB circuit or central venous&#xD;
      catheters (standard cardiac surgery protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all CPB time besides the ordinary cardiac surgery assistance team, a supplementary&#xD;
      CRRT expert team will be present in those patients randomized to CPB-oXiris®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples and all variables will be equally collected and registered in the control group&#xD;
      (CPB-Standard) with no modifications from CPB standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be reported (in less than 24 hours if severe) to the sponsor centre to be&#xD;
      properly evaluated. If the severe adverse event (SAE) is finally evaluated by the study board&#xD;
      as related to the intervention arm, urgent notification to health authorities must proceed&#xD;
      and study should be interrupted until further decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will warrant a correct protocol application. Study data will be reviewed by an&#xD;
      external monitoring committee from the clinical assay research central unit (UCICEC -&#xD;
      IDIBELL). Monitors will contrast registered data from the collection data form (CDF) with&#xD;
      data from patients' medical record. All patients' medical records will be indefinitely saved&#xD;
      in electronic format to be reviewed if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Registered variables and follow-up. Renal function related parameters Plasma creatinine&#xD;
           and urine output will be registered at baseline, prior to CPB, at ICU admission, 6 hours&#xD;
           ,12 hours, 24h postCBP and every 24h during the first week after cardiac surgery in&#xD;
           order to evaluate CS-AKI based on KDIGO AKI criteria (KDIGO criteria Kidney inter.,&#xD;
           Suppl. 2012; 2: 1-138.) Renal function will be checked at hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hemolysis parameters Cell-free serum hemoglobin levels will be determined in plasma.&#xD;
           These determinations will be measured at times T1 (at the end of CPB), and T3 (24 hours&#xD;
           after ICU admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inflammatory response parameters Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha&#xD;
           (TNF-α), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6&#xD;
           (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-18 (IL-18), complement&#xD;
           5a (C5a), high mobility binding protein 1 (HMBP-1), RANTES, GRO-alpha, leukocytes count,&#xD;
           lactate, and D-dimer levels will be determined in plasma.These determinations will be&#xD;
           measured baseline (0 hours), and at times T1 (at the end of CPB), T2 (ICU admission) and&#xD;
           T3 (24 hours after ICU admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ordinary laboratory parameters Plasmatic urea, potassium, albumin, magnesium, phosphate,&#xD;
           glucose, sodium, chloride, AST, ALT, blood cell count and coagulation times will be&#xD;
           determined following the ordinary cardiac surgery protocol (every 8 hours during the&#xD;
           first 24h).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical and respiratory parameters Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters will be&#xD;
           registered every hour. Arterial and venous blood gases with arterial lactate will be&#xD;
           determined every 8 hours during the first 24 hours. Temperature, heart rate, arterial&#xD;
           blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean), central venous pressure, vasopressor&#xD;
           and/or inotrope dose will be registered during surgery and at ICU according to standard&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographic and clinical record data Age, gender, weight, height, relevant clinical&#xD;
           records, previous or chronic medication, type of cardiac surgery, surgery times, time on&#xD;
           CPB, surgical complications, blood transfusions during and after surgery, prognostic&#xD;
           scores (SOFA, APACHE II and SAPS II), ICU stay, hospital stay. Clinical outcome&#xD;
           (survival at discharge, 28 and 90 days) and renal outcome (renal function, and RRT&#xD;
           requirements).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cell-free serum hemoglobin analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cell-free serum hemoglobin concentration will be measured using the Cayman's Hemoglobin&#xD;
           Colorimetric Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan). Blood samples will be&#xD;
           obtained at T1 and T3 into VACUETTE® Serum tubes (Greiner Bio One GmbH, Kremsmünster,&#xD;
           Austria). After clotting at room temperature, serum will be separated by centrifugation&#xD;
           at 2000 g for 15 minutes and stored at -80°C in 1 mL aliquots until use.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cell-free serum hemoglobin concentrations will be determined using manufacturer's&#xD;
           protocols with provided calibration standards. All samples will be processed in&#xD;
           duplicate. Changes in absorbance at 560 nm will be measured using a 96-well plate&#xD;
           reader.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cytokines analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, TNFα, MCP-1, HMBP-1, RANTES, GROα quantification will be&#xD;
           performed with multiplex new technology. MILLIPLEX (Millipore) magnetic balls system&#xD;
           will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Limitations&#xD;
&#xD;
           SIRS harmful effects which are initiated during CPB may persist after surgery and this&#xD;
           is an important limitation as our study only evaluates the use of increased adsorption&#xD;
           membranes during CPB. However, investigators hypothesize that the important effect on&#xD;
           cytokine levels during CPB will be observed. Furthermore, patients requiring non&#xD;
           emergent cardiac surgery represent a non absolutely homogeneous cohort and this could&#xD;
           introduce potential bias in main and secondary objectives. To avoid this potential bias,&#xD;
           temporary sequential randomization has been performed and advanced chronic renal failure&#xD;
           patients have been excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data will try to be avoided by an exhaustive patient´s follow up by study&#xD;
      investigators. Data registry has been created to include all variables with written&#xD;
      individual data collection forms (DCF). Data will be bedside registered by the study members&#xD;
      but final software database registration will be done by the statistics outside investigator&#xD;
      who has no contact with patients situation. Cytokines levels will be introduced in DCF when&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done by the statistics investigator who wont have any role in&#xD;
      patient´s selection, randomization, or follow up. SPSS v. 20.0 for statistical analysis will&#xD;
      be used. Variable distribution will be studied and logarithmic transformation will be used on&#xD;
      those variables that don't present normal distribution, presumably cytokine levels.&#xD;
      Univariate analysis comparing clinical, demographic, biochemical, metabolic, hemodynamic and&#xD;
      respiratory baseline variables between both arms (CPB-OXIRIS® and CPB-Standard), will be done&#xD;
      with two-tailed t test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical&#xD;
      variables. Variables determined several times (T0, T1, T2, T3) will be analysed using a&#xD;
      one-way repeated measures ANOVA test in order to demonstrate differences between both arms.&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis will be completed to control those clinically relevant confounding&#xD;
      variables as well as to discover baseline differences. Arm intervention (CPB-OXIRIS®,&#xD;
      CPB-Standard) will be considered as the main independent variable adding other control&#xD;
      independent variables. Intervention safety will be measured by the presence of any adverse&#xD;
      effects not related to the standard technique. This effects will be recorded during CPB,&#xD;
      after CPB, and during the first 24 hours postsurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study is measuring cytokine levels in four different moments (T0, T1, T2, T3), in&#xD;
      order to maximize statistical power and reduce control variables number, the area under the&#xD;
      curve (AUC) we´ll be determined for every cytokine during the first 24 hours. Due to this&#xD;
      statistical maneuver investigators will obtain a continuous variable that represents each&#xD;
      cytokine level during the biochemical study period (24 hours). To evaluate if the arm&#xD;
      intervention improvement in terms of efficacy and safety could be related to cytokine levels&#xD;
      during the first 24 hours, a mediation complementary analysis will be done considering&#xD;
      cytokine (represented by AUC) as a mediator between the independent variable (intervention&#xD;
      arm) and the effect we study.&#xD;
