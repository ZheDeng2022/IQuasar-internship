      For odor control malignant wounds (MW), use is 0.8% metronidazole solution - second&#xD;
      recommendation scientific and clinical practice. But no this formulation available in Brazil&#xD;
      , and its application to nursing steeps metronidazole tablets , diluted in saline and applied&#xD;
      to the bed of (MW) . Thus , it is used off label for metronidazole ( tablets orally applied&#xD;
      via &quot; topical &quot; - but it is not intact skin or mucosa ) , nursing and eventually manipulate&#xD;
      the solution at bedside , and by law this power is pharmacist bedside and can not be taken .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family antiseptic chlorhexidine was developed with the purpose of use in infected wounds&#xD;
      called polihexanide ( PHMB ) . In Brazil is now available for hospital and home care ( 0.2 %&#xD;
      Aquasept ® ) use. Evidence reported positive results in controlling infection of chronic&#xD;
      wounds such as pressure ulcers . Although not tested its efficacy in odor control. Thus the&#xD;
      study aims to compare metronidazole solution 0.8 % versus 0.2 % PHMB in odor control , where&#xD;
      , if the results are favorable to PHMB we have a treatment option in odor control with ready&#xD;
      to use formulation and easy access . Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of metronidazole&#xD;
      solution 0.8% and polihexanide solution (PHMB) in odor control in MW. Aims: Evaluate and&#xD;
      compare the time needed for odor control (reduction in days), using metronidazole and PHMB in&#xD;
      MW (primary endpoint); Evaluate and compare the perceptions of patients, nurses and&#xD;
      researcher on the odor MW, using metronidazole and PHMB in the MW; Evaluate and compare the&#xD;
      pain reported by patients during dressing changes, using metronidazole and PHMB in the MW;&#xD;
      Evaluate and compare the quality of life of patients before and after the use of&#xD;
      metronidazole and PHMB in MW. This is a randomized, double -blind study with patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with cancer and patients with MW with odor clinical trial . The sample consisted of&#xD;
      24 subjects divided into 2 groups (control - metronidazole group and experimental group -&#xD;
      PHMB ) , recruited in one cancer hospital in the city of São Paulo (AC Camargo Cancer&#xD;
      Center), which has as protocol description in odor control MW metronidazole . After&#xD;
      acceptance by the subject and return the Statement of Informed Consent signed , randomization&#xD;
      will be done .&#xD;
&#xD;
      For blinding , 0.8 % metronidazole solution will be provided by a compounding pharmacy (after&#xD;
      stability testing of tablet diluted - and then stipulated expiration date) , and PHMB be&#xD;
      bought from the supplier , delivered to the same compounding pharmacy which stores the PHMB&#xD;
      in identical bottles to metronidazole ( only the responsible researcher will know to which&#xD;
      group the subject was randomized ) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the odor will be taken by 3 &quot; employees &quot; and the patient through 3 scales&#xD;
      at zero , four, eight and twelve days ( or earlier if classified as &quot; odorless &quot; by 3&#xD;
      reviewers and the patient ) . Two scales about painful sensations in exchange for healing ,&#xD;
      one on quality of life will be applied to the patient and a specifically on the impact of&#xD;
      odor on the subject's life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet the proposed objectives, the data will be analyzed by: Friedman test to assess the&#xD;
      odor reduction with respect to time; Mann-Whitney (or t test) for comparison of groups and&#xD;
      the Fisher exact test to compare proportions. Data will be presented in the form of frequency&#xD;
      tables for categorical variables and means, standard deviations and position measurements for&#xD;
      quantitative variables. Will also be performed non-parametric analysis of ordinal data, or&#xD;
      parametric analysis with Generalized Estimation Equation for binomial variables, depending on&#xD;
      the data distribution and the sample size.&#xD;
