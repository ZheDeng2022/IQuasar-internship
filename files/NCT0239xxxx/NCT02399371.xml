    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with malignant&#xD;
      mesothelioma, a cancer of the linings around the lungs (pleura) or abdomen (peritoneum).&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, work by blocking a protein called programmed&#xD;
      cell death 1 (PD-1) which may stimulate an immune response and kill tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate of patients with malignant mesothelioma treated&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab in A) an unselected patient population, as well as B) in a programmed cell&#xD;
      death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive population (should the trial proceed to Part B, and PD-L1&#xD;
      expression correlate with improved efficacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the optimal threshold for PD-L1 expression using the 22C3 antibody based&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay in correlation to tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression-free survival of patients with malignant mesothelioma in A)&#xD;
      an unselected patient population and B) a PD-L1 positive population when treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the overall survival of patients with malignant mesothelioma in A) an&#xD;
      unselected patient population and B) a PD-L1 positive population when treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the disease control rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] +&#xD;
      stable disease [SD]) of patients with malignant mesothelioma who are treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in A) an unselected patient population and B) a PD-L1 positive population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine toxicity in patients with malignant mesothelioma who are treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine percentage of patients with mesothelioma who have PD-L1 tumor expression, and&#xD;
      the distribution of PD-L1 expression (percent positivity of tumor cells/stroma staining).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the T-cell inflamed phenotype in mesothelioma patients via presence of&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation (CD)8 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and/or use of a gene&#xD;
      expression signature (Nanostring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate other immune escape mechanisms including indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase&#xD;
      (IDO) expression, regulatory T cells (Tregs) (forkhead box P3 [FOXP3] expression),&#xD;
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and other checkpoints by immunohistochemistry (or&#xD;
      other methods e.g. flow cytometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine PD-L1 expression by mass spectrometry and correlate with tumor response,&#xD;
      PD-L1 expression by IHC, and the T-cell inflamed phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the immune cell populations present in fresh tumor (when available), via&#xD;
      tumor digests and mass spectrometry-based flow cytometric analysis (e.g. using CyTOF) in a&#xD;
      multiplex fashion in patients with fresh tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To characterize the T-cell receptor repertoire of TILs compared to circulating T-cells in&#xD;
      mesothelioma patients with available fresh frozen tissue (spectrotyping, T-cell repertoire&#xD;
      sequencing [e.g. using the Adaptive platform]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients may be eligible for up to 1 year of additional pembrolizumab therapy if&#xD;
      they progress after stopping pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days (up to 90 days for&#xD;
      serious adverse events), every 8 weeks until patient experiences confirmed disease&#xD;
      progression or starts a new anti-cancer therapy, and then every 12 weeks for 3 years.&#xD;

    <description>Based on the results from Part A, the Youden Index methodology will be used to determine the optimal threshold for PD-L1 expression in correlation with tumor response, and if a correlation is identified this threshold will be used for Part B. The overall ability of PD-L1 to predict response will be assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve). If the area is significantly greater than 0.5, part B will begin using the optimum cutpoint as determined from the Youden index.</description>
