    <textblock>
      This project is part of the EU funded project NISTAS. NISTAS aims at the development of a new&#xD;
      medical device for non-contact, non-invasive screening of the health status of the vascular&#xD;
      system of adult subjects. The instrument, called VascuLight, is intended to be deployed at&#xD;
      out-patient points-of-care and hospitals, and it provides output parameters related to the&#xD;
      PWV as measured at local and/or at regional level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NISTAS brings together four European SMEs in four different, but complementary, technology&#xD;
      areas (JULIGHT, ECLEXYS, EPI-LIGHT, OIP) and links them with five RTD Performers (UNIPV, OSM,&#xD;
      CORK UNIVERSITY, Saphyrion, Eudax srl ) to develop new knowledge and a new medical device&#xD;
      which will have significant commercial benefits for all of the SME partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VascuLight responds to an unmet need in the medical diagnosis practice: the request for a&#xD;
      fast and sustainable method for the screening of the health of the vascular system in large&#xD;
      series, capable of providing a reliable indicator of the cardiovascular risk of the screened&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VascuLight idea is founded on a paradigm shift: bringing and adapting to the biomedical&#xD;
      field measurement techniques that are to date confined to the industrial environment. NISTAS&#xD;
      will develop new non-contact distance/displacement/vibration sensors based on a variant of&#xD;
      the well-known and reliable laser triangulation technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUL and UNIPV have carried out proof-of-concept, in-vivo tests of the VascuLight approach to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the concept is realistic and attainable. Results have been obtained using&#xD;
      Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV), a displacement-measuring technique based on the principle of&#xD;
      light interference, and an area where both JUL and UNIPV have made important contributions.&#xD;
      In the tests it was possible to use TWO small LDV optical heads to simultaneously measure the&#xD;
      pulse wave in two points on the carotid spaced by 2.5 cm, allowing for the calculation of the&#xD;
      time-delay between the pulse waves, and thus providing a direct local measurement of the PWV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to test the implemented contactless optical technique for the&#xD;
      measurement of the PWV and the arterial stiffness at the carotid artery level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the validity of the measure method, the investigators will compare Vasculight&#xD;
      v1.0 PWV measures with those obtained from e-tracking (echocardiographic method) . The main&#xD;
      idea is to compare the distribution of measures (comparable mean and standard deviation) in&#xD;
      the same mixed adult population, using the two different methods.&#xD;
