  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study in Kenya that will examine the outcomes of participants aged 10-15&#xD;
      and 16 and older; and provider acceptability of the Shang Ring technique for male&#xD;
      circumcision that would simplify use. The study will be in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will explore the no-flip technique that has been used in China but will be used for&#xD;
      the first time in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will be a randomized trial comparing use of tropical vs. injectable anesthesia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study, to be conducted in two phases, will examine procedural and clinical outcomes, as&#xD;
      well as participant and provider acceptability, of adaptations of the Shang Ring technique&#xD;
      for male circumcision that would simplify its use and increase its acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I will be non-comparative for exploration of the no-flip technique for Shang Ring&#xD;
           circumcision (i.e. all participants will be circumcised using the no-flip Shang Ring&#xD;
           technique). Historical data from standard Shang Ring circumcisions conducted in Africa&#xD;
           (Kenya, Uganda and Zambia) will be used as the comparison group. Men will be randomized&#xD;
           to removal at 7 days after circumcision vs. delayed removal, to assess occurrence and&#xD;
           safety of spontaneous detachments following circumcision with the no-flip technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 will compare the use of topical vs. injectable anesthesia for Shang Ring&#xD;
           circumcision. Participants will be randomized to topical vs. injectable anesthesia in a&#xD;
           2:1 ratio. The investigators rationalize the 2:1 randomization scheme given that the&#xD;
           investigators will have just completed Phase I in which 200 men and boys will have been&#xD;
           circumcised using the no-flip technique with injected anesthesia. However, given the&#xD;
           subjectivity associated with using reported pain as the primary endpoint, the&#xD;
           investigators believe it is critical to randomize participants in this phase of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
