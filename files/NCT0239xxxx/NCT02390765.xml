      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Studies show that many factors affect children s eating behavior and health. These include&#xD;
      sleep, mood, thinking skills, and genetics. Studying children over time may identify children&#xD;
      at higher risk for eating-related health concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand how genes and environment influence eating behavior and health over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children ages 8 17 in good general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening visit 1: Medical history, physical exam, body measurements, and questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  14 days: Participants will wear a wrist monitor and answer smartphone prompts about&#xD;
           eating and mood. They may give a stool sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva, urine, and blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meals provided (after fasting overnight).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires and interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavior, thinking, and exercise tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-ray of left wrist and full body.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some parents may have medical history, physical exam, and questions at screening visits.&#xD;
           They may answer questions at the yearly visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have up to 6 yearly visits. They will give a urine sample and body&#xD;
           measurements, and repeat the X-rays. They will have questions and behavior and thinking&#xD;
           tasks. They may give stool samples. Visits will range from 3 to 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may choose to participate in other studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress and Hormones, 1 visit: While resting, participants will give saliva samples and&#xD;
           have their heart monitored. Then they will do math. They will repeat the resting part,&#xD;
           then do a computer task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain Imaging, 2 visits: Twice, participants will perform tasks with a magnetic cone on&#xD;
           their head then answer questions. Once, they will have an MRI, lying still in a scanner&#xD;
           with a coil on their head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep, 2 visits: Participants will have food provided, answer questions and do tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be compensated for the time and inconvenience involved with completing&#xD;
      study procedures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to disentangle the varying disinhibited eating patterns, or eating behavior&#xD;
      endophenotypes, that lead to excessive weight gain and obesity-related comorbidities in&#xD;
      youth. Extensive baseline evaluations, including three separate experimental paradigms, and&#xD;
      annual follow-up assessments will assist with identifying biopsychosocial mechanisms that&#xD;
      appear to increase risk for, and maintain, these eating behaviors and lead to weight gain.&#xD;
      Illumination of early risk factors for specific eating behavior endophenotypes and their&#xD;
      associated health outcomes will inform the development of targeted interventions for&#xD;
      pediatric obesity. Participants for the current study will include 500 healthy obese and&#xD;
      non-obese boys and girls (8 to 17yo at baseline) and their parents/caregivers. Youth will&#xD;
      first complete two visits in order to ensure study eligibility and to evaluate&#xD;
      self-regulatory, motivational, and neurocognitive factors that appear to be salient to the&#xD;
      development and maintenance of disinhibited eating behavior, including: psychological&#xD;
      distress, sleep behavior, food reinforcement, reward sensitivity, executive functioning,&#xD;
      attention bias, and a range of related genetic and physiological factors. Eating behavior&#xD;
      will be observed in the laboratory using several validated paradigms. For two weeks,&#xD;
      participants will monitor their sleep using wrist actigraphy, as well as record their mood,&#xD;
      eating behavior, and eating cognitions using smart phones (via ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessment methods). Youth will then be invited to complete up to three separate experimental&#xD;
      paradigms designed to further elucidate cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes&#xD;
      associated with disinhibited eating behavior. All participants will then complete annual&#xD;
      evaluations of weight and adiposity for a total of six years, with more extensive evaluations&#xD;
      of self-regulatory, motivational and neurocognitive functioning every three years. Studying&#xD;
      children and adolescents longitudinally will allow for examination of the independent and&#xD;
      shared risk factors for pediatric disinhibited eating and excess weight. Data from these&#xD;
      evaluations will not only be used to test specific hypotheses, but will also be&#xD;
      hypothesis-generating in that they will inform the development of additional empirical&#xD;
      questions and subsequent experiments. Thus, the current protocol will offer the flexibility&#xD;
      to examine potentially critical contributions to weight gain in children as they continue&#xD;
      their biopsychosocial development.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 8 17 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight, height and BMI greater than or equal to 5th percentile for age and sex&#xD;
             according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000 US standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitively capable of completing study procedures (FSIQ greater than or equal to 70).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good general health based on a normal history and physical examination (with the&#xD;
             exception of overweight and minor, well-controlled illnesses).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals will be excluded (and provided treatment referrals as needed) for the following&#xD;
        reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of major cardiovascular disease or any other serious obesity-related&#xD;
             complication as assessed during history and physical exam. Individuals with untreated&#xD;
             or major illnesses relating to the endocrine and/or cardiovascular systems are&#xD;
             excluded because these illnesses will likely influence outcomes. Such obesity-related&#xD;
             comorbidities include hypertension (defined by age- sex- and height- specific&#xD;
             standards, and fasting hyperglycemia consistent with diabetes (fasting glucose &gt; 126&#xD;
             mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of other major illnesses: renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, most&#xD;
             endocrinologic (e.g., Cushing syndrome, untreated hyper- or hypothyroidism),&#xD;
             hematological problems or pulmonary disorders (other than asthma not requiring&#xD;
             continuous medication). Non-serious medical illnesses, such as seasonal allergies,&#xD;
             will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular use of any medication known to affect body weight or eating behavior (e.g.,&#xD;
             many medications prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD).&#xD;
             Medication use for non-serious conditions (e.g., acne) will be considered on a&#xD;
             case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current pregnancy or a history of pregnancy. A negative pregnancy test before starting&#xD;
             the study will be required for postmenarcheal girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current and regular use of tobacco products and/or alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A significant reduction in weight during the past three months, for any reason,&#xD;
             exceeding 5% of body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of significant or recent brain injury that may considerably influence&#xD;
             performance on neurocognitive measures (i.e., any history of loss of consciousness&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 30 minutes associated with a head injury, any history of&#xD;
             memory loss or hospitalization associated with a head injury, or greater than or equal&#xD;
             to 2 concussions within last year).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any significant, full-threshold psychiatric disorder based on DSM criteria&#xD;
             such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, alcohol or substance abuse, anorexia or&#xD;
             bulimia nervosa, or any disorder that, in the opinion of the investigators, would&#xD;
             impede competence or compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study. These&#xD;
             individuals will not be permitted to enroll in the current study and will be referred&#xD;
             for treatment. Individuals who present with other psychiatric disorders, including&#xD;
             sub-threshold psychiatric disorders, will be permitted to enroll in the study.&#xD;
             Sub-threshold psychiatric disorders include symptoms that do not meet diagnostic&#xD;
             threshold based on the DSM criteria for mental disorders, but which are nevertheless&#xD;
             significantly impairing or distressing. If, based on the opinion of the investigators,&#xD;
             a participant requires treatment for his/her psychiatric symptoms,, the individual&#xD;
             will be referred for treatment. Participants who develop any psychiatric disorder or&#xD;
             significant psychiatric symptoms at any follow-up assessment during the study will not&#xD;
             be excluded, but will be provided with treatment referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition in the child or parents/guardians that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators, would impede compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study&#xD;
             (e.g., significant Learning Disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional exclusions for (optional) stool sample collection include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stool Sample only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis or history of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis or&#xD;
             Crohn's disease, celiac sprue, irritable bowel syndrome, or other inflammatory&#xD;
             disorders of the intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diarrhea within 1 week prior to sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antibiotic use within 4 weeks prior to sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, Experiments 1 and 2 have specific additional exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Experiment 1 only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular use of medications that could influence autonomic or endocrine functioning,&#xD;
             including alpha and beta blockers, oral contraceptives, or prescription pain&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scoring as &quot;highly active&quot; on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (due&#xD;
             to decreased cortisol reactivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Experiment 2 only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be excluded if MRI and MEG is contraindicated (metal in body,&#xD;
             braces, glasses required to correct vision, presence of non-organic [e.g., cochlear]&#xD;
             implants or cerebral clips, permanent tattooed makeup or general tattoos in a&#xD;
             dangerous location on the body or made with colors whose content in iron cannot be&#xD;
             definitely ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Youth will be excluded if they are left-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants will receive a written explanation of the purposes, procedures, and&#xD;
        potential hazards of the study. Communication of this information and of the participant s&#xD;
        assent as well as the consent of the parent or guardian will be documented in the medical&#xD;
        record and copies of all signed documents given to each family. All participants will be&#xD;
        informed of their right to withdraw from the study.&#xD;
