  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hominids and hominins serve as remarkable hosts to microbes, and we have co-evolved over the&#xD;
      past 4.5 million years as highly plethoric communities. Human-associated microorganisms (the&#xD;
      &quot;microbiome&quot;) are present in numbers exceeding the quantities of human cells by at least&#xD;
      10-fold beginning in the neonatal period. The collective genome (the &quot;metagenome&quot;) exceeds&#xD;
      our human genome in terms of gene content by more than 150-fold. With respect to microbiota&#xD;
      and preterm birth, it has generally assumed that the majority of intrauterine infections&#xD;
      originate in the lower genital tract, with microbiota ascending into the otherwise sterile&#xD;
      intrauterine environment to infect the placenta (preterm birth), fetal membranes&#xD;
      (chorioamnionitis), umbilical cord (funisitis), and the fetus (sepsis). However, we and&#xD;
      others have recently demonstrated that the vaginal and gut microbiome communities are&#xD;
      distinctly structured in pregnancy, and the placenta is in fact not sterile, but rather&#xD;
      harbors a low-abundance microbiome which is likely acquired through hematogenous transmission&#xD;
      of the oral microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our prior studies and preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that a distinct&#xD;
      and largely commensal resident microbiome in pregnancy renders risk for preterm birth. By&#xD;
      utilizing our state-of-the-science technology and analysis tools in a longitudinal&#xD;
      case-cohort of preterm birth subjects, we will be able to transform &quot;discovery based&quot;&#xD;
      metagenomics and multi'omics science into readily translatable mechanistic studies at a&#xD;
      previously unparalleled level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1. Longitudinal maternal (vaginal, oral, skin, gut), fetal (oral, skin, gut) and&#xD;
      placental (basal plate and parenchyma) 16S-based metagenomic profiling with inferred&#xD;
      metagenomics will reveal distinct microbial communities in association with preterm birth.&#xD;
      Methods: We will enroll 526 at-risk gravidae to yield an approximated 135 preterm births with&#xD;
      401 at-risk term controls. Starting in the first/early second trimester, we will sample&#xD;
      multiple body sites (vagina, oral, stool, placenta) at multiple time points (antenatal&#xD;
      through delivery), isolate microbial DNA, and perform 16S-based determination of&#xD;
      niche-specific microbial communities found in association with preterm birth. With our&#xD;
      case-cohort longitudinal design, we will be able to apply our well-developed supervised&#xD;
      learning approaches to reveal which taxa contribute to risk of preterm birth, and at what&#xD;
      body sites and gestational ages they are predictive of preterm birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomics from selected subjects and body sites&#xD;
      will enable species identification, generation of microbial gene catalogues, and metabolic&#xD;
      reconstructions to determine the structure, function and diversity of the preterm birth&#xD;
      microbiome. Methods: To probe metabolic functionality and describe pathogen-related&#xD;
      mechanisms, we will analyze changes in total gene content using shotgun metagenomics on a&#xD;
      subset of samples. We will build on our functional computational pipelines to fully&#xD;
      characterize targeted subjects' metagenomic signatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3. Integrated host genomics, metatranscriptomics and metabonomics data will&#xD;
      reveal molecular mechanisms and networks underlying preterm birth in a limited subset of&#xD;
      samples. Methods: We will interrogate and integrate our concomitantly acquired clinical&#xD;
      metadata, microbial and host gene expression data (RNA-Seq metatranscriptomics), and&#xD;
      metabonomics profiling with advanced computational and biostatistical approaches. We will be&#xD;
      guided in our choice of subjects by our data from Aims 1 and 2.&#xD;
