  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-human study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single&#xD;
      ascending doses of LMG324 to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in neovascular&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD) subjects. Enrollment will be expanded at a safe and&#xD;
      tolerated dose in treatment naïve nvAMD subjects to compare a single intravitreal (IVT) dose&#xD;
      of LMG324 to ranibizumab 0.5 mg administered every 4 weeks for change from baseline in&#xD;
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at Week 12 (Day 85).&#xD;

      The study will start with a single dose ascending (SAD) phase. LMG324 will be administered on&#xD;
      Day 1 with no further treatment until implementation of standard of care (SoC) therapy. SoC&#xD;
      therapy is ranibizumab 0.5 mg administered per label. Dose groups will be implemented&#xD;
      sequentially to allow for safety review between the current and subsequent dose group. All&#xD;
      treatments will be open-label, including ranibizumab used as SoC therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the enrollment expansion phase, subjects randomized to LMG324 arm will receive a single&#xD;
      LMG324 IVT injection on Day 1 followed by sham (fake) IVT injections until implementation of&#xD;
      SoC therapy. After implementation, SoC therapy will be applied monthly with sham injections&#xD;
      applied at the interim planned visits. The enrollment expansion phase may start at a selected&#xD;
      dose level whilst the dose escalation phase is still ongoing.&#xD;
