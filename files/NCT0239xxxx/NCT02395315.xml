    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a very prevalent metabolic disorder in the adult population&#xD;
      affecting roughly 17.7 million people in the US alone. The harmful effect of DM on implant&#xD;
      integration and survival has been attributed to vascular complications in the alveolar bone&#xD;
      that lead to compromised blood supply and decreased bone density. Nonetheless, the specific&#xD;
      detrimental effects of DM in the alveolar bone have not been investigated in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with DM generally lose more teeth than persons without diabetes, but implant placement&#xD;
      in not well controlled diabetics is not routinely performed due to the lack of relevant&#xD;
      evidence and the risk for implant failure and associated complications. Chemically modified,&#xD;
      micro-rough, hydrophilic (SLActive®) titanium implant surfaces have been shown to accelerate&#xD;
      osseointegration of dental implants placed in diabetic animals. It has been hypothesized that&#xD;
      this enhanced biologic response is due to the biocompatibility and hydrophilicity of the&#xD;
      surface that actively attracts blood and is populated by progenitor cells, and growth factors&#xD;
      that improve stromal cell differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that hyperglycemia results in compromised vascularity in the mandible.&#xD;
      Thus, hydrophilic TiZr implant surfaces (Roxolid®) that actively attract fluids and possess&#xD;
      excellent osteoconductive properties, may enhance peri-implant bone response in diabetic&#xD;
      patients to levels comparable to well-controlled diabetics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A high level of evidence exists to support the placement of implants in type 2 diabetics with&#xD;
      glucosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels within the normoglycemic range. Less information is&#xD;
      available for the integration of implants placed in diabetics that cannot achieve good&#xD;
      glycemic control, who may represent up to 50% of the diabetic patient population. Recent data&#xD;
      from the medical literature have unveiled the deleterious effect of uncontrolled diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (DM) on the bone marrow. The microvascular alterations of DM on skeletal bones lead&#xD;
      to microangiopathy, reduced blood flow and fatty degeneration in the bone marrow. Nascent&#xD;
      theories that are founded upon the observation of increased levels of soluble osteoprotegerin&#xD;
      (OPG) levels in uncontrolled DM implicate disruption of RANKL/OPG signaling as a potential&#xD;
      pathway for the diabetes- related bone alterations. Nonetheless, no data is currently&#xD;
      available on the pathophysiology of the alveolar bone in patients with DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that 1) hyperglycemia results in compromised vascularity in the mandible,&#xD;
      thus 2) hydrophilic TiZr implant surfaces (Roxolid®) that actively attract fluids and possess&#xD;
      excellent osteoconductive properties, may enhance peri-implant bone response in not&#xD;
      well-controlled diabetics (NCD) to levels comparable to well-controlled diabetics (WCD). We&#xD;
      further hypothesize that the expected decreased RANKL/OPG ratio in NCD versus WCD will not&#xD;
      recover during post-surgery bone remodeling. To assess our hypotheses, we will recruit n=21&#xD;
      type II WCD (HbA1c≤7.0%) and n=21 type II NCD (7.5%&lt;HbA1c≤10%) seeking implant placement in&#xD;
      the mandible. We will collect intra-operative bone specimens at baseline and blood samples to&#xD;
      assess bone structural alterations (H&amp;E stain), microvascular density (immunohistochemistry),&#xD;
      bound RANKL/OPG (immunohistochemistry) and serum RANKL/OPG (ELISA). Implant integration and&#xD;
      success will be assessed at 3, 6, 12 and 36-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtained results will give dental researchers new insights into the pathophysiology of the&#xD;
      alveolar bone in diabetes and will provide information on the safety and efficacy of implant&#xD;
      placement in type II diabetic patients that cannot control their glycemic status.&#xD;
      Collectively, this work will pave the way for identifying efficacious implant treatment&#xD;
      modalities for persons that live with type II diabetes to alleviate the morbidity associated&#xD;
      with tooth loss in this susceptible population group.&#xD;
