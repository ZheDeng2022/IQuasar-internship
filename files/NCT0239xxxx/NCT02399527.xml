    <textblock>
      Lymphatic anomalies are a rare subset of vascular anomalies that are poorly understood. the&#xD;
      understanding of the natural history, long-term outcomes, risk factors for morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, and the relative benefit of medical therapies and procedures is limited.The goal&#xD;
      of this project is to better understand these diseases and improve the care of theses rare&#xD;
      patients. To do this, the investigators are conducting an observational study of patients&#xD;
      with lymphatic anomalies, including an annual follow-up questionnaire to gather prospective&#xD;
      data on mortality, morbidity, treatments, and functionality as well as quality of life.&#xD;

      The purpose of the Lymphatic Anomalies Registry, created at Boston Children's Hospital, is to&#xD;
      create a database to help current and future patients diagnosed with a lymphatic anomaly. The&#xD;
      ultimate goal of the registry is to better understand and predict responses to therapies and&#xD;
      risk factors for complications. Although the Lymphatic Anomalies Registry exists at Boston&#xD;
      Children's Hospital, patients can be entered into the registry regardless of whether or not&#xD;
      they visit Boston Children's Hospital, thus increasing the program's accessibility. The&#xD;
      Lymphatic Anomalies Registry includes patients who have vascular anomalies with a lymphatic&#xD;
      component across various diagnoses. From the patient's perspective, participation in the&#xD;
      Lymphatic Anomalies Registry means taking part in a short, thirty minute interview, and&#xD;
      providing the registry with access to medical records. The interview is conducted verbally&#xD;
      with study staff of the Lymphatic Anomalies Registry, and can take place either at the&#xD;
      hospital, or over the phone. During the interview, the registry will inquire about the&#xD;
      patient's diagnosis, disease features, medical therapies, and procedures. Interested&#xD;
      prospective patients will receive an introductory packet from the registry with information&#xD;
      on how to proceed in the registry process. All obtained patient information is housed on a&#xD;
      secure, HIPPA compliant, internal database, managed by Boston Children's Hospital staff.&#xD;
      Patient information entered into the external database is de-identified. The research teams&#xD;
      will also obtain a medical record release form to request the patient's medical record for&#xD;
      review in our study.&#xD;

        Both domestic and international patients with complex lymphatic anomalies, as described&#xD;
        above, are eligible to participate. Travel to Boston is not required for participation.&#xD;
        Eligible patients are identified through active referral in the Vascular Anomalies Center&#xD;
        at Boston Children's Hospital. Physicians and patients may also refer eligible patients&#xD;
        directly to the Lymphatic Anomalies Registry. Patients may indicate interest in&#xD;
        participation themselves by contacting the registry team through the &quot;Contact Us&quot; link on&#xD;
