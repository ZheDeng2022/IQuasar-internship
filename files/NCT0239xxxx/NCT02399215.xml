  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nintedanib works in treating patients with&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors that have spread from where they started to nearby tissue or lymph&#xD;
      nodes (locally advanced) or have spread from the primary site (place where they started) to&#xD;
      other places in the body (metastatic). Nintedanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      slowing or stopping a certain type of receptor called vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (VEGFR) from attaching to its target. This may stop the growth of neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time interval from initiation of&#xD;
      therapy, to its cessation for documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the clinical response (complete response + partial response) in all patients&#xD;
      with measurable disease (using standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]&#xD;
      version [v]1.1 criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess overall survival (OS) in all patients. III. Assess changes in quality of life&#xD;
      (QOL) throughout treatment using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of&#xD;
      Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) - Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors&#xD;
      (NET) 21 (GI.NET21) questionnaire for carcinoid patients with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors, in all patients who have filled out at least two QOL questionnaires and, will be&#xD;
      reported by groups based on response (response, stable disease or progressive disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of nintedanib, biomarkers, regulatory T cell (Treg)&#xD;
      and cytokine expression and growth factors will be analyzed for all patients and reported in&#xD;
      groups based on response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Gene mutations and copy number alterations analysis in the mammalian target of rapamycin&#xD;
      (mTOR) pathway (will be performed only on the first 10 patients), protein expression of&#xD;
      activation of protein kinase B (Akt) (as well as other downstream targets).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Toxicity (graded using the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
      for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 4.0) will be closely monitored and all toxicities will be&#xD;
      tabulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;
