      Background: This randomized controlled clinical study of split-mouth aimed to compare&#xD;
      non-pedicled buccal fat pad graft (BFPG) with subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) in&#xD;
      the treatment of Miller Class I or II gingival recessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Twelve patients with Miller Class I or II (≥ 2 mm) bilateral recessions in maxillary&#xD;
      premolars or canines were selected. The recessions were randomly assigned to receive SCTG&#xD;
      (Control Group) or BFPG (Test Group). The clinical parameters of Gingival Index (GI), Plaque&#xD;
      Index (PI), Probing Depth (PD), Gingival Recession (GR), Clinical Attachment Level (CAL),&#xD;
      Width of Keratinized Tissue (WKT), Thickness of Keratinized Tissue (TKT) and Gingival Margin&#xD;
      to the Acrylic Guide (GM-AG) were evaluated at baseline, and in the postoperative periods of&#xD;
      1, 3, and 6 months. The percentage of root coverage was also evaluated. Data were submitted&#xD;
      to repeated measures ANOVA, Bonferroni method and t-test (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;

      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population This paper aims to report a randomized controlled clinical study of&#xD;
      split-mouth. 12 patients were selected, 8 women and 4 men, aged between 21 and 65 (mean age&#xD;
      41 ± 11.9 years). They were informed about the risks and benefits of this clinical&#xD;
      investigation as well as associated procedures, and signed a free and informed consent form.&#xD;
      This study was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of Positivo University&#xD;
      (083/2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for the selection of patients were: 1) patients with Miller Class I or&#xD;
      II gingival recessions located bilaterally in the vestibular surface of upper premolars or&#xD;
      canines ≥ to 2 mm; 2) patients who had recessions with some differences between the right and&#xD;
      the left sides ≤ to 3 mm; 3) non-smokers; 4) non-pregnant patients; 5) systemically healthy&#xD;
      patients; 6) periodontally healthy patients with no contraindications for periodontal&#xD;
      surgery; 7) patients who did not take any kind of medicine that could interfere with the&#xD;
      health of gingival and periodontal tissue; 8) teeth with probing depth (PD) &lt;3 mm and without&#xD;
      bleeding on probing (BOP); 9) teeth with no caries or restorations in the cervical region;&#xD;
      and 10) region that had not been undergone any periodontal surgery before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial therapy The patients underwent a basic periodontal treatment including scaling, root&#xD;
      planing, tooth polishing and oral hygiene instructions as required. Additionally, all&#xD;
      patients were included in a pre-treatment program in order to eliminate possible etiological&#xD;
      factors related to gingival recession. Patients were instructed to perform a non-traumatic&#xD;
      brushing technique by using a toothbrush with soft bristles. The surgical procedure was&#xD;
      performed only in patients who had adequate plaque control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Parameters After 30 days of initial therapy, the clinical parameters were recorded&#xD;
      by a single calibrated operator with professional experience in periodontics, at the&#xD;
      beginning (baseline), and in the postoperative periods of 1, 3, and 6 months respectively.&#xD;
      The periodontal probe used was North Carolina (UNC-15, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, an acrylic resin guide was made directly in the mouth of each patient and in&#xD;
      each experimental tooth. A reference point (slot) was created in the most central vestibular&#xD;
      portion of the guide in order to obtain a fixed reproduction of the periodontal probe&#xD;
      position so that the measures of the clinical parameters could be standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical parameters evaluated were: Gingival Index (GI)16; Plaque Index (PI)17; Probing&#xD;
      Depth (PD) - measure from the gingival margin (GM) up to the bottom of the gingival sulcus;&#xD;
      Gingival Recession (GR) - measure from the Cemento-Enamel Junction (CEJ) up to the GM;&#xD;
      Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) - measure from the CEJ up to the bottom of the gingival&#xD;
      sulcus; Width of Keratinized Tissue (WKT) - measure from the Mucogingival Junction (MGJ) up&#xD;
      to the GM; Thickness of Keratinized Tissue (TKT) - measure performed with the aid of a North&#xD;
      Carolina periodontal probe (UNC-15, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) perpendicularly placed along&#xD;
      the tooth axis in the most central portion of the keratinized tissue, between the GM and the&#xD;
      MGJ. The probe was slightly pressured, under local anesthetic, towards the adjacent hard&#xD;
      tissue. Then, the measure in millimeters was recorded and the last mean calculated referred&#xD;
      to the Gingival Margin to the Acrylic Guide (GM-AG) - measure performed from the GM up to the&#xD;
      most coronal point of the acrylic resin guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedure All surgical procedures were performed by the same operator, experienced&#xD;
      and specialist in Periodontics. The bilateral gingival recessions were randomly assigned by&#xD;
      lot (by a flip of coins) for both the side that received the SCTG (Control Group - C) and the&#xD;
      side that received the BFPG (Test Group - T). The same operator performed both surgeries on&#xD;
      the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the surgical procedure, extra intra-oral antisepsis was performed with 0.12%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine digluconate. The clinical parameters GI and PI were evaluated. Then, measures&#xD;
      of the clinical parameters PD, GR, CAL, WKT and GM-AG were performed with the aid of an&#xD;
      acrylic guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of the recipient site After local infiltration anesthetic (mepivacaine HCL 2% +&#xD;
      epinephrine 1:100,000) at the bottom of the vestibule in the region of the upper canine or&#xD;
      upper premolar teeth, the measure TKT was performed. Then, an intrasulcular incision was made&#xD;
      with a scalpel blade no 15c from the distal side of the upper canine tooth or the premolar&#xD;
      tooth towards their mesial side, with great care so that the interdental papillae could be&#xD;
      preserved. After that, two divergent vertical releasing incisions were made towards the&#xD;
      bottom of the vestibule. A partial-thickness flap was raised releasing all muscle fibers so&#xD;
      that the flap could be loose to be slid coronally. The roots were gently debrided and&#xD;
      flattened with Gracey curettes 5-6 (Hu-Friedy - USA), and the area was rinsed with sterile&#xD;
      saline solution for the total removal of dentine debris. Then, with the aid of an acrylic&#xD;
      guide, the measure of the most coronal portion of the recipient site to the acrylic guide&#xD;
      (CPRS-AG) was performed. The flap had to be raised so that the measure of the most coronal&#xD;
      portion of bone tissue over the root to the acrylic guide could be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard surgical procedure was to start on the patient's right side regardless of the&#xD;
      group that would undergo surgery, Group C or Group T. The preparation of the recipient site&#xD;
      was conducted the same way for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of the donor site In order to obtain connective tissue graft, the patient was&#xD;
      given infiltration anesthetic into the hard palate, on the same side of the recipient site&#xD;
      randomly chosen by lot to receive the SCTG. The removal of the connective tissue was&#xD;
      performed, followed by an L-shaped incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the graft was harvested, it was immediately positioned onto the recipient site at the&#xD;
      level of the CEJ, and fixed through simple sutures in the mesial and distal sides, with a&#xD;
      V-shaped compressive suture (Fig. 1A), from the periosteum to the palatine region of the&#xD;
      tooth with absorbable suture thread. After the graft was sutured with the aid of an acrylic&#xD;
      guide, the following measures were performed: 1) the measure of the most coronal portion of&#xD;
      the graft to the acrylic guide (CPG-AG), and 2) the apico-coronal height of the graft (ACHG).&#xD;
      The height of the graft ranged from 6.5 to 8.9 mm for all 12 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The flap was positioned coronally in order to cover the connective tissue graft as a whole.&#xD;
      Suspensory and simple sutures were made in the releasing incisions with silk thread (Fig.&#xD;
      1B). After the sutures were finished, the measure of the most coronal position of the flap to&#xD;
      the acrylic guide (CPF-AG) was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to harvest BFPG (Bichat's Ball), a terminal infiltration anesthetic was injected&#xD;
      into the region of the upper first and second molars, on the same side of the recipient site&#xD;
      that would receive BFPG. A horizontal incision measuring 1.5 cm was made with a blade no.15&#xD;
      at the bottom of the vestibule, in the region of the teeth 16 and 17 or 26 and 27, depending&#xD;
      on which side the surgery would be performed in accordance with the random choice established&#xD;
      by lot for the Test Group. A curved hemostat was used to divulse the muscles in the spot and&#xD;
      to expose the adipose tissue. The Bichat's Ball was exposed as soon as the muscles were&#xD;
      divulsed in the spot (Fig. 2A). Then, a small portion of adipose tissue (1.5 cm x 1.5 cm) was&#xD;
      removed with the aid of Goldman Fox scissors. After this procedure, the patient's cheek was&#xD;
      compressed in order for the wound edges to close, joining the tissue. The donor site was&#xD;
      immediately sutured with silk thread 4.0 (Ethicon, Johnson &amp; Johnson A.G., Brazil) through&#xD;
      simple stitches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BFPG was placed onto the recipient site at the level of the CEJ and fixed through&#xD;
      &quot;X&quot;-shaped sutures over the graft (Fig. 2B) with absorbable suture thread (Vicryl 5-0). The&#xD;
      same trans-surgical measures that had been performed in the Control Group were also performed&#xD;
      in the Test Group. The height of the graft ranged from 7.70 to 10.3 mm for all 12 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The flap was positioned coronally in order to cover the BFPG as a whole. Suspensory and&#xD;
      simple sutures were made in the releasing incisions (Fig. 2C). After the sutures were&#xD;
      finished, the measure of the most coronal position of the flap to the acrylic guide (CPF-AG)&#xD;
      was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Protocol The patients were given postoperative instructions, such as: ice&#xD;
      compress on the surgical site during the first 04 hours; liquid and/or soft diet for 3 days;&#xD;
      the teeth in the surgical region should not be brushed; and the mouth should be rinsed with a&#xD;
      mouthwash containing 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate during 1 minute, every 12 hours for 14&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative medications prescribed were: Amoxicillin 500 mg every 8 hours for 7 days or&#xD;
      Clindamycin 300 mg every 8 hours for 7 days to patients allergic to penicillin, and Ibuprofen&#xD;
      + arginine 600 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. The sutures were removed 14 days after surgery.&#xD;
      After this period, the patients were recommended to gently brush their teeth with a&#xD;
      soft-bristle toothbrush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were included in a monthly program of professional tooth cleaning and oral&#xD;
      hygiene instructions, starting on the 30th day until the 180th day after the surgical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Repeated Measures ANOVA associated with the Bonferroni method were used&#xD;
      to detect inter- and intra-group differences for the clinical parameters PD, GR, CAL, WKT,&#xD;
      TKT, and GM-AG. The t-test was used to detect inter-group differences versus time, for the&#xD;
      clinical parameters PD, GR, CAL, WKT, TKT, and GM-AG. For the parameters CPRS-AG, CPG-AG,&#xD;
      ACHG, and CPF-AG only the t-test was used. The level of significance was 5% for all&#xD;
      statistical comparisons. All analyses were made with the aid of the software SPSS Statistics&#xD;
      18.&#xD;
