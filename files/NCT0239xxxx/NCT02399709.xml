  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco smoking is the number one preventable cause of disease worldwide. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      there are few smoking cessation agents and their effectiveness has been shown to be&#xD;
      relatively limited and is associated with potential unwanted effects. Therefore, the&#xD;
      discovery of new medications that can facilitate abstinence and reduce relapse to cigarette&#xD;
      use represents a pressing necessity. In the attempt to find molecules that could reduce&#xD;
      drug-seeking behavior, we discovered that simvastatin reduces cocaine and nicotine, but not&#xD;
      food, seeking behavior in rats. This discovery of a new therapeutic application for an&#xD;
      already marketed class of compounds may greatly facilitate the translation from preclinical&#xD;
      to clinical setting. In this project, we aim at investigating whether simvastatin is an&#xD;
      effective smoking cessation agent in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a multicenter, randomized, double blind 2 parallel groups, clinical trial&#xD;
      with an intention-to-treat analysis. Smokers will randomly be assigned to receive simvastatin&#xD;
      or placebo for 3 months. 200 smokers (100 receiving simvastatin and 100 receiving placebo)&#xD;
      will be recruited through already established networks of general practitioners. The primary&#xD;
      outcome of the efficacy of simvastatin will be the rate of smoking abstinence during the last&#xD;
      month of the 3-month treatment period, defined as reported continuous abstinence from smoking&#xD;
      and confirmed by expired air carbon monoxide and urinary cotinine concentration. The last&#xD;
      assessment will be done 6 months after the predefined quit date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this proof-of-concept study may open new perspectives in the treatment of&#xD;
      tobacco use and dependance.&#xD;
