  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In surgical units negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is often used to facilitate wound&#xD;
      healing. The recommended frequency of change every third to fourth day causes an immense&#xD;
      workload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of an additional polymeric membrane&#xD;
      interface dressing (PolyMem® WIC) as primary wound contact layer in NPWT in comparison to&#xD;
      NPWT alone on the number of required dressing changes until wound closure as the primary&#xD;
      endpoint. Secondary endpoints are: time to heal and wound associated pain.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of chronic wounds requires time and resources. Optimized resource utilization&#xD;
      in treatment of chronic wounds is of medical and economic interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is widely used for the treatment of chronic wounds and&#xD;
      surgical site infections. NPWT is indicated for the treatment of diabetic leg ulcers, lower&#xD;
      leg ulcers as a result of peripheral arterial occlusive disease, pressure wounds, surgical&#xD;
      incisional wounds, traumatic wounds, burns, infected wounds, necrotizing fasciitis, infected&#xD;
      sternal wounds, and after skin grafting to facilitate healing. The polyurethane foam of the&#xD;
      NPWT is directly applied to a wound bed and sealed with a transparent occlusive film prior to&#xD;
      application of a negative pressure at 75 to 125 mmHg continuous suction. Prolonged placement&#xD;
      of the foam in the wound bed results in tissue ingrowth. Then, removal of the foam becomes&#xD;
      increasingly difficult and is often accompanied by pain, bleeding, and traumatization of the&#xD;
      healing wound. Therefore, various efforts have been made to decrease wound tissue damage and&#xD;
      pain during dressing change, including the use of different primary wound fillers,&#xD;
      administration of topical analgesics or placement of various interface dressings. Yet, the&#xD;
      effect of a non-adherent polymeric interface dressing on wearing time and frequency of&#xD;
      dressing changes has not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty consecutive patients with chronic wounds of lower extremities or surgical site&#xD;
      infections after revascularization are randomly allocated to either treatment with&#xD;
      conventional negative pressure wound therapy (VAC arm, control) or negative pressure wound&#xD;
      therapy with additional polymeric interface dressing (VAC + PolyMem® WIC, WICVAC, study arm).&#xD;
      The polymeric membrane dressing is applied as direct wound contact layer, covered with the&#xD;
      polyurethane foam dressing of the NPWT. The pink polymeric membrane dressing, which is left&#xD;
      partially visible at the margin of the wound bed under the black polyurethane foam, serves as&#xD;
      color indicator for the time-point of dressing change upon loss of the pink color. Patient&#xD;
      characteristics, wound size at each dressing change, pain during treatment and the number of&#xD;
      dressing changes needed until wound closure are documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Sample size estimation was based on detecting a 20% difference in the&#xD;
      number of dressing changes in favor of the WICVAC - study arm, with a type I error of 0.05&#xD;
      and type II error of 0.2. At least 23 patients are required for each study arm. Data are&#xD;
      analyzed for statistical distribution. Due to skewed data distribution Mann-Whitney-U tests&#xD;
      are applied for assessment of differences in primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;
