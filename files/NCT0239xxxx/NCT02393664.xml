  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan and worldwide. With the&#xD;
      advancement of thoracoscopic technique, thoracoscopic surgery has emerged as a reasonable&#xD;
      option for the management of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally,&#xD;
      current lung cancer screening policy recruits increasing number of candidates requiring&#xD;
      thoracoscopic lung resections because of lung nodules/tumors. Traditionally, intubated&#xD;
      general anesthesia with one-lung ventilation using a double-lumen endotracheal tube or an&#xD;
      endobronchial blocker has been considered mandatory in thoracoscopic surgery. However,&#xD;
      adverse effects of intubated general anesthesia are not negligible. Recently, a nonintubated&#xD;
      thoracoscopic technique has developed to reduce the adverse effects of intubated general&#xD;
      anesthesia with encouraging results. Nonetheless, the role of nonintubated technique in&#xD;
      thoracoscopic lung resection surgery in quality of postoperative recovery in not clear. As an&#xD;
      enhanced recovery is the major goal of modern minimally invasive surgery, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that nonintubated thoracoscopic technique can facilitate and improve the recovery&#xD;
      quality after surgery. To this end, the investigators will recruit 300 patients in subgroups&#xD;
      including patients undergoing segmentectomy/lobectomy, wedge resection and geriatric patients&#xD;
      in this two-year project. Patients will be randomly allocated in nonintubated and intubated&#xD;
      groups and quality of recovery of all patients will be evaluated according the protocol of&#xD;
      Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale. In the meantime, the preoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      cytokines will be compared between the groups as well as patients with different recovery&#xD;
      scales.&#xD;

      Treatment protocol of nonintubated technique and intubated general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonintubated technique: All nonintubated patients will be premedicated with 50 to 100 μg of&#xD;
      fentanyl intravenously and will be continuously monitored electrocardiographically, along&#xD;
      with pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and urine output.&#xD;
      End-tidal carbon dioxide will be continuously monitored by insertion of a detector into one&#xD;
      nostril. A bispectral index sensor (BIS Quatro, Aspect Medical System, Norwood, MA, USA) will&#xD;
      be applied to the forehead of each patient to monitor the level of consciousness.&#xD;
      Additionally, a non-invasive near-infrared cerebral regional oximetry (INVOSTM 5100BINVOS&#xD;
      5100B Cerebral Oximeter, Somanetics Corporation, Troy, MI, USA) will be applied to monitor&#xD;
      the regional oxygen saturation of the brains. The patients will be sedated with intravenous&#xD;
      propofol (Fresol 1%, Fresenius Kabi GmbH, Graz, Austria) using a target-controlled infusion&#xD;
      method (Injectomat® TIVA Agilia, Fresenius Kabi GmbH, Graz, Austria). The level of sedation&#xD;
      will be set to achieve a bispectral index value between 40 and 60, and incremental&#xD;
      intravenous injections of fentanyl 25 μg will be given to maintain a respiratory rate between&#xD;
      12 and 20 breaths/min. Oxygen will be supplied through a ventilation mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional intubated general anesthesia: All intubated patients will be monitored as for&#xD;
      nonintubated patients. Anesthesia will be induced by intravenous administration of propofol&#xD;
      (1 - 2.5 mg/kg), fentanyl (100 μg), and rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) and will be maintained by&#xD;
      sevoflurane and rocuronium at the discretion of anesthesiologist and bispectral index&#xD;
      monitoring. A double-lumen endotracheal tube or endobronchial blocker will be inserted for&#xD;
      one lung isolation during the procedure and a bronchoscopy will be used to facilitate the&#xD;
      correct isolation of targeted bronchus at the discretion of anesthesiologist. The dependent&#xD;
      lung will be ventilated using protective lung strategy with a tidal volume of 6 to 8 mL/kg, a&#xD;
      respiratory rate of 10 to 16 breaths/min to maintain the arterial carbon dioxide tension at&#xD;
      35 to 45 mmHg. After the operation, the patients will be extubated in the operating room or&#xD;
      remain intubated and be sent to the intensive care unit at the discretion of&#xD;
      anesthesiologist.&#xD;
