      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of treatment with Platelet-rich plasma&#xD;
      on Androgenetic alopecia (compared with placebo), between six months and baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a non-scarring patterned alopecia, multifactorial and a&#xD;
      genetic determined skin condition. This pathology is one of the most common forms of&#xD;
      progressive hair loss. It's an increasingly frequent complaint of dermatology clinic patients&#xD;
      and has a high impact psychologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset of AGA is gradual and when this pathology progresses, the anagen phase shortens and&#xD;
      the telogen phase remains constant. As a result, more hairs are in the telogen phase, and the&#xD;
      patient may notice an increase in hair shedding. This area varies from patient to patient and&#xD;
      is usually most marked at the vertex in men while women with androgenetic alopecia generally&#xD;
      lose hair diffusely over the crown. The incidence and prevalence of AGA increases with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical minoxidil and oral finasteride are the gold standard therapies for AGA and the only&#xD;
      two drugs currently that have US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications for&#xD;
      the treatment of androgenetic alopecia. Minoxidil and finasteride are known to be effective&#xD;
      medical treatments in AGA, especially during the initial grades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRP is a plasma concentrate reaped from the patient's whole blood that comprises&#xD;
      predominantly platelets. Numerous growth factors (GFs) are present within platelet α&#xD;
      granules. Some of the most important of these include platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF),&#xD;
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor (EGF), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF). This GFs stimulate cell&#xD;
      proliferation and differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRP was identified as having a beneficial effect on bone grafting with applications in oral&#xD;
      and maxillofacial surgery, orthopedic and cardiac surgery. More recently, increasing interest&#xD;
      is seen in the application of PRP in dermatology, for example, tissue regeneration, wound&#xD;
      healing such and fat grafting. It has also been shown to promote hair survival and growth,&#xD;
      both in vitro and in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The production of autologous PRP involves extraction of a specific volume of the patient's&#xD;
      whole blood, which is then placed in an automated centrifuge to separate the layers of whole&#xD;
      blood by their specific weight into 3 separate layers: (1) platelet-poor plasma, (2)&#xD;
      platelet-rich plasma and (3) red blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were divided into two groups (A and B): group A received treatment with PRP on&#xD;
      the right half-head and the placebo on the left half-head, whereas group B received treatment&#xD;
      with PRP on the left half-head and the placebo on the right half-head.&#xD;

    <description>PRP/Saline&#xD;
Briefly, for PRP preparation, approximately 18 mL of blood from each patient is drawn into a tube containing 3,8 % sodium citrate. The tubes were centrifuged at 450 g for 8 minutes, resulting in three basic layers: an erythrocyte layer at the bottom of the tube, a PRP layer in the middle, and a platelet-poor plasma (PPP) layer at the top of the tube. After removing the platelet-poor plasma (PPP) layer, the PRP is obtained, activated with 10 % calcium chloride.&#xD;
In the same patient, PRP will be injected to half-head and in the other half-head will be injected with saline solution (placebo).&#xD;
This study includes 4 visits: 3 visits (with 1-month interval) and 1 visit of follow-up (month 6).</description>
