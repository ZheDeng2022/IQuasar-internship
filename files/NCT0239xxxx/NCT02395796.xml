  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is highly effective for labor pain relief and is widely chosen by pregnant&#xD;
      patients. However, placement of the epidural needle can be challenging in pregnant patients&#xD;
      due to lax tissue ligaments and edema so that the traditional loss of resistance method (LOR)&#xD;
      used to find the space may be subtle leading to retries which may delay onset of analgesia as&#xD;
      well as increase the risk of complications. The ability to transduce a pulsatile pressure&#xD;
      waveform from epidural needles placed in non-laboring patients correlates highly with&#xD;
      successful placement of the epidural needle. We wish to evaluate the efficacy of obtaining a&#xD;
      pulsatile pressure waveform with correct epidural needle placement in laboring women.&#xD;

      Patients requesting epidural labor analgesia will be eligible for recruitment. After written&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained, placement of monitors and aseptic technique, the 17G epidural&#xD;
      needle will be placed using the loss of resistance (LOR) technique to air or saline at the&#xD;
      lumbar level chosen by the anesthesiologist. When LOR occurs, the needle will then be filled&#xD;
      with 2 mL NaCl 0.9% from that syringe and the pressure monitoring accessory will be connected&#xD;
      to the needle. The second investigator will then connect the high pressure tubing to the&#xD;
      acessory without touching it, and the pressure will be zeroed at level of the needle&#xD;
      insertion. Pressure will then be transduced and the waveform, recorded. An epidural catheter&#xD;
      (SIMS Portex) will then be passed through the needle and advanced 5 cm beyond the tip of the&#xD;
      epidural needle. After securing the epidural catheter in place, the patient will be placed on&#xD;
      the lateral position. The catheter will then be filled NaCl 0.9% from a syringe and a&#xD;
      high-pressure tubing extension leveled at the spine level will be connected to the catheter&#xD;
      and the pressure will be transduced and recorded. Data recorded will include 2 parameters: 1)&#xD;
      The presence or absence of a pulsatile waveform, and 2) The actual pressure read at the&#xD;
      epidural space, in mmHg. Those readings will be obtained in 2 distinct moments: at a &quot; rest&quot;&#xD;
      state, meaning during an interval between contractions, and at an &quot;active&quot; state, during the&#xD;
      first contraction after the epidural catheter is placed. A test dose of 3 mL of 2% lidocaine&#xD;
      with epinephrine1:200.000 will then be given to exclude potential spinal or intravascular&#xD;
      injection. After 3 minutes, a loading dose of 10mL of 0,125% bupivacaine will be given for&#xD;
      labor analgesia and the presence or absence of a bilateral sensorial block at T10 or higher&#xD;
      at 30 min will be assessed.&#xD;
