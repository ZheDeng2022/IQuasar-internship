      Lung Health research study (Development of a predictive model) - To determine whether the&#xD;
      I-neb breathing parameters (flow data) can act as a surrogate marker for lung function&#xD;
      (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second FEV1) hence allow early detection of decline in lung&#xD;
      function in cystic fibrosis patients.&#xD;

      1. Initial phase of the study will involve retrospective data collection, to review 36&#xD;
           months of retrospectively collected clinic time data (i.e. total length of appointment,&#xD;
           length of time seen by each discipline, waiting time). This data is routinely collected&#xD;
           and displayed in run charts. It will be used to allow an understanding of the baseline&#xD;
           variability in a standard un-streamed clinic and whether distinct patient&#xD;
           sub-populations can be identified i.e. red (complicated and time consuming) and green&#xD;
           (simple and rapidly processed) streams. These data may suggest a starting structure for&#xD;
           clinic slot lengths and provide a baseline comparator for the subsequent bespoke clinic&#xD;
           structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the prospective intervention phase, To recruit 50 participants to take part in the&#xD;
           bespoke clinics using a home spirometer, weighing scales, and Bluetooth enabled I-neb&#xD;
           providing breathing parameter and adherence data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants' baseline routinely collected demographics (age, gender, genotype) and&#xD;
           clinical data (including comorbidities, number of intravenous antibiotic days and clinic&#xD;
           attendances per year, and treatment regime) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At baseline participants will be asked to complete the Patient Activation Measure&#xD;
           questionnaire. This patient-reported measure is a powerful reliable tool which has been&#xD;
           validated in the UK24. It involves 13 quick questions to identify a patient's knowledge,&#xD;
           skills, and confidence in managing their own health and health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants will be asked to measure lung function and weight one week prior to clinic.&#xD;
           The I-neb adherence and flow data will be routinely captured and transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Prior to clinic when this data is collected participants will be asked the EQ-5D-5L as&#xD;
           before, if they require a repeat prescription, and whether there are any issues they&#xD;
           would like to focus on when they attend for their consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. This data will then be reviewed to determine which stream patients would be predicted to&#xD;
           need to require. i.e. adherence support, diagnostic, or stable brief review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Following review the standard clinic process will be analysed to see whether the&#xD;
           streaming would have been appropriate and if it could have potentially saved time and&#xD;
           resources.&#xD;

    <description>The study will develop a predictive model and conduct a parallel service improvement project. It therefore does not have a specific primary outcome measure. The predictive model will be attempting to identify if there is a correlation between the I-neb breathing parameters (i.e. inhalation time, rest time) and lung function (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second FEV1). The clinic streaming will attempt to identify if the preclinic data (lung function, weight, adherence) can predict the clinic needs of a patient.</description>
