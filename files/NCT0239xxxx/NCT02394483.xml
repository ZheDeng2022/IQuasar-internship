    <textblock>
      Double blind, placebo controlled, ascending single oral dose, sequential group study. Forty&#xD;
      subjects will complete the study in 5 cohorts (Groups A to E), each group consisting of 8&#xD;
      subjects. Each subject will be on study for approximately 6 weeks. Each subject will&#xD;
      participate in one treatment cohort only, residing at the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) from&#xD;
      Day -1 (the day before dosing) to Day 6 (120 hours post-dose). Each cohort will be dosed in a&#xD;
      leading edge design in which two subjects will receive study drug (1 active and 1 placebo) on&#xD;
      the first dosing day, and the last 6 will receive study drug (5 active and 1 placebo) on the&#xD;
      second dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will return for a post-study visit 8 to 10 days after the dose of study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts will be dosed at 2 weekly intervals. There will be a review of safety data, after the&#xD;
      first two subjects have been dosed and before dosing of the subsequent six subjects. There&#xD;
      will be a complete review of safety and pharmacokinetic data of each cohort prior to each&#xD;
      dose escalation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Male healthy subjects conforming to the selection criteria will be invited to take part in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit (Visit 1) After giving fully informed, written consent, subjects will attend&#xD;
      the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo screening within 28 days prior to the first dose administration. Prior&#xD;
      to the screening visit, subjects will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refrain from vigorous exercise for 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abstain from alcohol for 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will sign the consent form in the presence of a CRU physician prior to any&#xD;
           screening procedures being performed. The information recorded for all subjects,&#xD;
           regardless of their suitability for the study, will be retained and archived&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information and procedures will be recorded and performed as part of the&#xD;
      screening assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethnic origin, sex, age, height, weight, and BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs: supine blood pressure, supine pulse rate, and oral body temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting 12 lead ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine drugs of abuse screen, cotinine and breath alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting clinical laboratory and serology investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 28 days after screening, subjects will attend the clinic. Subjects will be admitted to&#xD;
      the research unit at approximately 13:00 hours in the afternoon the day before dosing (Day&#xD;
      -1; -19 hours pre-dose). Urine will be subjected to a screen for drugs of abuse and there&#xD;
      will be a breath test for alcohol and cotinine. Detection of any of these substances will&#xD;
      disqualify the subject from the study. A physical examination, check of inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, clinical laboratory evaluations, oral temperature and body weight will be&#xD;
      performed. Subjects will be asked whether they have experienced any adverse events or taken&#xD;
      any concomitant medication since their previous visit. Supper will be served starting at&#xD;
      19.30 hours and a snack at 21.00 hours, following which subjects will be fasting. Water will&#xD;
      be allowed ad libitum throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1, the total first urine void of the morning for each subject will be collected into a&#xD;
      polyethylene container and, from this, a sample will be taken for urinalysis and pre-dose /&#xD;
      baseline F901318 concentration. Within one hour before dosing commences (-1 hour), blood will&#xD;
      be drawn for laboratory safety assessments (haematology and clinical chemistry), and pre-dose&#xD;
      baseline F901318 and metabolites concentration. Supine and standing blood pressure and pulse&#xD;
      rate in triplicate, body temperature and a 12-lead ECG will be recorded. The subjects will&#xD;
      also be connected to continuous ECG recording from -1 hour until 12 hours after the start of&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked whether they have experienced any adverse events overnight. Any&#xD;
      concomitant medications will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Option 1: Subjects will then be dosed. This will be oral ingestion of a liquid formulation&#xD;
      followed by 250 mL of water. Subjects will be dosed with regular (at least 5 minute)&#xD;
      intervals between each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial dosing, the following measurements and observations will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Blood samples for analysis of F901318 plasma concentration will be drawn at 15, 30, 45, 60,&#xD;
      75, 90, 120 minutes, then 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours following&#xD;
      dosing. Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be analysed and reviewed before each dose&#xD;
      escalation. After the first dose administration, the timing of each blood sample may if&#xD;
      necessary be adjusted within the 120-hour period for the subsequent dose escalation. The&#xD;
      basis for this decision will depend upon the pharmacokinetic profiles obtained from the&#xD;
      preceding group of subjects. All changes will be documented in a file note. The number of&#xD;
      samples or volume of blood drawn must not be increased without prior approval of the relevant&#xD;
      ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Option 2: If it appears from pharmacokinetic measurements that oral absorption is extremely&#xD;
      rapid, leading to a high Cmax with a relatively low AUC0-12, the dose may be split in half,&#xD;
      with the second half being given 4-8 hours after the first. Under these circumstances, the&#xD;
      blood sampling schedule would be decided prior to dosing but would not exceed 26 samples over&#xD;
      a 120 hour period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Both Options:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples for analysis of metabolites will be drawn 4 and 8 hours after initial&#xD;
           dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be collected for safety measurements (haematology and clinical chemistry) 24,&#xD;
           48 and 72 hours post initial dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete urine collections for analysis of F901318 urine concentration will be made for&#xD;
           the following intervals in relation to dosing: 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-16, 16-24, 24-48,&#xD;
           48-72, 72-96 and 96-120 hours after initial dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supine and standing pulse rate and blood pressure; and body temperature (vital signs)&#xD;
           will be recorded 30, 60 and 120 minutes, 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours after initial dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained 1, 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours after initial dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The continuous ECG recording will cease 12 hours after initial dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spontaneously reported adverse events will be noted throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A urine sample will be taken for urinalysis 24, 48 hours and 72 hours after initial&#xD;
           dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lunch will be served approximately 4 hours after initial dosing but after all the 4 hour&#xD;
           observations and blood sampling have been completed and a main meal will be served&#xD;
           approximately 8 hours and a snack approximately 12 hours after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may leave the Research Unit on Day 6, unless they have experienced adverse events&#xD;
      that, in the opinion of the Investigator, warrant further observation and/or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed up 8-10 days after dosing with a post-study visit.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Subjects with, or with a history of, any clinically significant neurological,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, respiratory, metabolic,&#xD;

             surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody, or who have a positive result to the&#xD;
             test for HIV antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects who have an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, increases the risk of participating in the study, such as QTcB interval&#xD;
             &gt;430 msec, 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block, complete left bundle branch&#xD;
             block, complete right bundle branch block or Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, defined&#xD;
             as PR&lt;110 msec, confirmed by a repeat ECG.&#xD;
