  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One well-established cognitive theory propose a divide between social and non-social (i.e.,&#xD;
      cognitive) systems. However, recent work suggests that traditionally social systems can be&#xD;
      utilized to enhance cognitive performance. In this study the investigators aim to explore&#xD;
      this cooperation between oft-competing systems by instructing participants to learn&#xD;
      information because they will be subsequently tested (the nonsocial learning-for-testing&#xD;
      condition), or because they will be teaching the information to someone else (the prosocial&#xD;
      learning-for-teaching condition). This latter condition relies upon the mentalizing system,&#xD;
      which is used to contemplate another person's mental state, rather than traditional memory&#xD;
      systems. This implies that the mnemonic powers of the mentalizing system can be leveraged in&#xD;
      the learning of a broad array of non-social topics. Furthermore, there is also an emerging&#xD;
      literature on the role of oxytocin, a neuropeptide naturally produced in the hypothalamus, in&#xD;
      memory that parallels the social/nonsocial split. Oxytocin may benefit the&#xD;
      learning-for-teaching group both in terms of enhancing initial social motivation and&#xD;
      efficient use of the mentalizing system and then also in terms of memory consolidation for&#xD;
      this information learning under socially-motivated conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to replicate the basic learning-for-teaching effect such that those&#xD;
      in the teaching condition will remember more than those in the testing conditions. They also&#xD;
      expect an interaction between oxytocin administration and learning condition such that&#xD;
      oxytocin administration should enhance learning for socially-motivated learning exclusively.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in brain neural activity, observed by fMRI, in response to a reading comprehension task</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 40-90 minutes post administration</time_frame>
    <description>Whole brain and region of interest (ROI) regression analysis will be used to compare the neural activity of participants in the tutor/memorizer and oxytocin/placebo groups. A design matrix will be created for each participant, modeling activity that is greater during reading comprehension compared with the grammar control passage. First level analyses will compare the response during the reading comprehension passages relative to the grammar control passages. Second level group analyses will compare the first level contrasts between the tutor vs. memorizer groups as well as the oxytocin vs. placebo groups. In regression analyses we will enter each participant's comprehension test score in the tutor and then memorizer condition as a regressor in a whole-brain and ROI analysis to determine which brain regions were more active during the encoding of the reading comprehension passage compared to the grammar control passage.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance on a memory test of reading comprehension as measured by percentage of questions answered correctly</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 40-90 minutes post administration</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy will be calculated for each participant by dividing the number of correct responses by the total number of questions. We will then conduct a between-subjects 2x2 ANOVA on the accuracy scores for the four groups of interest (i.e., oxytocin-tutor, oxytocin-memorizer, placebo-tutor, placebo-memorizer). A significance level of p&lt;.05 will be used to determine whether there are significant differences between the groups. We will examine whether there is a main effect of either factor (oxytocin vs. placebo, tutor vs. memorize) as well as an interaction between the factors of interest.</description>
