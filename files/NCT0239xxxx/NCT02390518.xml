    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose escalation and expansion trial. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation received during stereotactic radiosurgery&#xD;
      in patients with brain metastases who have never received radiation to the brain before.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with 1 to 5 brain metastases will be treated. Patients will be assigned to one of four cohorts based on the size of their brain lesions. For each patient, a single lesion will be treated at experimental dose level, other metastases (if present) will receive standard SRS doses.&#xD;
Dose Level 1 Dose Level 2 Dose Level 3 Dose Level 4 Cohort 1a and 1a Expansion (starting at Dose Level 3) Diameter: ≤ 10 mm Volume: ≤ 0.5236 cm3 26 Gy 28 Gy 30 Gy n/a Cohort 1b Diameter: 11-20 mm Volume: 0.5237-4.1888 cm3 26 Gy 28 Gy 30 Gy n/a Cohort 2 Diameter: 21-30 mm Volume: 4.1889-14.1372 cm3 20 Gy 22 Gy 24 Gy n/a Cohort 3 Diameter: 31-40 mm Volume: 14.1373-33.5103 cm3 17 Gy 19 Gy 21 Gy 23 Gy&#xD;
Dose Escalation A non-standard 5+4 design will be used for the dose escalation. For each cohort, an initial group of 5 patients will be accrued at dose level 1 and receive experimental treatment to one of their lesions.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically confirmed brain metastases by CT or MRI criteria. If there is evidence of&#xD;
             extra-cranial metastatic disease, it is preferable that the lesions be pathologically&#xD;
             confirmed (see section 4.2.5 for excluded histologies) and reviewed by a University of&#xD;
             Utah or Huntsman Cancer Hospital pathologist if the initial review was done at an&#xD;
             outside facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior brain surgery is allowed, although a lesion situated in the operative bed would&#xD;
             not be selected to receive an experimental dose of SRS treatment. SRS should be&#xD;
             delivered 4-6 weeks post-surgery if the patient had a craniotomy for resection of a&#xD;
             lesion. Enrollment of a patient with the goal of performing SRS outside of the 4-6&#xD;
             post-craniotomy window is at the PI's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have 1-5 untreated brain metastases total.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Equivalent tumor diameter ≤ 40 mm by CT or MRI measurement at the time of&#xD;
             consultation/screening (for each metastatic lesion present in the brain).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All metastatic lesions must be separated by a minimum of 3 cm as measured from the&#xD;
             peripheral edges of the lesions that are in closest proximity to one another. If&#xD;
             multiple lesions are present and are not all ≥ 3 cm away from each other, the patient&#xD;
             will be deemed ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic therapy is allowed, although appropriate washout is required for&#xD;
             patients who have been on BRAF inhibitors (at least 7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects currently on active systemic cancer therapy, the treating medical&#xD;
             oncologist should be consulted to ensure proper washout (if appropriate) periods prior&#xD;
             to SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed consent and have signed an approved consent form that&#xD;
             conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 10 days of&#xD;
             study enrollment and must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control while&#xD;
             receiving radiation and for 3 months after radiation. Women of non-childbearing&#xD;
             potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or have been&#xD;
             postmenopausal for &gt;1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are able to father a child must agree to use an acceptable method of birth&#xD;
             control while receiving radiation, and for 3 months after radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior whole/partial brain irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain lesions with an equivalent diameter of &gt; 40 mm in size on MRI imaging at the&#xD;
             time of consultation/screening for protocol eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lesions located in anatomic regions that are not amendable to SRS (e.g., optic nerve)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain lesions located in the brain stem.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographic or cytologic evidence of leptomeningeal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary lesion with radiosensitive histology that includes the following: small cell&#xD;
             carcinoma, germ cell tumors, lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with multiple lesions, which by size criteria would be enrolled in a cohort&#xD;
             which is full at the time of enrollment and the 12 weeks DLT period has not been&#xD;
             reached.&#xD;
