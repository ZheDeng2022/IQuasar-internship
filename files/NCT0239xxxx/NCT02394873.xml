  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety of ALLO-ASC-DFU for the treatment of deep&#xD;
      second-degree burn wound patients. ALLO-ASC-DFU is a hydrogel sheet containing allogenic&#xD;
      adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Adipose-derived stem cells release growth factors&#xD;
      such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which&#xD;
      can enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide a new option in&#xD;
      treating a burn.&#xD;
