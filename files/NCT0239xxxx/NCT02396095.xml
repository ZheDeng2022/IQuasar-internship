    <textblock>
      Women of reproductive age who seek to freeze eggs for future pregnancy attempts may be&#xD;
      eligible to participate in a study investigating pregnancies that result from frozen eggs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants follow standard fertility protocols to stimulate the growth of multiple egg&#xD;
      follicles. When the egg follicles are mature, the eggs will be removed under sedation,&#xD;
      examined by an embryologist under a microscope and the mature eggs will be immediately frozen&#xD;
      and kept frozen in tanks at Penn Fertility Care using the same methods of labeling and&#xD;
      quality assurance currently in place for frozen embryos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eggs will be thawed in the future when the participant wishes to attempt pregnancy and&#xD;
      fertilized by standard methods used during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). Resulting embryos&#xD;
      will be placed into the uterus by a procedure that will require approximately 15-30 minutes.&#xD;
      The number of embryos to be transferred will be dictated by standard clinical practice. After&#xD;
      embryo transfer, subjects will return for serum pregnancy tests at 14 days after the embryo&#xD;
      transfer. For those who are not pregnant, there will be no further participation in the&#xD;
      study. For those who do achieve pregnancy, trans-vaginal ultrasound will be performed at&#xD;
      approximately 6 weeks gestation and weekly thereafter until 8 weeks gestation at which time,&#xD;
      they will be referred to their general obstetrician for prenatal care. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to provide the study team with information about birthweight, height, length,&#xD;
      gestational age at delivery, complications at delivery, and infant number. This information&#xD;
      is routinely collected from patients undergoing conventional IVF in order to maintain quality&#xD;
      assurance as recommended by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. Information will&#xD;
      also be collected from the participant's medical records including physical characteristics,&#xD;
      medical and fertility history, semen analysis of the partner if appropriate, egg stimulation&#xD;
      characteristics including medications, days of stimulation, number of egg follicles, number&#xD;
      of mature and immature eggs retrieved, number of eggs frozen, number of eggs thawed, number&#xD;
      of embryos, disposition of embryos, pregnancy test results, number of pregnancies that&#xD;
      survived the first 12 weeks and prenatal screening tests.&#xD;
