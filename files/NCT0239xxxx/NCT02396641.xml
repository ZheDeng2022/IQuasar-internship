      The primary objective of this study is to formalize the delivery of BSC in advanced cancer&#xD;
      trials. The first aim (to develop expert-derived consensus statements regarding components of&#xD;
      supportive care in cancer clinical trials) and the second aim (to compare the extent to which&#xD;
      documentation of current supportive care delivery in trials compares to the consensus&#xD;
      statements) have been completed. The final aim of this study is to test the feasibility of&#xD;
      thorough documentation of BSC delivery. That work is proposed as the primary aim of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many cancer clinical trials are designed to evaluate the benefits of experimental anticancer&#xD;
      drugs against best supportive care (BSC); many drugs have been registered based on very&#xD;
      modest survival advantages when compared with BSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Universally across these studies, however, BSC control arms have not been standardized across&#xD;
      sites in the way that trialists strive to standardize other interventions in clinical trials;&#xD;
      are not consistent with contemporary palliative care practice; are not based on the extensive&#xD;
      best available evidence; and are not described in any detail in most cases and certainly not&#xD;
      sufficient detail to reproduce in subsequent studies. When reporting of BSC in trials is&#xD;
      incomplete, the resulting data have uncertain internal and external validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such poorly defined interventions and variation between sites is unacceptable for other&#xD;
      aspects of a clinical trial. Furthermore, a poorly delivered BSC arm might systematically&#xD;
      overestimate the performance of the intervention arm(s) in the study leading to poor decision&#xD;
      making by clinicians and funders. With mounting evidence that early use of&#xD;
      supportive/palliative care can improve patient outcomes, incomplete delivery of BSC might&#xD;
      deprive patients of considerable benefit, potentially in the setting of far less toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the CONSORT statement on reporting of clinical trials, our proposed study would&#xD;
      seek to generate consensus-based standards for BSC definition (allowing this to be updated as&#xD;
      new evidence becomes available), operationalize and measure outcomes in a clinical trial&#xD;
      setting. In doing so, we intend to demonstrate: 1) the feasibility of thorough documentation&#xD;
      of BSC, its delivery and measurement in a clinical trial; and 2) improved quality of life&#xD;
      over standardized BSC. Specifically in terms of PCEOL research objectives, this study will&#xD;
      develop an intervention designed to mitigate adverse physical and psychological symptoms and&#xD;
      outcomes that focus especially on the beginning of the end-of-life phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, single arm before and after consecutive cohort study of&#xD;
      oncologists and patients. Initially, individual and institutional best practice in terms of&#xD;
      supportive/palliative care delivery will be recorded across all sites (control period). Two&#xD;
      months into study initiation, patients will complete pre-intervention patient ESAS and&#xD;
      PNPC-sv assessment to measure their baseline care experience. At that point, all sites will&#xD;
      simultaneously switch to the behavioral modification intervention (BSC checklist;&#xD;
      experimental period). From that time forward, documentation of supportive care delivery will&#xD;
      be documented via the BSC checklist and medical record review. At month four, physician&#xD;
      acceptability and patient experience will be evaluated.&#xD;
