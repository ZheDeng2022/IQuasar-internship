    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well vaccine therapy works in reducing the&#xD;
      frequency of cytomegalovirus severe infections (events) in patients with hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Vaccines made from a peptide may help the&#xD;
      body build an effective immune response and may reduce cytomegalovirus events after donor&#xD;
      stem cell transplant.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if cytomegalovirus (CMV) peptide(Pep)vaccine(Vax) (CMVpp65-A*0201 peptide&#xD;
      vaccine) increases levels, function and kinetics of CMV-specific T cell immunity in&#xD;
      vaccinated compared to placebo treated human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A*0201 allogeneic CMV&#xD;
      positive hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients (HCT-R+). (Entire cohort) II. To&#xD;
      provide a preliminary evaluation of the incidence of CMV reactivation between day 56 and day&#xD;
      180 in patients who receive standard letermovir (Prevymis) prophylaxis (from day 14 through&#xD;
      day 100), comparable to the evaluation of an expansion cohort in a pilot study, or the&#xD;
      futility stage of a phase II trial. (Letermovir combination cohort) III. To determine if&#xD;
      CMVPepVax increases levels, function and kinetics of CMV-specific T cell immunity in&#xD;
      vaccinated HCT patients who receive standard Prevymis prophylaxis. (Letermovir combination&#xD;
      cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine, within the constraints of a pilot cohort, if CMVPepVax reduces the frequency&#xD;
      of CMV events alone or in combination with Prevymis defined as reactivation or CMV disease in&#xD;
      HLA A*0201 allogeneic HCT-R+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMVPepVax by assessing the following:&#xD;
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days post HCT, severe (grade 3-4) acute graft versus host&#xD;
      disease (GVHD) (aGVHD), and grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) (Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events [CTCAE] 4.0) probably or definitely related to the vaccination within 2 weeks&#xD;
      from each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize CMV reactivation and CMV disease in recipients of CMVPepVax compared to&#xD;
      placebo by assessing time-to viremia (defined as number of days from transplantation to the&#xD;
      date of &gt;= 500 CMV gc/mL), duration of viremia, recurrence of viremia, incidence of late CMV&#xD;
      viremia/disease (&gt; 100 and =&lt; 360 days post HCT), use of antiviral drugs (triggered by&#xD;
      clinically significant viremia), cumulative number of CMV specific antiviral treatment days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine whether vaccination induces adaptive natural killer (NK) cell population&#xD;
      changes, and increase in the highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the impact of CMVPepVax on CMV immune reconstitution in patients who undergo&#xD;
      treatment with antiviral agent Prevymis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore GVHD biomarkers and compare between the vaccine and placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To characterize CMV reactivation after day 180&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive CMVpp65-A*0201 peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on days 28 and 56&#xD;
      after HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive placebo SC on days 28 and 56 after HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to day 365 after HCT.&#xD;

    <description>Each randomized study subject will be followed according to the study calendar for the occurrence of CMV reactivation events, which are defined in terms of either viremia, low-level viremia treated with antivirals, or CMV disease. Both initial and recurrent events will be recorded, with patients considered at risk for recurrent events after completion of a full planned course of a full course of anti-viral therapy. Vaccine and placebo groups will be compared with regard to the hazard of CMV events, using the Anderson-Gill approach to repeated events.</description>
