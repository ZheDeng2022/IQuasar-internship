      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact on sexuality in women with a spinal cord&#xD;

      Multicentre, prospective study, aiming to assess the effect on sexuality of an information&#xD;
      and education program in women with spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be women hospitalized for initial rehabilitation, and will be included&#xD;
      two weeks before their first return to home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-demographic data, diagnosis and etiology, secondary conditions, treatment,&#xD;
      comorbidities and expectations towards rehabilitation care will be assessed at inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At M3 Patients will be randomized in either the intervention arm or the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the intervention arm will benefit from a standardised information and&#xD;
      education consultation on physiology of sexual response 6 months after their return home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the control arm will undergo the same follow-up but will only have the&#xD;
      usual unstructured and unformalized information provided by the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At M3, M6, M12 secondary conditions , sexual function index (FSFI), social integration (LHS),&#xD;
      treatment and expectations towards rehabilitation care will be assessed&#xD;
