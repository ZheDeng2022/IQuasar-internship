  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an acquired retinal pathology affecting the central&#xD;
      region of the retina responsible for discrimination between high spatial frequencies&#xD;
      (reading), colour vision and the central visual field. The loss of visual acuity which occurs&#xD;
      with the onset of AMD significantly affects patients' quality of life. In developed&#xD;
      countries, AMD is the leading cause of vision impairment for people aged over 50 years. Its&#xD;
      prevalence in Europe in people aged over 65 years is 3.3%. In France, around 2 million people&#xD;
      suffer from this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage of the disease it is known as age-related maculopathy (ARM). This early&#xD;
      form of the disease can develop into intermediate AMD (stage 3 of the AREDS classification)&#xD;
      and then advanced AMD (stage 4 AREDS), which can be atrophic or exudative. In cases of&#xD;
      exudative AMD, the intravitreal administration of anti-VEGF drugs can limit the disease's&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore vital to adopt a strategy to assess the stage of the disease and provide the&#xD;
      appropriate care management at the earliest possible stage. This is even more important for&#xD;
      patients with advanced AMD in one eye and intermediate AMD in the fellow eye, as the risk of&#xD;
      the fellow eye progressing to the advanced stage within 5 years is between 35% and 53%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microperimetry is a promising new diagnostic method which combines measurements of light&#xD;
      sensitivity, loss of fixation and the anatomy of the retina. It offers a new approach to the&#xD;
      functional assessment of retinal damage in patients with AMD, as it precisely correlates&#xD;
      anatomical and functional modifications by measuring the loss of sensitivity and macular&#xD;
      fixation. It has been shown that the more advanced the patient's AMD is, the further the&#xD;
      parameters measured by microperimetry are from the norm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to assess the MAIAâ„¢ as a means of screening for AMD progression in&#xD;
      patients with a high risk of progressing to a more advanced stage (patients presenting one&#xD;
      eye with advanced AMD and a fellow eye with stage 3 AMD according to the AREDS&#xD;
      classification). The research hypothesis for our proposed study is that the parameters&#xD;
      measured using microperimetry will already show abnormal results in the study eye prior to&#xD;
      progressing to a more advanced stage of the disease. The use of these microperimetric&#xD;
      parameters as predictor of progression would therefore make it possible to screen eyes likely&#xD;
      to develop from intermediate to advanced AMD at an earlier stage, and subsequently provide&#xD;
      patients who need it with earlier follow-up, preventive treatment or adapted, personalized&#xD;
      rehabilitation as appropriate.&#xD;
