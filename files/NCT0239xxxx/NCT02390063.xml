  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial of a new treatment for prostate cancer that is a type of vaccine&#xD;
      that could be a new way to treat cancer. A vaccine that could alert the immune system to the&#xD;
      presence of cancer cells in the body may enable the immune system to target and kill those&#xD;
      cells effectively. This vaccine is intended to work by making the immune system kill cells&#xD;
      that have a special protein (called 5T4) that is present on the surface of cancer cells. The&#xD;
      vaccine is made up of two recombinant viruses (&quot;ChAdOx1&quot; and &quot;MVA&quot;) that have been designed&#xD;
      to produce the 5T4 protein and have been modified so that they are weakened and cannot&#xD;
      reproduce themselves within the body like normal viruses. Once injected into the body, these&#xD;
      viruses make the 5T4 protein and help the body's immune system to learn to target this&#xD;
      protein and destroy cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a first-in-human study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      ChAdOx1.5T4-MVA.5T4 vaccination regime. It is evaluated in neo-adjuvant setting in low and&#xD;
      intermediate risk localised prostate cancer patients who have either decided to have their&#xD;
      prostate removed or are stable on active surveillance.&#xD;
