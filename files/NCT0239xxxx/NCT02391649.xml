  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of a problem-solving&#xD;
      based bibliotherapy program (PSBBP) for Chinese family caregivers in psychotic disorders (not&#xD;
      more than 5 years onset). A repeated-measures, three-group design will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      and compare the effects between two treatment groups(PSBBP and psycho-education group) and&#xD;
      routine outpatient service and family support (control group) for 198 randomly selected&#xD;
      family caregivers of outpatients with psychotic disorders over a 24-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the 3-arm trial to be conducted, a pilot parallel-group randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      with a similar study design to the later three-arm randomised controlled trial (Phase 2) will&#xD;
      be conducted at one psychiatric outpatient clinic in Hong Kong. Receiving an additional&#xD;
      funding from local government, another pilot two-arm trial will also be conducted for family&#xD;
      caregivers of people with first-episode psychosis in the community to support and inform the&#xD;
      3-arm randomised controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family caregivers of people with psychotic disorders are confronted by a various physical,&#xD;
      psychosocial and financial hardships. This can adversely affect family members' caregiving&#xD;
      experiences, psychological distress, general well-being, and family relationships or&#xD;
      emotional involvement, which in turn may contribute to a greater risk of patient relapse and&#xD;
      non-recovery. While family psycho-education and mutual support groups are effective in&#xD;
      reducing caregivers' burden of care, these approaches usually require regular meetings and&#xD;
      encounter difficulties in extensive training of group leaders/facilitators and engaging&#xD;
      participants to actively share their caregiving experiences due to time inconvenience and&#xD;
      fear/inability of expression of feelings. By virtue of the above, an alternate model of&#xD;
      self-help program in book form named bibliotherapy, which is a guided reading and&#xD;
      self-practice program with problem-solving training facilitated by a psychiatric nurse, has&#xD;
      recently demonstrated evidences in clinical trials for families of depressive and psychotic&#xD;
      patients by the research team, and other researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 1, a pilot randomised controlled trial with repeated measures, parallel-group&#xD;
      (2-arm) design will be carried out at one psychiatric clinic. This pilot trial aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects between the treatment group (i.e., a problem-solving based self-learning&#xD;
      program) and routine outpatient service (control group) for 116 randomly selected family&#xD;
      caregivers of outpatients with recent-onset psychosis over a 6-month follow-up. The study&#xD;
      outcomes include the caregivers' burden of care, caregiving experiences, and problem-solving&#xD;
      abilities, and the patients' mental state, functioning, and re-hospitalization rates. They&#xD;
      will be measured at recruitment, one week, and 6 months following the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another pilot controlled trial will recruit 116 families of people with first-episode&#xD;
      psychosis attending follow-up at two regional psychiatric outpatient clinics in Hong Kong.&#xD;
      Participant will be randomly selected in equal proportion from the two clinics under study&#xD;
      and after baseline measures, the participants will be randomised to the treatment (i.e., the&#xD;
      Chinese version of the original manual of bibliotherapy program) or the routine care. They&#xD;
      will also be measured with the similar outcomes at the above pilot study at recruitment, one&#xD;
      week, 6 months, and 12 months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 2, a 3-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted to test the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the problem-solving based bibliotherapy program (PSBBP) for Chinese family caregivers in&#xD;
      early stage of psychotic disorders. A repeated-measures, three-group design will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate and compare the effects between two treatment groups (PSBBP and psycho-education&#xD;
      group) and routine outpatient service and family support (control group) for 198 randomly&#xD;
      selected family caregivers of outpatients with psychotic disorders over a 24-month follow-up.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes include caregivers' burden of care, caregiving experiences and coping and&#xD;
      social problem-solving skills using validated instruments. Secondary outcomes are patients'&#xD;
      mental state, functioning, perceived expressed emotion, and re-hospitalization rate. They&#xD;
      will be measured at recruitment, one week, and 12 and 24 months following the interventions.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the PSBBP participants will produce significantly better improvements&#xD;
      in caregivers' perceived burden, caregiving experience and coping and problem-solving skills&#xD;
      than those in psycho-education and control groups over 24-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group interviews will be conducted after the first post-test with 20 caregivers (10&#xD;
      participants per group) in both treatment groups. Their data will be content analyzed to&#xD;
      identify their perceived benefits, limitations and difficulties encountered and therapeutic&#xD;
      ingredients of the two programs.&#xD;
