    <textblock>
      In partnership with a multi-site, Los Angeles-area community clinic consortium, North East&#xD;
      Valley Health Corporation (NEVHC), the investigators will use telehealth to integrate&#xD;
      pediatric developmental, behavioral and mental health (DB/MH) services into primary care for&#xD;
      low-income, publicly insured children. During Project Year 1, the investigators used&#xD;
      qualitative methods to conduct and analyze interviews with parents, clinicians, and staff at&#xD;
      NEVHC to assess their perspectives on the delivery of child DB/MH services and on a potential&#xD;
      telehealth-based patient visit, coordination, and clinician education system for the&#xD;
      provision of DB/MH specialty care in primary care settings to children ages 5-12. This data&#xD;
      was used in a stakeholder-engaged process to customize a telehealth-based delivery system for&#xD;
      pediatric DB/MH services that can be integrated into primary care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Project Years 2-3, the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) to compare the customized telehealth-based patient visit, coordination, and&#xD;
      clinician education system to the usual in-person, community- based referral system at NEVHC.&#xD;
      This study will examine whether a telehealth developmental, behavioral and mental health&#xD;
      delivery model can be an effective, efficient, and family-centered way to provide integrated&#xD;
      DB/MH services to children in low-income communities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are three main parts to the basic template of this telehealth intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Real-time videoconference patient visits. Patients who need a specialty visit with a&#xD;
           developmental/behavioral pediatrician will be scheduled for a telehealth visit (with the&#xD;
           patient at the primary care clinical site and the subspecialists located at a University&#xD;
           of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) telehealth site). Patients who need a psych/MH&#xD;
           referral will initially connect with the mental health clinic (MHC) via telehealth.&#xD;
           Therapy visits and the initial psychiatric assessment for medications are in person.&#xD;
           Follow up psychiatric visits are via telehealth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enhanced clinician communication and patient coordination. Providers will use telehealth&#xD;
           capabilities to communicate with each other about patient care and coordination issues,&#xD;
           including diagnostic decisions, management strategies, and other patient care&#xD;
           coordination activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical educational sessions for clinicians. The telehealth equipment will also be used&#xD;
           for real-time videoconference educational sessions to help primary care clinicians and&#xD;
           specialty care clinicians share knowledge and experience that can translate into greater&#xD;
           improvements for patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the new customized telehealth-based patient visit,&#xD;
      coordination, and clinician education system to the usual in-person, community based referral&#xD;
      system at NEVHC. Patients scheduled for a telehealth visit will receive a phone reminder 2&#xD;
      days before the visit. The location of the telehealth visit will be at the same clinic&#xD;
      location as the index primary care provider (PCP) visit. Upon arrival for their telehealth&#xD;
      visit, parents will be sent to a typical patient encounter room at the clinical site. The&#xD;
      room will be set up for a telehealth visit with telehealth equipment, two chairs for the&#xD;
      parent(s) and a small table with chairs and toys for the child and any siblings that arrive&#xD;
      with the family. The camera will be set up to allow the specialty provider to have full view&#xD;
      of the examination room. The system uses a multifunctional camera with zoom and pan (side to&#xD;
      side) capabilities; the investigators will utilize a high-speed internet connection at NEVHC&#xD;
      for optimal connection speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bilingual (Spanish and English) telehealth coordinator will greet the parents and&#xD;
      coordinate the visit at the NEVHC end. The telehealth coordinator is present at the NEVHC end&#xD;
      of the telehealth visit for the duration of the visit. The telehealth coordinator ensures&#xD;
      that the camera and microphones are operating correctly, positions the camera as necessary,&#xD;
      conducts a volume and vision check, and as the exam proceeds, provides Spanish language&#xD;
      interpretation if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical encounter proceeds as a typical &quot;in-person&quot; encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The developmental behavioral services in the telehealth-based patient visit will be provided&#xD;
      by a developmental behavioral pediatrician (DBP) housed at UCLA from Children's Hospital Los&#xD;
      Angeles (CHLA). The telehealth coordinator will call parent to inform parents of their DBP&#xD;
      appointment date/time and will explain the telehealth visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mental health services will be performed by psychiatrists at CFGC and CFC. The telehealth&#xD;
      specialty physician will conduct the typical history, review of information brought by the&#xD;
      parent to the visit, focused behavioral observations, and a general visual inspection, with&#xD;
      assistance from the telehealth coordinator on the distal end. At the end of the visit, the&#xD;
      telehealth coordinator will assist the physician in setting up any follow-up plans with the&#xD;
      family. The telehealth coordinator will then prepare for the next scheduled patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other two components of the telehealth system include clinical educational sessions and&#xD;
      clinician communication and patient coordination sessions. As part of our ongoing stakeholder&#xD;
      engagement process, the investigators will hold a telehealth primary care-mental health&#xD;
      educational session via videoconference monthly. These sessions are topic-based webinars and&#xD;
      case-based educational sessions for the transfer cases. Sessions will alternate between&#xD;
      webinars and case-based educational sessions. The session will include the child&#xD;
      psychiatrist(s), and the NEVHC PCPs; each session will be held during the clinic's lunch hour&#xD;
      for about 45 minutes, based on the NEVHC PCP availability. There will be 9 topic-based&#xD;
      webinar sessions during the intervention period. The first 4 sessions will focus on referral&#xD;
      indications and recommendations for the most common child MH symptoms. Topics include:&#xD;
      guidelines for referral to CFGC/CFC (e.g., when not to refer), diagnosis and management of&#xD;
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression, and diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      for Oppositional Defiant Disorder and PTSD. the investigators will also conduct some sessions&#xD;
      on primary care topics (e.g., anorexia nervosa) for mental health providers.&#xD;
