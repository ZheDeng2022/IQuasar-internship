  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gliomas are the most common malignant primary central nervous system (CNS) tumours. When&#xD;
      high-grade gliomas (HGG) recur, subsequent magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging, with additional&#xD;
      sequences is required.The Positron Emission Tomography (PET) radiotracer&#xD;
      [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) will be used in this study to distinguish between changes seen&#xD;
      on MRI which can be a reflection of pseudoprogression, radiation necrosis, or recurrence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Molecular imaging has been used to distinguish recurrent tumor from post-treatment changes&#xD;
      through the use of positron emission tomography (PET) as well as other techniques. The&#xD;
      best-studied PET radiotracer for this application is [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Normal&#xD;
      brain matter is very FDG-avid, making it more difficult to identify lesions and in addition,&#xD;
      inflammation associated with radiation injury has been shown to be FDG avid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of this, variations of the standard FDG protocols have been proposed in order to&#xD;
      increase overall accuracy, including dual time point imaging (DTPI), consisting of injecting&#xD;
      the patient with the standard radiotracer and acquiring two sets of images several hours&#xD;
      apart, typically the normal initial images in addition to a delayed acquisition set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is good reason to suspect that DTPI FDG-PET would be useful a technique for&#xD;
      characterizing lesions in the brain. It's been shown that FDG uptake by normal brain&#xD;
      parenchyma initially increases then decreases with time, while tumor uptake typically&#xD;
      increases and then plateaus. This pattern of increasing and then decreasing FDG activity has&#xD;
      also been seen in inflammatory tissue. The difference in FDG uptake at different times is&#xD;
      what allows for a better distinction between malignant and benign tissue.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive an intravenous injection of 250 MBq (megabecquerels) of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG). The first Positron Emission Tomography (PET) acquisition of the head will occur one hour post-injection. The second acquisition will take place 3 hours post-injection. Both early and late PET images will be manually co-registered with the participant's most recent magnetic resonance images.</description>
