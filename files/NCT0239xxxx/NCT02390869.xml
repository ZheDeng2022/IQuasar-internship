      A randomized phase III multicenter trial assessing efficacy and toxicity of a combination of&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL) is the second one in terms of&#xD;
      frequency, accounting for about 25% of all NHL cases in the western hemisphere. A&#xD;
      predominance in females is reported, and the median age at the diagnosis is 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FL cells originates from normal counterparts germinal B cells. At a molecular level, the&#xD;
      pathology is thought to be dependent on multiple DNA alterations. However, a large amount of&#xD;
      patients (approximately 85%) have t(14;18), with a consequent overexpression of&#xD;
      anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional hallmark of pathology is bone marrow involvement (70% of patients), while this&#xD;
      is seldom noticed in other organs. Finally, 20% of patients show high levels of serum lactate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (LDH) and/or B symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FL is actually considered an incurable disease. Although FL responds well to initial&#xD;
      chemotherapy, most patients will eventually relapse, requiring multiple subsequent&#xD;
      therapeutic regimens during the course of disease to achieve new period of remission, that&#xD;
      are nevertheless shorter. Relapsed/refractory FL in advanced stage, especially in older&#xD;
      patients, has a relatively poor prognosis, and several patients die for infectious&#xD;
      complications and/or progressive disease. This subset of patients usually do not survive more&#xD;
      than 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus there is a need for new, less toxic and more active treatment in particular for patients&#xD;
      with recurrent disease. The addition of Rituximab to chemotherapy showed a clear benefit in&#xD;
      terms of overall response rate, quality of response, event-free survival and, in most&#xD;
      studies, overall survival; nevertheless, relapses still occur. Moreover Rituximab also proved&#xD;
      highly effective when employed as maintenance treatment either following chemotherapy or&#xD;
      Rituximab-supplemented chemotherapy. The success of Rituximab maintenance led to the&#xD;
      widespread opinion that in the context of indolent lymphomas novel &quot;smart&quot; drugs&#xD;
      characterized by a good safety profile need to be carefully evaluated not only in the&#xD;
      induction but also in the maintenance setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous stem cell transplantation and radioimmunotherapy are therapeutic option for&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory FL patients, but can be considered only for younger or fit patients and&#xD;
      can be delivered only in large institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the search of new, more manageable, therapeutic agents with different mechanisms of&#xD;
      action, especially for elderly or frail patients, is ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bendamustine is highly effective in relapsed/refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)&#xD;
      and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), including patients who are refractory to rituximab and those&#xD;
      previously treated with other alkylating agents. Therefore, bendamustine is now widely used&#xD;
      in this setting and provides another effective treatment option for patients who progress&#xD;
      after CHOP-R. Two phase II studies have combined bendamustine (90 mg/m2 days 2-3 every 28&#xD;
      days) with rituximab (375 mg/m2 day 1) and both reported similar results. The overall&#xD;
      response rate was 90% (60% CR) for the entire patient population, and median Progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) for all patients was 24 months. Based on these encouraging results in the&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory setting, the Study group indolent Lymphomas (StiL) initiated a large,&#xD;
      randomized, phase III trials of bendamustine (90 mg/m2 days 1-2 every 28 days) plus rituximab&#xD;
      (375 mg/m2 day 1). This trial compared B-R with standard CHOP-R (21-day cycles) in previously&#xD;
      untreated patients with indolent NHL and MCL. 549 patients with predominantly stage IV&#xD;
      disease were enrolled, and the treatment groups were well balanced for all baseline&#xD;
      characteristics. Approximately 55% of patients had FL, approximately 20% had MCL, and the&#xD;
      remaining 25% had other indolent lymphomas. Although the overall response rate was similar in&#xD;
      the B-R and CHOP-R arms (93.8% and 93.5%, respectively), the CR rate was significantly higher&#xD;
      in the B-R arm (40.1% compared with 30.8% for CHOP-R; P .03), and the median PFS was&#xD;
      significantly longer in the B-R arm (54.8 months v 34.8 months for CHOP-R; P .0002). No&#xD;
      difference in survival has been observed thus far, further follow-up of this ongoing study&#xD;
      will be required to address whether B-R improves survival compared with CHOP-R. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      bendamustine plus rituximab yielded more durable responses and improved PFS compared with&#xD;
      CHOP-R in previously untreated patients with indolent lymphomas. Moreover, bendamustine plus&#xD;
      rituximab was better tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with multiple mechanisms of action wich include&#xD;
      antiproliferative activity as well as microenvironmental effects such as inhibition&#xD;
      angiogenesis and stimulation of T-cell mediated response. Lenalidomide given as monotherapy&#xD;
      proved to be active, with an acceptable toxicity profile, in B-cell malignancies such as&#xD;
      multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent reports on Lenalidomide in FL, both for untreated and relapsed patients, are&#xD;
      promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-three patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were&#xD;
      treated with oral Lenalidomide 25 mg once daily on days 1 to 21 of every 28-day cycle for 52&#xD;
      weeks or until progression. Twenty-two of the 43 patients enrolled had FL In this subgroup&#xD;
      overall response rate was 27%, with a 9% complete remission rate. Most common adverse events&#xD;
      were myelosuppression, fatigue, gastrointestinal events and cutaneous rash, while predominant&#xD;
      grade 3/4 serious adverse events were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Despite a median&#xD;
      duration of response longer than 16.5 months, there was a disappointing median&#xD;
      progression-free survival of 4.4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Witzig et al. focused on Lenalidomide 25 mg in monotherapy in relapsed/refractory B-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas. The cohort of patients was 217, 19 of them had a stage III FL. Regarding this&#xD;
      patients subset, ORR was 42%, CR/Cru was 11%, median PFS was 8.9 months, median duration of&#xD;
      response was not reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytotoxic effect of Rituximab appears to involve CDC, ADCC and induction of apoptosis.&#xD;
      Early studies of Lenalidomide show the potential for high CR rates and long duration of&#xD;
      response in FL and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recent data suggest that the&#xD;
      modulation of effector cells by Lenalidomide can enhance the antitumor activity of Rituximab&#xD;
      and partially overcome its resistance in cell lines of relapsed/refractory NHL. Lenalidomide&#xD;
      appears in fact to greatly enhance the monocyte and NK-mediated ADCC exerted by Rituximab,&#xD;
      resulting in an increase of cancer cell killing compared to the single drugs. A synergistic&#xD;
      activity between Rituximab and Lenalidomide has been reported in vitro in lymphoma cells and&#xD;
      in animal models. Rituximab-lenalidomide (R2) combination has been consequently tested in&#xD;
      clinical trials, including untreated or relapsed/refractory indolent NHL, with encouraging&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first report about the R2 combination in FL was presented at the 51th ASH meeting by&#xD;
      Dutia M et al. Sixteen patients with relapsed/refractory indolent NHL have been treated with&#xD;
      R2 combination, obtaining a 75% overall response (ORR) rate with an acceptable toxicity;&#xD;
      interestingly, efficacy data seem better in FL patients with a 88% ORR. Moreover, in the&#xD;
      unfavourable subgroups of rituximab refractory and heavily pre-treated patients, ORR rates&#xD;
      were 57% and 70%, respectively. Estimated progression-free survival for all patients is 12&#xD;
      months. The major limitation of the study was the small number of patients, with only 9 FL&#xD;
      patient included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four patients with indolent B-cell lymphoma, previously resistant to Rituximab,&#xD;
      received a Rituximab-Lenalidomide +/- Dexamethasone combination until progression of disease&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity; Lenalidomide was administered at the dosage of 10 mg, 28 days per&#xD;
      course. 28 over 45 patients had FL. No further FL group analysis were reported, but the study&#xD;
      allowed to assess that also patients resistant to Rituximab in mono-therapy can benefit from&#xD;
      R2, with or without Dexamethasone, achieving higher ORR (~61%) with relatively durable&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients with stage III-IV untreated indolent NHL received the R2 combination in&#xD;
      cycles of 28 days (Lenalidomide 20 mg orally once a day from day 1 to day 21 and Rituximab&#xD;
      375 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1). 49 patients (49%) composed the FL subset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of FL patients was extremely positive, considering the ORR (98%) and the CR/CRu&#xD;
      (85%). Moreover, when the R2 treatment was prolonged after 6 courses, a significant&#xD;
      improvement was seen for CR/CRu. Finally, the PFS was 83% for FL patients after 24 months,&#xD;
      and the toxicity profile was acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CALGB 50401 randomized study 89 recurrent FL patients were treated with Lenalidomide alone&#xD;
      versus R2 combination. ORR were 49% vs 75% and EFS was 1.2 vs 2.0 with a median follow up of&#xD;
      1.5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basing on these promising data, other trials proposed the combination of Lenalidomide and&#xD;
      R-CHOP (R2-CHOP), as R-CHOP is the standard treatment for most patients with B-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas. Briefly, both Phase I and Phase I/II trials confirmed the potential of the novel&#xD;
      combination, although a large multi-centre trial is required to confirm the results.&#xD;
