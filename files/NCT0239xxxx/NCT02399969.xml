      The purpose of this study is to study acupuncture for the treatment of low back pain in the&#xD;
      emergency department. Current treatments for low back pain in the emergency department&#xD;
      generally include pills or injections of medications to treat pain and relax muscles.&#xD;
      However, it is known that many of these medications have risks and toxicities which may limit&#xD;
      their safe use in some patients. Therefore, new types of treatments are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture is an ancient form of healing that has been practiced in some form for centuries.&#xD;
      In modern times, acupuncture has been studied for the long-term treatment of low back pain&#xD;
      and some research suggests it may be effective. However, very little research has examined&#xD;
      the use of acupuncture for immediate pain relief in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will study a type of acupuncture called Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA).&#xD;
      Battlefield acupuncture was designed by a physician in the US military with the purpose of&#xD;
      providing immediate pain relief. It involves the placement of 5 small needles in each ear.&#xD;
      The needles may be removed at any time. The hypothesis of this study is that battlefield&#xD;
      acupuncture may improve mobility and pain of patients with low back pain in the emergency&#xD;
      department.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers will review the chief complaints of patients arriving to the emergency&#xD;
      department in epic. Subjects will be identified and recruited in the emergency department&#xD;
      based on chief complaint of &quot;back pain&quot;. Subjects will be approached by a researcher who will&#xD;
      then recruit them to participate in the study using the attached informed consent form.&#xD;
      Researchers will not be acting as treating physicians at the time of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients that present to the emergency setting with the complaint of low back pain will be&#xD;
      randomized to standard care or standard care plus Battlefield Acupuncture. The patients&#xD;
      randomized to receive Battlefield Acupuncture will receive the treatment according to the&#xD;
      defined protocol, which involves placement of ASP indwelling needles in up to 5 auricular&#xD;
      points. One ear will be selected, and the areas which will be needled will identified and&#xD;
      prepped with alcohol to reduce risks of infection. Up to 5 sterile ASP semi- permanent&#xD;
      needles will be placed. Treatments will be provided by MDs or PAs who have been trained to&#xD;
      administer the Battlefield Acupuncture technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will complete pre- and post- treatment surveys regarding their pain rating and&#xD;
      functional limitation from pain. Additional data will be collected from EPIC regarding&#xD;
      demographic information, medication administration, and length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from the subject at the time of enrollment, and again one hour&#xD;
      following enrollment. No further data will be collected directly from subjects. Additional&#xD;
      follow-up data regarding medications prescribed and length of stay will be collected from the&#xD;
      chart after patient discharge.&#xD;
