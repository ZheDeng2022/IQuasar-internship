    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/Ib study of Radium-223 in combination with Tasquinimod for patients with&#xD;
      bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to determine the spectrum of tolerability of the combination of&#xD;
      tasquinimod and radium-223 and determine a dose for a subsequent randomized phase II study&#xD;
      (first cohort) and the proportion of men with bone-specific alkaline phosphatase response&#xD;
      (second cohort).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of Radium-223 in combination with Tasquinimod. The target population is&#xD;
      patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer intended for&#xD;
      treatment with radium-223.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline assessment, all subjects will receive six cycles of Radium-223 separated by an&#xD;
      interval of 28 days. Radium-223 will be administered per FDA-approved dosing (six IV&#xD;
      injections at a dose of 50kBq/kg of body weight, administered every 4 weeks). The treatment&#xD;
      maintenance dose of tasquinimod will be a maximum of 1 mg of tasquinimod taken once daily&#xD;
      with water (~200 mL). The initial target dose of tasquinimod is 0.5mg/day. All subjects will&#xD;
      be followed up for 12 months after start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a phase I/Ib trial of the addition of tasquinimod to FDA-approved&#xD;
      doses of radium-223 in men with symptomatic bone-only metastatic CRPC. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that given their distinct mechanisms of action and non-overlapping toxicity&#xD;
      profiles that additive or synergistic toxicity would be minimal. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that adding tasquinimod to radium therapy may result in improved measures of&#xD;
      efficacy including reduction in total alkaline phosphatase, time to first skeletal-related&#xD;
      event and PSA and radiographic progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase I portion of dose-escalation scheme, the dose escalation will follow a 3+3&#xD;
      design with intra-patient dose-escalation from 0.25mg/day of tasquinimod to a goal dose of&#xD;
      either 0.25mg (dose-level -1), 0.5mg (dose-level 1), or 1.0mg/day (dose-level 2) based on&#xD;
      individual tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon identifying a recommended Phase II combination dose-level of Radium-223 and tasquinimod,&#xD;
      the investigators will move to the Phase Ib portion and open an expanded cohort of up to 35&#xD;
      additional patients to achieve a total of 38 patients treated at the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose-level (including those from the dose-escalation phase).&#xD;
