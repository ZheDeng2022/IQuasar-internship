      This study evaluates the effect of a symbiotic fermented milk on health-related quality of&#xD;
      life and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant&#xD;
      IBS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common digestive disorders in the developed&#xD;
      world which. It is associated to numerous symptoms, of which the most characteristic are&#xD;
      recurrent pain or discomfort in the abdominal region, changes and difficulties related to&#xD;
      bowel movements, and bloating. Although not dangerous, the disease may significantly impair&#xD;
      the patients' quality of life. Treatment is symptomatic, but currently not very efficient.&#xD;
      The use of probiotics in the treatment of IBS is a promising approach and has been the&#xD;
      subject of much research in the last two decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized, placebo-controlled study is to assess changes in&#xD;
      health-related quality of life in patients with constipation-predominant IBS after regular&#xD;
      consumption of symbiotic fermented milk (containing probiotics and dietary fibres) and to&#xD;
      assess its effects on some symptoms, like abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, and chronic&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;
