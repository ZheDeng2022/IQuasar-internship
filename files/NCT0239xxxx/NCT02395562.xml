      Several studies show that the incidence of skin cancer parallels the length and depth of&#xD;
      immunosuppression. This study will analyze the correlation of viral reactivation and skin&#xD;
      cancer in organ transplant recipients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the skin (SCC) affects people in high numbers worldwide. While a&#xD;
      yearly increase of over 2 million patients, who develop cancer, is recorded, organ transplant&#xD;
      recipients (OTR) have a 60- to 100-fold higher risk of developing skin cancer. In OTRs, skin&#xD;
      cancer is the most frequent tumor that appears, whereas 95% are nonmelanoma skin cancer&#xD;
      cells: squamous cells or basal cell carcinomas. All OTRs need to be treated lifelong with&#xD;
      immunosuppressants in order to prevent the rejection of the transplanted organ. However, this&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment leads to a decrease of immunity, and therefore, cancer cells are&#xD;
      able to proliferate easier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies show that the incidence of skin cancer parallels the length and depth of&#xD;
      immunosuppression. The appearance of CD4 in OTRs with cutaneous carcinomas is significantly&#xD;
      lower compared to those without skin lesions. Various findings have shown a positive&#xD;
      correlation of the period of exposure to immunosuppressants and the risk of skin cancer.&#xD;
      However, little is known about the dose or the type of drug is responsible for skin cancer.&#xD;
      The uptake of three immunosuppressive medicaments compared to the uptake of two results in a&#xD;
      3-fold increased risk of developing cancer. The consequence of the immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
      is reversible; patients who stop immunosuppressive treatment often show a decrease in skin&#xD;
      cancer. The highest risk for organ rejection is during the first three months after&#xD;
      transplantation. Therefore, an increased dose of immunosuppressors is used during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to cancer, a high increase of viral infections and reactivations is seen in OTRs.&#xD;
      Over 90% of the population carries herpesviruses. The risk of viral infection and&#xD;
      reactivation is much higher in OTRs. While inducing a decrease in immunosurveillance,&#xD;
      herpesvirus can spread easier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herpesvirus infections due to the eight human herpes viruses (HHV) are more frequent by&#xD;
      immunosuppression in OTRs. Once a patient is infected with one of the human herpesvirus types&#xD;
      (Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6 and 7, or Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus), the&#xD;
      virus is able to establish a latent, non-productive infection and maintains the capacity for&#xD;
      a life-long reactivation. Due to the decrease of immunity, OTRs are highly susceptible to&#xD;
      activate this latent herpesviral infection, which is a critical aspect of the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment. The risk of the reactivation of Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr&#xD;
      virus in OTRs is much higher compared to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking the above discussed findings together, the investigators hypothesize that viral&#xD;
      infections and reactivations correlate positively with skin cancer in OTRs. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators think that viral reactivation and infection can be used as a marker for a later&#xD;
      incidence of skin cancer. While virus infections and reactivations appear early, OTRs become&#xD;
      affected by SCC in the early and in the late period after the transplantation. The&#xD;
      investigators thus aim to analyze existing data from the STCS and its nested studies to test&#xD;
      these hypotheses: To assess the correlation of viral replication and skin cancer in organ&#xD;
      transplant recipients and to assess viral replication as predictor for skin cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators are interested in all data available from other studies of the STCS and to&#xD;
      divide all organ transplant recipients e.g. for CMV in four groups: no replication, a larger&#xD;
      group who show asymptomatic viral replication, some of them with viral syndrome and the ones&#xD;
      with proven disease.&#xD;
