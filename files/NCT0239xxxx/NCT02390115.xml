  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stroke is the second cause of death and the first of disabilities in the world. Although&#xD;
      a motor spontaneous recovery is observed, around 50 to 70% of the hemiparetic upper extremity&#xD;
      present alterations of upper extremity, limiting the performance of daily activities even&#xD;
      after 2 to 4 years of strokes. More recently used in neurological rehabilitation, the ability&#xD;
      to promote sensory-motor facilitation is given to the Elastic Tape (ET). However, its safety&#xD;
      and efficacy in the treatment of post-stroke individuals still require further investigation.&#xD;
      Thus, the objective of this project is to evaluate the immediate effects of ET, applied to&#xD;
      the paretic shoulder on proprioception during movements of abduction and flexion of the&#xD;
      shoulder and muscle activation and kinematic variables for the reaching in chronic&#xD;
      hemiparetic. Fifteen subjects with chronic hemiparesis will participate these crossover&#xD;
      sham-controlled trial. Participants will be randomized into two condition: elastic tape (ET)&#xD;
      followed by sham tape (ST- strapping) or ST followed by ET. One month of washout period was&#xD;
      considered. The motor impairment and the dominance before stroke will be evaluated by&#xD;
      Fugl-Meyer scale and the Inventory Side dominance of Edinburgh, respectively. ET will apply&#xD;
      deltoid (anterior, middle and posterior). Assessment before and after the application of ET&#xD;
      will be performed. For proprioception assessment (joint position sense) will be evaluated&#xD;
      using a dynamometer. Absolute error for shoulder abduction and flexion at the 30° and 60° was&#xD;
      calculated. For the assessment of motor performance in a functional task (reach a glass of&#xD;
      water), spatio-temporal parameters (total duration of the motion, peak velocity, time to peak&#xD;
      velocity) and three-dimensional joint kinematics of the trunk, scapula, shoulder, and elbow&#xD;
      (total range of motion, joint angle maximum and minimum) will be used. Concomitantly,&#xD;
      bilateral activation of the deltoid (anterior, middle and posterior), trapezius (upper and&#xD;
      lower), serratus anterior and pectoral major will be assessed by electromyography during&#xD;
      reach. The following electromyographic variables will be analyzed: activation amplitude,&#xD;
      muscle onset and maximum and minimum activation. For statistical analysis, the normality and&#xD;
      homogeneity tests will be applied. If the variables have a distribution considered normal and&#xD;
      homogeneous, Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures gift will be applied. Otherwise it will be&#xD;
      applied to non-parametric statistics Friedman. Will be considered a 0.05 significance level&#xD;
      for all statistical tests.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline and 10 minutes post-application of placebo ou elastic tape</time_frame>
    <description>This analysis will be performed on a dynamometer with the participant seated and blindfolded. Initially, the dynamometer will move the arm participant in references angles. Each subject will be allowed to sense the reference angle for 10 seconds before the upper extremity is returned passively to the start position. Subsequently, the upper extremity will be moved passively by the dynamometer toward the reference position, and subjects will press a button in their hand that will stop the machine when they feel the position has been reached. The absolute error (in degrees) will be calculated as the difference between the indicated and reference positions.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in joint kinematics of reach at 10 minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 minutes post-application of placebo ou elastic tape</time_frame>
    <description>The Qualisys system will be used for this evaluation. Passive reflective markers will be placed on the anatomical landmarks (anatomical markers) according to the International Society of Biomechanics. In addition, clusters will be placed on the sternum, scapula (most superficial part of the acromion), arm (positioned below the insertion of the deltoid muscle), and forearm (5 cm below the cubital fossa). After positioning the markers and clusters, the collection of static posture (duration 5 seconds) will be performed. In static posture, the individuals should be seated in an adjustable chair. Then, the subject will perform the reaching movement to touch a glass placed at 80% of the length of the upper limb and return to the starting position (pronated hands on the thigh). The variables are calculated: duration of movement (second), speed (mm/s), displacement of the joints of the trunk, scapula, shoulder and elbow (°).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Electromyography during the reach at 10 minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 minutes post-application of placebo ou elastic tape</time_frame>
    <description>The collection of electromyographic activity will be performed only during the kinematics of the reaching movement. The electrodes are positioned parallel to the orientation of muscle fibers in the anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid, pectoral major, upper and inferior trapezius, and serratus anterior. Initially, five seconds in the rest position and 10 seconds of EMG activity before the start of the reaching movement will be collected. The following variables will be calculated: activation amplitude, maximum and minimum activation coefficient variation, onset e offset.</description>

    <description>Tape placing will consider as the initial anchor the acromioclavicular joint, and as the final one the point immediately below the insertion of the deltoid muscle. Two centimeters anchor will be considered for all the participants, and the active zone will be equivalent to the distance between two anchors. The first tape will be placed to the anterior portion of the deltoid with the shoulder at 30° passive extension. The second tape will be placed to the middle portion of the deltoid with the shoulder at 30° of passive horizontal adduction. For placing the third tape to the posterior deltoid, the limb will be positioned at 90° of passive flexion of the shoulder. The elastic tape tension will be placed as previously described as &quot;paper tension&quot; and it is equivalent to 10-15% of the total elastic tape tension.</description>
