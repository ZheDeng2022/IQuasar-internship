  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      South Asians have a much higher risk of diabetes compared to Europeans and investigators&#xD;
      don't know why this is. Investigators think that South Asians' capacity to store fat safely&#xD;
      under the skin is lower than Europeans, so they start to store fat around internal organs and&#xD;
      in liver and muscle, and at lower body weights than Europeans. These increased levels of&#xD;
      internal fat storage are thought to increase risk of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study therefore is to investigate whether there are differences with&#xD;
      weight gain and weight loss in fat storage, fat cell function and metabolic risk factors, in&#xD;
      South Asians compared with Europeans. Investigators will compare South Asian and European men&#xD;
      at the start of the study, after they have gained about 7% body weight, and again after they&#xD;
      have lost 7-15% body weight (from peak weight) to see how gaining and losing weight affects&#xD;
      fat storage within the body and the function of fat cells. Investigators will also assess the&#xD;
      effect of weight gain and weight loss on metabolism, fitness and risk factors for diabetes&#xD;
      and heart disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      South Asians have about five times the risk of adult onset diabetes (high blood sugar) than&#xD;
      Europeans and nearly one in five South Asian men in the United Kingdom have the disease.&#xD;
      Diabetes is a serious disease that can lead to a number of adverse health consequences&#xD;
      including heart disease, kidney disease and blindness and accounts for about 10% of all&#xD;
      healthcare costs in the UK. Obesity is strongly linked to diabetes risk, but the adverse&#xD;
      effect of getting fatter on diabetes risk is much higher in South Asians than Europeans. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to understand why this is the case. When humans put on weight&#xD;
      initially this fat is stored under the skin (subcutaneous fat). This is relatively safe.&#xD;
      However, when the capacity of this under skin storage is exceeded, fat is stored internally&#xD;
      within the tummy area (visceral fat) and in organs such as the liver and muscle, which is&#xD;
      less safe and increases diabetes risk. Investigators think that South Asians' capacity to&#xD;
      store fat safely under the skin is lower than Europeans, so fat is stored internally and in&#xD;
      liver and muscle at lower body weights than Europeans. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate whether this occurs and why. To do this investigators will compare a group of&#xD;
      South Asian and European men and see how gaining and losing weight affects fat storage within&#xD;
      the body and the function of fat cells. Investigators will also assess the effect of weight&#xD;
      gain and weight loss on metabolism, fitness and risk factors for diabetes and heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include healthy men of normal weight aged between 18-45 year and of either&#xD;
      white European or South Asian (both parent of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladesh or Sri Lankan&#xD;
      origin) ethnic origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight will be altered by initially gaining weight and then losing weight. To do this&#xD;
      participants will initially have to eat more food for 4-6 weeks and then go on a diet&#xD;
      combined with exercise for 12 weeks. Participation in the study will last around 5½ months in&#xD;
      total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study pictures of body fat stores will be taken using an MRI scanner, a&#xD;
      biopsy/sample of tummy fat will be taken to look at the fat cells and physical fitness and&#xD;
      body metabolism (the way the body deals with sugar, insulin and fat) will be measured. These&#xD;
      measurements will be done at three different times: before gaining weight, once weight is&#xD;
      gained, and after losing weight (and back to original weight). The measurements will give a&#xD;
      detailed assessment of the changes in the body when gaining or losing weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of taking part in the study are receiving detailed feedback about fitness&#xD;
      levels, body fat, dietary intake, blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar and level of&#xD;
      &quot;insulin resistance&quot;. Feedback about the overall study findings will also be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the knowledge gained from participation may benefit people who are at risk of&#xD;
      diabetes in the future by increasing our understanding of why South Asians are at increased&#xD;
      risk of developing diabetes. It will also help guide future research investigating how to&#xD;
      reduce this increased risk through lifestyle changes and may also help direct the development&#xD;
      of medicines to prevent and treat diabetes groups at increased risk of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible disadvantages of the study are gaining 7% of body weight over 4-6 weeks. This is&#xD;
      likely to temporarily induce negative metabolic changes. However, investigators are also&#xD;
      supporting losing this weight (and hopefully more) in the weight loss phase of the study.&#xD;
      There is no evidence that short-term weight gain of this nature causes any long-term adverse&#xD;
      effects. Longer-term weight gain however is associated with an increased risk of diabetes,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. It is therefore important that investigators&#xD;
      ensure participants return to original weight at the start of the study. Taking fat biopsies&#xD;
      carries a small risk of minor bruising or an infection. Good sterile practice reduces this&#xD;
      risk of infection and application of ice and pressure to the biopsy site reduces the risk of&#xD;
      bruising. Blood sampling via the cannula may cause minor bruising or an inflammation of the&#xD;
      vein. Some participants may feel faint when they give blood. One of the exercise tests will&#xD;
      be at a maximal level and the possibility exists that, very occasionally, certain changes may&#xD;
      occur during or shortly after the test. They include abnormal blood pressure, fainting or a&#xD;
      change in the normal rhythm of the heartbeat. There is a small possibility that taking part&#xD;
      in this study will reveal a health problem that patients already have such as high&#xD;
      cholesterol or high blood pressure. If such a problem is revealed, investigators will ask&#xD;
      permission to inform the participant's General Practitioner to receive clinically appropriate&#xD;
      follow-up care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is running for ~2.5 years from March 2015 and is based at the University of&#xD;
      Glasgow. The study is being funded by the European Commission as part of the European Medical&#xD;
      Information Framework (EMIF), called EMIF-Metabolic. This research will help investigators to&#xD;
      better predict who is likely to be at risk of developing diseases such as diabetes and to&#xD;
      develop new medicines to prevent and treat these diseases. More details about EMIF-Metabolic&#xD;
      are available here: http://www.emif.eu/emif-meta/objectives.&#xD;
