    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nab-paclitaxel when given&#xD;
      together with capecitabine and radiation therapy following first treatment with chemotherapy&#xD;
      (induction therapy) in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that is not spread to tissue&#xD;
      far away but is not operable due to abutment or encasement of blood vessels nearby (locally&#xD;
      advanced). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel and capecitabine, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy&#xD;
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving nab-paclitaxel, capecitabine, and&#xD;
      radiation therapy together may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of combining nab-paclitaxel (abraxane) with&#xD;
      capecitabine and radiation (radiation therapy) for consolidating treatment after induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether combining abraxane with capecitabine and radiation for consolidating&#xD;
      treatment after induction chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer increases&#xD;
      overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To analyze fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle biopsy samples for mothers against&#xD;
      decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) by immunocytochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate plasma cytokines levels, circulating tumor cells before, during and after&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate patient-reported symptoms using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Cancer Module (MDASI-GI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate response rate in patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and&#xD;
      29 and capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5 (Monday-Friday). Patients also&#xD;
      undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD) on days 1-5 (Monday-Friday). Treatment continues&#xD;
      for 5 1/2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks and then every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
