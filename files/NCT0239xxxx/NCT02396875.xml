  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) prolongs the life and improves the symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with heart failure and electrical dyssynchrony. 30-50% of patients do not improve&#xD;
      with the treatment which is both expensive and not without complication. Despite much&#xD;
      research, we cannot accurately predict who will not respond. Furthermore, most heart failure&#xD;
      patients gets symptoms on exercise and most studies have examined patients at rest. We&#xD;
      propose to investigate the effect of exercise on different parts of the left ventricle by&#xD;
      sampling various biomarkers of metabolism, myocardial injury and gene expression. We will&#xD;
      then repeat the protocol following device insertion to look for changes. This novel work will&#xD;
      require a small cohort of patients with heart failure and no electrical dyssynchrony and&#xD;
      normal patients to act as controls. We will also measure novel biomarkers at different venous&#xD;
      sites relating to different parts of the myocardium to determine whether they can be used to&#xD;
      prognosticate or even predict response to CRT.&#xD;

      We propose to examine the acute effects of exercise on patients with dyssynchronous&#xD;
      electrical activation of the heart and heart failure and to compare the release of novel&#xD;
      biomarkers in selective areas of coronary venous drainage by direct cannulation of different&#xD;
      veins via the coronary sinus (CS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will separate patients into a minimally invasive arm (MINARM)and an invasive&#xD;
      arm (INARM). The INARM will be recruited from patients in the MINARM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MINARM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 40 patients scheduled for CRT implant Group 2: 15 patients with heart failure and no&#xD;
      dyssynchrony Group 3: 15 patients with normal hearts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 patient undergoing CRT will have venous samples taken from the CS, two CS tributaries,&#xD;
      peripheral venous and peripheral arterial sites at the time of CRT insertion at the time of&#xD;
      device implant. Blood samples will be analysed for metabolites and novel biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will then undergo repeat sampling at 6 months to assess for changes in the micro RNA and&#xD;
      biomarker profile including CS sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control arm of 15 patients with heart failure and no dyssynchrony (Group 2) and 15 patients&#xD;
      with normal hearts (Group 3) will undergo peripheral venous sampling for biomarkers and this&#xD;
      will be repeated at 6 months. These samples will allow for control against the dyssynchronous&#xD;
      heart failure group and also for temporal changes in micro RNA expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patient from Group 1 and 5 from Group 2 and 3 will be invited to from part of the INARM at&#xD;
      the time of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INARM study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A 10 pts with heart failure and dyssynchronous ventricular contraction GROUP B 5 pts&#xD;
      with heart failure and no electrical dyssynchrony schedule for either coronary angiography or&#xD;
      electrophysiology study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP C 5 pts schedule for diagnostic coronary angiography or electrophysiology study with&#xD;
      normal cardiac function&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact details of the protocol will vary depending upon the Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 On the day preceding the CRT implant will attend hospital for a temporary invasive catheter&#xD;
      study. A pacing protocol will be performed using a pacing wire inserted into the right&#xD;
      atrium. Coronary sinus venous blood sampling will be performed using a catheter placed via&#xD;
      the femoral or internal jugular vein. At the chief investigator's discretion a specially&#xD;
      designed exercise bicycle that allow supine exercise in the catheter lab will be used rather&#xD;
      than the atrial pacing wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 6 months post implant the patients will return to the catheter laboratory for a further&#xD;
      study. This will repeat the protocol but with the device having been on for 6 months. This&#xD;
      will require further arterial access as described above. This study should take approximately&#xD;
      an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B and C&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is common practice for these patients to have a coronary angiogram to exclude ischaemic&#xD;
      heart disease as the cause of their heart failure or chest pain or to have electrophysiology&#xD;
      study to determine the mechanism of arrhythmia. If their angiogram is normal,we will perform&#xD;
      a pacing protocol (this will be required if they are attending for an electrophysiology&#xD;
      study). This will require 2 femoral venous access sites (similar to standard&#xD;
      electrophysiological study) to allow temporary atrial pacing and acquisition of blood samples&#xD;
      from the coronary sinus. Following the invasive part of the study patients in Group B and C&#xD;
      will fall back into Group 2 and 3 of MINARM and attend at 6 month for peripheral blood&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;
