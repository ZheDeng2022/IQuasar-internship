    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the transplacental gradients for 6 polyols&#xD;
      and mannose are altered in intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) pregnancies compared to&#xD;
      normal pregnancies and b) to determine the relative contributions of transplacental transport&#xD;
      vs production by the conceptus of both inositol (the major polyol) and mannose in IUGR and&#xD;
      normal pregnancies using stable isotopic methodology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study fall in 2 categories: 1) information important to an understanding&#xD;
      of normal pregnancies and the roles of polyols and trace carbohydrates in human fetal&#xD;
      nutrition and metabolism and 2) determination of the impact of the small IUGR placenta upon&#xD;
      the delivery of polyols and trace carbohydrates to the fetus. Stable isotopes of D-mannose,&#xD;
      D-glucose and myoinositol are used to determine the contributions of placental transport of&#xD;
      these carbohydrates from the maternal circulation to the fetus vs their synthesis in the&#xD;
      fetus and placental tissues. The IUGR pregnancies compare the transport and synthesis of&#xD;
      these compounds vs a classification of clinical severity based upon Doppler velocimetry data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that, (just as the investigators have shown for glucose) the&#xD;
      fetal enrichment of mannose m+6 will be ~ equal to the maternal enrichment. Thus, without any&#xD;
      appreciable dilution of fetal mannose m+6 there is no evidence of fetal production of&#xD;
      mannose. This will be further confirmed by the infusion of D-[1-13C]glucose into the maternal&#xD;
      circulation. Our previous studies have shown that the fetal enrichment will equal the&#xD;
      maternal enrichment. Thus, confirmation will be obtained by comparing the enrichment of fetal&#xD;
      mannose m+1 with the fetal enrichment of glucose m+1. The mannose enrichment should be 10% or&#xD;
      less of the glucose enrichment. These findings would establish unequivocally that fetal&#xD;
      requirements for mannose are met primarily by transplacental transport, not fetal production&#xD;
      from glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, the investigators anticipate demonstrating that the fetal enrichment of&#xD;
      myoinositol m+6 is significantly less than the maternal enrichment demonstrating minimal&#xD;
      transplacental flux of myoinositol with very little dilution of fetal enrichment by&#xD;
      myoinositol production from glucose. This will receive further confirmation by comparing the&#xD;
      fetal enrichment of myoinositol m+1 with the fetal enrichment of glucose m+1. For example if&#xD;
      the fetal enrichment of myoinositol m+1 is 70% of the fetal enrichment of glucose m+1, then&#xD;
      70% of fetal plasma myoinositol is derived from fetal plasma glucose. This would establish&#xD;
      that fetal myoinositol requirements are met by fetal production from glucose rather than by&#xD;
      transplacental transport.&#xD;
