    <textblock>
      This study is looking at a novel therapy of numbing medication injected directly around the&#xD;
      fracture site. The purpose of this study is to determine if the study medication, EXPAREL®,&#xD;
      is a viable alternative to current therapies for rib fractures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rib fractures are common in patients who have suffered a traumatic injury, occurring in about&#xD;
      10% of general injury cases and in about 30% of cases where the injury is directly to the&#xD;
      chest. Usually caused by injury to the chest wall, rib fractures most often occur where the&#xD;
      ribs bend and are most fragile. These kinds of injuries are commonly caused by motor vehicle&#xD;
      collisions, falls, assault, industrial accidents, gunshots, or repetitive causes such as&#xD;
      severe coughing or use-injury in athletes. With any of these types of injury, the first&#xD;
      concern of the physician is to repair any immediate damage to the chest wall (such as&#xD;
      penetrating wounds, air or blood in the chest cavity that compresses the lung(s), or fixing&#xD;
      the broken ribs in place). Once these injuries are repaired and stabilized, the patient's&#xD;
      care consists of controlling their pain and helping them recover normal breathing ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who are not admitted to the hospital for care, usually with only 1 or 2 ribs&#xD;
      broken, care is often pain control using over the counter medicines like Tylenol or Ibuprofen&#xD;
      (called NSAIDS) or prescription medicines like hydrocodone (Vicodin®). The main concern&#xD;
      during follow-up of these patients is full recovery of pain-free breathing ability. In&#xD;
      patients who are admitted to the hospital for treatment, pneumonia is the most common&#xD;
      complication associated with multiple broken ribs. Pneumonia occurs in anywhere from 15% to&#xD;
      30% of these patients. For long-acting pain control to help them breathe more easily, studies&#xD;
      have shown that epidural analgesia (pain relieving drugs delivered through a thin tube called&#xD;
      a catheter into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord) is preferable over opioids, whether&#xD;
      given in pill form or through an IV. Additional studies have shown better results with&#xD;
      epidural pain control compared to opioid or NSAID use. However, with all of these methods&#xD;
      come risks and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using oral NSAIDs can result in stomach irritation, kidney injury, or can interfere with the&#xD;
      body's ability to form blood clots. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) has been shown to be toxic to the&#xD;
      liver at higher doses. Opioid use can lower a person's breathing ability even while it&#xD;
      reduces their pain, which is not wanted in patients already at higher risk for pneumonia.&#xD;
      Epidural placement is a complex procedure, risks infection at the site of catheter insertion,&#xD;
      can cause itching, and risks injury to both the spinal cord and the membrane surrounding it&#xD;
      (the dura).&#xD;
