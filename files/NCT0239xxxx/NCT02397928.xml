    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, single arm, non-randomized, open label phase II trial, designed&#xD;
      to study the safety and efficacy of a medical device, the NovoTTF-100L concomitant with&#xD;
      Pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma patients. The&#xD;
      device is an experimental, portable, battery operated device for chronic administration of&#xD;
      alternating electric fields (termed TTFields or TTF) to the region of the malignant tumor, by&#xD;
      means of surface, insulated electrode arrays.&#xD;

      PAST PRE CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of TTFields has demonstrated significant activity in in vitro mesothelioma&#xD;
      pre-clinical models both as a single modality treatment and in combination with pemetrexed&#xD;
      and cisplatin, chemotherapies that are commonly used to treat malignant pleural mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot clinical trial (first in men) TTFields were shown to have an effect as a&#xD;
      monotherapy in one patient with malignant pleural mesothelioma when applied to the patient's&#xD;
      abdomen (the disease metastasized to the abdomen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study, 42 patients with stage IIIB- IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had&#xD;
      had tumor progression after at least one line of prior chemotherapy received pemetrexed&#xD;
      together with TTFields applied to the chest and upper abdomen until disease progression.&#xD;
      Efficacy endpoints were remarkably high compared to historical data for pemetrexed alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a large prospective, randomized trial, in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). The outcome of&#xD;
      subjects treated with TTFields was compared to those treated with an effective best standard&#xD;
      of care chemotherapy (including bevacizumab). TTFields arm subjects had comparable overall&#xD;
      survival to subjects receiving the best available chemotherapy in the US today. Similar&#xD;
      results showing comparability of TTFields to best standard of care (BSC) chemotherapy were&#xD;
      seen in all secondary endpoints. Recurrent GBM patients treated with TTFields in this trial&#xD;
      experienced fewer side effects in general, significantly fewer treatment related side&#xD;
      effects, and significantly lower gastrointestinal, hematological and infectious adverse&#xD;
      events compared to controls. The only device-related adverse events seen were a mild to&#xD;
      moderate skin irritation beneath the device electrodes. Finally, quality of life measures&#xD;
      were better in TTFields Therapy subjects as a group when compared to subjects receiving&#xD;
      effective best standard of care chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, an interim analysis of a large ongoing phase III trial in newly diagnosed GBM&#xD;
      showed that adding TTFields to the standard of care temozolomide chemotherapy significantly&#xD;
      prolonged patients' progression free survival and overall survival. An independent data&#xD;
      monitoring committee recommended to stop the trial for early success. The FDA approved cross&#xD;
      over of control arm patients to the TTFields arm of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in this trial are diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma. In&#xD;
      addition, all patients must meet all eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be enrolled, baseline tests will be performed and the patients will be&#xD;
      treated continuously with the device concomitant with weekly pemetrexed and cisplatin or&#xD;
      carboplatin until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TTFields treatment will consist of wearing four electrically insulated electrode arrays on&#xD;
      the thorax. Electrode array placement will require shaving of the chest/back as necessary&#xD;
      before and during the treatment. After an initial short visit to the clinic for training and&#xD;
      monitoring, patients will be released to continue treatment at home where they can maintain&#xD;
      their regular daily routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial the patient will need to return once every 3 weeks to the clinic where an&#xD;
      examination by a physician and a routine laboratory examinations will be done. These routine&#xD;
      visits will continue for as long as the patient's disease is not progressing. A routine CT&#xD;
      scan of the chest and abdomen will be performed at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter,&#xD;
      until disease progression. After this follow up plan, patients will be contacted once per&#xD;
      month by telephone to answer basic questions about their health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on&#xD;
      metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of&#xD;
      electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic&#xD;
      particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues.&#xD;
      TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their&#xD;
      direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (150&#xD;
      thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects&#xD;
      on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the&#xD;
      intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breakthrough finding made by Novocure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very&#xD;
      low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are&#xD;
      multiplying, TTFields cause the building blocks of these cells to move and pile up in such a&#xD;
      way that the cells physically explode. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature&#xD;
      building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to&#xD;
      place. TTFields cause these tiny motors to fall apart since they have a special type of&#xD;
      electric charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of these two effects, cancer tumor growth is slowed and can even reverse after&#xD;
      continuous exposure to TTFields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells&#xD;
      since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to&#xD;
      a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, TTFields hold the promise of serving as a brand new cancer treatment with very&#xD;
      few side effects and promising affectivity in slowing or reversing this disease.&#xD;
