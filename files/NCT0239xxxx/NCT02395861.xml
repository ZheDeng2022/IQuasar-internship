  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe diseases in intensive care unit (ICU) patients are associated with a high mortality&#xD;
      rate which nevertheless remains difficult to predict. Recently, the abolition of some&#xD;
      brainstem reflexes at clinical examination of ICU patients within the first 24 hours after&#xD;
      has been shown of prognostic value in ICU patients requiring sedation. Early abolition of the&#xD;
      cough reflex was associated with an increase in mortality and that of the oculocephalic&#xD;
      reflex was predictive of coma or delirium after sedation has been stopped. A dysfunction of&#xD;
      the brainstem may account for these results and be present in other patient subpopulations,&#xD;
      particularly those who do not receive iv sedation or the brain injured patients, who were&#xD;
      eluded from the previous study. This dysfunction could take place in the muti-organ failure&#xD;
      characteristic of the severe ICU patient. On the other hand, a preliminary study performed on&#xD;
      somatosensory evoked potentials has shown that a latency of the P14 wave greater than 16 ms&#xD;
      between day 1 and day 3 after admission was associated with death at 28 days. The primary&#xD;
      goal of this project is to confirm this hypothesis. By studying the clinical and&#xD;
      electrophysiological responses of the brainstem in ICU patients, with or without brain&#xD;
      injury, with alteration of consciousness in relation or not with sedation. The other&#xD;
      objectives are to determine the correlations between neurophysiological clinical&#xD;
      neurological, or neuroradiological data with delirium occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine, in ICU patients with or without brain&#xD;
      injury and with alteration of consciousness in relation or not with sedation, if abolition of&#xD;
      the cough reflex at Day 1 after admission is predictive of mortality at 28 days, independent&#xD;
      from cause for admission and severity.&#xD;

      Adult Medical or surgical, brain-injured or not, ICU patients requiring invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation for at least 48 hours and with alteration of consciousness induced or not by&#xD;
      sedatives. Inclusion will take place at the 24th hour (± 12) after admission into the ICU&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Those patients with either pregnancy, post anoxic coma, brain death,&#xD;
      pre-existing neurologic disease disturbing the interpretation of the brainstem reflexes&#xD;
      (Guillain-Barre, myasthenia, gravis, brain tumor, inflammatory or degenerating disease of the&#xD;
      posterior fossa, acute peripheral neurologic disease), or declined participation will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements will be based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      D1 : Demographic data, cause for admission, brainstem reflexes, Glasgow Coma Scale score,&#xD;
      Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) , Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS),&#xD;
      Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS), simplified index of gravity (IGS 2) score, Sequential Organ&#xD;
      Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, cumulated sedative doses and Secondary Systemic Cerebral&#xD;
      Aggressions (ACSOS) parameters D3 : parameters of D1, electrophysiologic analyses:&#xD;
      Electroencephalogram (EEG), auditory evoked potentials (EAEP), Somatosensory Evoked Potential&#xD;
      (SEP), recording of clinico-biological data, Cognitive evoked potentials (CEP) in patients&#xD;
      with consciousness alteration still on mechanical ventilation at day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D1-D28 : date of death, date of extubation, SOFA, CAM-ICU, cumulated doses of sedatives and&#xD;
      analgesics, duration of sedation, occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia after Day 2, brain&#xD;
      imaging data if available.&#xD;
