      The first-in-man study are designed as below to assess safety, tolerability, and preliminary&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of ZL-2102.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled ascending single oral doses (Part 1,&#xD;
           ZL-2102-SAD);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover (Part 2,&#xD;
           ZL-2102-FED);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled, ascending repeated oral doses for 14 days&#xD;
           (Part 3, ZL-2102-MAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 104 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 3 parts to the study. Subjects will be randomized to receive ZL-2102 or matching&#xD;
      placebo (3: 1 ratio) in Parts 1 and Part 3 of the study. Subjects in Part 2 will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive ZL-2102 in each possible treatment sequence (fed/fasted or&#xD;
      fasted/fed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1 (ZL-2102-SAD), the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the study drug or&#xD;
      placebo will be tested after a single dose in the form of a capsule when given after an&#xD;
      overnight fast. There will be 7 groups. Groups 1 to 7 will have a total of 8 participants in&#xD;
      each group, with 56 participants total in all 7 groups. Each group will receive a different&#xD;
      dose of the study drug or placebo in the following order of strength: 5, 20, 60, 150, 300,&#xD;
      500, 750 mg. Plasma samples will be collected in&#xD;
      0H,0H30M,1H,2H,3H,4H,5H,6H,8H,10H,12H,16H,24H,48H and on Day 8. Urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected at 0-4,4-8,8-12,12-24,24-28H intervals. Subjects will be confined to the unit for 3&#xD;
      days and the follow-up observation period is 7 days after the administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study (ZL-2102-FED) will test the effect of a high-fat meal on safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the study drug after a single dose in 12 healthy male&#xD;
      subjects. Choice of dose of ZL-2102 will be made based on review of the blinded preliminary&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics data in Part 1. No subjects will receive placebo in&#xD;
      Part 2. Two single doses separated by at least a 7-day wash-out period. One dose will be&#xD;
      given under fed (standardized high-fat breakfast) and one will be under fasted conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 of the study (ZL-2102-MAD) will test the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      the study drug after repeated doses of the study drug. Three dose level groups (9 active and&#xD;
      3 placebo) with 12 healthy male subjects will be enrolled.Choice of the actual daily ZL-2102&#xD;
      doses will be made based upon a review of the blinded preliminary safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics data in Part 1. Three ascending once-daily repeated doses of ZL-2102 or&#xD;
      placebo for 14 days or, alternatively, twice daily for 14 days if indicated by&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics parameters from Part 1 (ZL-2102-SAD). If the dose needs to be twice daily,&#xD;
      the total daily doses will be given half in the morning and half in the evening 12 hours&#xD;
      later. Dose will be administered either under fed or fasted conditions depending on blinded&#xD;
      Part 2 (ZL-2102-FED) results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in Linear Clinical Research Ltd.by Principle Investigator Janakan&#xD;
      Krishnarajah,MD and his team.&#xD;
