&#xD;
          2. Have failed or are not a candidate for drug treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is willing to provide Informed Consent, is geographically stable, understands&#xD;
             the requirements for completing the bladder diary and is willing to comply with the&#xD;
             required diary, follow up visits and testing schedules&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ambulatory without the aid of walking assistance a majority of the time (cane, walker&#xD;
             etc.) and able to use toilet without assistance&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Post-void residual (PVR) ≤ 100 ml NOTE: Subjects with a single PVR of &gt;100 ml followed&#xD;
             by two consecutive PVR measurements of ≤100 ml may be included in the study. The final&#xD;
             acceptable PVR measurement will be recorded in the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability and willingness to self-catheterize in case this is necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. 3 day Bladder Diary Criteria: Symptoms of OAB as evidenced by: Micturition frequency&#xD;
             of ≥ 8 times/day And &gt; 3 episodes of urgency urinary incontinence (UUI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject will be excluded if ANY of the following conditions apply:&#xD;

          2. Current participation in any other conflicting interventional or OAB treatment study&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Primary complaint of stress urinary incontinence or stress predominant mixed&#xD;
             incontinence or functional incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any invasive or surgical intervention (e.g., radio frequency, implant, sling)&#xD;

             screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Receiving electro-stimulation (e.g. PTNS or SNS) treatment within the last 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: Subjects with an implanted SNS device that has not been active in the last 15&#xD;
             days is acceptable for enrollment&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Anatomical conditions that would preclude the introduction and use of the device, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, such as significant pelvic organ prolapse, urogenital&#xD;
             prolapse visible at rest beyond the hymen, significant cystocele prolapse or high BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Current bleeding disorder or coagulopathies&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Current use of antimuscarinics, β3 agonist or antispasmodics NOTE: subjects on these&#xD;
             drugs must undergo a 2 week washout period prior to completing the baseline Bladder&#xD;
             Diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject has been previously diagnosed with interstitial cystitis, bladder cancer or&#xD;
             chronic pelvic pain syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
