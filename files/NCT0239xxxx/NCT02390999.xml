      3500 people suffer from out of hospital cardiac arrest each year in Denmark. Therapeutic&#xD;
      hypothermia to 33 degrees celsius is now standard treatment of comatose cardiac arrest&#xD;
      patients. The investigators are challenged in our attempt to predict outcome of these&#xD;
      patients by both low body temperature in itself and the sedative and relaxing drugs used to&#xD;
      keep the patient in a coma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a substudy in a large international multicenter randomized trial that&#xD;
      investigates the possible benefit of 48 hours of therapeutic hypothermia versus todays&#xD;
      standard of 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this substudy the investigators will approach early prediction of neurological outcome&#xD;
      using a combination of new examinations backed up by well established ones to engage this&#xD;
      challenge from different angles and find a battery of combined examinations, that together&#xD;
      will enable us to accurately predict outcome at an earlier stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our examinations have been chosen from the three fields of neurophysiology, biochemistry and&#xD;
      neurology and consist of electroencephalography (EEG), somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP),&#xD;
      biomarkers and clinical examinations such as brain stem reflexes chosen for their prognostic&#xD;
      reliability.&#xD;

      Neurological prognostication of patients in therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: In Denmark, approximately 3000 people suffer from cardiac arrest (CA) each year.&#xD;
      After CA with no blood flow for more than five minutes, cerebral ischemia, free radicals&#xD;
      along with other mediators creates chemical cascades during reperfusion that result in&#xD;
      cerebral injury and often severe neurologic impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has become standard treatment of comatose CA patients and this&#xD;
      has led to new challenges in the area of prognostication, because both the low temperature in&#xD;
      itself and the sedative and relaxing drugs used to keep the patient in a coma, affect the&#xD;
      examinations performed by the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This calls for a reevaluation of the existing prognostic examinations and the invention and&#xD;
      implementation of new ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new awareness towards a prognostic model involving several different modalities including&#xD;
      SSEP, EEG, biomarkers and clinical examinations is thus awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of EEG, SSEP, four biomarkers and five clinical&#xD;
      examinations and observations. We will evaluate our patients using the Glasgow-Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG The EEG analysis is today a qualitative analysis based on the assessment of a trained&#xD;
      specialist. New methods of EEG analysis are based on digital quantitative analyses and&#xD;
      therefore less sensitive to interpersonal differences and the uncertainty of subjective&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG reactivity is the observed change in EEG linked to a stimulation (fx noxious or auditory)&#xD;
      and is a promising predictor of outcome concerning CA patient with anoxic coma (1, 9). In&#xD;
      this study we will use power-spectral analyses in the assessment of EEG reactivity and&#xD;
      investigate the prognostic value of power analyses in the four frequency bands delta, theta,&#xD;
      alpha and beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain EEG-patterns, the malignant patterns, are predictors of bad neurological outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. burst-suppression pattern with discharges of epileptiform activity. (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Generalized suppression (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Isoelectric EEG pattern (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Electroencephalographic status epilepticus (ESE) on a flat background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It is possible to measure reactivity quantitatively in the EEG using power spectrum&#xD;
           analyses and it can be correlated to outcome after 6 months using the CPC scale&#xD;
           dichotomized in good (CPC 1-2) and poor (CPC 3-5) outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EEG has the same predictive value for good and bad outcome in the 48h group compared to&#xD;
           the 24h group using the dichotomized CPC-scale at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSEP: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials is an examination where the median nerve is stimulated&#xD;
      and cortical response (N20) is assessed. Bilateral absence of the N20 component of a SSEP is,&#xD;
      with one exception, invariably associated with bad outcome, CPC 4-5 (1, 2, 7). SSEP maintains&#xD;
      its high predictive value for bad outcome during hypothermia (7, 15) and only one case is&#xD;
      described where a patient has regained the N20 response after an initial bilaterally absent&#xD;
      response measured after 24 hours of hypothermia (106).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSEP is a more hardy examination than the EEG concerning medication and metabolic imbalances&#xD;
      and therefore more prognostically reliable when the response is absent (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The predictive value of bilaterally absence of SEP response for death or&#xD;
      permanent vegetative state (CPC4-5) is 100% at 24, 48 and 72 hours in both groups (24h and&#xD;
      48h hypothermia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological examination: The brainstem is more resistant to hypoxia than the cerebral cortex&#xD;
      which is why an absence of brainstem reflexes is a good predictor of bad outcome in comatose&#xD;
      patients. Several studies have shown that presence of myoclonias or seizures and absence of&#xD;
      corneal-, light- and oculocephalic reflexes along with absence of motor response to noxious&#xD;
      stimulation is strongly associated with severe neurological deficits, permanent vegetative&#xD;
      state or death after CA (1, 12, 15). Our aim is to validate the use of these neurological&#xD;
      examinations in prolonged hypothermia of 48 hours and to investigate the difference in&#xD;
      incidences in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There is a higher incidence of absent brainstem reflexes in the 24h group&#xD;
      compared to the 48h group evaluated at 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical markers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific biochemical markers have been demonstrated to have better predictive value than many&#xD;
      clinical examinations in prediction of poor outcome in patients who remain unconscious after&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Especially neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S-100B have&#xD;
      been used in prognostication of the comatose CA patient (3, 4, 8, 74, 14). Cut-off values&#xD;
      with a predictive value for bad outcome of 100% have been suggested, but because of the small&#xD;
      number of patients in most studies and failure to agree on which biochemical marker is the&#xD;
      best, new studies including NSE and S-100B along with testing of new biochemical markers are&#xD;
      needed. In this study we wish to compare the two new biochemical markers Copeptin and&#xD;
      NT-proBNP with NSE and S-100B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copeptin is released in response to stress and is a sensitive and stable surrogate marker for&#xD;
      arginine vasopressin release. Measurement of copeptin levels has been shown to be promising&#xD;
      as a prognostic marker in patients with CA and therapeutic hypothermia (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-type Natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac neurohormone synthesized in the ventricular&#xD;
      myocardium and secreted as a response to ventricular expansion and pressure overload (11).&#xD;
      The BNP level on arrival at the emergency room has been shown to be significantly higher&#xD;
      among patients who die of post-resuscitation syndrome, which is when reperfusion of ischemic&#xD;
      tissue occurs and cytokines and endotoxines are spread throughout the organism resulting in a&#xD;
      drop in cardiac output and cerebral blood flow. The ability of BNP to predict the degree of&#xD;
      post-resuscitation syndrome therefore makes it a promising neurologic biochemical marker (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSE is released because of neuronal damage and impairment of the blood-brain barrier&#xD;
      integrity can be detected by the release of NSE into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and eventually&#xD;
      into the blood. Increases in CSF and serum NSE levels have been reported after stroke, brain&#xD;
      injury, and CA (80). When used with GCS and SEP, NSE has been demonstrated to augment the&#xD;
      predictive value for neurological outcome (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein S100 beta (S100B) is expressed mainly in human astroglial cells and is a surrogate&#xD;
      marker for neuronal damage (13). S-100B rises to its peak-concentration quickly after the CA&#xD;
      thus, constant elevation of S100B level in serum reflects its continuous release from damaged&#xD;
      tissue and predicts bad outcome (13). S-100B serves as a prognostic predictor within 24 hours&#xD;
      after CA, and thus at an earlier stage than other factors like NSE (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to investigate the new prognostic markers Copeptin and NT-proBNP compared to NSE&#xD;
      and S-100B in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 48 hours of therapeutic hypothermia reduces the total release of NSE and S-100B compared&#xD;
           to 24 hours measured as area under the curve from 24 to 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The total release of NT-proBNP and Copeptin measured as area under the curve (AUC) is&#xD;
           significantly correlated to neurological outcome (dichotomized CPC score) after 6&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To find a cut-off-value for copeptin and NT-proBNP from samples taken at arrival to the&#xD;
           hospital that can predict good (CPC1-2) or bad (CPC 3-5) outcome with a false positive&#xD;
           rate of 0%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: EEG and SEP is performed on patients at 1: 12-24h after reaching of&#xD;
      target temperature (T0, 33 degrees celsius), 2: 36-48h and 3: 72-96h after T0 only on&#xD;
      comatose patients. During the EEG recording three sequences of 30 seconds with noxious&#xD;
      stimulation are marked and will be used later in the quantitative power-spectral analysis to&#xD;
      assess reactivity. All EEG's are assessed by a neurophysiologist as soon after the recording&#xD;
      as possible in order to see if ESE is present and if so, the treating physician will be&#xD;
      notified at once. The final interpretation of the EEG will be conducted blinded at a later&#xD;
      stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When analysing the EEG we will catalog benign and malignant patterns partly by using&#xD;
      Rossettis (9) simple and operational method and assessing the following parameters:&#xD;
      Reactivity to noxious stimulation, continuous background activity and ESE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months our patients will be categorized with the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral&#xD;
      Performance categories (CPC), in which 1 = good recovery, 2 = moderate disability, 3 = severe&#xD;
      disability with dependency for daily-life activity, 4 = vegetative state, and 5 = death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEP: Cortical N20 responses of median nerve SEPs are recorded with standard procedures during&#xD;
      hypothermia. SEP is performed maximum 3 times on each patient as described above. Recordings&#xD;
      are assessed by a neurophysiologist and documented as ''absent'' (bilaterally absent cortical&#xD;
      N20 responses after left and right median nerve stimulation, in the presence of a cervical&#xD;
      potential), ''present'' (cortical N20 response present on at least 1 side), or&#xD;
      ''undeterminable'' (technically insufficient recording). Undeterminable SEP results are&#xD;
      considered as present&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chosen examinations and analyses, apart from power-spectral analysis, are well known&#xD;
      standard examinations and are performed routinely in hospitals all over the world. EEG and&#xD;
      SEP are performed by medical student Kristoffer Nøhr and physician Christophe Duez. The&#xD;
      interpretation is done by a neurophysiologist and Christophe Duez will participate&#xD;
      increasingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical markers: NT-proBNP, NSE, S-100B and Copeptin are all taken at hospital admission,&#xD;
      24h, 48h and 72h. NT-proBNP is furthermore taken at 96h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: EEG is blinded to the treating physician unless ESE is present. All primary SEP are&#xD;
      blinded to the treating physician. If SEP is performed at 72h it is unblinded. All&#xD;
      biochemical markers are blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The QEEG study is a study of a new method in the context of CA and data&#xD;
      is therefore not available for statistical analysis. If there is no difference in outcome&#xD;
      between the 24h and the 48h group we will pool our data and if not we will analyse each group&#xD;
      separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study on clinical neurological examinations, classical EEG and biochemical&#xD;
      samples will be to generate new hypotheses as our power assessments are not strong enough&#xD;
      when we assess each examination one by one. We still believe however that the examinations&#xD;
      are highly relevant when investigating the additive effect of a multimodal examination and&#xD;
      not many studies have investigated such an important body of examinations within the same&#xD;
      study. Furthermore we have no data of this kind on patients treated with prolonged&#xD;
      hypothermia of 48 hours since it has never been done in a randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be possible to enrol 100 patients in 2 years in the study based on the patient flow&#xD;
      of Aarhus University Hospital and we believe that 50 patients in either group will be&#xD;
      sufficient for a basic validation of well established examinations as well as new ones and to&#xD;
      form a basis for generating new hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic studies of this kind have not been performed previously in Denmark and we see a&#xD;
      unique opportunity in this patient group to create a basis for new studies in the area of&#xD;
      neuro-prognostics in Emergency Medicine and Intensive Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is written with biostatistical assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective: The aim of this study is to contribute to the understanding of how a longer&#xD;
      period of therapeutic hypothermia affects some of the examinations used in neurological&#xD;
      prognostic after CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the future we expect EEG, SEP clinical examination and biochemical markers to become a&#xD;
      more integrated part of a faster and more precise neurologic prognostication to guide the&#xD;
      physician in his decisions concerning discontinuation of intensive therapy. This will be of&#xD;
      benefit on many levels because financial implications of caring for patients in a vegetative&#xD;
      state or prolonged impaired consciousness are substantial, family members yearn to know what&#xD;
      functional outcome they can expect from their loved ones and maybe most important; the&#xD;
      patients themselves can be spared suffering and unfruitful continuation of therapy.&#xD;
