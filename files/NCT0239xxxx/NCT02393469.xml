  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has shown a progressive increase of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, suggesting that the lung as a single therapeutic target, has not&#xD;
      contributed in the past 20 years, significant changes to the natural evolution of the&#xD;
      disease. Direct treatment for systemic changes and comorbidities, in fact, the most&#xD;
      responsible for high rates of treatment failure could mean a new hope of life for individuals&#xD;
      with COPD. This research project characterized as interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary&#xD;
      program will be headquartered in Pulmonary Rehabilitation of the Santa Cruz Hospital which&#xD;
      has partnerships with local companies . Its main objective will be to analyze&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory and functional capacity in COPD patients not rehabilitated and&#xD;
      rehabilitated after the period from 02 to 12 months of treatment in a Pulmonary&#xD;
      Rehabilitation program in the municipality of Santa Cruz do Sul - Rio Grande do Sul. Will be&#xD;
      included in this survey of COPD patients who were referred to a rehabilitation program with a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of disease. In research activities to assess cardiorespiratory and&#xD;
      functional capacity of COPD, pre and post-program (02 and 12 months) are provided for&#xD;
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation. The research subjects will also be subjected to physical exercise&#xD;
      protocol as recommended by the GOLD (2009), a period of eight weeks, often 2x / week, where&#xD;
      their vital signs are measured before, during and after each session. Thus, it is believed&#xD;
      that it will be possible to refine the knowledge of mechanisms by which the judicious use of&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation can control the progression of COPD.&#xD;

      Selection of project participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD, duly diagnosed with proof of spirometric lung function, who are receiving outpatient&#xD;
      care at the Hospital Santa Cruz (HSC) to compose the control group will be selected. For&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Pulmonary Group fase 01 (GRP1) and Rehabilitation Pulmonary Group fase 02&#xD;
      (GRP2) will be selected COPD patients who participate in the program Rehabilitation Pulmonary&#xD;
      occurring within the HSC, in the municipality of Santa Cruz do Sul - Rio Grande do Sul. The&#xD;
      sample size calculation is performed according to the primary endpoint of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals involved in the project have signed a term of informed consent and answer a&#xD;
      questionnaire of personal health, containing demographic information, exposure to radiation&#xD;
      and drugs, as well as eating habits and consumption of alcohol and cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodological steps of the study will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Selection of subjects according to the criteria of inclusion and exclusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. As an outpatient treatment without Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) assess lung volumes,&#xD;
           respiratory muscle strength, dyspnea for Medical Research Council (MRC), functional&#xD;
           capacity for Functional Independence Measurement (MIF) and Six Minutes Walk Test (6MWT),&#xD;
           grip strength, Quality of Life (QoL), body mass index (BMI), and ankle-brachial index&#xD;
           (ITB);&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) As a submission to Rehabilitation Pulmonary after 02 months of treatment to assess lung&#xD;
      volumes, respiratory muscle strength, MRC, functional capacity (MIF and 6MWT), grip strength,&#xD;
      QoL, BMI, and ITB; 5) As a submission in Rehabilitation Pulmonary after 12 months of&#xD;
      treatment to assess lung volumes, respiratory muscle strength, MRC, functional capacity (MIF&#xD;
      and 6MWT), grip strength, QoL, BMI, and ITB&#xD;
&#xD;
      Techniques and tools for collecting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung volumes Lung volumes will be assessed through digital spirometry (EasyOne ®, Model 2001,&#xD;
      Zurich, Switzerland). It is a tool to provide a record of several volumes and airflows that&#xD;
      an individual is able to mobilize, as the gold standard for assessment of pulmonary functions&#xD;
      according to the International Guidelines of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive&#xD;
      Lung Disease (GOLD, 2011). Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one&#xD;
      second (FEV1), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF 25% -75%), FEV/FVC&#xD;
      relationship, (In the present study, the following variables will be evaluated FEV1 / FVC)&#xD;
      and peak expiratory flow (PEF) (GONTIJO, 2011). Three measures and the curve that presents&#xD;
      the best performance will be compared with the predicted values in the literature and&#xD;
      described in percentage of predicted will be realized (Pereira et al., 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory Muscle Strength (FMR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FMR (MIP and MEP) will be evaluated through digital manometer (MDI®, Porto Alegre,&#xD;
      Brazil). The MIP will be obtained after the individual expiration to residual volume (RV),&#xD;
      the examiner connected with the nose clip and requested inspiration to total lung capacity&#xD;
      (TLC). The MEP will be evaluated after the Total Lung Capacity inspiration to the residual&#xD;
      volume the mouthpiece (ATS, 2002). For data analysis, will be considered the highest value&#xD;
      among the five maneuvers, which did not differ more than 10% of the second highest value in&#xD;
      descending order. These values are then compared with those reported in the literature (NEDER&#xD;
      et al., 1999) and expressed as percentage of predicted. It is noteworthy that for these&#xD;
      measures, the patient will remain in sitting position in the chair or sitting on the bed with&#xD;
      an inclination of 45 °.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional dyspnea&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRC (Medical Research Council), which is a British medical institute, developed a scale&#xD;
      to graduate dyspnea in patients with COPD. The MRC scale is used for decades and has been&#xD;
      adapted into Portuguese and published in published in the II Brazilian Consensus on COPD&#xD;
      (2004). Patients were originally categorized into five grades, ranging from 1 (&quot;normal&quot;) to 5&#xD;
      (&quot;very dyspneic to leave the house&quot;). The scale focuses primarily on dyspnoea occurring on&#xD;
      walks. The MRC scale is widely used in patients with COPD due to its simplicity, ease of use&#xD;
      and correlation with quality of life and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional capacity is the independence of an individual to accomplish their mental and&#xD;
      physical activities to maintain their basic and instrumental activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an assessment tool for people in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation process, part of the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation (SUDRM)&#xD;
      and is widely used and accepted internationally as a measure of functional assessment. Is&#xD;
      linked to mobility and functional capacity in which the individual does not require help to&#xD;
      perform the same, ie, independence supposed to satisfactory performance of motor and&#xD;
      cognitive tasks conditions. The use of the scale focuses on the effective realization of&#xD;
      activities independently in daily routine. So lets documenting their sensitivity to&#xD;
      functional acquisitions and its correlation with functional levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of dependence is classified according to the functional independence measure. This&#xD;
      instrument consists of six dimensions: self-care, sphincter control, transfers, locomotion,&#xD;
      communication and social cognition. Each item scores from 1 (total dependence) to 7 (complete&#xD;
      independence). Obtain minimum total score of 18 and maximum of 126 points that characterize&#xD;
      the levels of dependence. Through the individual score will be classified as follows: mild&#xD;
      disability (&gt; 80 points), moderate disability (40-80 points) or severe disability (&lt;40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform the 6MWT is the standard protocol used ATS Six-Minute Walk Test (2002). The 6MWT&#xD;
      will be held itself, 02 tests, a practice test for educational purposes and another 6MWT,&#xD;
      which will be validated for the collected information of the distance walked in six minutes&#xD;
      and done. Standard phrases of encouragement will be given by the examiner and if necessary,&#xD;
      subjects receive during testing, supplemental oxygen (O2) to maintain a peripheral O2&#xD;
      saturation above 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamometry Manual&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of peripheral muscle strength by Dynamometry Manual (DM) appears as a simple,&#xD;
      objective, low cost alternative and less invasive to measure maximal voluntary handgrip&#xD;
      strength and its principle to estimate the function of skeletal muscle. The dynamometer is a&#xD;
      device simple to use, and provides fast and direct reading. This test enables indicating&#xD;
      health risks related to muscle strength and correlated to other skeletal muscles in the human&#xD;
      body, and is considered a good indicator for the overall muscle strength and also to assess&#xD;
      physical performance in several clinical situations. Conform the American Society of Hand&#xD;
      Therapist (ASHT), for measuring handgrip, patients should be seated comfortably with adducted&#xD;
      and neutrally rotated, elbow flexed at 90 °, with arm in neutral pronation-supination and&#xD;
      shoulder wrist joint between 0 ° and 30 ° of extension. The procedure should be performed&#xD;
      three times in both limbs (right and left) the average of the measurements of each hemibody&#xD;
      being calculated separately and given a resting time of 60 seconds between ume measurement&#xD;
      and another quoted by.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life (QOL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) which is specific for the&#xD;
      assessment of QoL in patients with COPD will be used. This questionnaire consists of 76 items&#xD;
      and is divided into 03 domains (symptoms, activity and impact of the disease). For each&#xD;
      domain, the items are coded and transformed into a scale of zero (worst QOL) to 100 points&#xD;
      (best QoL), according to the standardization of the Manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most widely used anthropometric measurements to assess nutritional status are: weight,&#xD;
      height, circumferences (arm and waist), arm length and skinfold thicknesses (triceps, biceps,&#xD;
      subscapular, suprailiac). Through the combination of these measures is possible to calculate&#xD;
      the weight / height, arm muscle circumference and arm fat index relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements are easy to perform and relatively sensitive to evaluate adult&#xD;
      patients hospitalized in isolation as malnutrition. The body mass index (BMI), expressed as&#xD;
      the relationship between body mass in kg and height in m2, is widely used as an indicator of&#xD;
      nutritional status for its good correlation with body mass and low correlation with height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ABI is a noninvasive measurement of peripheral arterial disease is highly predictive of&#xD;
      subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. It is the&#xD;
      relationship between the (maximum) of the ankle systolic blood pressure (right and left) and&#xD;
      the (maximum) arm systolic blood pressure (right and left) with the patient at rest which is&#xD;
      taken as a reference the largest value observed among measured the sides. Gauging the&#xD;
      (maximum) systolic blood pressure of lower limbs is taken through the ankle being performed&#xD;
      using a Doppler Vascular Portable and upper limbs with a sphygmomanometer. It will be noted&#xD;
      that the ankle pressure is generally higher, then a ratio of 1 to 1.1 is normal. It is&#xD;
      noteworthy that a lower index 0.9 provides strong evidence of peripheral arterial disease,&#xD;
      thus the lower the value, the more severe the disease, as this reduction is due to the&#xD;
      presence of arterial obstruction in the lower limb. This index is strongly associated with&#xD;
      the incidence of strongly related to the individual's functional capacity Arterial Chronic&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain the WHR, the waist is measured at the narrowest part of the waist, between the last&#xD;
      rib and the iliac crest and hip circumference is taken at the widest area of the hips and the&#xD;
      largest protuberance of the buttocks. Then divide the waist measurement by the hip&#xD;
      measurement. WHO defines the indices of&gt; 9.0 in men and&gt; 8.5 in women as a crucial&#xD;
      relationship to the metabolic syndrome. Studies confirm and cite several other studies that&#xD;
      show that WHR is superior to predict all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality clinical&#xD;
      measure. Another Study add that the hip circumference indicates a lower risk of body fat&#xD;
      accumulation and thus include it in the waist-hip ratio equation improves the accuracy of the&#xD;
      measurement technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactate analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conjunction with the 6MWT, the measure of capillary lactate could estimate muscle&#xD;
      metabolism profile of COPD patients, since his early increase before the physical exertion&#xD;
      seems to be associated with changes in muscle metabolism, observable loss of oxidative&#xD;
      activity of skeletal muscle . The measurement will be performed after obtaining a drop of&#xD;
      capillary blood from the tip of the second finger of the nondominant hand for analysis of&#xD;
      lactate at rest and after the 6MWT, the pre-Rehabilitation Pulmonary intervals, 02, and 12&#xD;
      months post-Rehabilitation Pulmonary, (Lct) on the in lactate analyzer Accutrend Plus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group of patients undergoing Rehabilitation Pulmonary will carry out the intervention&#xD;
      protocol as recommended by the GOLD (2009). Will undergo submaximal aerobic training for&#xD;
      30-40 minutes strength training for upper and lower limbs, muscle stretching, nutritional and&#xD;
      pharmacological monitoring and continuing education sessions, twice a week. Such measures&#xD;
      will be carried out under the Hospital Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz do Sul - Rio Grande do Sul.&#xD;
