    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer is adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy combined with 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in early&#xD;
      stage breast cancer has the advantages of i) tumour downsizing, ii) higher breast&#xD;
      conservation rates, and iii) enabling the evaluation of tumour biology. Pathologic complete&#xD;
      response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be an independent, strong&#xD;
      predictor of outcome in operable HER2-positive breast cancer. The addition of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      anti-HER2 therapy to chemotherapy results in a 2-3 fold increase in pCR rates in operable&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer. However, the optimal neoadjuvant regimen has not been defined in&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer. The investigators recently completed a phase II study of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant lapatinib combined with weekly paclitaxel/ carboplatin in stage I-III&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer. Preliminary analysis suggested that the utility of the regimen&#xD;
      might have been limited by its unfavourable efficacy/ toxicity ratio. ASLAN001 is a small&#xD;
      molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against HER1, HER2, and HER4. Preclinical data have shown&#xD;
      ASLAN001 to be more potent than lapatinib and neratinib in inhibiting HER1 and HER2, and&#xD;
      early phase clinical studies have demonstrated superior pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      target inhibition compared to lapatinib. Furthermore, ASLAN001 has demonstrated a better&#xD;
      safety profile than lapatinib in early phase studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The investigators hypothesize that ASLAN001 combined with paclitaxel/carboplatin will&#xD;
      induce favorable pathological complete response (of at least 30%) in stage I-III HER2&#xD;
      positive breast cancer, with a more favourable safety profile than lapatinib combined with&#xD;
      paclitaxel/carboplatin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide, with approximately&#xD;
      800, 000 breast cancer deaths annually projected to occur in 2030 globally[1]. Activation and&#xD;
      over-expression of oncogenes encoding trans-membrane receptor tyrosine kinases of the&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, including ErbB1 (also known as HER1/EGFR) and&#xD;
      ErbB2 (also known as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 or HER2), play an important&#xD;
      role in the development of breast cancer. Overexpression of HER2 has been shown to be a poor&#xD;
      prognostic indicator associated with increased relapse rates and poorer overall survival in&#xD;
      breast cancer. Several therapeutic strategies have been developed to block HER2 signaling&#xD;
      pathways in order to improve the treatment of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab is a recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular&#xD;
      domain of the HER2 protein. Treatment with trastuzumab improves the outcomes of women with&#xD;
      HER2 over-expressing early stage and metastatic breast cancer (MBC) [3, 4]. The current&#xD;
      standard of care for stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer patients is the addition of 1&#xD;
      year of adjuvant trastuzumab to chemotherapy [5]. This results in a 40-50% improvement in 5-&#xD;
      year disease-free survival (DFS), and 30% improvement in 5-year overall survival (OS) over&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative (primary or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy which is the standard therapy for patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced breast cancer, is increasingly used in patients with operable breast&#xD;
      cancer [15]. Randomised trials comparing preoperative and adjuvant chemotherapy for early&#xD;
      operable breast cancer demonstrated that preoperative chemotherapy has several potential&#xD;
      advantages over the adjuvant approach. It significantly increased the rate of breast&#xD;
      conserving surgery over mastectomy. Pathological complete response following preoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the breast and lymph nodes significantly predicted better patient survival.&#xD;
      Furthermore, preoperative chemotherapy was associated with fewer adverse events (AEs) [16,&#xD;
      17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data have prompted the increasing use of preoperative chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      operable breast cancer. Given the increasingly important role of anti-HER2 therapy in both&#xD;
      early and advanced stage HER2-positive breast cancer, our aim is to expand current&#xD;
      therapeutic options by developing an efficacious and tolerable combination of chemotherapy&#xD;
      and targeted therapy. In the neoadjuvant setting, the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy&#xD;
      has been reported to result in a 2-3 fold increase in pCR rates in operable HER2-positive&#xD;
      breast cancer [18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the optimal neoadjuvant regimen for early stage HER2-positive breast cancer has yet&#xD;
      to be defined. We recently completed a phase II study of neoadjuvant weekly paclitaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin in combination with lapatinib in patients with stage I-III HER2-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer. Pathologic complete response rates were lower than expected (11.1%) due to a high&#xD;
      proportion of locally advanced tumours. In addition, dose interruptions and reductions were&#xD;
      common, and dose intensity was difficult to maintain. Grade 3 and above non-hematologic&#xD;
      toxicities occurred in 19.4% and common toxicities (¬&gt;20%) included diarrhea (80%),&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy (65.7%), rash (57.1%), nausea (40%), fatigue (40%), vomiting (34.3%),&#xD;
      non-neutropenic infections (25%) and transaminitis (22.8%) [19]. ASLAN001 is a small molecule&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor against HER1, HER2, and HER4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data have shown ASLAN001 to be more potent than lapatinib and neratinib in&#xD;
      inhibiting HER1 and HER2, and early phase clinical studies have demonstrated superior&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic target inhibition compared to lapatinib. Furthermore,&#xD;
      ASLAN001 has demonstrated a better safety profile than lapatinib in early phase studies. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the novel combination of ASLAN001 with weekly paclitaxel/carboplatin will&#xD;
      induce favorable pathological complete response (of at least 30%) in stage I-III HER2&#xD;
      positive breast cancer, with a more favourable safety profile than lapatinib combined with&#xD;
      paclitaxel/carboplatin. All patients will receive 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab following&#xD;
      completion of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy post-operatively, in accordance with&#xD;
      standard practice.&#xD;
