      Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) - bleeding into the normal fluid spaces (ventricles)&#xD;
      within the brain - is associated with a high risk of death or significant long-term&#xD;
      disability. IVH leads to an increase pressure within the head and triggers inflammation and&#xD;
      swelling in the surrounding brain. The ideal treatment for IVH would both rapidly relieve&#xD;
      pressure and safely remove as much blood as possible to prevent any further injury to the&#xD;
      brain. Currently, patients are managed by inserting a tube into the ventricle that drains&#xD;
      fluid to the outside and helps reduce pressure, but does not address the blood clot itself,&#xD;
      which naturally dissolves only over several days or weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, these drains frequently block because of blood clots that for within them. If&#xD;
      that occurs a repeat operation is required to replace them. Experimental treatments include&#xD;
      infusing drugs to accelerate clot breakdown but this can nonetheless still take a number of&#xD;
      days and the process introduces a risk of infection and fresh bleeding. Surgery to remove the&#xD;
      blood clot is hazardous, technically challenging, and generally not very successful.&#xD;
      Therefore, at the present time, none of the available options achieve all the stated goals of&#xD;
      IVH treatment and there is an unmet need for better interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators propose to pilot a novel instrument that employs a high&#xD;
      pressure but very localised microjet of water to mechanically disrupt blood clots and then&#xD;
      sucks the debris away. This technique has been highly successful in reopening blocked&#xD;
      arteries in the heart and, importantly, does so without damaging the underlying vessel&#xD;
      lining. In the context of IVH, this should allow rapid removal of blood from the ventricles&#xD;
      while causing minimal trauma to the brain. Clearing the blood early will prevent the build-up&#xD;
      of pressure and inflammation, and improve the chances of patients making a good recovery.&#xD;

      Intraventricular Haemorrhage Approximately 30% of cases of spontaneous intracranial&#xD;
      haemorrhage or severe head injury are complicated by intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH).&#xD;
      Typically, IVH results from extension of deep intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) or aneurysmal&#xD;
      subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), though a third of patients may have primary IVH confined&#xD;
      solely the ventricular system. In the absence of a demonstrable angiographic abnormality IVH&#xD;
      is usually associated with deranged coagulation or vascular risk factors such as&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes, and smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both experimental and clinical studies have clearly demonstrated the independent effect of&#xD;
      the volume of haemorrhage on death and disability from IVH. In animals, injection of blood&#xD;
      into the lateral ventricle exhibits a dose-dependent increase in the risk of fatality, and&#xD;
      early thrombolysis of the simulated IVH reduces the severity of neurological deficit. In&#xD;
      retrospective reports of intracerebral haemorrhage patient series concomitant IVH&#xD;
      consistently emerges as a risk factor for greater mortality and poor functional outcome.&#xD;
      Similarly, multivariate analyses of data from the STICH and FAST prospective randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials of ICH management has provided conclusive evidence that the presence and&#xD;
      volume of IVH is a significant independent risk factor for mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal effects of IVH are mediated by intracranial hypertension and induction of&#xD;
      inflammation with oedema in the periventricular white matter and deep grey structures. Blood&#xD;
      within the ventricles blocks CSF pathways resulting in a sequence of hydrocephalus, acute&#xD;
      rise in intracranial pressure (ICP), reduced cerebral perfusion, with a risk of ischaemia,&#xD;
      and potential brainstem herniation. Exposure of the ependymal lining to blood initiates&#xD;
      inflammatory cascades and leucocyte infiltration into the adjacent brain, with ensuing tissue&#xD;
      injury, localised oedema, and eventually generalised brain swelling. Late effects of IVH&#xD;
      include scarring of the ventricles and obstruction of CSF absorption by blood breakdown&#xD;
      products, typically resulting in chronic hydrocephalus necessitating permanent CSF diversion&#xD;
      (shunting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Management of Intraventricular Haemorrhage The rapid onset of deleterious effects&#xD;
      after IVH supports the rationale of early intervention to relieve hydrocephalus and raised&#xD;
      ICP, and to reduce blood load and the resulting inflammation and oedema. In most&#xD;
      neurosurgical centres the prevailing treatment paradigm is insertion of a ventricular&#xD;
      catheter and external drainage to divert CSF and reduce ICP, though this can be of limited&#xD;
      efficacy with a large IVH as expansion and distortion of the ventricle by haematoma plays a&#xD;
      greater role in exerting mechanical pressure than obstructed CSF. Ventricular catheters also&#xD;
      frequently block with blood, necessitating repeated surgery for replacement. Furthermore,&#xD;
      this mode of treatment does not address the inflammatory effects of the haematoma itself,&#xD;
      which may persist for several days or weeks before complete reabsorption occurs. Infusions of&#xD;
      urokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator via an external drain to accelerate&#xD;
      clot lysis have shown promise, however, the effect is not immediate and serial treatments are&#xD;
      required, each with an attendant risk of infection and rebleeding. Several authors have&#xD;
      described transcortical or endoscopic surgical clot evacuation but such approaches are&#xD;
      technically demanding, have limited success in terms of the volume of haematoma removed, and&#xD;
      are not practicable in the emergency situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheolytic Thrombectomy Rheolytic thrombectomy (RT) involves a double-lumen endovascular&#xD;
      catheter that delivers multiple high-speed retrograde water jets to create a hydrodynamic&#xD;
      recirculation vortex that traps and mechanically fragments adjacent thrombus, with the&#xD;
      resulting debris evacuated via the continuous aspiration lumen. Safety studies have shown&#xD;
      that the technique causes minimal denuding of vascular endothelium with no difference in the&#xD;
      degree of vessel injury compared with traditional balloon thrombectomy. Clinically, RT has&#xD;
      principally been applied to endovascular extraction of acute thrombus in coronary arteries&#xD;
      and the results of large randomised controlled trials testify to a favourable safety profile.&#xD;
      RT has also been used successfully to treat intracranial dural sinus thrombosis, acute&#xD;
      internal carotid artery occlusion, and for recanalising blocked synthetic vascular grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These attractive features of RT suggest it may offer significant advantages over conventional&#xD;
      IVH treatment for rapidly removing clot from within the ventricle in a single procedure,&#xD;
      while at the same time causing minimal trauma to the ependymal lining and brain. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of RT therapy for adult IVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale There is an unmet need for interventions directed at early clot removal following&#xD;
      IVH. RT has proven effective and safe for intravascular thrombectomy and its features suggest&#xD;
      it has the potential to be similarly successful in the treatment of IVH. A pilot study is&#xD;
      indicated to establish feasibility and safety as a precursor to larger clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations Patients participating in this trial will have suffered major&#xD;
      intracranial haemorrhage with poor prospect of favourable neurological recovery even with&#xD;
      maximal current treatment. In this situation, the potential benefits of the RT outweigh the&#xD;
      foreseeable risks and on balance favour offering the study intervention to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will receive additional computed tomography (CT) scans&#xD;
      involving ionising radiation. These scans will exclude certain causes of haemorrhage&#xD;
      (aneurysm) that would preclude safely administering the RT therapy. Diagnosis of aneurysm&#xD;
      would however be of substantial benefit to the patient in determining their further clinical&#xD;
      management. Volume STEALTH CT scans will be obtained prior to surgery and at 24-48 hours&#xD;
      post-operatively to aid in navigating the RT catheter and to measure the degree of clot&#xD;
      evacuation. To guide the number of passes of the RT catheter an on-table CT scan may be&#xD;
      necessary intra-operatively. In total, the additional radiation dosage equates to&#xD;
      approximately 4 milliSieverts (mSv), equivalent to approximately 1.5 years background&#xD;
      radiation. Set against the potential benefits of RT this is not excessive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suitable for RT and fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will, because&#xD;
      of their condition, not be able to give informed consent. The nature of the pathology being&#xD;
      studied means that a trial of a novel treatment cannot first be conducted in patients able to&#xD;
      give their own consent. The investigators will approach family, relatives, and friends to&#xD;
      discuss patients' expressed wishes towards participating in research and proceed with&#xD;
      enrolment if the consultees are in agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;

           intraventricular haemorrhage, measured by computed tomography-based volumetric analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of using RT in adult intraventricular haemorrhage&#xD;

      Study Participants Overall Description of Participants Adult patients admitted in coma with&#xD;
      severe intraventricular haemorrhage requiring external ventricular drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Withdrawal Patients or their nominated consultee are free to withdraw from the study&#xD;
      at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be withdrawn from the study following baseline CT angiography if an aneurysm is&#xD;
      demonstrated that is thought to have possibly caused the IVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients withdrawn from the study prior to RT will be replaced to achieve to ensure a full&#xD;
      assessment of feasibility and safety can be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the study involves a one-time intervention it is not envisaged patients will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from follow-up after RT, unless requested by them or their nominated consultee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of the End of the Study The study will be terminated on completion of recruitment&#xD;
      and 6-month follow-up of 20 patients.&#xD;
