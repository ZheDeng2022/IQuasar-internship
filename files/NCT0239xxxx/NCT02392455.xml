    <textblock>
      This observational study will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of Vargatef&#xD;
      (Nintedanib) plus docetaxel in daily routine second-line treatment in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent NSCLC. Treatment with Vargatef in eligible NSCLC&#xD;
      patients, for whom the treating physician has decided to initiate treatment with Vargatef in&#xD;
      second line according to the local label, will be observed for up to 24 months. Survial&#xD;
      follow-up will be done until the end of the study.&#xD;
