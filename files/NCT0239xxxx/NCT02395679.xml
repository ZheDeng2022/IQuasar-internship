  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive pleural disease, related to asbestos exposure. At&#xD;
      present, cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only evidence based treatment for the disease, but&#xD;
      efficacy is limited. The investigators have shown both in a murine model, as for the first&#xD;
      time in patients, that dendritic cell-based immunotherapy induces tumor specific T-cell&#xD;
      responses. However the quality and quantity of the autologous tumor cell lysate to load the&#xD;
      dendritic cells was a major impediment for these trials. The investigators have now developed&#xD;
      a clinical grade allogeneic tumor cell lysate which can be used to load dendritic cells of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Objective: To investigate the safety of an allogeneic tumor cell lysate (PheraLys) loaded&#xD;
      onto autologous dendritic cells (MesoCancerVac) in patients with malignant mesothelioma (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A phase I study with a classical 3*3 design. Study population: Adult patients&#xD;
      with malignant mesothelioma who were treated with chemotherapy as standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: After chemotherapy, a leukapheresis is performed of which the monocytes are&#xD;
      used for differentiation to DCs using specific cytokines. Pulsed autologous DCs&#xD;
      (MesoCancerVac) are re-injected 3 times every two weeks. After the third injection with&#xD;
      MesoCancerVac, revaccinations to boost the immune system are given after 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The aim of this phase I protocol is to study the toxicity&#xD;
      and safety of MesoCancerVac (DC-based immunotherapy) in MM patients. Toxicities will be&#xD;
      scored according to common toxicity criteria version 4.0. The following toxicities occurring&#xD;
      during 8 weeks after the first vaccination, will be considered as dose-limiting toxicities&#xD;
      (DLTs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Patients have to undergo extra outdoor visits for this study (10-20) and extra&#xD;
      invasive procedures especially for this trial, like a catheter in a blood vessel. These are&#xD;
      invasive procedure but risks are limited. This iv entrance is necessary every time, for the&#xD;
      leukopheresis, for blood samples and for the injection of the dendritic cells. A&#xD;
      leucopheresis is a standard procedure and will be performed according to guidelines. There is&#xD;
      a limited risk for transient thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of autologous cells, that have been loaded with allogeneic human&#xD;
      materials, is a potential risk and that is the subject of the study. Because not the lysate&#xD;
      itself is administered to the patients but only when it is processed by the dendritic cells&#xD;
      of the patient the investigators expect these risks to be limited.&#xD;
