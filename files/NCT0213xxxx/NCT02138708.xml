      The purpose of this study is to assess the predictive performance of the pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      reactivity to acetylcholine, in the presence pulmonary arterial hypertension (estimated 1&#xD;
      year after the closure of the shunt).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in&#xD;
      patients with congenital heart disease with a shunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These congenital cardiac shunts are responsible for PAH, which evolves towards higher&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance if they are not closed early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with significant pulmonary flow and low pulmonary vascular resistance fully benefit&#xD;
      from surgical shunt closure with complete disappearance of pulmonary hypertension after&#xD;
      closure. In contrast, patients with low pulmonary flow and high pulmonary vascular resistance&#xD;
      will have no benefit because they keep a deleterious pulmonary hypertension after closure of&#xD;
      the shunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In certain situations, especially late discovery of heart disease, the issue of operability&#xD;
      of these patients is crucial because closing the shunt inappropriately worsens the&#xD;
      spontaneous prognosis. Currently, in case of doubt on the operability, there are several&#xD;
      clinical and hemodynamic criteria used empirically, but their predictive value is uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore necessary to stratify patients into operable and inoperable groups to improve&#xD;
      their overall outcome after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research project we propose to assess the predictive performance of the pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular reactivity to acetylcholine test on the presence of elevated PAH 1 year after the&#xD;
      closure of the shunt. This reactivity test will be evaluated on a population of patients for&#xD;
      whom the decision of the surgical closure of the shunt has been adjudicated on the basis of&#xD;
      explorations and usual tests (and therefore blind to the knowledge of the result of the&#xD;
      reactivity test). The test in this study is designed with repeated injections and increasing&#xD;
      doses with a continuous flow of acetylcholine in the left lower lobe of the pulmonary artery.&#xD;
      The last injection consisted with adenosine with inhaled O2/NO (potentiating effect) for&#xD;
      maximum vasodilatation. The parameter of interest is the Doppler flow velocity in the&#xD;
      pulmonary artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation by acetylcholine relative to the speed at&#xD;
      maximum vasodilatation (adenosine + in nitric oxide (NO) inhalation)&#xD;
