  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adipose and diabetic patients have glomerular hyperfiltration and enhanced reabsorption of&#xD;
      sodium in the kidney leading to fluid retention and hypertension. It is already known that&#xD;
      obese mice (db/db) have salt retention and elevated intrarenal angiotensin II , and that the&#xD;
      mechanism of the salt retention is similar to the one described in human beings. In&#xD;
      experimental study from 2009 done by Hirata K and al., published in Biochemical and&#xD;
      Biophysical Research Communications to both obese type 2 diabetic db/db mice and non-diabetic&#xD;
      db/m mice hypertension was artificially induced (acute sodium-loading and angiotensin&#xD;
      II-infusion). Two groups of mice were treated with exendin-4 or vehicle for 12 weeks. Obese&#xD;
      type 2 diabetic db/db mice show high salt-sensitivity. Exendin-4 demonstrated&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive effect in db/db mice and angiotensin II-infused mice, related to&#xD;
      attenuation of high salt-sensitivity. That observation confirmed that exendin-4, a GLP-1&#xD;
      (Glucagon-like peptide-1) analogue, has extra-islet effect including the regulation of salt&#xD;
      handling. More then ten years before mentioned observations the presence of GLP 1 receptors&#xD;
      was confirmed all over the body, also in kidneys. In 2004 Gutzwiller published a study in&#xD;
      Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism that examined 15 healthy subjects and 16&#xD;
      obese men (mean body mass index, 36 kg/m2) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover&#xD;
      study. After overnight fasting hypertonic saline was infuse followed by 3-h infusion of&#xD;
      GLP-1. Intravenous infusions of GLP-1 enhanced sodium excretion, reduced H+ secretion, and&#xD;
      reduced glomerular hyperfiltration in obese men. These findings suggest an action at the&#xD;
      proximal renal tubule and a potential renoprotective effect. Two years later same author with&#xD;
      colleagues published a new study in Digestion. In a part of new study he observed 8&#xD;
      volunteers. The protocol included intravenous salt load compared to the effect of an infusion&#xD;
      of GLP-to isotonic saline (placebo). Extracellular volume expansion induced by an intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of hypertonic saline was partially compensated by an increase in urinary sodium and&#xD;
      water excretion with GLP-1. He explained that volume expansion was associated with increased&#xD;
      renal perfusion, rise in glomerular filtration and the filtered sodium load. It was observed&#xD;
      that GLP-1 is able to increase renal sodium excretion by 69% and urine volume by 86%.&#xD;
      Considering all mentioned above it is obvious that GLP-1 have natriuretic effect, although&#xD;
      its exact mechanism and clinical usefulness remain unclear. Both GLP1 analogues and&#xD;
      inhibitors of DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4), elevate GLP1 level, and it would not be a&#xD;
      surprise to observe similar natriuretic effects in the body. Since GLP 1 is a peptide given&#xD;
      IV. or sc. there are on long-term studies that observe final possible effect no blood&#xD;
      pressure, but GLP1 analogues and DPP4 inhibitors enhancing the incretin action demonstrate&#xD;
      some antihypertensive properties. 2008 in a study done by Mistry GC and al., published in&#xD;
      Journal of Clinical Pharmacology antihypertensive effect of sitagliptin was observed. In&#xD;
      nineteen patients on stable treatment with antihypertensive agent(s) investigators found&#xD;
      small but statistically significant reductions of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. There&#xD;
      are no many definitive clues why the blood pressure should droop during any treatment that&#xD;
      elevates serum GLP1. At the end of 2009 an analysis was published in American Journal of&#xD;
      Hypertension, showing results from six trials including 2,171 subjects treated with exenatide&#xD;
      for at least 6. Again, a significantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure was&#xD;
      confirmed, not giving an explanation why it happened so. Finally, Prof. Sjöholm from&#xD;
      Karolinska institute Sweden published in Diabetes, obesity and metabolism a review concerning&#xD;
      impact of GLP-1 on endothelial function. He mentioned again decreased blood pressure through&#xD;
      improvements in diuresis and natriuresis, but he also added a new element, improved&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction through GLP-1 receptor-dependent pathway. Though there are many&#xD;
      speculations, exact antihypertensive effects and water homeostasis of both GLP-1 itself, also&#xD;
      of GLP1 analogues and DPP4 inhibitors is still unknown. Finally, recent review (Tanaka et&#xD;
      all) from 2011 confirms mentioned speculations regarding natriuretic effect of GLP1, quote …&quot;&#xD;
      Incretin mimetics and DPP-IV inhibitors are a novel class of antihypertensive drugs with&#xD;
      natriuretic properties. They can be used in the treatment of salt-sensitive hypertension,&#xD;
      which is characterized by edema. The idea is to investigate the effect of GLP1 on&#xD;
      diuresis/natriuresis compared with placebo in healthy non-obese people and to compare&#xD;
      natriuresis with GLP-1, BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) and ADH (antidiuretic hormone) levels&#xD;
      in serum.&#xD;

      This is a cross-over study. Totally 15 participants will be randomized (or other number later&#xD;
      determined by power test). The duration of the study is 9 days that will include 3 visits and&#xD;
      screening visit before starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening (day -1) Inclusion criteria are fulfilled before approaching Visit 1 on screening.&#xD;
      Participants are instructed do come next day fasting and to collect 24h of urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (day 1) Participant voluntarily agrees to participate by giving informed written&#xD;
      consent. Baseline study assessment is going to be performed fasting: blood count and&#xD;
      differential, blood chemistry (liver enzymes, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus,&#xD;
      magnesium, chloride, serum amorality, urea and creatinine, lipid panel including cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, HDL and LDL cholesterol, coagulation, uric acid, glucose and insulin, renin&#xD;
      activity, aldosterone, GLP1 level, T4 TSH-thyroid stimulating hormone, ADH, BNP) In the 24 h&#xD;
      urine collection sodium, chloride and calcium excretion, osmolality, creatinine are going to&#xD;
      be measured, glomerular filtration is going to be assessed by creatinine clearance, urin&#xD;
      analysis with microscopy is going to be preformed, EKG, kidney ultrasound together with 24-h&#xD;
      blood pressure monitor. HOMA2 (The Homeostasis Model Assessment ) index is calculated and a&#xD;
      total body water percentage determinated via Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis. All samples of&#xD;
      renin activity and aldosterone in a study are going to be taken while being in horizontal&#xD;
      position at least for 3 hours. Participants are going to be randomized regarding the glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test. First group it the one with fasting glucose 4,5 -5,7 mmol/L and at 2 hour&#xD;
      OGTT (the amount of sodium in OGTT fluid used is 0,4 mg of sodium and 0,3 mg of chloride in&#xD;
      0,2 L of water) glucose level below 7.8 mmol/l. The other group is the one with fasting&#xD;
      glucose from 5,7 to 7 mmol/l and/or at 2 hour OGTT glucose level form 7.8 mmol/l to 11,1&#xD;
      mmol/L (venous sample). Patients are instructed to come on the next day fasting again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (day 2) is a next study assessment: 24-h blood pressure monitor is removed, after the&#xD;
      overnight fast oral saline load is going to be given in a form of a standardized meal (soup)&#xD;
      in a amount of 12 g of NaCl (average daily intake of salt in Croatia). The soup is going to&#xD;
      be consumed in 30 minutes. Volunteers are going to be instructed to drink afterwards 1/2 L of&#xD;
      water during next 1 h. Placebo in a form iv infusion of hypertonic saline is going to be&#xD;
      given at a rate of 0.06 ml/kg/in and infused during 3 hours from beginning of oral sodium&#xD;
      load. During 6 hours (from oral sodium load) urine is gong to be collected. Finally, blood&#xD;
      samples are going to be drawn for glucose, insulin, sodium, potassium, serum osmolality,&#xD;
      serum creatinine, renin activity, and aldosterone, BNP, ADH and GLP1 level after 3 and 6&#xD;
      hours. Sodium, chloride and calcium excretion, osmolality and creatinine are going to be&#xD;
      measured in the urine after 3 hours. Patients are instructed to come again after 7 days&#xD;
      fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (day 9) after the overnight fast again oral sodium load is going to be given in a&#xD;
      form of a standardized meal (soup) in a same amount as previous day and again consumed in 30&#xD;
      minutes, they are going to drink afterwards 1/2 L of water during next 1 h like pervious day.&#xD;
      Synthetic GLP-1 (1.5 pmol/kg/min) dissolved in 500 ml 0.9% saline is going to be infused&#xD;
      during 3 hours from beginning of oral sodium load. During 6 hours (from oral sodium load)&#xD;
      urine is gong to be collected, blood samples are going to be drawn after 3 and 6 hours for&#xD;
      the same analysis as in Visit 2, just like urine collection after 6 hours.&#xD;
