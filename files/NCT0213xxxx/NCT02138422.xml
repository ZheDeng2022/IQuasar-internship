    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study will be to assess how effective Xilonix is in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with symptomatic colorectal cancer. By blocking a substance that helps&#xD;
      tumours grow and spread, Xilonix therapy may not only slow tumour growth, but also may&#xD;
      improve symptoms of muscle loss, fatigue, appetite loss, and pain in patients with colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. The effectiveness of the therapy will be measured by assessing the change in these&#xD;
      symptoms for patients treated with Xilonix versus those treated with placebo. Reversal of&#xD;
      muscle loss will be assessed with a type of X-ray called a DEXA scanner. Improvement in pain,&#xD;
      appetite loss, and fatigue will be measured with a questionnaire that is completed by&#xD;
      patients enrolled on the trial.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with pathologically confirmed colorectal carcinoma that is metastatic or&#xD;
             unresectable and which is refractory to standard therapy. To be considered refractory,&#xD;
             a subject must have failed both an oxaliplatin (oxaliplatin may have been in the&#xD;
             adjuvant setting) and an irinotecan based regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptomatic Disease: One symptom from each domain (metabolic and functional) must be&#xD;
             present.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of metabolic dysfunction, defined as the presence of one or more of the&#xD;
                  following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any degree (up to 20%) of unintentional total body weight loss in the previous 6&#xD;
                  months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum Interleukin 6 levels ≥10 pg/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of reduced function or presence of cancer related symptoms as determined&#xD;
                  by EORTC QLQ-C30.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Appetite reduction, with a score of &gt;10&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of fatigue, with a score of &gt;10&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of Pain, with a score of &gt;10&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Decreased Role, Emotional and Social function, with a score of &lt; 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 1 or 2.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Mechanical obstruction that would prevent adequate oral nutritional intake.&#xD;

          2. &gt;20% total body weight loss in the previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Serious uncontrolled medical disorder, or active infection, that would impair the&#xD;
             ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
