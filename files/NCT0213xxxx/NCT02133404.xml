      This study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, Cinacalcet hydrochloride-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group, dose-ascending study. Subjects judged to be eligible will be registered and&#xD;
      randomized into either ASP7991 group (receiving ASP7991 and cinacalcet-placebo) or Cinacalcet&#xD;
      group (receiving cinacalcet and ASP7991-placebo), and will receive 12-week (84 days)&#xD;
      administration of study drug from first dialysis day in a week (treatment period), in a&#xD;
      double-blind manner. The dose of the study drugs will be increased every 3 weeks in&#xD;
      dose-ascending manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessment will be performed before starting first dialysis in a week, 1 week (7&#xD;
      days) after the completion of the treatment period.&#xD;
