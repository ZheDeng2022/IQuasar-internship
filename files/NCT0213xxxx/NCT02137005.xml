  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate longitudinally, the walking ability of&#xD;
      individuals with cerebral palsy who are transitioning into adulthood and to cross-sectionally&#xD;
      examine the health status of these individuals in the context of their walking ability. Young&#xD;
      adults who received instrumented gait analysis (IGA) as children will show significant&#xD;
      decreases in overall gait performance, as measured by kinematics, kinetics, temporal-spatial&#xD;
      parameters, and gait deviation index, compared to their last childhood IGA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a prospective, longitudinal, cross-sectional, and&#xD;
      patient-centered outcome study of walking ability and current health status to investigate&#xD;
      important health outcomes that impact the quality of life, participation, and activity on&#xD;
      adults with cerebral palsy who took part in a gait analysis during childhood at the Center&#xD;
      for Gait and Movement Analysis (CGMA). The goal is to see whether their health and walking&#xD;
      ability has changed since leaving the Children's Hospital Colorado (CHCO) system and&#xD;
      understand if there is a relationship between maintaining proper walking ability and health&#xD;
      status. The investigators are including the measure of health outcomes to better understand&#xD;
      if a decline in walking ability relates to a decline in health status. The first aim is to&#xD;
      study the walking ability of adults with cerebral palsy by comparing their results of a gait&#xD;
      analysis to the same results collected when they were children. The second aim is to study&#xD;
      the presence of heart disease risk factors by testing each participant's blood levels of&#xD;
      lipids, glucose, and insulin. The investigators will also measure each participant's blood&#xD;
      pressure. The third aim is to study the relationship(s) between inflammatory markers,&#xD;
      neurotrophic factors, and pain and fatigue levels. The investigators will measure&#xD;
      inflammatory markers through a blood test and pain and fatigue levels through standardized&#xD;
      assessments. The fourth aim is to study each participant's mental health. The investigators&#xD;
      will measure this through standardized psychological assessments. The fifth aim is to study&#xD;
      each participant's self-perceived health and quality of life as well as employment status.&#xD;
      The investigators will measure these levels also through standardized assessments.&#xD;
