      The overall objective of this study is to demonstrate how dietary ganglioside may protect the&#xD;
      gut attenuate inflammatory signals in the intestinal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gangliosides are dietary fats found in milk and are important constituents of intestinal&#xD;
      cells. Our previous studies have shown that inflamed intestinal mucosal cells have reduced&#xD;
      ganglioside content compared to normal mucosal cells. Gangliosides are glycolipids found on&#xD;
      the surface of the intestinal mucosa and in lipid rafts in enterocytes and lymphocytes.&#xD;
      Gangliosides influence microbial attachment, cell division, differentiation, signaling and&#xD;
      mucosal integrity. Preclinical studies show that provision of ganglioside in cell culture and&#xD;
      in animal diets increase ganglioside content in mucosal cells and down regulates signals&#xD;
      caused by pro-inflammatory stimuli. In subjects with active Crohn's disease, consumption of&#xD;
      ganglioside remarkably improved the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. In healthy control&#xD;
      subjects, dietary ganglioside improved intestinal permeability and decreased production of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed that ganglioside degradation is elevated in the inflamed gut of IBD patients.&#xD;
      Provision of ganglioside in the diet replaces ganglioside in the gut, consequently restoring&#xD;
      proper structure and function to the diseased intestine and inducing disease remission.&#xD;
      Insight into diet-based treatment would allow IBD patients to live healthy and happy lives.&#xD;
      The main research objective is to characterize how ganglioside catabolism is associated with&#xD;
      increased signaling from pro-inflammatory mediators and how reduction in ganglioside levels&#xD;
      can be ameliorated by ganglioside supplementation during active inflammatory disease. This&#xD;
      study will assess molecular mechanisms by which ganglioside alters gut permeability,&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators and cell signaling.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 will test if dietary ganglioside treatment improves intestinal integrity,&#xD;
      permeability and systemic inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 will study the bioavailability of dietary ganglioside&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND &amp; SCOPE&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study being conducted in patients with mild-moderate IBD as assessed by&#xD;
      Crohn's disease activity index or Mayo Score. Our studies indicate that some ganglioside&#xD;
      species prevent proinflammatory stimuli and prevent disruption of integrity of tight&#xD;
      junctions between enterocytes, normalizing transepithelial electrical resistance in inflamed&#xD;
      cells. Feeding ganglioside to rats prevented lipopolysaccharide-stimulated decrease in&#xD;
      cellular tight junction protein occludin. Low level of GD3 ganglioside in the intestinal&#xD;
      mucosa is associated with degradation of tight junction proteins. Increasing the GD3 content&#xD;
      of the intestinal mucosa thus reduces the degradation of tight junction proteins improving&#xD;
      the integrity of the brush border and improving the deleterious changes occurring in&#xD;
      intestinal permeability. Improving intestinal integrity in subjects with IBD is important to&#xD;
      manage diarrhea, infection, penetration of allergens, and malnutrition. Research in progress&#xD;
      from our group demonstrates that dietary ganglioside decreased level of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      prostaglandin E2 in healthy human subjects and those with Crohn's disease. Also, daily&#xD;
      consumption of ganglioside was very effective in improving the Crohn's disease activity index&#xD;
      by an average of 43% over an eight-week study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS &amp; PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment Healthy control subjects and patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis will be recruited in Edmonton from the University of Alberta Hospital&#xD;
      gastroenterology clinic. Male and (non-pregnant) female adults (&gt; 17 year of age) are&#xD;
      eligible for study. Pre-operative IBD patients with mild to moderate disease including those&#xD;
      with rectosigmoiditis, left-sided colitis, concurrent small bowel disease, and Crohn's will&#xD;
      be recruited. Diagnosis will be based on established radiologic, endoscopic, and histologic&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Treatment with Ganglioside Ganglioside will be provided in the form of a&#xD;
      ganglioside-enriched milk fat globule membrane. This buttermilk supernatant contains protein,&#xD;
      lactose, and 0.4% ganglioside (75% GD3, 25% GM3). Normal preparation of butter yields&#xD;
      buttermilk. The ganglioside fraction used in this study has been centrifuged and filtered&#xD;
      again to remove the casein and whey protein. Participants will be randomized to consume&#xD;
      either 1.0 g of ganglioside or placebo daily for eight weeks in addition to their standard&#xD;
      drug treatment. The placebo milk fraction does not contain ganglioside, and is equal in&#xD;
      protein and lactose content to the ganglioside fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Involvement Participants will have blood drawn at baseline and week 2, 4, 6 and 8 of&#xD;
      supplementation study. Subject disease Activity Index or Mayo Score will be obtained at weeks&#xD;
      0 and 8. Participants will undergo non-invasive intestinal permeability testing at study&#xD;
      weeks 0 and 8.&#xD;
