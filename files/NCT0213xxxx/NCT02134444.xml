      Study Description and Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vestibular sense organs of the inner ear consist of the semi-circular canals and otolith&#xD;
      end organs. These organs contain specialized gravito-inertial sensors that sense angular and&#xD;
      linear head acceleration. The input from these sensors is required to stabilize gaze position&#xD;
      during head motion, and provide an absolute frame of reference with respect to gravity, thus&#xD;
      providing a vertical spatial reference for body orientation and balance. Disease or damage of&#xD;
      the vestibular sense organs causes a range of distressing symptoms and functional problems&#xD;
      for people that could include loss of balance, gaze instability, disorientation and&#xD;
      dizziness. A novel computer based rehabilitation system with therapeutic gaming application&#xD;
      has been developed. This method allows different gaze and head movement exercises to be&#xD;
      coupled to a wide range of inexpensive, commercial computer games. It can be used in standing&#xD;
      and thus graded balance demands using a sponge pad can be incorporated into the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the therapeutic effectiveness of the TRP delivered in the home compared to usual&#xD;
           care delivered in an out-patient physical therapy clinic on measures of balance&#xD;
           (standing and walking) , gaze control, dizziness, and health related quality of life in&#xD;
           individuals with peripheral vestibular disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare trajectory of change in electronic gaze performance measures obtained during&#xD;
           each therapy session of each participant assigned to the home Telerehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators believe the Telerehabilitation platform to be a cost-effective delivery of&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Additionally motivation to perform tedious home programs can be improved with&#xD;
      engaging, fun and interactive computer gaming as part of the rehabilitation process. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized the home game-based Telerehabilitation program will result in greater&#xD;
      improvements in dynamic balance control, gaze control, and dizziness, in individuals with&#xD;
      peripheral vestibular disorders as compared to a typical out-patient physical therapy&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;

      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will adopt a randomized clinical trial design. Recruitment and screening&#xD;
      (including diagnostics) will be coordinated by co-applicant, Dr. Jordon Hochman, department&#xD;
      of Otolaryngology, Karen Reimer, and Andrea Giacobbo,; Physical Therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consist of (a) age 18 to 65 , (b) diagnosed with unilateral peripheral vestibular hypo&#xD;
      function based on a detailed neuro-otological and neuro-orthoptic analysis to include&#xD;
      binocular electro-oculography with caloric testing, and (c) have a home computer running&#xD;
      Windows or Mac OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consist of those with CNS disorders for example CVA, Multiple Sclerosis, epilepsy, migraines,&#xD;
      concussion recent fractures of the lower extremities or vertebra, advanced hip/knee OA , and&#xD;
      cardiac disease. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Control group (active&#xD;
      comparator) or Experimental group (therapeutic gaming). Participants will be blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment. The treating therapist will know who is receiving the home or out-patient clinical&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group will receive; (a) Herdman gaze stabilization exercises, (b) optokinetic&#xD;
      exercises, and (c) balance exercises using sponge pads. These exercises are presently a&#xD;
      standard of vestibular care. Participants will attend an out-patient physical therapy clinic&#xD;
      once a week for 8-10 weeks. The program also includes a 20 minute home exercise program&#xD;
      prescribed four times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: Will receive the game-based rehabilitation program delivered at home. The&#xD;
      program for gaze will include provision of the motion mouse (Gyration). This approach&#xD;
      provides a highly flexible treatment tool applied to train gaze control, and allows&#xD;
      incorporation of graded balance demands. The use of this HID compliant computer input device&#xD;
      allows many different therapeutic exercises to be coupled to a wide range of inexpensive&#xD;
      commercial computer games. Though initially designed for clinical use, with the easy to use&#xD;
      and inexpensive motion sense mouse and computer games this intervention approach can be&#xD;
      extended to home settings. Many therapeutic exercises and activities (singly or in&#xD;
      combination) can be used to practice a variety of gaze and balance skills, and, importantly,&#xD;
      while playing fun computer games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend three clinical sessions during which time the home therapy programs&#xD;
      will be established and training in the use of the computer, motion mouse and games will be&#xD;
      provided. Based on clinical experience and pilot data, three sessions is sufficient before&#xD;
      initiating the home program.16 The treating physiotherapist will attend the participant's&#xD;
      home to ensure proper set-up and operation of the TRP equipment and computer applications.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to perform their respective home programs four times per week for&#xD;
      20 minutes per session. They will receive a phone call at one week to assess their ability to&#xD;
      manage their home program. Thereafter participants will attend for clinical follow-up once&#xD;
      per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording and Data Analysis The following information will be collected at baseline prior to&#xD;
      start of the interventions; age, gender, work history, occupation and (history of&#xD;
      disease/injury process, and current medications. Assessor will be blinded to participant&#xD;
      assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction in Balance (CTSIB); performance-based measure of&#xD;
           balance under altered sensory conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), is a self-rating questionnaire based on 25 questions&#xD;
           used to quantify a client's perception of his or her dizziness and its impact on their&#xD;
           life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Computerized Visual tracking test (CVT), involves tracking a bright visual target moving&#xD;
           horizontally left and right on a computer display in a sinusoidal fashion for several&#xD;
           cycles, and at predetermined speeds. The application records (80 Hz) coordinates of both&#xD;
           reference and head cursors. Coefficient of determination (COD) will be computed based on&#xD;
           total and average residual difference between trajectories of the reference and head&#xD;
           cursor motions. A value approaching one equates to excellent gaze performance. This test&#xD;
           will be performed in standing and while walking on a treadmill at 0.9 m/s.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants in the experimental group will be given the visual tracking game&#xD;
           application for home use. The game software automatically logs reference and head cursor&#xD;
           coordinates (gaze performance) during the visual tracking task and saves the data to a&#xD;
           coded and time stamped computer file (anatomized). Participants will be asked to play&#xD;
           the tracking task (in standing at the beginning of every training session. This will&#xD;
           involve three short tests of 45 seconds at three tracking speeds. The application&#xD;
           automatically saves the logged data file, and the clients can either e-mail the files to&#xD;
           the investigator, or save on a flash drive provided and return at a follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Spatiotemporal gait variables and walking stability measures. This is included to&#xD;
           examine whether the exercise program transfers to walking. A treadmill instrumented with&#xD;
           a pressure mat (Vista Medical, CA) will be used to record vertical foot forces for each&#xD;
           step during walking trials of 1 minute at 0.9 m/s, and thus data for 40 consecutive&#xD;
           steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants will be ask to complete a log of dates and duration of each exercise&#xD;
           session, and submit either a paper version or by e-mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis &amp; Power Assessment: Descriptive statistics, including means, standard&#xD;
      deviations, frequencies, and percentages, will be used to describe the experimental and&#xD;
      control groups on the baseline demographic variables. Differences between the groups on the&#xD;
      outcomes will be tested using t-tests and tests of independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve Objective 1, we will test the difference between experimental and control groups&#xD;
      on continuous and normally distributed outcome measures using analysis of covariance, with&#xD;
      the dependent variable being the post-intervention measurement of the outcome, the covariate&#xD;
      being the pre-intervention measurement, and group membership as the between-subjects effect.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics, including measures of skewness and kurtosis, will be used to assess&#xD;
      departures from the assumptions of a normal distribution of responses. If the distribution&#xD;
      contains extreme observations, a robust ANCOVA statistic will be adopted. To test differences&#xD;
      between experimental and control groups on discrete outcomes, such as counts of number of&#xD;
      times participants feel dizzy during their daily activities, we will use a Poisson regression&#xD;
      model, with the dependent variable being a count of the number of relevant events, the&#xD;
      covariate being the pre-intervention measurement, and group membership as the&#xD;
      between-subjects effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the longitudinal data associated with Objective 2, we will use a mixed-effects&#xD;
      regression model with time as the random effect and group as the fixed effect. This model&#xD;
      will be adopted because it accounts for clustering of repeated measurements within study&#xD;
      participants and uses all available longitudinal data (i.e., it does not result in case-wise&#xD;
      deletion of study participants due to missing observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on pilot data for the primary outcome (i.e., CTSIB), we conducted a power analysis of&#xD;
      the required sample size to test the difference between the experimental and controls groups&#xD;
      at the post-intervention measurement occasion (i.e., objective 1). The pilot data showed a&#xD;
      standardized effect size of 0.80. Assuming the number of model covariates to be 3, the&#xD;
      proportion of variance explained by these covariates to be 10%, and a two-tailed test of the&#xD;
      null hypothesis of no group difference at p = .05, a sample size of 46 is required. We expect&#xD;
      an attrition rate of 20% over the study observation period for objective 2. Given this, we&#xD;
      propose to recruit a sample of N = 56 individuals to participate, with equal numbers to be&#xD;
      recruited to the treatment and control groups.&#xD;
