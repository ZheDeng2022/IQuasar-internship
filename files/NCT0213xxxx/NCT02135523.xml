      1. Title: The efficacy of involved-field radiation therapy for residual or locoregionally&#xD;
           recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer after definitive treatment; Multi-institutional&#xD;
           phase 2 clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study period: 2014.04~2018.04&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective: To determine whether involved-field radiation therapy will prove to be&#xD;
           improve 2-year progression free survival for residual or locoregionally recurrent&#xD;
           epithelial ovarian cancer patients after definitive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient Selection: primary epithelial ovarian cancer (Required sample size: 70)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Planned number of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  YUHS database have 149 FIGO stage III patients treated with debulking surgery and&#xD;
                adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Of these patients, 90 patients experienced locoregional failures, and then the&#xD;
                investigators selected 44 patients who could be treated effectively with IFRT based&#xD;
                on MDACC suggestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Median interval to failure was 9 months in these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Hypothesis; IFRT reduces 44% hazard of progression compared with patients&#xD;
                     without IFRT&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Sample size; two-sided, accrual time = 24 mo, f/u time= 36 mo. α= 0.05, power&#xD;
                     = 0.80 Null progression-free median survival = 9 mo Alt progression-free&#xD;
                     median survival = 16 mo Calculated sample number = total 27 patients Drop rate&#xD;
                     = 10% • Total sample number = 30 patients Estimated Enrollment : 30&#xD;
                     participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop rate = 10%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total sample number = 70 patients 6. Radiation therapy: Participants will receive&#xD;
           involved-field radiotherapy (external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy) over 45Gy with&#xD;
           1.8-2.0 Gy fraction, five times per week for residual or locoregionally recurrent&#xD;
           epithelial ovarian cancer after definitive treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target volume&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  directed to gross disease plus a high-risk clinical target volume (CTV) that&#xD;
                included the postoperative bed or the prechemotherapy extent of disease with a 1-&#xD;
                to 1.5-cm margin, excluding uninvolved clinical structures&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Additional CTVs were designated according to the risks of microscopic disease&#xD;
                spread, proximity to critical structures, and other risk factors for complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nodal CTVs included grossly involved lymph node sites, extending to cover adjacent&#xD;
                uninvolved regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modality; 3-dimensional conformal RT including electron, intensity-modulated RT, proton&#xD;
           beam RT 7. Patient assessment: Participants will be followed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24&#xD;
           month after radiation therapy 8. Key words: ovarian cancer, involved-field radiation&#xD;
           therapy, progression free survival&#xD;
