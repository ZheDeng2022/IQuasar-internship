      This study represents a randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial. Thirty cocaine&#xD;
      dependant patients will be included in this study during their hospitalization for&#xD;
      withdrawal. After the inclusion visit, they will be randomized to receive disulfiram 250&#xD;
      mg/day or placebo over the 15 days of their hospitalization. Main outcome criteria will be&#xD;
      evaluated during two TEP imaging sessions with 11Craclopride, before and after stimulation by&#xD;
      methylphenidate, 8 to 15 days after randomization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DHB) inhibition represents a promising approach to treating&#xD;
      cocaine dependence. DBH is the enzyme responsible for hydroxylation of dopamine into&#xD;
      noradrenaline. Its inhibition suppresses noradrenaline secretion. In animal studies, the&#xD;
      efficacy of DBH inhibition in psychostimulants use could be linked to a reduced dopaminergic&#xD;
      response, possibly in association with post synaptic dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity.&#xD;
      In humans, the clinical efficacy of DBH inhibition, in particular following disulfiram&#xD;
      administration, is in the process of being established. However, its particular mode of&#xD;
      action remains unclear: some publications suggest an increased aversive reaction to cocaine,&#xD;
      whereas others report decreased positive effects. To date, the impact of DBH inhibition on&#xD;
      dopaminergic response to psychostimulants has yet to be studied in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study represents a randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial. Thirty cocaine&#xD;
      dependant patients will be included in this study during their hospitalization for&#xD;
      withdrawal. After the inclusion visit, they will be randomized to receive disulfiram 250&#xD;
      mg/day or placebo over the 15 days of their hospitalization. Main outcome criteria will be&#xD;
      evaluated during two TEP imaging sessions with 11Craclopride, before and after stimulation by&#xD;
      methylphenidate, 8 to 15 days after randomization. The main outcome criterion will be the&#xD;
      variations in linkage rates of 11Craclopride in the nucleus accumbens between baseline TEP&#xD;
      measurement and TEP measurement following administration of 20 mg of methylphenidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to show that in abstinent cocaine patients, DBH&#xD;
      inhibition by disulfiram induces reduced dopaminergic response following methylphenidate&#xD;
      administration. The secondary objectives of this trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to show that methylphenidate stimulation induces less craving and more aversive&#xD;
           responses in the disulfiram vs placebo condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to show that DBH inhibition by disulfiram elevates D2 dopaminergic receptor availability&#xD;
           (in the absence of methylphenidate stimulation);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to show that the availability of D2 dopaminergic receptors (in the absence of&#xD;
           methylphenidate stimulation) is linked to DBH activity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to confirm that in abstinent cocaine patients, disulfiram reduces DBH activity vs&#xD;
           placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to confirm that subjects with weak DBH activity have more aversive reactions to cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, disulfiram is the only drug on the market that inhibits DBH. Another more specific&#xD;
      DBH inhibitor is currently under development. It is possible that other inhibitors could soon&#xD;
      be developed by the pharmaceutical industry in the area of psychoactive drug addiction or&#xD;
      other psychiatric or somatic disorders. The development of this new therapeutic approach&#xD;
      requires a better understanding of its action mechanism.&#xD;
