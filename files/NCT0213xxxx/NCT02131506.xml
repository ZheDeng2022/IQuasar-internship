      A Phase Ib Study of Lapatinib in Combination with Caelyx in Patients with Advanced HER2&#xD;
      positive pretreated Breast Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lapatinib is given at escalating doses orally and continuously on days 1-21. Caelyx is&#xD;
      administered at escalating doses in a 60-minute i.v. infusion on day 1. Each cycle is defined&#xD;
      as 21 days. Four dose levels are planned. Dose level -1, Caelyx 30 mg/mq &amp; Lapatinib 1000 mg&#xD;
      die; dose level 1, Caelyx 30 mg/mq &amp; Lapatinib 1250 mg die; dose level 2, Caelyx 30 mg/mq &amp;&#xD;
      Lapatinib 1500 mg die; dose level 3, Caelyx 40 mg/mq &amp; Lapatinib 1500 mg die. Three patients&#xD;
      will be initially enrolled in each dose level starting from level 1. If none of the first&#xD;
      triplet of patients will develop DLT, the dose will be escalated to the next level for the&#xD;
      subsequent three patients. If one of the first triplets of patients will develop first-course&#xD;
      DLT, a maximum of 3 additional patients will be entered at the same dose level. The MTD is&#xD;
      defined as the dose below that at which two patients have experienced DLT. Lapatinib will be&#xD;
      self-administered by the patient in an outpatient setting at the dose of the assigned step.&#xD;
      Patients will take the drug daily by mouth on days 1 to 21 of each cycle. Caelyx will be&#xD;
      administered by intravenous infusion over an exact period of 1 hour (preferably by a pump to&#xD;
      guarantee a constant speed of infusion) on day&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 of each cycle repeated every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of toxicity: all patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their&#xD;
      first treatment with Caelyx and Lapatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of response: all patients included in the study must be assessed for response to&#xD;
      treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients. Subanalyses may then be performed&#xD;
      on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have&#xD;
      been identified .However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing&#xD;
      conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the&#xD;
      analysis should be clearly reported. The 95% confidence intervals should also be provided.&#xD;

      Title: A Phase Ib Study of Lapatinib in Combination with Caelyx in Patients with Advanced&#xD;
      HER2 positive pretreated Breast Cancer. Protocol Code: IRST 174.01 Phase: Ib Study Design:&#xD;
      open-label,single arm study in patients with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lapatinib is given at escalating doses orally and continuously on days 1-21. Caelyx is&#xD;
      administered at escalating doses in a 60-minute i.v. infusion on day 1. Each cycle is defined&#xD;
      as 21 days. Four dose levels are planned. Dose level -1, Caelyx 30 mg/mq &amp; Lapatinib 1000 mg&#xD;
      die; dose level 1, Caelyx 30 mg/mq &amp; Lapatinib 1250 mg die; dose level 2, Caelyx 30 mg/mq &amp;&#xD;
      Lapatinib 1500 mg die; dose level 3, Caelyx 40 mg/mq &amp; Lapatinib 1500 mg die. Three patients&#xD;
      will be initially enrolled in each dose level starting from level 1. If none of the first&#xD;
      triplet of patients will develop DLT, the dose will be escalated to the next level for the&#xD;
      subsequent three patients. If one of the first triplets of patients will develop first-course&#xD;
      DLT, a maximum of 3 additional patients will be entered at the same dose level. The MTD is&#xD;
      defined as the dose below that at which two patients have experienced DLT. Lapatinib will be&#xD;
      self-administered by the patient in an outpatient setting at the dose of the assigned step.&#xD;
      Patients will take the drug daily by mouth on days 1 to 21 of each cycle. Caelyx will be&#xD;
      administered by intravenous infusion over an exact period of 1 hour (preferably by a pump to&#xD;
      guarantee a constant speed of infusion) on day&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 of each cycle repeated every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: to define the MTD and the safety profile of Lapatinib (Tyverb) plus Caelyx.&#xD;
      Secondary: to preliminarily explore the anti tumour activity, to determine the objective&#xD;
      tumor response rate using RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No formal sample size estimation is performed as this is primarily a descriptive phase I&#xD;
      trial of safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of toxicity: all patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their&#xD;
      first treatment with Caelyx and Lapatinib. Evaluation of response: all patients included in&#xD;
      the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol&#xD;
      treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each patient will be assigned one of the&#xD;
      following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4)&#xD;
      progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7)&#xD;
      early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). All of&#xD;
      the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who&#xD;
      received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.&#xD;
      Patients in response categories 4-9 should be considered as failing to respond to treatment&#xD;
      (PD). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in&#xD;
      exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients. Subanalyses may then be performed&#xD;
      on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have&#xD;
      been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment,&#xD;
      major protocol violations, etc.). However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for&#xD;
      drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients&#xD;
      from the analysis should be clearly reported. The 95% confidence intervals should also be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
