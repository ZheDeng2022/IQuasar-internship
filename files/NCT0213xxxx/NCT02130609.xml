    <intervention_model_description>Even though this study has recruited more than 10 participants, it is a feasibility study, designed to test the prototype rather than measuring health outcomes. It is to confirm the operating specifications before beginning a full clinical trial. The objective of this study is to improve the treatment guidelines for the Elite+ by determining the maximum safe settings for skin and correlate them to measurement of Melanin Index (MI).</intervention_model_description>
