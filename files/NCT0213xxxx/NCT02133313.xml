      The time on peritoneal dialysis may be limited for a significant number of patients that use&#xD;
      this modality of renal replacement therapy due to the inability of the peritoneal membrane to&#xD;
      clear solutes or achieve adequate ultrafiltration, termed peritoneal membrane failure (PMF).&#xD;
      This can be devastating for patients who have become accustomed to the quality of life&#xD;
      provided by peritoneal dialysis and who otherwise have done well on this therapy. There is&#xD;
      clinical evidence suggesting that icodextrin preserves the peritoneal membrane transport&#xD;
      characteristics which may be linked to reduced cumulative glucose exposure of the peritoneal&#xD;
      mesothelial cells. Theories to explain the role of dextrose in PMF have focused for the most&#xD;
      part on the high intracellular concentrations of glucose without consideration to the&#xD;
      potential pathogenic role of the glucose transporters which allow glucose entry into the&#xD;
      cell. Experimental evidence in non-mesothelial cell lines indicate that some cellular&#xD;
      processes that occur under high glucose conditions may not be related to intracellular&#xD;
      glucose metabolism but to the type of glucose transporter allowing glucose entry. 3,4&#xD;
      However, little is known about these glucose transporters in peritoneal mesothelial cells and&#xD;
      their potential role in the development of PMF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize the following&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of Sodium Glucose Co-transporter (SGLT1) on peritoneal mesothelial cells&#xD;
           plays a role in PMF under hyperglycemic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regulation of pro-fibrotic mediators such as reactive oxidative species,transforming&#xD;
           growth factor Î², and vascular endothelial growth factor are modulated by SGLT1&#xD;
           activation by glucose rather than glucose metabolism or concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Icodextrin does not activate the SGLT1 transporter establishing a mechanism that may&#xD;
           explain the beneficial effects of icodextrin on peritoneal membrane transport.&#xD;

      Participants enrolled in this study will have pertinent clinical information entered into a&#xD;
      database. Participants will then have spent peritoneal dialysate collected at least every 6&#xD;
      months and analyzed for markers of fibrosis. Patients undergoing a special type of peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis start call urgent start peritoneal dialysis will have spent peritoneal dialysate&#xD;
      collected more frequently at the start of peritoneal dialysis and then every 6 months. The&#xD;
      results from the analysis of the peritoneal dialysate will then be correlated with data in&#xD;
      the patient registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance- As this is a single center trial all data will be monitored by the PI.&#xD;
      Data will be entered in a prospective manner into the database by a research coordinator.&#xD;
      Every 6 months data will be checked for accuracy by comparing to data collected for routine&#xD;
      clinical purposes by both the home dialysis unit which tracks all hospitalizations,&#xD;
      peritonitis, exit site infections, technique failures. As well as the dialysis access&#xD;
      database maintained by the University of Alabama at Birmingham.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data verification- Data will come from both the history and physical of the primary&#xD;
      investigator as well as electronic medical records at the University of Alabama at Birmingham&#xD;
      and Falcon Electronic Health Record from Davita.&#xD;
