  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of cardiac and cerebral involvements in&#xD;
      patients with idiopathic thrombotic microangiopathies on diagnosis. Patients will be assessed&#xD;
      for cardiac involvement (troponin Ic level and cardiac ultrasonography) and cerebral&#xD;
      involvement (cerebral MRI). The investigators will assess whether serum troponin Ic on&#xD;
      diagnosis can predict morbidity and mortality of patients with a thrombotic microangiopathy&#xD;
      at the acute phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measurement is the event free survival at day 30, as defined by death,&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, severe cerebral injury and disease exacerbation. An increase&#xD;
      in troponin Ic on diagnosis is defined as at least one result above 0.2 ng/ml among the three&#xD;
      daily analyses performed after TMA diagnosis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After TMA diagnosis, patients will be treated in emergency according to standard National&#xD;
      recommendations. Patient will be included in the study as soon as the diagnosis of TMA is&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From day 1 to day 3, specific blood tests will be performed (serum troponin Ic and brain&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide [BNP]). A cardiac ultrasonography within the 4 first days and a cerebral&#xD;
      MRI within the first 7 days after TMA diagnosis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that an increased serum troponin Ic level on diagnosis (&gt; 0.2 ng/ml) is a&#xD;
      predictive feature of cardiac events or worsening at the acute phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months, a control cardiac ultrasonography and cerebral MRI will be performed in patients&#xD;
      with cardiac and/or cerebral involvement on diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      122 patients are expected to be included among 30 recruiting centres in France. The total&#xD;
      duration of inclusions is 2.5 years, and the total duration of the study is of 3 years.&#xD;
