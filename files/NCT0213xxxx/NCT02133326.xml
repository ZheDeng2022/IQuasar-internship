    <textblock>
      This study will compare how effective a single dose of an intravenous (IV) ibuprofen is when&#xD;
      compared to single dose of IV acetaminophen in reducing pain. We will administer this study&#xD;
      medication thirty minutes prior to removal of wisdom teeth. We want to see if administering&#xD;
      these drugs prior to surgery may reduce post-operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug before the onset of inflammation during&#xD;
      surgery will reduce postoperative pain following third molar extraction when compared to the&#xD;
      acetaminophen group. Subjects receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug will consume less&#xD;
      opioid medications compared to those receiving preemptive acetaminophen.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The surgical removal of third molars is a common surgical procedure performed in dentistry.&#xD;
      Surgery to extract an impacted third molar can be due to various reasons such as infection,&#xD;
      caries, pain, cyst or tumor formation, or to facilitate orthodontic treatment. Both&#xD;
      clinicians and patients are concerned with the postoperative pain following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for model selection The oral surgery model is well-suited for the measurement of&#xD;
      acute pain.The model has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of analgesic drugs and is&#xD;
      useful for examining peripheral biochemical measures of drugs in vivo.This model is&#xD;
      recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration because patients are usually healthy&#xD;
      without complicating medical conditions and most patients have pain for a short, predictable&#xD;
      period after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for drug selection Pain from the surgical incision and tissue manipulation&#xD;
      associated with the surgical procedure is instigated immediately. This gives way to&#xD;
      inflammatory pain that follows inflammatory cell recruitment to the injured area within the&#xD;
      course of several hours. Inflammatory pain generally continues for several days, depending on&#xD;
      the nature of the surgical procedure. As a consequence of tissue damage and release of&#xD;
      neurogenic inflammatory mediators, there is activation of specific receptors and pathways&#xD;
      that can contribute to central sensitization and development of hyperalgesia and persistent&#xD;
      pain. While various pharmacological strategies, including the use of opioids, provide&#xD;
      adequate attenuation of pain, their use is associated with undesirable side effects, drug&#xD;
      interactions, pharmacokinetic variability, and often inadequate dosing, all of which can lead&#xD;
      to ineffective analgesia and prolonged suffering. Opioids do not interrupt the inflammatory&#xD;
      component of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug Caldolor® is an intravenous formulation of ibuprofen which was approved by the&#xD;
      FDA in June 2009. Caldolor® is the first injectable product available in the United States&#xD;
      for the treatment of pain and fever. This is the first study in dentistry evaluating the use&#xD;
      of Caldolor® as a preemptive analgesia. Southworth et al and colleagues randomized 406&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective single-site orthopedic or abdominal surgery to 400 mg&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) Caldolor, 800 mg IV Caldolor, or placebo. The results showed that patients&#xD;
      in the 800 mg group had a 25.6% lower median morphine use (P = .026) over the first 24 hours&#xD;
      of treatment than the placebo group. Patients in the 400 mg group did not have a lower use of&#xD;
      morphine, but both the 400 and 800 mg groups reported less pain at rest and with movement&#xD;
      than with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparator group Ofirmev® is intravenous acetaminophen and was recently approved by the&#xD;
      FDA for the management of mild to moderate pain, the management of moderate to severe pain&#xD;
      with adjunctive opioid analgesics, and the reduction of fever. In a study conducted for total&#xD;
      abdominal hysterectomy, preemptive IV paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1 g provided good quality&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia, with decreased consumption of morphine and minimal side effects.&#xD;
      Studies have showed that the use of 1 g of paracetamol as a single intravenous preemptive&#xD;
      dose in abdominal surgery with perioperative epidural analgesia did not reduce the analgesic&#xD;
      consumption and the intensity of pain in the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of Pain Scale VAS Pain Scale Score: The primary end point is the clinical report of pain.&#xD;
      Pain intensity will be assessed using a 100 mm VAS with anchors of &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain&#xD;
      imaginable&quot; and a 4-point category scale (&quot;none&quot;, &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot;, and &quot;severe&quot;) once&#xD;
      pre-operatively and over the post-operative observation period at 30-minute intervals during&#xD;
      the post- surgical time. The category scale is included for purposes of obtaining a&#xD;
      patient-reported assignment of moderate pain (definition of clinically significant pain), and&#xD;
      for computing the cut-offs for pain sensitivity.&#xD;
