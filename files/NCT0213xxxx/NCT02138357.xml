  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether Butrans Transdermal System (BTDS)&#xD;
      reduces RLS symptom severity in patients with moderate to severe idiopathic RLS who are naïve&#xD;
      to opiate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to investigate the effects of BTDS on mood, sleep,&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of nine visits. Depending on the need for medication titration, there&#xD;
      may also be two scheduled telephone contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: This is a screening visit to determine study eligibility. Eligible subjects who&#xD;
      choose to participate must undergo medication washout as described in the detailed protocol&#xD;
      between visits 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period #1 (Visits 2 - 5; day 0 - 28): Baseline measures will be recorded and&#xD;
      subjects randomized to treatment order at visit 2 (day 0). Study medication as well as rescue&#xD;
      medication (l-dopa, a non-blinded active treatment to be used within a limited dose range as&#xD;
      described in the detailed protocol) will be dispensed. Subjects will begin treatment period&#xD;
      #1 immediately after this. The study medication will be titrated within the allowed range&#xD;
      according to subject's reported symptoms during visit 3 (day 7), visit 4 (day 14), telephone&#xD;
      contact (day 21). Visit 5 will occur on day 28 and will include assessment of outcome&#xD;
      measures for the first treatment period. Visit 5 will also mark the beginning of the second&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period #2 (Visits 6 - 8; day 28 - 56): Procedures will be similar to those&#xD;
      described above during treatment period #1. Visit 8 will mark the end of the second treatment&#xD;
      period during which outcome measures will be ascertained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visit (Visit 9; day 70): This will be a safety follow-up visit approximately two&#xD;
      weeks after visit 8 for review of adverse events.&#xD;
