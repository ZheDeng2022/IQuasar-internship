    <textblock>
      The proposed investigation is a Phase 1 trial to determine the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of pioglitazone ( and carboplatin patients&#xD;
      with advanced or metastatic solid malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  In Part I of the study, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined. During part&#xD;
           I, Cycle 1, days 1-28, pioglitazone will be administered once daily. On cycle 1, day 8,&#xD;
           the first dose of carboplatin will be administered. On cycle 2, day 1, both carboplatin&#xD;
           and pioglitazone will be administered. Cycles 2 and onward are 21-day cycles, with&#xD;
           pioglitazone administered once daily and carboplatin administered once every 3 weeks.&#xD;
           Part I of the study will end when the MTD has been determined in a minimum of 6&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Part II of the trial, an MTD Expansion Cohort may be utilized to further characterize&#xD;
           the safety profile and pharmacodynamics of the drug. Patients in the MTD Expansion&#xD;
           Cohort will receive carboplatin alone on cycle 1, day 1. Over days 15-21 of the cycle&#xD;
           pioglitazone will be administered alone. On cycle 2, day 1, both carboplatin and&#xD;
           pioglitazone will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 2 and onward are 21-day cycles, with pioglitazone administered once daily and&#xD;
      carboplatin administered once every 3 weeks.&#xD;
