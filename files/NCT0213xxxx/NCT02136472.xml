      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, 10 - 15% of couples seek specialist help once in their lives when a spontaneous&#xD;
      pregnancy does not occur. These couples are defined subfertile when there is at least one&#xD;
      year of unprotected intercourse without conceiving. Subfertility can have different causes&#xD;
      which can be diagnosed with a basic fertility work-up. Unfortunately, the subfertility in 25%&#xD;
      of the couples still remains unexplained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that cardio-metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities reducing&#xD;
      cardiovascular reserves relate to circulatory redistribution at the expense of uterine&#xD;
      perfusion and with it women's fertility. This could especially be important in the subgroups&#xD;
      with an unexplained subfertility and a decreased ovarian reserve. Interventions to improve&#xD;
      these abnormalities could lead to better results in fertility treatment, better obstetric&#xD;
      outcome and reduced lifelong health risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to examine specific cardio-metabolic and cardiovascular parameters in&#xD;
      women of subfertile couples. The investigators want to evaluate the prevalence of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome in all women who are assessed for subfertility compared to healthy parous women.&#xD;
      Furthermore in the women with an unexplained subfertility or with (signs of) a decreased&#xD;
      ovarian reserve the cardiovascular profile will be studied consisting of the uterine artery&#xD;
      pulsatility index (PI) as measure of uterine perfusion, the plasma volume as measure of&#xD;
      venous reserve capacity, the intima media thickness of the carotid arteries as proxy of&#xD;
      chronic strain and the endothelial function, measured by flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of&#xD;
      the brachial artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group consists of subfertile women between 18 and 41 years who visit the fertility&#xD;
      clinic in the Maastricht University Medical Centre with a primary or secondary subfertility.&#xD;
      Women with an unexplained subfertility or with (signs of) a decreased ovarian reserve are&#xD;
      evaluated for their cardiovascular profile. The control group consists of women with a&#xD;
      history of an uneventful spontaneous pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in subfertile women&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The cardiovascular profile, in women with an unexplained subfertility or with (signs of)&#xD;
           a decreased ovarian reserve, consisting of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The uterine artery pulsatility index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The plasma volume&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The intima media thickness (IMT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The endothelial function of the vascular system (FMD)&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, 10 - 15% of couples seek specialist help once in their lives when a spontaneous&#xD;
      pregnancy does not occur. These couples are defined subfertile when there is at least one&#xD;
      year of unprotected intercourse without conceiving. Subfertility can have different causes. A&#xD;
      basic fertility work-up focuses on the reproductive system of the couple. After this basic&#xD;
      fertility work-up the subfertility remains unexplained in 16-24% of the couples. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that cardio-metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities reducing&#xD;
      cardiovascular reserves relate to circulatory redistribution at the expense of uterine&#xD;
      perfusion and with it women's fertility. This could especially be important in the subgroups&#xD;
      with an unexplained subfertility and a decreased ovarian reserve. For all possible assessed&#xD;
      abnormalities, proven effective treatments are available such as primarily life style&#xD;
      corrective actions. Furthermore these interventions could lead to better results in fertility&#xD;
      treatment, better obstetric outcome and reduced lifelong health risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to examine specific cardio-metabolic and&#xD;
      cardiovascular parameters in women of subfertile couples. This study protocol is divided into&#xD;
      3 studies to evaluate several cardio-metabolic/cardiovascular parameters in different&#xD;
      subgroups of female subfertility compared to fertile women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 1 &quot;The metabolic syndrome and female subfertility&quot;: The prevalence of metabolic&#xD;
           syndrome in all women who are assessed for subfertility compared to fertile women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 2 &quot;The cardiovascular profile in female subfertility&quot;: The cardiovascular profile&#xD;
           of women with female subfertility classified as unexplained subfertility or &quot;expected&quot;&#xD;
           decreased ovarian reserve compared to fertile women. For this study 4 measurements will&#xD;
           be performed: the uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) as measure of uterine perfusion,&#xD;
           the plasma volume as measure of venous reserve capacity, the intima media thickness of&#xD;
           the carotid arteries as proxy of chronic strain and the endothelial function, measured&#xD;
           by flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 3 &quot;The cardiovascular profile of women with a poor ovarian response&quot;: The&#xD;
           cardiovascular profile of women who had an In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) population with&#xD;
           a &quot;proven&quot; decreased ovarian reserve&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these different studies, the investigators hope to identify possible&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic/cardiovascular causes for female subfertility. This can lead to new&#xD;
      treatment options for female subfertility, enhancing reproductive and obstetric outcome, and&#xD;
      a risk assessment for later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
