  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this Pilot study are to investigate the toxicity and safety of high doses&#xD;
      of [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) used as a therapeutic agent in patients with advanced stage&#xD;
      IV malignant tumors that failed standard of care treatment, have a good performance status&#xD;
      and bear radiosensitive tumors with a high [18F]-FDG uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that [18F]FDG may have a significant tumoricidal effect on&#xD;
      cancer cells and radionuclide therapy of cancers with high doses of [18F]FDG administered as&#xD;
      a single dose or in multiple doses (dose fractionation regimen) can be safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated with minimal toxicities. Advantages of FDG are its uptake in many different human&#xD;
      tumors, its short half-life (110 minutes) and the possibility to monitor its effect closely&#xD;
      with the FDG-PET scan. The rationale for using high doses of this radiopharmaceutical agent&#xD;
      for treatement is that most malignant lesions have accentuated glucose metabolism, which is&#xD;
      mirrored by increased uptake of FDG. Since FDG cannot be metabolized within the cell like&#xD;
      glucose, it is effectively confined within the cancer cells; thus, FDG treatment is&#xD;
      potentially a novel form of targeted therapy for tumors with increased FDG uptake.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Photons, electrons and protons have therapeutic use however positrons have only been used for&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging purposes.. The energies of positrons (β+) from F-18 (0.633 MeV) and&#xD;
      electrons (β-) from I-131 (0.606 MeV) are very close and have similar equilibrium dose&#xD;
      constants. Since [18F]- fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) clears rapidly from circulation,&#xD;
      administration of 37-74 BGq (1-2 Ci) of 18F-FDG is relatively safe from an internal radiation&#xD;
      dosimetry point of view. We initiated a phase I dose escalation study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      toxicity, and potential therapeutic utility of administering high doses of 18F-FDG delivered&#xD;
      over a 1 to 5 day period in patients with advanced lymphomas and solid tumors refractory to&#xD;
      standard of care treatment (SCT).&#xD;
