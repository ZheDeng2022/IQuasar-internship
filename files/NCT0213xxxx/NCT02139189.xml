             judgment of the attending cardiologist or cardiac surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppressive medication (e.g. prednisone, cyclophosphamide, etanercept, etc.)&#xD;

             follow-up or claustrophobia (thus precluding performance of follow-up MRI scans)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to the administration of heparin, warfarin or anti-platelet agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergic reaction or sensitivity to porcine material&#xD;
