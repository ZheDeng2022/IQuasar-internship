      Hypothesis 1: The proportion of pre-ART patients whose CD4 cell counts decline to&#xD;
      ART-eligibility within 48 weeks will be lower in intervention compared to the&#xD;
      non-intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: PLHIV who receive the PSCB intervention will experience lower rates of&#xD;
      morbidity or death over the follow-up period compared to patients not receiving the&#xD;
      intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: PLHIV who receive the PCSB intervention will have better adherence to scheduled&#xD;
      clinic appointments compared to those not receiving the intervention&#xD;

      A randomized trial to assess the effect of patient-selected care buddies (PSCB) on adherence&#xD;
      to pre-ART clinic appointments, clinical and immunologic outcomes of patients receiving&#xD;
      pre-Anti-retroviral therapy (pre-ART) HIV care in a rural community HIV care program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care: Patients enrolled for pre-ART care (CD4&gt; 250 cells/ul) received general&#xD;
      health education, scheduled and unscheduled clinical monitoring, CD4 testing and other&#xD;
      clinically indicated investigations, treatment of opportunistic infections, and cotrimoxazole&#xD;
      prophylaxis. A client was expected to come to the clinic at least once in three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selected Care buddy intervention: In addition to standard of care (above), pre-ART&#xD;
      patients randomized to PSCB arm were requested to choose a care buddy who was aware of the&#xD;
      patient's HIV infection and resides in the same household or in close proximity. Care buddies&#xD;
      attended at least two HIV health education sessions similar to those provided to study&#xD;
      participants. Information on HIV, and the importance of adhering to scheduled clinic visits&#xD;
      and to prescribed medications were emphasized. Buddies were requested to remind participants&#xD;
      to take their prophylactic treatments, and remind them of clinic appointments. No&#xD;
      compensation for participation was given to buddies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure Randomization and concealment This was done to minimize systematic&#xD;
      bias in the allocation of patients to the intervention or non-intervention study arms. I used&#xD;
      stratified block randomization to restrict chance imbalances so as to ensure that the study&#xD;
      arms were as alike as possible for patient enrollment factors, including key factors such as&#xD;
      sex and CD4 which can have an effect on the outcomes such as adherence to pre-ART scheduled&#xD;
      clinic appointments. A set of permuted blocks were generated for each combination of&#xD;
      stratification factors. In this study, these factors included patient sex and CD4 cell count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concealment of the patient allocation to study arms was done to avoid both conscious and&#xD;
      unconscious selection of patients into the study. The research assistants assessed the&#xD;
      eligibility of the patients, sought their consent for study participation, and then the&#xD;
      enrollment officer with the sealed trial randomization envelopes let the patient pick the&#xD;
      envelope containing the study arm. To further ensure unbiased allocation of patients to study&#xD;
      arms, I used varying block size, specifically size 6 so that the recruiting officer does not&#xD;
      guess which study arm follows (Concealment through sequence generation). I used a&#xD;
      computer-generated allocation sequence with a randomization ratio of 1:1, to PSCB or SOC We&#xD;
      collected data using interviewer-administered questionnaires and HIV clinic forms. Patients&#xD;
      received a questionnaire at baseline, six months and 12 months follow up visits. All visits&#xD;
      were conducted at the HIV clinics. At baseline visit, we collected socio-demographic&#xD;
      information including level of education, occupation, marital status, distance to the HIV&#xD;
      clinic, willingness to select a buddy as well as readiness to disclose HIV status to a buddy.&#xD;
      At both the 6 and 12 month follow up visits, information on continued possession of a buddy,&#xD;
      change or loss of a buddy, relationship and perceived helpfulness of their buddy (if in&#xD;
      intervention arm), self-reported adherence to clinic appointments and cotrimoxazole, quality&#xD;
      of life and sexual behaviors including sexual activity, condom use and number of sexual&#xD;
      partners (marital and non-marital) were collected. As per clinic schedules, patients were&#xD;
      required to come to the clinic for cotrimoxazole refills at least 3 monthly and to have a&#xD;
      blood draw for CD4 testing as follows: at 3 months if previous CD4 count was 251-350 cells/ul&#xD;
      or after six months if CD4 was greater than 350 cells/ul. Routine clinic data, collected on&#xD;
      clinic forms included patient visit data (visit date, number of cotrimoxazole pills&#xD;
      dispensed, blood samples taken for testing), health status (e.g. opportunistic infections&#xD;
      diagnosed, Karnofsky score, WHO staging) and laboratory results, including CD4 counts and any&#xD;
      other investigations as clinically indicated. Blood for CD4 testing was collected from&#xD;
      participants at the various community clinics and transported to the central Rakai Health&#xD;
      Sciences Program laboratory in Kalisizo.CD4 counts were assessed by flow cytometry using a&#xD;
      FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).&#xD;
