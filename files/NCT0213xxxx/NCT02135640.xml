  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody to RANKL that being investigated as a&#xD;
      therapeutic agent in all bone diseases characterized by excessive bone resorption, such as&#xD;
      primary and secondary osteoporosis, metastatic bone diseases, and other diseases involving&#xD;
      bone loss associated with increases in osteoclast function. This will be a single-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled single-dose study. All subjects will be randomized to denosuamb 60 mg,&#xD;
      denosumab 120 mg or placebo in a ration of 3:3:2. The purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of denosumab&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously to healthy adults in China. The primary endpoints for safety are:&#xD;
      subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, including clinically significant&#xD;
      changes in physical examinations, laboratory safety tests, ECG and vital signs. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are PK and PD (s-CTX1) parameter estimates.&#xD;
