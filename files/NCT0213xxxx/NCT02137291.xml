      Lung isolation is primordial in thoracic surgery. To achieve it, two techniques are used: the&#xD;
      double lumen tube (DLT) and the bronchial blocker (BB). Left-sided DLT (L-DLT) is use by the&#xD;
      majority of anesthesiologists for both left and right thoracic surgeries. Standard&#xD;
      right-sided DLT (Rs-DLT) is rarely use since it is dif¬ficult to properly position it and&#xD;
      that there is a risk of misalignment between the lateral orifice of the tube and the origin&#xD;
      of the right upper lobe (RUL) bron¬chus. In 2007, the investigators have published results&#xD;
      suggesting enlarging the Rs-DLT's lateral orifice. The modified R-DLT (Rm-DLT) was more&#xD;
      frequently in an adequate position: 77% vs 37% of patients (p = 0.0121), and easier to&#xD;
      reposition: 97% vs 74% of patients (p= 0.0109) in comparison to the standard R-DLT group. The&#xD;
      data suggest the superiority of the Rm-DLT compared to Rs-DLT for optimal positioning to&#xD;
      facilitate one-lung ventilation (OLV) during thoracic surgery. It is believed that DLT tend&#xD;
      to provide quicker and better quality of lung collapse than BB. In 2013, investigators have&#xD;
      demonstrated an equivalent quality of lung collapse (LC) between L-DLT and BB used with two&#xD;
      apnea periods when initiating OLV. Complementary analysis showed a significative difference&#xD;
      to obtain complete LC (CLC) between L-DLT for left thoracoscopy and L-DLT for right&#xD;
      thoracoscopy and BB in right or left surgery. The investigator hypothesis is that, when using&#xD;
      L-DLT for left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), LC of the isolated lung will be&#xD;
      slower and of poorer quality compare to the use of the Rm-DLT. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      compare the delay between pleural opening (PO) and CLC in left VATS when using three lung&#xD;
      isolation devices: 1) L-DLT and 2) Rm-DLT. Secondary objectives are: 1) to evaluate quality&#xD;
      of LC, 2) to evaluate the level of obstruction of the lumen of the left bronchus, 3) to&#xD;
      evaluate the quality of OLV (PaO2) 4) To collect blind surgeon's opinion about de device used&#xD;
      and 5) to measure the delay between OLV and PO for evaluating the role of absorption&#xD;
      atelectasis in obtaining CLC. After obtaining IRB approval, the investigators propose a study&#xD;
      of 40 patients undergoing an elective left VATS at IUCPQ involving one lung ventilation. They&#xD;
      will have to be 21 years or more, to read, understand and sign an informed consent at their&#xD;
      pre-operative evaluation. This study will be prospective, randomized, and blind to thoracic&#xD;
      surgeons.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung isolation is frequently used in thoracic surgery. The quality of the isolation is&#xD;
      crucial, especially for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Two techniques are&#xD;
      principally used to obtain lung isolation: the double lumen tube (DLT) and the bronchial&#xD;
      blocker (BB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The left-sided DLT (L-DLT) is used by the majority of anesthesiologists, as much for left as&#xD;
      for right thoracic surgeries. The standard right-sided DLT (Rs-DLT) is rarely used since&#xD;
      positioning its lateral orifice with the origin of the right upper lobe (RUL) can be&#xD;
      difficult.(1-4) In 2007, the investigators have published their results suggesting an&#xD;
      enlargement of the lateral orifice of the Rs-DLT.(5) They have demonstrated that the modified&#xD;
      right-sided double lumen tube (Rm-DLT) remained more frequently in optimal position than the&#xD;
      Rs-DLT (77% vs. 37%, p=0.0121) and that it was also easier to reposition the tube after&#xD;
      turning the patient in lateral decubitus (97% vs. 74%, p=0.0109).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, investigators have demonstrated, with three dimensional reconstruction of&#xD;
      computed tomography of 106 patients, that angulation between the RUL and the horizontal&#xD;
      posterior plane varies from -26 to +58°, justifying the modification of the Rs-DLT proposed&#xD;
      in 2007. (Unpublished data)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of BB for lung isolation is believed to provide a slower and a poorer quality of lung&#xD;
      collapse (LC) than DLT. Over the years, the investigators have demonstrated an equivalent&#xD;
      quality of lung collapse between the L-DLT and BB when two apnea periods are used at the&#xD;
      beginning of one-lung ventilation (OLV). (Unpublished data) Further to complementary&#xD;
      analysis, investigators have noted a significant difference in time to get complete lung&#xD;
      collapse between left and right thoracic surgery when using the L-DLT. Time to obtain&#xD;
      complete lung collapse (CLC) was not different when comparing BB and L-DLT in left thoracic&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to explain these observations is that when the bronchial extremity of the&#xD;
      L-DLT is inserted into the left main stem bronchus (LMSB), the LMSB and its relative superior&#xD;
      position, associated to a progressive collapse of the left lung, could induce a dynamic&#xD;
      obstruction of the distal extremity of the L-DLT lumen, and consequently slowing the lung&#xD;
      collapse. Investigators have also regularly observed this type of obstruction during&#xD;
      bronchoscopic examination when positioning the L-DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In past studies comparing L-DLT to BB, time to get CLC was measured from the beginning of&#xD;
      OLV. Nevertheless, the interval between this time point and the pleural opening (PO) is&#xD;
      sometime difficult to control. Technical incidents can prolong this period and induce a bias.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in the last investigator's protocol, the second period of apnea is done at&#xD;
      pleural opening. For these reasons, the authors consider that the time to get CLC should be&#xD;
      measured from the pleural opening since it is the crucial moment for the surgical team.&#xD;
      Investigators are proposing to evaluate the PO-CLC interval as a primary objective.(6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the proposed study is that the use of the L-DLT will allow for a slower and&#xD;
      a poorer quality of CLC compared to the ones obtained with the Rm-DLT in left VATS.&#xD;
