  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with high blood pressure (hypertension) and chronic kidney disease are at an&#xD;
      increased risk of developing heart disease and strokes. Part of this risk is due to changes&#xD;
      in the structure and function of the blood vessels throughout the body. It is thought that&#xD;
      reducing high blood pressure and treating chronic kidney disease improves the structure and&#xD;
      function of blood vessels but information on this is limited. Optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) is a method of looking at the blood vessels at the back of the eye. It is a simple,&#xD;
      quick and non-invasive test that you may have previously had during a visit to the optician.&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to ascertain whether OCT is able to detect changes in the eye's&#xD;
      blood vessels in patients with hypertension and chronic kidney disease compared to healthy&#xD;
      individuals and also to see if any differences seen improve with treatment.&#xD;

      This project is an exploratory study, using enhanced depth imaging with the new SPECTRALIS&#xD;
      OCT, designed to examine choroidal and microvascular retinal structure in patients with&#xD;
      hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and in age and sex matched healthy controls. The&#xD;
      study is non-invasive and takes only a few seconds to acquire these complex images. The&#xD;
      Centre, where the images will be captured and where image analysis systems are located, is on&#xD;
      the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) site close to the RIE outpatient clinics, making&#xD;
      recruitment easy.&#xD;
