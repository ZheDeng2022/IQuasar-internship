  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, Canadian, study in patients treated with Abilify Maintena™ for&#xD;
      schizophrenia followed for 24 months, with 9 visits recommended. Study assessments and&#xD;
      administration of questionnaires will take place during the patient regular assessments or&#xD;
      injection visits that are part of routine care. The main objective of the study is to&#xD;
      describe the impact of treatment with Abilify Maintena™ on global functional status.&#xD;

      -  Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients will be treated with Abilify Maintena™ administered once monthly at&#xD;
                the dose that is as per the treating physician's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The assignment of the patients to be treated with Abilify Maintena™ is not decided&#xD;
                in advance by the study protocol and is clearly separated from the decision to&#xD;
                include the patients in the study. For all patients that will be included in the&#xD;
                study, the decision to initiate treatment with Abilify Maintena™ must have been&#xD;
                reached prior to and independently of enrolling the patient in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any treatment is to be prescribed according to the recommendations given in the&#xD;
                approved Canadian Product Monograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Sites&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Up to 30 sites planned in Canada: Patients will be recruited by community or hospital&#xD;
           based psychiatrists. A random representative sample of Canadian psychiatrists will be&#xD;
           identified as the sampled population of physicians that will be invited to participate&#xD;
           in the study and will undergo a feasibility assessment. Those that satisfy the&#xD;
           feasibility assessment, have adequate volume of patients and are willing to participate&#xD;
           in the study will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data Collection and Handling&#xD;
&#xD;
           - All patient data will be collected by the site investigator or designated staff and&#xD;
           will be entered in an electronic data capture (EDC) system that will be developed for&#xD;
           the study. Patient questionnaires will be completed during the visit using paper-based&#xD;
           surveys. The questionnaire data will be transcribed into the study database by the CRO&#xD;
           personnel using a double data entry system. There will be no patient identifying&#xD;
           information recorded in any of the study data collection forms or databases. All&#xD;
           patients will be identified using encrypted random study ID numbers. Data monitoring and&#xD;
           source verification will be conducted on a sample of patients. Auditing of patient&#xD;
           qualification will also be conducted on a sample of patients within each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Missing data handling&#xD;
&#xD;
           - There will be no imputation for missing data. General linear models with repeated&#xD;
           measures and mixed effects will be used to compensate for unequal follow up intervals&#xD;
           and missing data points. All analyses will be conducted on observed cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety analyses - The safety population will comprise all patients included in the study&#xD;
           that have had at least one treatment with Abilify Maintena™. Adverse events will be&#xD;
           described with the MedDRA dictionary of terms classified by preferred term and system -&#xD;
           organ class.&#xD;
