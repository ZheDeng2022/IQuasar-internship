      A number of methods are currently used to prevent movement of epidural catheters in women&#xD;
      during labour. These usually consist of sticky dressings applied to the patient's back. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to compare how much epidural catheters move when secured with three&#xD;
      commonly used different fixation dressings with the aim of identifying the best method of&#xD;
      securing epidural catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement of epidural catheters has several clinical implications. Usually only a short length&#xD;
      of epidural catheter is left in the epidural space, and therefore any significant movement&#xD;
      could result in the catheter moving out of the epidural space leading to a loss of the pain&#xD;
      relieving effects of the epidural.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once epidural failure has occurred due to catheter migration, a second catheter must be&#xD;
      inserted in order to re-establish pain relief and thus the patient is exposed to the risks of&#xD;
      epidural insertion for a second time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the researchers in this study can identify a method of fixing epidural catheters which&#xD;
      results in the least amount of catheter movement, then patients could benefit from more&#xD;
      reliable epidural pain relief, fewer repeated procedures and the risks associated with&#xD;
      repeated procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle objective of the study is to determine which epidural fixation dressing results&#xD;
      in the least amount of epidural catheter movement from the time of epidural insertion (during&#xD;
      labour) to the time of epidural removal (after labour).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in epidural catheter migration between any&#xD;
      of the epidural catheter fixation devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design has been chosen so that the researchers can fairly assess how different&#xD;
      commercially available epidural fixation devices perform in the real life scenario of labour,&#xD;
      a time when epidurals are particularly important to the well-being of a labouring woman.&#xD;
      Three different epidural fixation methods will be studied. These three methods have been&#xD;
      chosen because they are all already in use in different hospitals across the UK but have&#xD;
      never been compared together.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Women admitted to labour ward at St. George's Hospital will be invited to participate in&#xD;
           the study. Written informed consent will be obtained from all potential participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Women in labour who request an epidural will be randomly allocated to one of three&#xD;
           different dressings used to secure the epidural. The epidural will be performed by the&#xD;
           duty anaesthetist according to a standard practice. The three epidural dressings are: 3M&#xD;
           Tegaderm, Smiths Medical Lockit Plus and Unomedical Epifix. All dressing will be applied&#xD;
           in a standardised manner. Since 3M Tegaderm is the current dressing used at St. George's&#xD;
           Hospital it will form the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Epidurals will be inserted by the duty anaesthetist using a standard technique and the&#xD;
           appropriate dressing applied. In order to avoid bias women will not be informed which&#xD;
           device they are to receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient characteristics will be documented for each epidural, including length of&#xD;
           catheter at skin at time of insertion, depth to epidural space, intervertebral&#xD;
           interspace used (e.g. L3-4), patient position for epidural insertion (lateral or&#xD;
           sitting), time and date of epidural insertion, patient body mass index (at booking). No&#xD;
           identifying patient data will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If an epidural is removed before delivery or the epidural fixation device is altered&#xD;
           then the reason for intervention will be documented e.g. inadequacy of epidural&#xD;
           analgesia, loss of integrity of fixation device. Any specific events that precipitate&#xD;
           problems with the epidural fixation devices will be documented e.g. discomfort at site&#xD;
           of dressing on transfer of patient onto operating theatre table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After delivery of the baby, the epidural catheter will be removed. Removal will be&#xD;
           encouraged within the first hour following delivery and before the patient has mobilised&#xD;
           from their bed. If possible then the woman will adopt the same position (either sitting&#xD;
           or lateral) for removal of the epidural as she was in for insertion. Removal of the&#xD;
           catheter will either be by a midwife or the duty anaesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. After removal of the epidural the following patient characteristics will be collected by&#xD;
           the midwife or anaesthetist removing the catheter: length of catheter at skin at time of&#xD;
           removal, patient position for epidural removal (lateral or sitting), time and date of&#xD;
           epidural removal, integrity of epidural dressing, whether the patient was transferred to&#xD;
           the operating theatre table, any additional problems encountered with the epidural or&#xD;
           dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. No specific restrictions will be placed on participants following epidural insertion,&#xD;
           other than those that are routine for all labouring women with epidurals. However any&#xD;
           women who move off their bed and walk before removal of their epidural catheter will be&#xD;
           excluded from the study, since walking may cause the epidural catheter to migrate more&#xD;
           than it would do so usually during labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed to determine whether the null hypothesis is accepted or rejected.&#xD;
      Information about the study and any conclusion drawn will be published locally and nationally&#xD;
      in order to inform decision making regarding which epidural catheter fixation device is best&#xD;
      suited to reduce epidural migration in labouring women.&#xD;
