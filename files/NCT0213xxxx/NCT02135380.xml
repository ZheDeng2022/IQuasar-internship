  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite intense research efforts and clinical trials, there is still no effective treatment&#xD;
      that can prolong the survival of patients with IPF. Conventional therapeutic approach&#xD;
      includes combination of corticosteroids, anti-oxidants, immunodepressants and immune&#xD;
      modulatory anti-fibrotic agents to be discontinued 20 days before screening. The only, so&#xD;
      far, therapeutic approach that has been proven effective in terms of prolonging patient's&#xD;
      survival is lung transplantation. Nonetheless, not all the patients with IPF are eligible for&#xD;
      lung transplantation; there is a significant proportion of these patients that finally&#xD;
      succumb while waiting in a lung transplantation list. Therefore, there is critical need for&#xD;
      more effective and reliable therapeutic modalities5. Adult Stem Cells (ASCs) seem to&#xD;
      represent one of these. Therefore, it is conceivable to assume that adult-stem cells can be&#xD;
      easily and safely be applied as a novel therapeutic agent in chronic and fatal lung diseases,&#xD;
      including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is an urgent need to provide a safe, effective and affordable treatment&#xD;
      option for IPF patients. New diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies need to be&#xD;
      developed to reduce the burden of IPF. Given the present lack of appropriate treatment&#xD;
      adjunctive in the therapy of IPF, adipose derived stromal vascular fraction provides new&#xD;
      opportunities for development of the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules&#xD;
      involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This&#xD;
      cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to&#xD;
      mesenchymal tissue.14&#xD;
&#xD;
      As limited clinical information is available about use of SVF and MSC in the IPF patients&#xD;
      hence this Open Label, Prospective, Randomized multi center comparative study has been&#xD;
      undertaken to explore the tolerability &amp; effectiveness of SVF in one treatment arm and MSC in&#xD;
      second treatment arm in IPF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose derived stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in&#xD;
      preclinical studies to be safe and effective&#xD;

      Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained&#xD;
      from tumescent liposuction. The SVF contains a variety of cells such as pre-adipocytes,&#xD;
      endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and adult stem cells (ASCs).&#xD;
      In addition, the SVF also contains blood cells from the capillaries supplying the fat cells.&#xD;
      These include erythrocytes or red blood cells, B and T cells, macrophages, monocytes, mast&#xD;
      cells, natural killer (NK) cells, hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells,&#xD;
      to name a few. It also contains growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta&#xD;
      (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), among&#xD;
      others. This is consistent with the secretions of cells in the presence of an extracellular&#xD;
      matrix. The SVF also contains the various proteins present in the adipose tissue&#xD;
      extracellular matrix of which laminin is of interest due to its ability to help in neural&#xD;
      regeneration.Entire procedure for SVF preparation and isolation of SVF cells will be carried&#xD;
      out in cGMP compliance clean room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pure stromal vascular fraction to the tune of 99% will be isolated for this clinical trial&#xD;
      eliminating other unnecessary cells such as RBC and leukocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSC) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are&#xD;
      present as a rare population of cells in adipose tissue which is almost 30-40% of the&#xD;
      nucleated cells, but they can rapidly grow in culture without losing their stemness. MSCs can&#xD;
      be expanded in vitro ≥ 2 million -fold and retain their ability to differentiate into several&#xD;
      mesenchymal lineages. MSCs have several characteristics such as Ease of isolation, High&#xD;
      expansion potential,Genetic stability,Reproducible attributes from isolate to&#xD;
      isolate,Reproducible characteristics, Compatibility with tissue engineering principles,&#xD;
      Potential to enhance repair in many vital tissues, Uniform dose and Better quality control&#xD;
      and release criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside autologous use MSC can also be used for allogenic therapy. Several studies have used&#xD;
      allo-MSC in vivo and experience suggests that the allo-MSCs are not rejected and many have&#xD;
      positive effects on engraftment.MSC's can be isolated from various tissues, cultured ex vivo,&#xD;
      and expanded many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC's appear to represent a homogeneous&#xD;
      population by flow cytometric measures of cell-surface markers. These cell retain the ability&#xD;
      to undergo in vitro differentiation to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, even&#xD;
      when clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derived MSCs are capable of differentiating&#xD;
      into endothelial cells in vitro and later form capillary-like structures in semisolid medium&#xD;
      and suggest differentiation potential of MSCs is not restricted to mesodermal lineages but&#xD;
      also transdifferentiation of MSCs into other lineages like endothelial could be realized in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo8 MSCs are known to give rise to limb-bud mesoderm (osteoblasts,&#xD;
      chondrocytes, adipocytes, stroma cells, and skeletal myoblasts) and can also differentiate&#xD;
      into cells of visceral mesoderm (endothelial cells).9 MSCs can facilitate vasculogenesis by&#xD;
      increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. After MSCs are intramyocardially&#xD;
      injected into the infarct zone, local VEGF levels rise, vascular density and regional blood&#xD;
      flow increases, and contractility improves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules&#xD;
      involved with cell attachment to neighboring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This&#xD;
      cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to&#xD;
      mesenchymal tissue.&#xD;
