  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify effective and cost-effective interventions for tobacco use and&#xD;
      other risk behaviors for cardiovascular disease among Alaska Native people in rural villages.&#xD;
      In a randomized controlled trial, the study will compare interventions using telemedicine to&#xD;
      promote the American Heart Association's identified ideal health behaviors (nonsmoking and&#xD;
      physical activity) relative to ideal health factors (managing cholesterol and blood&#xD;
      pressure).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an RCT, we will compare 2 active treatments delivered over 12-months via telehealth&#xD;
      services linking participants in rural villages to Anchorage and Stanford-based study&#xD;
      counselors overcoming access-to-care for CV preventive health issues. The village AN health&#xD;
      aides will facilitate data collection and telehealth connectivity. Intervention contacts&#xD;
      occur at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12-months follow-up, with the final assessment at 18-months.&#xD;
      The repeated intervention contacts provide iterative computerized feedback reflecting prior&#xD;
      responses and encouragement of adoption and maintenance of behavioral health goals. The&#xD;
      groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tobacco/Physical Activity Intervention (n=150), consisting of a psychosocial component&#xD;
           that includes counselor-facing computer-assisted intervention with tailored counseling&#xD;
           feedback focused on increasing intrinsic motivation, goal setting for tobacco and&#xD;
           physical activity, adherence with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT, patch plus gum or&#xD;
           lozenge), and self-monitoring with a pedometer-based walking program. The study will&#xD;
           provide 12-weeks of NRT for participants randomized to this intervention condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HTN/HCL (HTN/HC, n=150), consisting of a psychosocial component that includes&#xD;
           counselor-facing computer-assisted intervention with tailored counseling feedback&#xD;
           focused on increasing intrinsic motivation, goal setting for managing HTN and HCL, and&#xD;
           adherence with antihypertensives and statins with supportive dietary changes. The AN&#xD;
           health plan covers antihypertensive and statins as a benefit to patients and would be&#xD;
           prescribed as part of standard of care (i.e., not prescribed for the purposes of this&#xD;
           research); however, strategies to maximize medication adherence are needed, hence the&#xD;
           focus of this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The counseling and print materials are highly individualized, unique to the participant,&#xD;
      thereby minimizing the likelihood of cross-condition contamination, determined to be minimal&#xD;
      in prior investigations. For the research study, participant eligibility criteria include AN&#xD;
      heritage; daily cigarette smoking; and hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or established vascular&#xD;
      disease. Intention to change the targeted risk behaviors will not be required to participate.&#xD;
      Utilizing telemedicine technology and Transtheoretical Model-tailored interventions, the&#xD;
      trial aims to reach at-risk AN people regardless of residential location or current&#xD;
      motivation. The primary outcome is biochemically-confirmed tobacco abstinence using&#xD;
      anabasine. Secondary outcomes include moderate-to-vigorous physical activity assessed by&#xD;
      self-report, blood pressure, cholesterol ratio, medication adherence, dietary change, body&#xD;
      mass index, Framingham index, multibehavioral impact factor, a linear index, and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
