  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a new radiation treatment that delivers&#xD;
      high-dose, precise radiation to small tumors in 1-3 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study combines SABR and surgery to treat non-small cell lung cancer. SABR will be done&#xD;
      first, with surgery done approximately 10 weeks later. There will be some extra imaging done&#xD;
      before and after the SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine how effective SABR is in killing the cancer cells,&#xD;
      and if SABR can help make surgery more effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The advent of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has provided a novel, promising&#xD;
      treatment for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. SABR uses modern&#xD;
      radiotherapy planning and targeting technologies to precisely deliver larger, ablative doses&#xD;
      of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of SABR as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery may provide a novel therapeutic&#xD;
      opportunity. In oncology, the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy prior to&#xD;
      surgery has become widespread for several types of cancer, and in many instances improves&#xD;
      local control over and/or survival compared to surgery alone. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy&#xD;
      provides several theoretical advantages, including potentially decreasing the rate of&#xD;
      positive margins, decreasing the size of the required resection, or by sterilizing the tumor&#xD;
      to avoid seeding of circulating tumor cells during surgery. Although radiologic outcomes&#xD;
      after SABR illustrate local control rates of approximately 90% in many studies, the presence&#xD;
      of residual post-treatment fibrosis may confound this assessment of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate a novel treatment approach: the combination of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant SABR followed by surgical resection in patients with T1T2N0 non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer, in order to measure the true pathologic rates of local control after SABR, to develop&#xD;
      new imaging biomarkers or response, and to assess clinical outcomes, including toxicity,&#xD;
      relapse patterns, and survival.&#xD;
