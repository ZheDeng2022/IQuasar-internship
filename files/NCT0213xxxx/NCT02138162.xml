    <textblock>
      The influence of severely diminished liver function on the metabolism, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of a single oral dose of enzalutamide in a group of 8 men. The results are&#xD;
      compared to the data gained from 8 age- and BMI-matched men with normal liver function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening takes place between Day -22 and Day -2, and subjects are admitted to the clinic on&#xD;
      Day -1. Each subject receives a single oral dose of enzalutamide on Day 1, under fasted&#xD;
      conditions. They are discharged on Day 7; ambulant visits take place until Day 50. An End of&#xD;
      Study Visit (ESV) occurs 7-10 days after the last PK sampling or early withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full PK profiles are obtained for enzalutamide, metabolite 1 of enzalutamide (M1) and&#xD;
      metabolite 2 of enzalutamide (M2) up to 1176 hours (Day 50) after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments are performed throughout the study. For subjects with severe hepatic&#xD;
      impairment, additional Child-Pugh classification and laboratory safety tests (including liver&#xD;
      function tests) are performed regularly after administration.&#xD;
