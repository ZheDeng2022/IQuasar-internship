    <textblock>
      Pazopanib (Votrient) is registered for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma and patients with soft tissue sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy. It is&#xD;
      administered at a fixed oral dose of 800 mg once daily (OD) regardless of size, age and&#xD;
      clinical condition. It is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an oral&#xD;
      bioavailability of ~21%. Pazopanib is practically insoluble and highly permeable. When&#xD;
      ingested with high fat food the pazopanib exposure (area under the concentration time curve&#xD;
      (AUC)) is doubled. Common adverse effects are diarrhea and nausea. This might be caused by&#xD;
      the non-absorbed proportion of pazopanib. A reduced dose taken with food could be a possible&#xD;
      approach to reduce these side effects. Therefore the investigators initially want to&#xD;
      determine the equivalent reduced dose of pazopanib when taken with a continental breakfast.&#xD;
      Thereafter the investigators want to investigate whether the intake with food reduces the&#xD;
      frequently reported side effects nausea and diarrhea.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pazopanib (Votrient) is a multi targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor receptor, (VEGFR-1, -2 en -3), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR-α&#xD;
      and -β), and stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT). Pazopanib is registered for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and patients with soft tissue sarcoma who have&#xD;
      received prior chemotherapy. It is administered at a fixed oral dose of 800 mg OD regardless&#xD;
      of size, age and clinical condition. It is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an&#xD;
      oral bioavailability of ~21%. Pazopanib is practically insoluble and highly permeable. When&#xD;
      ingested with high fat food the pazopanib exposure (area under the concentration time curve&#xD;
      (AUC)) is doubled. Common adverse effects are diarrhea and nausea. This might be caused by&#xD;
      the non-absorbed proportion of pazopanib. A dose reduction when ingested with food could be a&#xD;
      logical approach to reduce these side effects; however this is not tested in patients yet.&#xD;
      Therefore we want to perform a bioequivalent study to investigate what dose with a&#xD;
      continental breakfast equals the dose of 800 mg in fasted conditions (study part A). In part&#xD;
      B of the study we want to investigate whether the intake with food reduces the frequently&#xD;
      reported side effects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to performance of study-specific&#xD;
             procedures or assessments and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: informed consent may be obtained prior to start of the specified screening&#xD;
             window.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: procedures conducted as part of the subject's routine clinical management (e.g.&#xD;
             blood count) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be utilized for&#xD;
             screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures are conducted as specified in&#xD;
             the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ≥ 18 year old men and women who use pazopanib&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Adequate organ system function&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Poorly controlled hypertension; systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 40 mm Hg or diastolic&#xD;
             blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted prior to&#xD;
             study entry. Following antihypertensive medication initiation or adjustment, blood&#xD;
             pressure (BP) must be re-assessed three times at approximately 2-minute intervals. At&#xD;
             least 24 hours must have elapsed between anti-hypertensive medication initiation or&#xD;
             adjustment and BP measurement. These three values should be averaged to obtain the&#xD;
             mean diastolic blood pressure and the mean systolic blood pressure. The mean SBP / DBP&#xD;
             ratio must be &lt;140/90 mmHg (OR 150/90 mm Hg, if this criterion is approved by Safety&#xD;
             Review Team) in order for a subject to be eligible for the study.&#xD;

                  Association (NYHA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may increase the risk for&#xD;
             gastrointestinal bleeding including, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active peptic ulcer disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known intraluminal metastatic lesion/s with risk of bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), or other&#xD;
                  gastrointestinal conditions with increased risk of perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra abdominal&#xD;
                  abscess within 28 days prior to beginning study treatment.&#xD;

             investigational product including, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Malabsorption syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Major resection of the stomach or small bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack (TIA),&#xD;
             pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with recent DVT who have been treated with therapeutic anti-coagulating&#xD;
             agents for at least 6 weeks are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Major surgery or trauma within 28 days prior to first dose of investigational product&#xD;
             and/or presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer (procedures such as&#xD;
             catheter placement not considered to be major surgery).&#xD;

             excluded; however, the presence of a tumor that is touching, but not infiltrating&#xD;
             (abutting) the vessel is acceptable (CT with contrast is strongly recommended to&#xD;
             evaluate such lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Recent hemoptysis (½ teaspoon of red blood within 8 weeks before first dose of study&#xD;
             drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric, or other condition that&#xD;
             could interfere with subject's safety, provision of informed consent, or compliance to&#xD;
             study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Unable or unwilling to discontinue use of prohibited medications for at least 14 days&#xD;
             or five half-lives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of day 1&#xD;
             and for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Concurrent use of other substances known or likely to interfere with the&#xD;
             pharmacokinetics of pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients, who are adjusted to proton pump inhibitors and had no dose modifications for&#xD;
             over two weeks, are allowed to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
