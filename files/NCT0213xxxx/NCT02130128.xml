      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the LungPoint ATV&#xD;
      System in patients who are scheduled for standard bronchoscopy to diagnose highly suspicious&#xD;
      lung cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LungPoint ATV System is an image-guided navigation system used to access tissue samples&#xD;
      in the lungs. This feasibility study is being conducted to assess the safety and yield of the&#xD;
      LungPoint ATV System in patients who are scheduled for standard bronchoscopy to diagnose&#xD;
      highly suspicious lung cancer. Navigation to and sampling of the patient's lung cancer tumor&#xD;
      is conducted.&#xD;

    <description>The number of serious adverse events (SAEs) rated as probably or definitely related to the study device and/or procedure divided by the number of patients in whom an attempt at study device use was made. This study protocol focuses specifically on sub-chronic pneumothorax, but will also track hemoptysis.</description>
