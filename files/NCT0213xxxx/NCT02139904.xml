  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with malignant mesothelioma of the lung lining (called pleura) who&#xD;
      have had previous chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen whose disease has progressed.&#xD;
      Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive, frequently drug resistant, and&#xD;
      incurable disease that is increasing in incidence in the UK and worldwide. All patients with&#xD;
      MPM will relapse following first line chemotherapy and at present, there is no standard&#xD;
      treatment available for patients in the second line setting. The vinca alkaloid chemotherapy&#xD;
      drug vinorelbine has shown promising activity in a single arm UK trial. However to date,&#xD;
      there has been no randomised evaluation of vinorelbine in mesothelioma in the second line&#xD;
      setting. In addition, there have been no trials which have looked at underlying molecular&#xD;
      changes in mesothelioma which may predict vinorelbine efficacy; This might allow vinorelbine&#xD;
      to be used in patients only where there is a chance of benefit. Studies suggest that&#xD;
      vinorelbine requires a gene called BRCA1 (shown to be absent in 38% of mesothelioma cases) in&#xD;
      order to induce cell death in mesothelioma. The VIM trial aims to establish whether&#xD;
      vinorelbine in patients with MPM helps them live longer and whether the BRCA1 gene is helpful&#xD;
      in selecting patients most likely to benefit from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised (1:2) to receive either active symptom control (ASC) (which is&#xD;
      all supportive care deemed necessary for pain management excluding disease modifying&#xD;
      treatment) or ASC with vinorelbine. Patients will continue vinorelbine treatment until&#xD;
      evidence of disease progression (or unacceptable toxicity to the drug or patient withdrawal).&#xD;
      If vinorelbine activity is demonstrated, we will use the results from this trial to inform&#xD;
      the design of a future phase III trial.&#xD;

    <description>Anti-tumour activity of vinorelbine will also be measured by progression free survival. We will document time from randomisation to any disease progression and/or death, defined according to strict RECIST v1.1.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The toxicity profile of oral vinorelbine in this setting will be used to assess safety. An independent data monitoring committee will convene and assess safety 6 months after the first patient has been randomised. If the trial is deemed safe to continue then safety will be assessed again approx every 6 months. Toxicity data will be assessed alongside serious adverse events.</description>

    <description>Tumour and blood samples will be collected for future translational research. BRCA1 expression as a putative predictor of vinorelbine sensitivity will be measured primarily in the samples.</description>

    <description>Vinorelbine was first licensed in the UK for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and advanced breast cancer in 1997. Vinorelbine (Navelbine®) is a semi-synthetic, third generation, vinca alkaloid. The cytotoxic effect of vinorelbine is through the disruption of mitotic spindle formation, blocking mitosis at the G2-M stage resulting in cell death.</description>
