  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking has a negative effect on the predictability and stability of root coverage procedures&#xD;
      because of decreased blood supply and fibroblast activity. Long-term evaluation of this&#xD;
      procedure in smokers is important for clinical decision making, because it provides&#xD;
      information about the stability of results over time. In smokers, enamel matrix derivative&#xD;
      (EMD) used at acellular dermal matrix graft (ADMG)/ soft tissue interface could be an&#xD;
      alternative to improve the deficient healing potential, since EMD has the capability of&#xD;
      stimulating angiogenesis. At the ADMG/ root surface interface, it could improve the deficient&#xD;
      fibroblast activity in smokers and therefore reduce the presence of a long junctional&#xD;
      epithelium. The aim of this randomised controlled clinical study was to investigate whether&#xD;
      EMD contributes to the root coverage of gingival recessions performed with ADMG in smokers&#xD;
      during a 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty smokers with bilateral Miller Class I or II gingival recessions ≥ 3 mm will be&#xD;
      selected. The test group will be treated with an association of ADMG and EMD, and the control&#xD;
      group with ADMG alone. Some clinical parameters as: probing depth, relative clinical&#xD;
      attachment level, gingival recession height, gingival recession width, keratinized tissue&#xD;
      width and keratinized tissue thickness will be evaluated before surgery and after twelve&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      The present clinical study was designed as a controlled, randomised split-mouth design.&#xD;
      Twenty patients will be selected by an experienced periodontist responsible for the study at&#xD;
      the Clinic of Periodontology, School of Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto - University of São Paulo&#xD;
      (USP). The subjects should have bilateral large, Miller (1985) Class I or II, ≥ 3 mm&#xD;
      maxillary or mandibular gingival recession in non-molar teeth of different quadrants and in&#xD;
      the same dental arch. Radiographs will take to evaluate the interproximal alveolar bone&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning the active therapy, each patient will be randomised to a single treatment&#xD;
      group (test or control) by using the method of randomly allocating by simple draw to reduce&#xD;
      bias and equalize groups. The allocation was implemented by a senior investigator who will be&#xD;
      not directly involved in the examination or treatment procedures. Using a split-mouth design,&#xD;
      twenty patients with a total of 40 class I or II recession defects will be randomly allotted&#xD;
      and treated either with acellular dermal matrix graft (ADMG) + enamel matrix derivative (EMD)&#xD;
      (test group - TG) and the other side received only ADMG (control group - CG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical parameters will be recorded at the selected and adjacent teeth, on both sides,&#xD;
      with computerized periodontal probe two weeks after basic periodontal therapy (baseline) and&#xD;
      twelve months after surgery by one-blinded experienced periodontist. A calibration exercise&#xD;
      will be performed to achieve acceptable intraexaminer reproducibility (≥ 90%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients initially will complete a pre-surgical therapy - a program of plaque control was&#xD;
      performed before and after surgery and scaling and root planning with curettes. The plaque&#xD;
      and bleeding indices should be less than 20% at baseline. All risks and benefits involved in&#xD;
      the surgical procedures will be explained to the patients before they signed a consent form&#xD;
      in agreement. The methodology was approved by the Human Ethics Research Committee of the&#xD;
      School of Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto - USP (process 2009.1.590.58.4/ 004.0.138.000-09).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A modified surgical technique will be used in both groups, the flap is extended to adjacent&#xD;
      teeth as a modification of the current subepithelial connective tissue graft technique&#xD;
      (Langer &amp; Langer, 1985). In the test group, an additional EMD layer will be inserted between&#xD;
      the ADMG and the flap, and between the ADMG and the root surface by using a sterile brush.&#xD;
      The prescribed medication will include 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate solution to rinse&#xD;
      twice a day for the first fifteen days, amoxicillin for seven days, starting 24 hours before&#xD;
      surgery, and an analgesic for three days. Patients will continue to smoke as usual and will&#xD;
      be instructed to avoid trauma and to discontinue tooth brushing at the surgical sites during&#xD;
      fourteen days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sutures will be removed after fourteen days. The patients will be recalled for control&#xD;
      and prophylaxis after two and four weeks and, subsequently, once a month until the final&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
