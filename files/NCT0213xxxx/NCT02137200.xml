    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of immediate versus&#xD;
      delayed pushing for nulliparous women in labor at term reaching complete cervical dilation.&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that immediate pushing in the second stage of labor increases&#xD;
      spontaneous vaginal delivery, shortens duration of the second stage, and reduces adverse&#xD;
      neonatal and maternal outcomes in nulliparous women. They will pursue the following specific&#xD;
      aims: 1) Assess the effectiveness of immediate pushing at complete cervical dilation on the&#xD;
      rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery in nulliparous women (Primary Aim), 2) Determine the&#xD;
      effect of immediate pushing on the rate of neonatal composite morbidity (Secondary Aim #1),&#xD;
      and 3) Determine the impact of immediate versus delayed pushing on objective and subjective&#xD;
      measures of maternal pelvic floor morbidity (Secondary Aim #2). They estimate that&#xD;
      randomizing a total of 3184 women will provide adequate statistical power to detect&#xD;
      meaningful differences in the primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;

      A. SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that immediate pushing in the second stage of labor increases&#xD;
      spontaneous vaginal delivery, shortens duration of the second stage, and reduces adverse&#xD;
      neonatal and maternal outcomes in nulliparous women. They will pursue the following specific&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Primary Aim: Assess the effectiveness of immediate pushing at complete cervical dilation&#xD;
      on the rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery in nulliparous women. Hypothesis: Nulliparous&#xD;
      women will have an increase in spontaneous vaginal delivery rates with immediate, as compared&#xD;
      to delayed, pushing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Secondary Aims: i.Determine the effect of immediate pushing on the rate of neonatal&#xD;
      composite morbidity. Hypothesis: Immediate pushing will reduce the rate of neonatal composite&#xD;
      morbidity, defined as one or more of: neonatal death, major neonatal injury, umbilical cord&#xD;
      arterial acidosis, suspected neonatal sepsis, respiratory distress, transient tachypnea,&#xD;
      meconium aspiration with pulmonary hypertension, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy,&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, and need for hypothermia treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii.Determine the impact of immediate versus delayed pushing on objective and subjective&#xD;
      measures of maternal pelvic floor morbidity. Hypothesis: Immediate pushing will be associated&#xD;
      with a reduction in the rate of acute levator ani and anal sphincter muscle injury, and lower&#xD;
      rates of pelvic floor disorders identified on subjective and objective clinical assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      B1. Design Overview This is a multicenter randomized trial of nulliparous women to compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness of immediate and delayed pushing in the second stage of labor. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to test the central hypothesis that immediate pushing in the second stage&#xD;
      of labor increases spontaneous vaginal delivery, shortens duration of the second stage, and&#xD;
      reduces adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes. The investigators chose a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, the 'gold standard' of clinical research design, with the goal of obtaining&#xD;
      the highest quality evidence to inform clinical practice. Randomly allocating subjects to&#xD;
      different interventions minimizes selection bias and results in groups that are comparable&#xD;
      with regards to important confounding variables, both measured and unmeasured. Additionally,&#xD;
      the broad inclusion criteria, simplicity in relationship of the interventions to current&#xD;
      practice, and the multicenter design with regional representation and practice diversity&#xD;
      increase generalizability and direct application of the findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)&#xD;
      guidelines wherever appropriate in the conduct and reporting of this trial. They will use&#xD;
      computer-generated random sequences, stratified by study site, to assign participants to the&#xD;
      two interventions. Labor management will be similar in the two groups except for the timing&#xD;
      of maternal pushing effort. Analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle. The use of&#xD;
      broad inclusion criteria and intention-to-treat analysis will allow a more conservative&#xD;
      estimate of differences in outcomes between the two strategies and allow a better estimate of&#xD;
      effectiveness and public health implications of practice change than would pure estimate of&#xD;
      efficacy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B2. Study Sites and Populations&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Washington University Medical Center - Coordinating center (PI/PD-Cahill/Tuuli): The&#xD;
           obstetrical service at WUMC delivers babies for approximately 4000 women annually. WUMC&#xD;
           is a tertiary care hospital and draws all ethnic groups typical of a large urban&#xD;
           referral hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sub site: Missouri Baptist Medical Center is a private hospital affiliated with WUSM.&#xD;
           The obstetric service delivers 4000 women annually, predominantly by private physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. University of Alabama at Birmingham (Site PI-Tita): UAB Hospital is the major perinatal&#xD;
           referral facility for Alabama. Approximately 4200 women (53% African American, 25%&#xD;
           Caucasian, 20% Hispanic, and 2% other ethnic groups) are delivered annually in the Women&#xD;
           and Infants' Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (Site PI-Srinivas): The obstetrical service&#xD;
           at Penn delivers approximately 4100 women per year. Penn is an urban tertiary care&#xD;
           hospital with a diverse population. Patients are managed by faculty of the Penn School&#xD;
           of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sub site: Pennsylvania Hospital is a close affiliate of Penn. The obstetric unit is&#xD;
           staffed by both private obstetricians and midwives. Of the 4600 - 5000 deliveries&#xD;
           performed annually, 4000 - 4500 are performed by private physicians and 300 - 600 by&#xD;
           midwives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Oregon Health &amp; Science University (Site PI-Caughey): The Labor and Delivery Unit at&#xD;
           OHSU delivers approximately 2700 women per year. OHSU is a tertiary care hospital and&#xD;
           the only academic medical center in Oregon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria The investigators will use broad inclusion criteria to&#xD;
      ensure generalizability of our results. Exclusion criteria will be limited to conditions for&#xD;
      which vaginal delivery is contraindicated or expedited delivery is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B4. Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      B4-1. Primary aim Primary outcome measure: The primary outcome is spontaneous vaginal&#xD;
      delivery, defined as delivery that occurs without the use of forceps, vacuum, or cesarean, as&#xD;
      the primary outcome measure. This is because spontaneous vaginal delivery is the most&#xD;
      desirable outcome for laboring women in the second stage of labor. Compared to cesarean&#xD;
      delivery, spontaneous vaginal delivery is associated with lower maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      morbidity, including hemorrhage, postoperative wound infection, endometritis, and prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization. Further, once a cesarean is performed, the risk of delivery by cesarean for&#xD;
      future pregnancies is dramatically elevated, further increasing maternal morbidity. Finally,&#xD;
      although operative vaginal delivery is associated with overall lower maternal morbidity than&#xD;
      cesarean delivery, it carries higher risks of neonatal and maternal pelvic floor injury than&#xD;
      spontaneous vaginal delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures: Operative vaginal delivery (forceps or vacuum), cesarean&#xD;
      delivery, total duration of second stage, duration of active pushing, postpartum hemorrhage,&#xD;
      endometritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B4-2. Secondary aim#1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure: The outcome measure for this aim will be neonatal composite morbidity,&#xD;
      defined as occurrence of any of the morbidities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonatal death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major neonatal injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acidemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory distress&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transient tachypnea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meconium aspiration with pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspected sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
      B4-3. Secondary aim#2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rate and extent of acute levator ani muscle (LAM) injury in nulliparous women. i.Overt&#xD;
           LAM injury, defined as clinically diagnosed 2nd, 3rd, and 4th degree perineal&#xD;
           lacerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii.Occult LAM injury, defined as interruption in LAM on 3D transperineal ultrasound)&#xD;
           injury in nulliparous women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rates and extent of signs of POP on objective clinical examination at the 4 - 8 weeks,&#xD;
           and 5 - 7 months postpartum follow-up visits using the validated Pelvic Organ Prolapse&#xD;
           Quantification (POP-Q) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rates of patient-reported symptoms of urinary incontinence (UI), fecal incontinence&#xD;
           (FI), and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) on validated quality-of-life questionnaires at 1 -&#xD;
           5 days, 4 - 8 weeks, and 5 - 7 months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      C1. Recruitment The investigators will employ familiar efficient recruitment techniques we&#xD;
      have used in recent randomized trials in the same settings. All women admitted to the labor&#xD;
      and delivery units of the participating medical centers will be screened against inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will be approached for written consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study once they are committed to a vaginal delivery attempt. Although&#xD;
      consent to participate will be obtained irrespective of cervical dilation, randomization will&#xD;
      be performed only when complete cervical dilation is confirmed. This is necessary to avoid&#xD;
      situations in which subjects are randomized and subsequently undergo cesarean delivery in the&#xD;
      first stage of labor for indications such as failure to progress or non-reassuring fetal&#xD;
      heart tracing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C2. Randomization Enrolled subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to immediate or&#xD;
      delayed pushing. A web-based randomization sequence will be prepared using blocks of variable&#xD;
      sizes, stratified by study site, and maintained centrally by the study statistician. The&#xD;
      advantage of this method is that it provides a good probability of balance, and future&#xD;
      assignments are unpredictable. In addition, it allows an explicit randomization analysis to&#xD;
      be conducted with relative ease. Stratification by center assures balance between the two&#xD;
      treatment groups within each center to account for possible differences in patient&#xD;
      management. A subject's group assignment will be obtained only after the subject is confirmed&#xD;
      to continue to meet inclusion criteria, and a study number and 10-cm cervical dilation are&#xD;
      entered and locked in a secure web site upon complete cervical dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C3. Blinding Although blinding of both subjects and physicians would be ideal, blinding is&#xD;
      clearly not possible in this trial. We will minimize systematic bias by applying the same&#xD;
      standard procedures for managing labor and delivery in all patients. Further, the group&#xD;
      assignment of subjects will not be taken into account by research personnel collecting&#xD;
      neonatal and maternal outcomes and maternal pelvic floor morbidity. Importantly, the primary&#xD;
      outcome of spontaneous vaginal delivery is an objective measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C4. Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions to be compared in this trial are the two most common approaches to initiating&#xD;
      maternal pushing in the second stage of labor:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Immediate pushing: Women in this group will be instructed to initiate pushing as soon as&#xD;
           complete cervical dilation is documented. Maternal position, technique (closed or opened&#xD;
           glottis), and duration and frequency of maternal pushing effort will be at the&#xD;
           discretion of each subject's nurse or physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Delayed pushing: Women assigned to the delayed pushing group will be instructed to wait&#xD;
           for 60 minutes from complete cervical dilation before pushing. Women will be allowed to&#xD;
           push earlier if they feel an irresistible urge to push or there is a clinical indication&#xD;
           to initiate pushing. We chose 60 minutes as the delay time because our meta-analysis&#xD;
           suggested that the duration of delay (ranging from 60 to 180 minutes) did not modify the&#xD;
           effect of delayed pushing on spontaneous vaginal delivery rates. Additionally, a&#xD;
           60-minute delay will enable us to assess the effect of delayed pushing without unduly&#xD;
           increasing total duration of the second stage. This is important because, although there&#xD;
           is no established threshold, a number of large cohort studies suggest incremental&#xD;
           increase in the risks of operative delivery, maternal infection, hemorrhage, and&#xD;
           laceration, as well as neonatal Apgar score depression, worsening cord pH, and neonatal&#xD;
           morbidity, with each additional hour in the second stage, regardless of whether patients&#xD;
           pushed immediately or delayed pushing. Finally, patients indicated in our survey that&#xD;
           they would prefer to wait no longer than 60 minutes after complete cervical dilation&#xD;
           before pushing if they were randomized to the delayed pushing group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C5. Pelvic Floor Assessment These assessments will be overseen by Co-I Dr. Richter, a&#xD;
      Urogynecologist and site the UAB PI of the NIH-funded Pelvic Floor Disorders Research&#xD;
      Network. Patients willing to participate in the pelvic floor assessment part of the study&#xD;
      will be consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C5-1. Postpartum three-dimensional transperineal ultrasound imaging Traditionally, MRI has&#xD;
      been used to detect LAM injury, but investigators have recently validated the use of 3D&#xD;
      ultrasound to assess acute LAM injury. We will use ultrasound because it is a much more&#xD;
      readily available and inexpensive tool than MRI. Subjects enrolled at WUMC, UAB, OHSU and&#xD;
      PENN will be asked to consent for pelvic floor assessment including postpartum 3D&#xD;
      transperineal ultrasound examination. Examinations will follow methods developed and&#xD;
      validated by Dietz and Simpson. Dr. Shobeiri will undertake all image processing and&#xD;
      interpretation. Drs. Shobeiri and Lockhart, as well as other trained personnel, will be&#xD;
      blinded to the group assignments of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C5-2. Assessment of pelvic floor morbidity The investigators will conduct a comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment of the pelvic floor to include all components outlined in the proceedings of the&#xD;
      NIH Terminology Workshop for Research in Pelvic Floor Disorders. These assessments will be&#xD;
      overseen by Co-I Dr. Richter, a Urogynecologist and site PI of the NIH-funded Pelvic Floor&#xD;
      Disorders Research Network with extensive experience in the use of these instruments for&#xD;
      pelvic floor research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. POP-Q staging of pelvic organ prolapse (4 - 8 weeks, and 5 - 7 months postpartum):&#xD;
           Objective assessment of pelvic organ prolapse will be based on the POP-Q system, an&#xD;
           objective, site-specific system for describing, quantifying, and staging pelvic support&#xD;
           in women. We will follow standard guidelines established by the International Continence&#xD;
           Society. Pelvic examinations will be performed in the dorsal lithotomy position with the&#xD;
           subject straining maximally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptom and Quality-of-Life Questionnaires (1-5 days, 4 - 8 weeks, and 5 - 7 months&#xD;
           postpartum): We will use four validated Symptom and Quality-of-Life Questionnaires to&#xD;
           assess subjective symptoms of pelvic floor morbidity: Fecal Incontinence Severity Index&#xD;
           (FISI), Modified Manchester Questionnaire, Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20, Pelvic&#xD;
           Floor Impact Questionnaire-7 (PFIQ-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. DATA MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      D1. Data Collection The investigators will collect extensive antepartum, intrapartum, and&#xD;
      postpartum information from participants and their infants. Data will be collected on&#xD;
      standardized forms on which nearly all responses will be precoded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D2. Data Management The study statistician (Dr. Liu) and the data manager (Mr. Colvin) at&#xD;
      WUSM will be responsible for coordinating the overall data management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and managed with REDcap (Research Electronic Data Capture), an&#xD;
      established, secure, web-based data capture and management tool developed at Vanderbilt&#xD;
      University and supported by the Division of Biostatistics at WUSM&#xD;
      (http://www.biostat.wustl.edu/redcap/). The database is backed up periodically throughout&#xD;
      each day and is backed up offsite nightly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      assessment. Data cleaning will be performed prior to quarterly reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      E1. Sample size and Power E1-1. Total sample size for the trial: The sample size for the&#xD;
      trial is estimated based on the primary outcome. The investigators then estimate, on the&#xD;
      basis of the sample size for the primary aim, the power they will have to detect clinically&#xD;
      significant differences in the secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sample size and power estimates are based on two-tailed tests. This is important because&#xD;
      we will be powered to detect both increases and decreases in outcomes with immediate compared&#xD;
      to delayed pushing. The baseline spontaneous vaginal delivery rate with delayed pushing used&#xD;
      for the sample size estimation is based on our observational cohort. We estimate that a total&#xD;
      of 3184 (1592 delayed and 1592 immediate pushing) will be sufficient to detect a 5% absolute&#xD;
      difference (estimated 72% versus 77%) in spontaneous vaginal delivery with 90% power (alpha&#xD;
      of 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      E1-2. Estimated power for secondary aim #1: The sample size of 3184 for the primary outcome&#xD;
      will be sufficient to detect a 2% absolute difference in neonatal composite morbidity between&#xD;
      the two groups with &gt;80% power and significance level of 5%. This represents the difference&#xD;
      between a 6% neonatal composite morbidity rate with delayed (based on our observational&#xD;
      cohort study) and 4% with immediate pushing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E1-3. Estimated power for secondary aim #2: We anticipate that at least 630 will consent for&#xD;
      and complete the pelvic floor aspects of the study. This will provide adequate power for the&#xD;
      key outcomes under secondary aim #2. The rate of POP (defined as any POP at or below the&#xD;
      hymen) or FI (based on FISI) in nulliparous women at 6 - 12 months postpartum from prior&#xD;
      studies were 20.2% [38] and 12.6%[38, 39], respectively. Using these as baselines, the 630&#xD;
      women will provide &gt;80% power to detect a 40% difference in rates pelvic organ prolapse or&#xD;
      fecal incontinence between the two groups. For LAM injury on postpartum 3D transperineal&#xD;
      ultrasound examination, a prior study found an average rate of 38% [40]. Using this baseline&#xD;
      rate, 630 women will provide &gt;90% power to detect at least a 30% difference in occult LAM&#xD;
      injury. For overt anal sphincter injury, the sample size will be sufficient to detect a 40%&#xD;
      difference in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th perineal lacerations (anticipated 27% to 16.2% with &gt;80%&#xD;
      power).&#xD;
&#xD;
      E2. Interim Analyses The investigators anticipate two interim analyses after 50% and 75% of&#xD;
      the sample size are recruited, but the exact timing will be at the discretion of the DSMB.&#xD;
      Analyses will be performed by the study statistician and presented to the DSMB, which will&#xD;
      make recommendations regarding further conduct of the trial. At their first meeting, the DSMB&#xD;
      will establish thresholds and rules for trial stoppage based on safety and efficacy limits.&#xD;
      Although early stopping decisions cannot be based purely on a mathematical stopping rule, the&#xD;
      Haybittle-Peto stopping rule will be used as a guide. Under this rule, the interim analyses&#xD;
      of the primary outcome would have to demonstrate an extreme difference between groups (p&#xD;
      &lt;0.001) to justify premature disclosure. This rule has the advantages that the exact number&#xD;
      and timing of interim analyses need not be specified in advance and the overall type I error&#xD;
      is preserved at 0.05. Therefore, samples size adjustments are not needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E3. Data Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      E3-1. Overview Data analyses will adhere closely to the CONSORT guidelines. Analyses will&#xD;
      follow the intention-to-treat principle in which subjects will be analyzed in the group to&#xD;
      which they were randomized, regardless of whether or not they received the assigned&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E3-2. Primary Analysis Descriptive statistics will characterize the group of individuals&#xD;
      recruited and investigate comparability of the two groups at baseline. Formal statistical&#xD;
      testing will be limited to selected baseline characteristics considered to be prognostic&#xD;
      factors for the primary outcome, such as fetal station at complete cervical dilation, birth&#xD;
      weight, and duration of the first stage of labor. The categorical prognostic factors will be&#xD;
      compared between trial groups by using the Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests as&#xD;
      appropriate. Distributions of continuous prognostic factors will be assessed by visual&#xD;
      inspection of histograms and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The two-group independent t-test&#xD;
      will be used to compare normally distributed variables. If variables are not normally&#xD;
      distributed, the Mann-Whitney U test will be used to make comparisons between the trial&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of primary and secondary outcomes will be controlled for study site, considering&#xD;
      that the randomization is stratified by study site. The primary outcome (spontaneous vaginal&#xD;
      delivery) and other categorical secondary outcomes will be compared between trial groups by&#xD;
      using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. The estimates of the common relative risk and&#xD;
      confidence intervals associated with the primary and secondary outcomes will be calculated.&#xD;
      The Breslow-Day test for homogeneity of the odds ratios will be reported as well.&#xD;
      Distributions of continuous secondary outcome measures such as duration of the second stage&#xD;
      of labor within each site will be assessed by visual inspection of histograms and the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The mixed model in which study site is treated as a fixed effect&#xD;
      will be used to compare normally distributed variables. If variables are not normally&#xD;
      distributed, the van Elteren test will be used to make comparisons between the trial groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E3-3. Secondary Analyses The investigators will perform other analyses aimed at obtaining&#xD;
      adjusted assessments of treatment effectiveness, adjusting for baseline patient&#xD;
      characteristics (covariates). The objectives of these analyses are to estimate the influence&#xD;
      of covariates on the outcome and to use covariates to improve the estimated difference&#xD;
      between treatment groups. The stepwise logistic regression model stratified by study site&#xD;
      will be used to identify and estimate the effect of multiple prognostic factors on the&#xD;
      probability of spontaneous vaginal delivery and other categorical outcomes. For continuous&#xD;
      secondary outcomes such as duration of the second stage, the mixed model in which study site&#xD;
      is treated as a fixed effect will be considered to adjust for prognostic factors. Interaction&#xD;
      tests will be used to determine whether the effectiveness of the pushing strategy&#xD;
      significantly differs across these subgroups. These analyses will be considered exploratory&#xD;
      in nature and will not be viewed as providing confirmatory tests of hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following prespecified subgroup analyses will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study site&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fetal station at complete cervical dilation (high versus low)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fetal position at complete cervical dilation (occiput-anterior versus occiput-posterior)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
       16. Effect on cord blood lactate&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. Cost-effectiveness of delayed versus immediate pushing&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. Pelvic floor related outcomes i. Within and across intervention groups, correlate UI, FI&#xD;
           and POP symptoms and impact and POPQ exams in women with/without LAM injury (control for&#xD;
           LAM injury when comparing pelvic floor symptoms between immediate and delayed pushing&#xD;
           groups) ii. Characterize rates of regression/persistence of pelvic floor symptoms/impact&#xD;

      E3-4. Patient Satisfaction The investigators will assess patient satisfaction with their&#xD;
      birthing experienced using the modified Mackey Childbirth Satisfaction Rating Scale. This is&#xD;
      a simple validated childbirth satisfaction scale which has been modified to focus on the&#xD;
      second stage experience. Face and construct validity as well as reliability have been&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E3-5. Economic Analysis The investigators will conduct economic analysis to estimate medical&#xD;
      costs associated with management of the second stage and associated outcomes quantify&#xD;
      potential cost savings attributable to immediate or delayed pushing.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Singleton term pregnancy: gestational age ≥37 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Nulliparous women&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Neuraxial anesthesia: epidural or combined epidural-spinal anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Preterm: gestational age &lt;37 weeks (preterm infants have an a priori risk for adverse&#xD;
             outcomes, which is driven more by gestational age than the timing of maternal pushing&#xD;
             in the second stage)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Multiple gestation (incidence of multiple gestation is small and there are unique&#xD;
             delivery considerations)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Multiparous women&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing (will be an indication for expedited delivery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Contraindication to vaginal delivery including: non-vertex presentation, placenta&#xD;
             previa, prior classical cesarean, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No neuraxial anesthesia: epidural or combined epidural-spinal anesthesia (subjects&#xD;
             without adequate pain control tend to push involuntarily and cannot delay pushing)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnancy complications requiring expedited delivery: severe preeclampsia, placental&#xD;
             abruption, maternal cardiac disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Fetal head visible at the introitus at complete cervical dilation&#xD;
