    <textblock>
      Neurodevelopmental disability is now recognized as the most common long-term complication&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery in neonates. Research studies have shown that progesterone is critical&#xD;
      to the development of the brain and in a variety of clinical situations including brain&#xD;
      injury can protect the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether progesterone administered during&#xD;
      the 3rd trimester of pregnancy (24-39 weeks) to pregnant women protects the brain of unborn&#xD;
      babies with CHD and improves their neurodevelopmental outcomes after heart surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, approximately 1 in every 100 newborns is diagnosed with congenital&#xD;
      heart disease (CHD). Many of these newborns (25%-35%) will require either corrective or&#xD;
      palliative open heart surgery. As recently as the 1960's, only 20% of newborns with critical&#xD;
      CHD survived to adulthood. Today, thanks to better diagnostic technologies and methods&#xD;
      (including prenatal diagnosis), advances in surgery, and improved postoperative care, early&#xD;
      survival is over 90%. However, with improved early outcomes has come the sobering recognition&#xD;
      that there is an ongoing risk of late mortality, as well as significant morbidity for these&#xD;
      children. In particular, neurodevelopmental disability is now recognized as the most common&#xD;
      complication of critical CHD (i.e. those patients requiring cardiac surgery in infancy) and&#xD;
      has the most negative impact on quality of life, academic performance and opportunity for&#xD;
      independence as an adult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The altered fetal hemodynamics secondary to CHD lead to decreased blood flow and/or oxygen&#xD;
      delivery to the fetal brain. In turn, this impairment in blood flow and oxygenation results&#xD;
      in impaired brain growth and altered structural and cellular maturation, particularly of the&#xD;
      white matter. Fetal MRI studies have shown that during the third trimester, normally a time&#xD;
      of rapid brain growth and development, brains of infants with CHD fail to grow at the same&#xD;
      rate as the brains of fetuses without CHD. This growth delay results in microcephaly,&#xD;
      immature cellular elements of the white matter and decreased cortical folding at birth. It&#xD;
      has been demonstrated that brain immaturity at birth is a primary major risk factor&#xD;
      underlying the hypoxic-ischemic white matter brain injury and subsequent neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disability seen in over 50% of infants following surgery for CHD. In addition, there is&#xD;
      increasing evidence in the CHD population that even late pre-term birth (prior to 39 weeks&#xD;
      GA) is associated with increased mortality, increased peri-operative morbidity, and worse&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progesterone is an essential hormone in the occurrence and maintenance of pregnancy.&#xD;
      Progesterone administration has also been shown to be neuroprotective in a variety of&#xD;
      clinical situations, including traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sex steroid hormones, including&#xD;
      progesterone, are critically involved in axonal myelination, forming the basis of white&#xD;
      matter connectivity in the central nervous system (CNS). Progesterone and its metabolites not&#xD;
      only promote the viability and regeneration of neurons, but also act on myelinating glial&#xD;
      cell oligodendrocytes in the CNS and play an important role in the formation of myelin&#xD;
      sheaths. Progesterone has also been shown to increase myelination and enhance maturation of&#xD;
      immature oligodendrocytes progenitor cells to mature oligodendrocytes, which are more&#xD;
      resistant to hypoxic/ischemic injury. Therapeutic administration of progesterone has also&#xD;
      been demonstrated to prevent preterm birth. Thus, there are two potential mechanisms by which&#xD;
      pre-natal progesterone therapy may improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with CHD:&#xD;
      1) a direct neuroprotective effect, and 2) decreasing the occurrence of pre-term birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Develop preliminary evidence to support a multi-institutional study to determine&#xD;
      whether, in women carrying fetuses (maternal-fetal dyad) with CHD, prophylactic vaginal&#xD;
      natural progesterone therapy is neuroprotective, and compared to placebo improves&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Develop preliminary evidence to support a multi-institutional study to determine&#xD;
      whether, in women carrying fetuses (maternal-fetal dyad) with CHD, prophylactic vaginal&#xD;
      natural progesterone therapy is neuroprotective, and compared to placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. improves fetal brain growth and maturation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. increases myelination during fetal brain development,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. reduces pre-operative brain white matter injury, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. reduces post-operative white matter injury.&#xD;
