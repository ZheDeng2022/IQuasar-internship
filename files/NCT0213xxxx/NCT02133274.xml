  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief psychosocial intervention together&#xD;
      with early palliative care are feasible, acceptable and effective in the reduction of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms of patients with advanced cancers starting first line palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced cancer report physical, emotional, social and existential problems&#xD;
      that may be due to the cancer itself or its treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      benefit of early inclusion of palliative care (PC) in combination with standard oncologic&#xD;
      care in reducing depressive symptoms, improving quality of life, increasing survival and also&#xD;
      decreasing unnecessary invasive procedures. However, patients continue to arrive late at PC,&#xD;
      even in large comprehensive cancer centers. One of the barriers is the stigma of PC perceived&#xD;
      by patients and health professionals as &quot;a place to die.&quot; The primaries objectives are to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and satisfaction of patients with advanced cancer submitted to a&#xD;
      brief psychosocial intervention based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in addition to&#xD;
      early PC and to evaluate the impact of these interventions on the reduction of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. A randomized, open-label, phase II trial, with two intervention arms and a control&#xD;
      group. It will be included 150 patients with advanced cancer initiating palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy who meet the selection criteria. Participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      outpatient oncology clinics from the Barretos Cancer Hospital and will be randomized in one&#xD;
      of the three treatment arms: arm A, five weekly sessions of brief psychosocial interventions&#xD;
      based on CBT in combination with early PC; arm B, early PC only; arm C, standard oncologic&#xD;
      care. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9&#xD;
      (PHQ-9), Brazilian version of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS-br), European&#xD;
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 PAL&#xD;
      (EORTC QLQ-C15-Pal), 13-item measure of patient satisfaction (FAMCARE-P13), and the Disease&#xD;
      Understanding Protocol, will be the instruments used for data collection. Patients will&#xD;
      answer these instruments at baseline and after 45, 90, 120, and 180 days after randomization.&#xD;
      An interim analysis is planned to occur after the inclusion of 20 participants with complete&#xD;
      data in each arm; if the Cohen's effect size between the arms A and B is small (d&lt;&lt;0.2), the&#xD;
      study will continue only with arms B and C.&#xD;
