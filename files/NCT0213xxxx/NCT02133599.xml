  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year approximately 2,900 children and adolescents less than 20 years old are diagnosed&#xD;
      with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic lymphoma in the United States. (For&#xD;
      the purposes of this protocol, ALL will be used to refer to patients with either acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic lymphoma as patients are treated in the same&#xD;
      manner.) High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX; 5 g/m2) remains an important component of standard&#xD;
      treatment for most ALL patients. However, high plasma and intracellular MTX concentrations&#xD;
      (defined as a MTX level of &gt;1 µmol/L at 42 hours and &gt; 0.40 µmol/L at 48 hours) can quickly&#xD;
      lead to acute kidney, bone marrow, liver, skin, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal&#xD;
      toxicities requiring extended hospitalization and delays in subsequent chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to identify more sensitive markers of kidney injury that could serve as&#xD;
      better predictors of delayed excretion and/or toxicity of HDMTX. This study is a pilot&#xD;
      repeated-measures feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Directly measured GFR (mGFR, a type of test to measure the filtering rate of&#xD;
      kidneys) by iohexol clearance obtained prior to HDMTX will demonstrate greater sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity for prediction of delayed MTX excretion and/or toxicity in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with ALL than serum creatinine (sCr) alone or sCr used for eGFR calculation. If&#xD;
      this study proves that mGFR is a better predictor of delayed MTX excretion and/or toxicity,&#xD;
      then another study will be developed in the future to determine if modifying the HDMTX dose&#xD;
      or adjusting supportive care based on mGFR will prevent delayed clearance and toxicity&#xD;
      without impacting patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Those participants prospectively demonstrating delayed MTX excretion or&#xD;
      toxicity will exhibit elevation of kidney injury biomarkers less than 24 hours following&#xD;
      initiation of HDMTX infusion compared to pre-chemotherapy measurements. These biomarkers will&#xD;
      increase prior to a measurable sCr elevation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using this approach, retrospective clinical data from our patient population has identified a&#xD;
      significant number of HDMTX treatments associated with delayed MTX excretion (defined as a&#xD;
      MTX level of &gt;1 µmol/L at 42 hours and &gt; 0.40 µmol/L at 48 hours) and secondary toxicity.&#xD;
      From January 2012-May 2013, 16 ALL patients received 64 total HDMTX doses (4 cycles each). At&#xD;
      48 hours post-HDMTX infusion, 27 doses (42%) exhibited delayed MTX clearance [median plasma&#xD;
      MTX level 0.41 µmol/L (range, 0.01-1.6 µmol/L) above the 48-hour clearance level of 0.40&#xD;
      µmol/L]. Mucositis, cytopenias, skin rashes, and subsequent chemotherapy delays were noted in&#xD;
      31%, 31%, 6%, and 34% of doses respectively. Toxicities in combination with delayed MTX&#xD;
      clearance occurred in 17 doses (27%) and toxicity without delayed clearance occurred in 18&#xD;
      doses (28%). Also, a mean increase in sCr of 17% (range 0-57.6%) above pre-HDMTX baseline was&#xD;
      observed. Although measurements of sCr are used per the standard of care as an indirect&#xD;
      marker of kidney injury, the known delay in sCr rise following nephrotoxic (drug-induced)&#xD;
      kidney injury (KI) eliminates its use as a point of care surrogate marker for kidney&#xD;
      toxicity. Therefore, this study seeks to identify more sensitive markers of kidney injury&#xD;
      that could serve as better predictors of delayed excretion and/or toxicity of HDMTX. This&#xD;
      study is a pilot repeated-measures feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substantial evidence demonstrates sCr, alone or used to estimate glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      (eGFR), overestimates kidney filtering function when compared with direct measurement of GFR&#xD;
      [3]. A new, commonly used equation for estimating the GFR uses values of sCr, blood urea&#xD;
      nitrogen (BUN), and cystatin C. Conversely, a direct measurement of kidney filtering function&#xD;
      (mGFR) can be accomplished by determining the plasma (part of the blood) iohexol&#xD;
      (Omnipaque300, GE Healthcare) clearance rate (rate at which the iohexol is removed from the&#xD;
      body by the kidneys) over a period of 300 minutes, and has been documented as a sensitive and&#xD;
      accurate measure of renal filtering function [4]. Plasma clearance of iohexol is an optimal&#xD;
      method of determining mGFR, particularly in children, because it is not radioactive, is&#xD;
      non-ionic, has a low osmolality, has been proven to be a safe and non-toxic X-ray contrast&#xD;
      medium, and is excreted from the plasma exclusively by the kidneys [5]. Iohexol is a&#xD;
      well-known contrast agent that is already FDA-approved for use in urographic procedures,&#xD;
      angiographic procedures, and for the measurement of GFR (See Appendix I for more information&#xD;
      on the history and safety of iohexol use for GFR measurement). Iohexol clearance from plasma&#xD;
      has been shown in several studies to be a suitable method of determining GFR in adults [6]&#xD;
      and children [7, 8, 9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that standard oncology care relies on sCr values and eGFR, the kidney filtering&#xD;
      function is likely often overestimated, which can result in an increased incidence of delayed&#xD;
      MTX excretion and subsequent toxicity. Therefore, mGFR may provide an optimal method to more&#xD;
      accurately determine kidney filtering function and thereby allow prediction of which ALL&#xD;
      patients will develop delayed MTX excretion and/or toxicity. The utility of mGFR in&#xD;
      predicting MTX excretion delay and/or toxicity has not been previously studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, earlier recognition of kidney injury following HDMTX administration could also&#xD;
      be evaluated using biomarkers in blood and urine. If these biomarkers are found to be useful&#xD;
      in diagnosing early kidney injury, these tests may become a new clinical point of care in the&#xD;
      future that could allow earlier and thus more effective clinical intervention in ALL&#xD;
      patients. These interventions include increased intravenous hydration, which decreases the&#xD;
      associated end-organ toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and clusterin, serum cystatin C, and plasma&#xD;
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (pFGF23) are biomarkers that appear earlier and are more&#xD;
      sensitive than sCr in the setting of kidney injury. In fact, a detectable increase in sCr&#xD;
      does not occur until 24-48 hours after a primary renal injury [2]. KIM-1, a type 1&#xD;
      transmembrane glycoprotein, is not expressed in normal kidneys, but is exhibited at high&#xD;
      levels in proximal tubule epithelial cells and is excreted into the urine within 6-12 hours&#xD;
      after toxic or ischemic injury [10, 11, 12]. Similarly, clusterin expression is induced by&#xD;
      glomerular, tubular, or papillary kidney injury, with increased urine concentrations at 8,&#xD;
      24, and 48 hours post-toxic exposure [12, 13]. Cystatin C, a cysteine protease inhibitor, is&#xD;
      not affected by age, gender, race, or overall muscle mass, making it a useful glomerular&#xD;
      filtration marker in early KI. In a prospective study, cystatin C rise preceded an increase&#xD;
      in sCr by 1-2 days [14]. FGF23 increases as early as within one hour of acute KI induction in&#xD;
      mice and remains elevated in chronically compromised GFR, thereby serving as a useful&#xD;
      biomarker in both acute and chronic KI [15]. In addition, plasma FGF23 has recently been show&#xD;
      to be a strong predictor for risk of adverse outcomes in adults with acute kidney injury&#xD;
      (AKI), with the median FGF 23 level obtained within 24 hours of admission being 5.5 times&#xD;
      higher in patients with AKI compared to &quot;control&quot; ICU patients without kidney injury and&#xD;
      almost 20 times higher than the upper limit of normal [16]. Therefore, KIM-1, clusterin,&#xD;
      cystatin C, and FGF23 could provide earlier detection of kidney injury related to HDMTX when&#xD;
      compared with sCr measurements. The utility of these biomarkers in identifying early kidney&#xD;
      injury following treatment with HDMTX has not been previously studied. This study will&#xD;
      compare these biomarkers with sCr pre-, intra-, and post-HDMTX treatment to determine their&#xD;
      utility in detecting early kidney injury.&#xD;
