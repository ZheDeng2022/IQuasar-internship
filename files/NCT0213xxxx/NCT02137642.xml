&#xD;
          2. Subjects with chronic IDIOPATHIC constipation, including experiencing constipation for&#xD;
             12 or more weeks in the preceding 12 months. Chronic constipation is to be defined by&#xD;
             the Rome III criteria for Functional Constipation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Stable concomitant medications defined as no changes in regimen for at least 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to the study period.&#xD;

             throughout the study. Female patients unable to bear children must have this&#xD;
             documented in their medical history. (i.e., tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or&#xD;
             post-menopausal [defined as a minimum of one year since the last menstrual period]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent or to comply with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of secondary constipation e.g. underlying general neurological disease such&#xD;
             as Parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis, diseases associated with peripheral neuropathy,&#xD;
             iatrogenic constipation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Structural or metabolic diseases that affect the GI system NOTE: Patients with&#xD;
             clinical suspicion of upper or lower GI obstruction must have been evaluated per&#xD;
             standard of care and obstruction ruled out before screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Unable to withdraw the following medications 48 hours prior to the colon study day and&#xD;
             throughout the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medications that alter GI transit including laxatives, magnesium and aluminum&#xD;
                  containing antacids, prokinetics, erythromycin, narcotics, aspirin,&#xD;
                  anti-cholinergics, tricyclic antidepressants, SNRI and newer antidepressants.&#xD;
                  With the exception of GoLYTELY which will be taken the evening prior to colon&#xD;
                  study day. 4- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are&#xD;
                  permissible at low, stable doses. All medications shall be reviewed and&#xD;
                  dis/approved by the principal investigator on a case by case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Analgesic drugs including opiates, NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  GABAnergic agents&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Benzodiazepines NOTE: stable doses of thyroid replacement, estrogen replacement&#xD;
                  and birth control (but with adequate backup contraception as drug-interactions&#xD;
                  with birth control have not been conducted) are permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Drugs with a low therapeutic index, such as warfarin, digoxin, anti-seizure&#xD;
                  medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of recent surgery (within 60 days of screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Acute or chronic illness or history of illness, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, could pose a threat or harm to the patient or obscure interpretation of&#xD;
             laboratory test results or interpretation of study data such as frequent angina, Class&#xD;
             III or IV congestive heart failure, moderate impairment of renal or hepatic function,&#xD;
             poorly controlled diabetes, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities identified in the medical record, as determined by the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Acute GI illness within 48 hours of initiation of the colonic study day&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of alcohol or substance abuse; Alcohol use 2 days before colonic study day&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participation in a clinical study involving an investigational medication within the&#xD;
             30 days prior to dosing in the present study&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any other reason, which in the opinion of the Investigator, would confound proper&#xD;
             interpretation of the study&#xD;
