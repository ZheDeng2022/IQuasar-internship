    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent, chronic and/or recurrent condition&#xD;
      with substantial morbidity and mortality. It is one of the leading causes of disability&#xD;
      worldwide. Despite significant advances in pharmacological treatment for depression over the&#xD;
      last two decades, a significant proportion of patients (10-20%) are resistant to currently&#xD;
      available treatment. The development of new effective treatment for depression is limited by&#xD;
      the fact that MDD is a heterogeneous disorder with subgroups based on variations in&#xD;
      etiological factors and treatment response. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      approaches offer promise in the prediction and evaluation of clinical response of&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous fMRI studies have identified increased activity in dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (DLPFC) and decreased amygdala activity from the baseline as imaging markers of&#xD;
      antidepressant response in patients with MDD. However, these studies have examined MDD as a&#xD;
      homogenous group without specifying the type of patient group, and brain regions as a priori&#xD;
      hypothesis.We therefore need studies using combined genetics and neuroimaging measures as&#xD;
      biomarkers in the prediction and evaluation of clinical response to antidepressants. In this&#xD;
      study we attempted to determine imaging clinical efficacy markers in previously defined brain&#xD;
      regions (amygdala and prefrontal regions) for two classes of antidepressants (citalopram and&#xD;
      quetiapine extended release (XR)) with differential action on serotonin transporter&#xD;
      inhibition in a subgroup of MDD patients with high risk allele ( S/Lg) of serotonin&#xD;
      transporter gene polymorphism.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The atypical antipsychotic quetiapine has been found to have significant antidepressant&#xD;
      action in addition to antipsychotic action. Unlike citalopram a selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitor (SSRI) quetiapine has no effect on serotonin transporter (5-HTT) but it increases&#xD;
      post synaptic 5-HT1A binding potentials and down regulates 5-HT2A receptors consistently&#xD;
      (Tarazi et al., 2002) due to its direct antagonistic effect on 5-HT2A receptors and agonistic&#xD;
      effect on post synaptic 5-HT1A receptors. The quetiapine induced down regulation of 5-HT2A&#xD;
      receptors and increased density of 5-HT1A receptors has been attributed to its antidepressant&#xD;
      effects (Thase et al., 2006). Taking into account that contrary to SSRIs, quetiapine mediated&#xD;
      antidepressant effect does not depend on 5-HTT inhibition, it is possible that genetic&#xD;
      factors which regulate 5-HTT expression may have less influence on the outcome of quetiapine&#xD;
      treatment than on SSRI treatment in depressed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experiment, we proposed to study the efficacy of quetiapine relative to citalopram in&#xD;
      patients with MDD and high risk serotonin transporter gene polymorphism (5-HTTLPR)S/Lg&#xD;
      alleles. Since 5-HTTLPR-S/Lg allele confers vulnerability to depression in the context of&#xD;
      emotional stress (Caspi et al., 2003) and also mediates poor and slower response to SSRI&#xD;
      antidepressants (Serretti et al., 2007), a study of this nature will have significant&#xD;
      treatment implications in depressed patients with high risk for stress induced relapses and&#xD;
      treatment resistance. Given that quetiapine has no affinity for 5-HTT and may normalize the&#xD;
      receptor changes that occur in conditions with low 5-HTT expression (S and Lg carriers and&#xD;
      patients with MDD), we predict that compared to citalopram treatment, quetiapine treatment&#xD;
      will be more effective in reducing amygdala responses to negative stimuli as well as&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in patients with MDD and high risk S/Lg alleles. It is also predicted&#xD;
      that because of its direct action on post synaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, quetiapine&#xD;
      treatment will show early onset of action on amygdala responses than citalopram treatment&#xD;
      especially in patients with S allele.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: There will be a significant decrease in amygdala responses to negative&#xD;
      facial stimuli in depressed patients with S/Lg allele after short term (1 week) and long term&#xD;
      (8 weeks) quetiapine treatment compared to citalopram treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses: The reduction in amygdala responses at week 8 of treatment will&#xD;
      correlate with clinical improvement, and the reduction in amygdala responses at week one of&#xD;
      the treatment may predict the subsequent clinical response at week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effects of short term (1 week) and long term (8 weeks) treatment of quetiapine&#xD;
      150-300 mg and citalopram 10-20 mg on amygdala responses to negative emotional stimuli in&#xD;
      patients with major depression with high risk alleles (S/Lg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an eight-week, parallel-group, randomized, double blind comparative trial with a&#xD;
      repeated measure design in which the patients with major depression will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with either quetiapine 300 mg or citalopram 20mg for an&#xD;
      8-week period. The subjects will undergo imaging during three separate 60-minute sessions: 1)&#xD;
      baseline or week 0, 2) one week after initiation of treatment, and 3) 8 weeks after baseline&#xD;
      or initiation of treatment. Genotyping will be performed in all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      64 Caucasians of both gender with an age range of 20-55 years meeting the criteria of DSM-IV&#xD;
      (American Psychiatric Association 2000) criteria for major depressive disorder according to&#xD;
      the Structured Clinical Interview (First et al.,2000) for DSM-IV Axis 1 disorders will be&#xD;
      recruited from the Calgary Health Region outpatient mental health clinics and through local&#xD;
      newspaper advertisements. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive either quetiapine or citalopram. Thus each treatment arm will have 32 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline, Structured Clinical Interview I and II will be performed to determine the&#xD;
      DSM IV diagnosis of MDD and also to exclude other Axis I psychiatric disorders. Hamilton&#xD;
      rating scale for depression (HRSD) (will be used to assess the severity of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms (Hamilton 1960) and Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAM-A) (Hamilton 1959) will be&#xD;
      used to rate anxiety symptoms. Additionally, temperament and character inventory (TPI)&#xD;
      (Cloninger et al 1994) and childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ) will be administered to&#xD;
      assess and control for the personality traits such as fear and anxiety and child hood abuse&#xD;
      that are known to affect amygdala responses to fearful stimuli&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline assessment and prior to the initiation of treatment, first fMRI session&#xD;
      will be performed. Then quetiapine XR will be initiated at 50mg/day the first 2 days and 150&#xD;
      mg/day on day 3 and titrated to 300mg/day by day 4, and citalopram will be initiated at the&#xD;
      dose of 10 mg /day and titrated to 20 mg/day by day 4. The patients in both treatment arms&#xD;
      will continue this dosage until the completion of the study protocol 8 weeks later. For the&#xD;
      patients who could not tolerate or develop adverse effects, the quetiapine dose will be&#xD;
      reduced to 150 mg/day and citalopram dose will be reduced to 10 mg/day. The patients who&#xD;
      could not tolerate quetipine 150 mg/day and citalopram 10 mg/day will be terminated from the&#xD;
      study.During their participation in the study, patients will undergo a clinical assessment at&#xD;
      week one after the titration of quetiapine and citalopram and a second fMRI session.&#xD;
      Depressive and anxiety symptoms will be rated using HRSD and HAM-A. Then, patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated every two weeks and at the week 8 using HRSD and HAM-A. At week 8, a third fMRI&#xD;
      session will be performed. Adverse effects will be recorded. The patients who could not&#xD;
      tolerate any of the study medications will be terminated from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping of 5-HTTLPR and functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)(A-G) rs 25531 at&#xD;
      the promoter region will be performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by&#xD;
      double restriction endonuclease digestion as reported previously (Wendland et al., 2006) .&#xD;
      High resolution agarose gel will be used to determine four alleles: Sa-469 bp (uncut),&#xD;
      Sg-402+67 bp, La- 512 bp (uncut), and Lg-402+110bp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI will be performed on three occasions: i) at the baseline, ii) 1 week after optimizing&#xD;
      the treatment, iii) 8 weeks after optimization An fMRI block design with presentations of&#xD;
      angry and fearful facial expressions interleaved with a sensorimotor control task will be&#xD;
      used to elicit activations in amygdala. This paradigm of perceptual processing of facial&#xD;
      expressions of negative emotions has been shown to effectively and consistently activate&#xD;
      amygdala in previous studies (Hariri et al., 2002). The paradigm consists of a total of 6&#xD;
      runs and during each run, 3 blocks of emotional task interleaved with 4 blocks of&#xD;
      sensorimotor control task will be presented. During the emotion task, subject will view a&#xD;
      trio of faces and select one of two faces that expresses the same emotion as the target face&#xD;
      in the top. Each emotion block will consist of 6 images, three of each gender, and target&#xD;
      affect (angry and fear). Each facial stimulus will be presented for 5 seconds. The identity&#xD;
      of all three faces will be always different. During the sensorimotor control task, subjects&#xD;
      will view a trio of geometric shapes (circles, vertical and horizontal ellipses) and select&#xD;
      one of two shapes that matches the target shape. Each control block consists of 6 different&#xD;
      images, and each image will presented for 5 seconds. Accuracy and reaction time will be&#xD;
      recorded during all scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first level of analysis will be the generation of fMRI maps of brain activity using FMRIB&#xD;
      Software Library (FSL), a statistical software package specifically designed for fMRI&#xD;
      applications, which uses the general linear model to compute contrast parameter estimates of&#xD;
      explanatory variables (in our case, the explanatory variable is face task vs. sensorimotor&#xD;
      task) for each pixel in the brain images. The result is an estimate of the response magnitude&#xD;
      in a given pixel that surpasses a specified statistical threshold (typically, p = 0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main variable of interest will be the magnitude of activity within the amydala. For each&#xD;
      patient, regions of interest (ROIs) will be drawn manually to encompass the amygdala within&#xD;
      each hemisphere with the aid of each patient's anatomical images. Magnitude of activity with&#xD;
      the ROIs will be recorded. A generalized linear mixed model will be used to analyze group&#xD;
      data with treatment, and time of session (baseline, 1-week, 8-week) as factors into the&#xD;
      analysis. As we expect that the sample size of patients with La/La genotype will be smaller&#xD;
      in each treatment group, the primary analysis will be done only in MDD patients with S/Lg&#xD;
      alleles to prove our hypothesis. To examine the association between changes in amygdala&#xD;
      activity and response in depression severity the change in HAM-D for each patient over 8&#xD;
      weeks will be regressed on the corresponding change in amygdala activity. A similar approach&#xD;
      will be used to correlate 1-week change in activity with 8-week change in depression&#xD;
      severity. The other regions that are functionally or structurally connected with amygdala&#xD;
      such as anterior cingulate region (ACC), dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC),&#xD;
      dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), and precuneus (PCC) will also be selected for&#xD;
      exploratory analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential confounding factors such as age,sex, childhood adversity and personality index&#xD;
      of fear and anxiety, baseline depression and anxiety scores will be controlled between the&#xD;
      groups or will be covaried if there are intergroup differences in these variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      As it is expected that approximately 70% of participants will express the S/Lg allele, the&#xD;
      magnitude of activity within the amygdala is estimated from a meta-analysis by Munafo et al&#xD;
      (2008). to be 0.10 with a standard deviation of 0.11 Assuming a difference in mean change&#xD;
      (baseline to 8 weeks) between groups to be 0.05 with a change standard deviation of 0.07, a&#xD;
      total of 32 patients per group is required to detect this difference with 80% power at a&#xD;
      two-sided 5% level of significance. A 50% difference in mean change is reasonable based upon&#xD;
      the results by Sheline et al (2001).&#xD;
