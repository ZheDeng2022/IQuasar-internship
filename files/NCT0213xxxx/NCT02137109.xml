      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of natalizumab use in the&#xD;
      pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) population.&#xD;

      All available retrospective and prospective data from pediatric MS participants who have&#xD;
      received at least 1 dose of natalizumab before turning 18 years old and before 31Mar2015 will&#xD;
      be used in this study. Prospective data are defined as data to be collected in the future,&#xD;
      i.e., from new participants not included in the first data transfer or additional data from&#xD;
      existing participants that were not included in the first data transfer. Existing biospecimen&#xD;
      samples will be evaluated but not collected as part of this study.&#xD;
