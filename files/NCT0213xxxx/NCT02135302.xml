  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label clinical study to assess the single-dose PK of&#xD;
      eravacycline in subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects conducted at&#xD;
      approximately 3 sites in the United States. This study includes an up to 21-day Screening&#xD;
      Period, a 5-day Treatment Period, and an End of Study Visit occurring approximately 2 weeks&#xD;
      (± 2 days) after initiation of study drug administration. Approximately 24 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled: 18 subjects with impaired hepatic function (6 subjects who meet the criteria for&#xD;
      each of the 3 Child-Pugh categories of mild [5 - 6 points], moderate [7 - 9 points], and&#xD;
      severe [10 - 15 points]) and 6 healthy subjects without hepatic impairment. Healthy subjects&#xD;
      will be matched to hepatically impaired subjects in gender, age, and body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
      All subjects will be administered a single IV dose of eravacycline (1.5 mg/kg).&#xD;

    <description>Eravacycline (TP-434) is a parenteral and oral antibiotic of the tetracycline class that is highly active in vitro and in established animal infection models against both nosocomial and community-acquired methicillin-susceptible or -resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, vancomycin-susceptible or -resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-susceptible or -resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, eravacycline is highly active against clinically important species of Enterobacteriaceae (including those isolates that produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases and/or are carbapenem-resistant), Acinetobacter baumannii, and anaerobes.</description>
