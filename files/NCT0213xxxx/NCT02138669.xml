    <textblock>
      The US food and Drug Administration (FDA) originally approved INTACS prescription inserts in&#xD;
      April 1999 for the correction of low levels of nearsightedness (-1.00 to -3.00 diopters).&#xD;
      Additional clinical data have shown that INTACS are safe for the treatment of keratoconus, in&#xD;
      July 2004, FDA approved INTACS inserts for the treatment of keratoconus as a Humanitarian Use&#xD;
      Device (FDA approval letter attached). The statute and the implementing regulation of FDA (21&#xD;
      CFR 814.124 (aj) require IRB review and approval before a HUD is used.INTACS prescription&#xD;
      inserts are composed of two clear segments, each having an arc length of 150°, they are&#xD;
      manufactured form a biomedical material called polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and are&#xD;
      available in three thicknesses. Two INTACS inserts ranging from 0.250mm to 0.350mm may be&#xD;
      implanted depending on the orientation of the cone and the amount of myopia and astigmatism&#xD;
      to be reduced.&#xD;

      The INTACS procedure is typically performed in an outpatient setting. The two tiny INTACS&#xD;
      inserts are surgically placed into the periphery of the cornea through a tiny cut that is&#xD;
      made on the cornea after numbing drops have been applied. A specially designed instrument&#xD;
      creates a tunnel by separating the tissue layers in the outside periphery of the cornea, the&#xD;
      INTACS inserts are placed into this tunnel where they remain. One or two ophthalmic sutures&#xD;
      will be placed to close the incision. A postoperative care information booklet will be given&#xD;
      to the patients; patients will be followed by means of postoperative appointments for up to&#xD;
      12 months after the surgery. The visits/testing schedules are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-OR visit (1.5 hours): Visual Acuity (VA), Refraction, Topography, Keratometry, Glare&#xD;
      Test. Mesopic Pupil Size, Pachymetry, Tonometry, Slit Lamp Exam and Contrast Sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery (30min): At Laser Center for Vision Care which is part of Aston and department of&#xD;
      Ophthalmology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-OR Day 1(10min): VA, Slit Lamp Exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-OR 1week (20min): Visual Acuity, Refraction, Topography, Tonometry, Slit Lamp Exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-OR 1 month (20minj: Visual Acuity, Refraction, Topography, Tonometry, Slit Lamp Exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-OR 3 month (1.5 hours): Some as pre-op Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-OR 6 month (20min): Visual Acuity, Refraction, Topography, Tonometry, Slit Lamp Exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-OR 12 month (1.5 hours): Same as pre-op.&#xD;
