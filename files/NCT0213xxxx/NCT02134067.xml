  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of TAS-119 and determine the most&#xD;
      appropriate dose in combination with Paclitaxel for subsequent studies in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAS-119 is a novel, selective Aurora A kinase inhibitor, which has previously been&#xD;
      demonstrated to enhance the activity of paclitaxel in preclinical studies&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Background and rationale for study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In nonclinical pharmacology studies TAS-119 significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of&#xD;
      the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel and TAS-119 is being developed for use in combination&#xD;
      with paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAS-119 selectively inhibits the kinase inhibitor Aurora A. AurA regulates cell division by&#xD;
      controlling the transition from G2 to M phase. Overexpression of AurA is associated with&#xD;
      resistance to taxanes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two sequential phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation Phase with the purpose to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose of TAS-119 given in combination with paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Expansion Phase in which additional patients will be enrolled to further evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and preliminary efficacy of the recommended Phase 2 dose of TAS-119 in combination&#xD;
      with paclitaxel, during which a subgroup of patients will be evaluated for DDI between&#xD;
      paclitaxel and TAS-119 via PK assessment.&#xD;
