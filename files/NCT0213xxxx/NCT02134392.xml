  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      C-diff infection often causes belly pain and diarrhea and can be very hard to treat with&#xD;
      medicine. One of the possible reasons that C-diff infection is hard to treat is because there&#xD;
      is too much &quot;bad&quot; bacteria in the colon. Investigators believe that putting more &quot;good&quot;&#xD;
      bacteria into the colon will help fight the &quot;bad&quot; bacteria. We do this by doing a fecal&#xD;
      (poop) transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal transplant has been done at other hospitals, but not at Nationwide Children's Hospital.&#xD;
      Since our Investigators have not done this before, this study will help us learn the best way&#xD;
      to do the transplant. Investigators also believe this transplant might help improve symptoms&#xD;
      for patients with C-diff.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Visit 1 - screening visit: This visit will take about 1 hour. The study doctor will talk to&#xD;
      the patient about C-diff infection and fecal transplant in detail. Investigators will ask you&#xD;
      questions about your medical history and health. A complete physical examination will be&#xD;
      done. Investigators will order a pregnancy test (for girls who are old enough to become&#xD;
      pregnant) and take blood (about 1.5 teaspoons) to make sure you do not have any other illness&#xD;
      or infections (other than C-diff.) If the pregnancy test comes back positive on a patient who&#xD;
      is younger than age 18, both the patient and parent(s) will be informed. The study doctor&#xD;
      will then choose a possible stool donor. The study doctor will ask the donor to fill out a&#xD;
      questionnaire about their medical history, past and present diseases, allergies and&#xD;
      medications. If this donor seems suitable, blood and stool tests will be performed on the&#xD;
      donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the next visit: Before the fecal transplant is scheduled the study doctor will look at&#xD;
      your all of the lab results from you and the donor to make sure it is safe for the fecal&#xD;
      transplant to take place. This will take up to two weeks. If the donor is not a suitable&#xD;
      donor, another donor will be chosen. Every possible donor will need to sign a consent form&#xD;
      and fill out questionnaires. When a suitable donor is found, we will to schedule the fecal&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two ways in which the fecal transplant can be given. One is by enema and the other&#xD;
      is during a colonoscopy. The study doctor believes that the best way to give the transplant&#xD;
      is during a colonoscopy. If you needs to have a colonoscopy done for clinical purposes (in&#xD;
      the routine medical care of your C-diff infection), the fecal transplant will happen during&#xD;
      that procedure. The doctor will explain the colonoscopy to you in detail and will be given&#xD;
      special instructions on how to prepare for the colonoscopy. You will need to sign a separate&#xD;
      consent for the colonoscopy. The other way the fecal transplant can be given is by enema. If&#xD;
      you are not having a colonoscopy or for some other reason the doctor believes it is better to&#xD;
      do so, you will receive the transplant through an enema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor will talk with you about stopping medicines that are not allowed during the&#xD;
      study. If you are taking antibiotics (such as metronidazole, vancomycin, or rifaximin,&#xD;
      nitazoxanide, and fidaxomicin) as a treatment for C-diff, you will be asked to stop these&#xD;
      medicines 2 days before the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - the day of the fecal transplant: This visit will take about 4-6 hours. A pregnancy&#xD;
      test will be repeated. If the pregnancy test comes back positive for a patient who is younger&#xD;
      than age, both the patient and parent will be informed. The study doctor will ask you and the&#xD;
      donor how they are feeling. If either the patient or the donor is not feeling well, the&#xD;
      transplant will be reschedule to another day. If both are well, the fecal transplant will&#xD;
      proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of the transplant the donor will be asked to have a bowel movement in a&#xD;
      plastic container. The donor will bring this stool sample to the hospital to be processed.&#xD;
      This stool sample will be blended into a liquid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FMT can be given by either a colonoscopy or enema. The doctor will talk to you about&#xD;
      which method will be best for you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant by colonoscopy: Before the colonoscopy, the study doctor will ask questions about&#xD;
      your symptoms and medications. During the colonoscopy, the doctor will squirt one cupful (250&#xD;
      ml) of liquid into the colon using a special colonoscopy tube. The liquid will be made of&#xD;
      saline (salt water) and donor stool. The recovery time from the colonoscopy will be the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant by enema: The study doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and&#xD;
      medications. The patient's pants and underwear will be removed. A thin slippery tube will be&#xD;
      put into the patient's bottom (rectum). The tube will be pushed in as deep as we can without&#xD;
      pushing the tube hard. About 1 cupful of liquid will be gently squeezed into the rectum. The&#xD;
      liquid will be made of saline (salt water) and donor stool. We will ask the patient to lie&#xD;
      down on their left side for 30 minutes and keep the solution in for at least 45 minutes. The&#xD;
      patient will then be sent home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the transplant: The patient will be called at days 1, 7, 14 and months 1 and 6 to see&#xD;
      how they are feeling. The investigator's staff will ask some questions over the phone. The&#xD;
      phone call will take about 10 minutes. The patient may also call the study doctor anytime&#xD;
      with questions or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If belly pain or diarrhea continues one month after the transplant, the study doctor will&#xD;
      want to repeat a stool test for C-diff. Sometimes the patient is not cured and a second&#xD;
      transplant is needed. If a second transplant is needed, the same donor can be used if he/she&#xD;
      is willing. The second transplant will be done by enema. The donor would have lab (blood and&#xD;
      stool tests) done again to be sure she/he does not have any new infections or illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The donor may need to have the lab work done again if the transplant does not happen as&#xD;
      scheduled (cancellation, no-show or illness). HIV testing is one of the things we do on&#xD;
      potential donors. The HIV testing must be done no more than 14 days before the transplant.&#xD;
      The other required lab tests need to be done no more than 30 days before the transplant. The&#xD;
      date the transplant is rescheduled to will determine whether or not these tests need to be&#xD;
      done again.&#xD;
