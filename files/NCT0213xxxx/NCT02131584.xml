  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ruxolitinib phosphate works in reducing fatigue in&#xD;
      patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking a protein called Janus kinase (JAK) that is needed for cell growth&#xD;
      and may also help control fatigue, decrease the size of lymph nodes and/or lower the number&#xD;
      of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in the blood.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the reduction in fatigue as measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) of&#xD;
      patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who do not require anti-neoplastic therapy&#xD;
      according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the reduction in other symptoms using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory&#xD;
      (MDASI) and to assess disease burden and response by the IWCLL 2008 response criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) (approximately 12 hours&#xD;
      apart) for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
