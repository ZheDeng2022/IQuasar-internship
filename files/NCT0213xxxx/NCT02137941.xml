  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic stress at work is a public health problem increasing morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      especially in men. Among the men military populations, the firefighters of Paris (FFPs) are&#xD;
      particularly exposed. To deal with this stress and to improve stress management is&#xD;
      challenging. Psychological fitness is required to regulate emotions which improve&#xD;
      effectiveness under stress and enhance recovery from stressful events. The heart coherence&#xD;
      (HC) program uses feedback from a simple pulse sensor to reflect changes of the&#xD;
      emotional/psychological state, and to learn how to reduce stress and stabilize emotions.&#xD;
      Another kind of psychological fitness focuses on cognitive training to regulate emotions,&#xD;
      with the use of techniques to optimize potential (TOP). The TOP consists of learning easy&#xD;
      techniques in mental skills to improve cognitive-based problem-solving using respiration,&#xD;
      relaxation, and visualization. Although never published in a peer-review journal, the&#xD;
      procedure of TOP training is structured and standardized for individuals and groups, and is&#xD;
      widely practiced in air traffic controllers, with apparently good effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, any event can be emotionally ambiguous, providing both negative and positive&#xD;
      outcomes. The interpretation of such ambiguity is linked with an individual's emotional&#xD;
      state, such as anxiety or mood. Individuals with a high level of trait anxiety are likely to&#xD;
      interpret an event negatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no studies have compared the effect of HC or TOP in the perceived stress of FFPs.&#xD;
      Nor have long-term effects of these stress management programs (SMP) been investigated.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the influence of trait anxiety on stress levels in FFPs needs to be clarified.&#xD;
      Finally, no trials have assessed levels of biomarkers stress following these SMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From these observations, we hypothesized that 1) young recruits aiming to become FFPs will be&#xD;
      particularly exposed to stress, 2) SMP will be effective in reducing perceived stress, 3) SMP&#xD;
      will mainly benefit FFPs who have high anxiety, and 4) the effects of SMP will lower levels&#xD;
      of biomarkers of stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized control trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of stress&#xD;
      management programs on perceived stress (primary outcome variable), and on negative mood,&#xD;
      mindfulness, and biomarkers of stress (secondary outcome variables) in FFPs. We also aim to&#xD;
      investigate the influence of anxiety on the stress management programs effectiveness&#xD;
      long-term.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The army's FFPs unit recruits new FFPs each month who received a twelve-month contract&#xD;
      comprising of a six-month induction program (1st month to 6th month) and a six-month active&#xD;
      duty period (6th month to 12th month). Within our study, volunteers will be included at the&#xD;
      4th month (baseline measurements after the first four months of training), in order to avoid&#xD;
      the high drop-out rate that occurs during the beginning of this period. Included participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned (computer-generated randomization) to one of the three following&#xD;
      groups: TOP, HC, or control, and the stress managements programs will occur during the last&#xD;
      two months of induction program (4th month to 6th month). The two stress managements programs&#xD;
      will be taught by an experimented psychologist, with daily requirements of short practice&#xD;
      tasks. All three groups will receive a pharmaceutical placebo in order to control any placebo&#xD;
      effect. The placebo will comprise of starch concealed in a capsule, and was required to be&#xD;
      consumed between the 4th month and the 6th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be perceived stress. Secondary outcomes will be changes in mood,&#xD;
      mindfulness and biomarkers of stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All baseline assessments (4th month) will be repeated three times: at the end of the stress&#xD;
      managements programs (6th month), at the end of the six-month active duty period (12th month)&#xD;
      and at the 18th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment will set to end when 180 FFPs (60 per group) will be included. We estimated that&#xD;
      with 55 participants in each group, the study would have more than 80% power to detect a&#xD;
      clinically important difference among the groups in the change of perceived stress, at an&#xD;
      alpha level of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gaussian distribution of the data wil be tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data will be&#xD;
      presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Comparisons between groups will be made with&#xD;
      Wilcoxon matched-pairs test or ANOVA when appropriate. Relationships between data will be&#xD;
      assessed by Pearson correlation, a Principal Components Analysis or a multivariable&#xD;
      generalized estimating equations model when appropriate. Significance will be accepted at the&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05 level. Statistical procedures will be performed using SPSS Advanced Statistics&#xD;
      software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).&#xD;

    <description>The heart coherence (HC) is based on the fact that the heart rhythm becomes more erratic with negative emotions such as anger and anxiety, and more ordered/coherent with sustained positive emotions such as appreciation, love, or compassion, leading to optimal performance and well-being. The HC program uses feedback from a simple pulse sensor to reflect changes of the emotional/psychological state, and to learn how to reduce stress and stabilize emotions.</description>
