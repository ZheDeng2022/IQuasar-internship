    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well thyroid gland removal with or without central lymph node&#xD;
      dissection works in treating patients with thyroid cancer or suspected thyroid cancer that&#xD;
      has not spread to the lymph nodes (randomized into Arms I and II). Arms I and II are compared&#xD;
      to a standard of care (SOC) Arm III to enable comparison of quality of life among various&#xD;
      surgical treatments. Currently, the standard treatment for thyroid cancer is total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy, or complete removal of the thyroid. The lymph nodes in the central part of the&#xD;
      neck may also be surgically removed, called central lymph node dissection. Prophylactic&#xD;
      removal of the lymph nodes may increase the risk of life-threatening complications, and may&#xD;
      reduce post-surgery quality of life. It may also prevent the cancer from returning and reduce&#xD;
      the need for additional surgery. It is not yet known whether recurrence rates and&#xD;
      complication levels are lower after thyroid gland removal alone or with central lymph node&#xD;
      dissection.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of transient and permanent hypocalcemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of voice and swallowing problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the degree to which quality of life (QOL) is compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the degree to which accurate quality of life measures can be extracted from&#xD;
      patient interview narratives using natural language processing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine clinical recurrence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms, if ineligible into a SOC arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients undergo total thyroidectomy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients undergo total thyroidectomy with ipsilateral prophylactic central neck&#xD;
      dissection (CND).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm III: Patients ineligible to be randomized into Arm I or II, Standard of Care (SOC)&#xD;
      comparator receiving same follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 1, 2 and 6 weeks, and 6&#xD;
      and 12 months.&#xD;

        <title>Rate of Transient and Permanent Hypocalcemia</title>
        <description>The rate of transient and permanent hypocalcemia will be determined by assessing the following:&#xD;

Hypocalcemia symptoms in first 2 weeks (average episodes/day) IV. Hypocalcemia symptom severity scale (range 1-5) V. Requirement for calcium and calcitriol at Month 6 (or, if laboratory values at visit reveal calcium &lt; 8 mg/dL and PTH &lt; 15 pg/ml&#xD;
