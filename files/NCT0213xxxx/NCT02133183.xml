    <textblock>
      This partially randomized pilot phase I trial studies how much sapanisertib reaches the brain&#xD;
      tumor and how well it works when given before and after surgery in treating patients with&#xD;
      glioblastoma that has grown or come back and requires surgery. Sapanisertib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the penetration of sapanisertib (MLN0128 [TAK-228]) across the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier and achieve a concentration of 70 nM in tissue resected from a contrast enhancing&#xD;
      region of the tumor in 60% of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients. (Part I) II. To&#xD;
      determine the ability of MLN0128 (TAK-228) to inhibit TOR complex (TORC)1/2 in the enhancing&#xD;
      components of the tumor as determined by modulation of RPS6 phosphorylated Ser-235 (pS235) in&#xD;
      reverse phase protein array (RPPA) assays. (Part II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the penetration of MLN0128 (TAK-228) across the blood brain barrier by&#xD;
      determining its concentration in tissue resected from a non-contrast enhancing region of the&#xD;
      tumor. (Part I) II. To assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent GBM. (Part I) III. To determine the ability of MLN0128 (TAK-228) to inhibit&#xD;
      TORC1/2 in the non-enhancing components of the tumor as determined by modulation of RPS6&#xD;
      pS235 in RPPA assays. (Part II) IV. To assess the ability of MLN0128 (TAK-228) to inhibit&#xD;
      TORC1/2 by evaluating pharmacodynamics (PD) markers by immunohistochemistry such as pS235,&#xD;
      pS236, phosphorylated 4E-binding protein (p4EBP), phosphorylated-mechanistic target of&#xD;
      rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase) (pmTOR), and AKTpSer473. (Phase II) V. To evaluate the&#xD;
      safety profile of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in pre-operative patients with recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To estimate response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to qualitatively assess the ability of MLN0128&#xD;
      (TAK-228) to penetrate the blood brain barrier and enter tumor tissue in enhancing and&#xD;
      non-enhancing regions of the tumor. (Part I) II. To determine ex-vivo sensitivity of tumor&#xD;
      neurosphere cultures (patient derived cell lines [PDCL]) established from surgical specimens&#xD;
      to MLN0128 (TAK-228). (Part II) III. To explore the potential association of tumor genotype&#xD;
      with progression-free survival among patients treated with MLN0128 (TAK-228). (Part II) IV.&#xD;
      To determine the ability of MLN0128 (TAK-228) to inhibit TORC1/2 as determined by modulation&#xD;
      of additional TORC1/2 markers in RPPA assays. (Part II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7-9 days (including&#xD;
      2-4 hours before surgery). On day 0, patients undergo surgery. Within 45 days after surgery,&#xD;
      patients receive sapanisertib PO QD. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. If patients do not demonstrate adequate sapanisertib&#xD;
      tumor tissue concentrations, patients are enrolled in Cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients receive sapanisertib PO 2-4 hours before surgery on day 0. Within 45 days&#xD;
      after surgery, patients receive sapanisertib PO once weekly. Courses repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive sapanisertib PO according to the results from Part I. Patients also&#xD;
      undergo surgery on day 0. Within 30 days after surgery, patients receive sapanisertib PO&#xD;
      according to the results from Part I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo surgery on day 0. Within 30 days after surgery, patients receive&#xD;
      sapanisertib PO according to the results from Part I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 2 months for&#xD;
      2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
