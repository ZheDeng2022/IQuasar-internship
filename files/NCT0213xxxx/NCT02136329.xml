      The objectives of the study are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of Sildenafil in cardiac surgery patients at&#xD;
           risk of acute kidney injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of Sildenafil in cardiac surgery patients at&#xD;
           risk of acute kidney injury&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury occurs in up to one third of all patients following cardiac surgery. It&#xD;
      is manifested by an acute decline in kidney function and results in significant increases in&#xD;
      postoperative complications as well as an almost fourfold increase in the risk of&#xD;
      postoperative death. Our understanding of the underlying processes is poor and recent&#xD;
      systematic reviews have concluded that there is no effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental studies have demonstrated that preservation of endogenous Nitric Oxide (NO)&#xD;
      bioavailability is reno-protective in response to a variety of injurious stimuli. Endogenous&#xD;
      NO activity is increased by administration of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor&#xD;
      sildenafil citrate. This is used clinically in the treatment of erectile dysfunction&#xD;
      (Viagra®, Pfizer) and more recently, pulmonary hypertension and acute right ventricular&#xD;
      failure (Revatio®, Pfizer). We have developed a preclinical swine model of extracorporeal&#xD;
      circulation (cardiopulmonary bypass) mediated acute kidney injury that shows significant&#xD;
      homology to that which occurs in post cardiac surgery patients. Administration of intravenous&#xD;
      sildenafil prevents acute kidney injury in this model in association with an increase in NO&#xD;
      bioavailability. There is a recognized clinical need for developing prevention and treatment&#xD;
      strategies for AKI and results obtained in this preclinical study indicate that Sildenafil is&#xD;
      suitable for further development as a potential prevention strategy for post cardiac surgery&#xD;
      AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to conducting a safety and efficacy trial however we intend to first establish a dose&#xD;
      of Sildenafil that is tolerated by cardiac surgery patients and compare the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of this dose to the effective dose identified in our preclinical work. We therefore propose&#xD;
      to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety and tolerability of sildenafil in 36 patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery, in an open label, dose escalation Phase I study. This study will&#xD;
      inform the design of a subsequent randomized Phase IIb trial that will determine efficacy and&#xD;
      safety&#xD;

    <description>The active study drug, Revatio®, is the citrate salt of sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE5). Sildenafil citrate is designated chemically as 1-[[3-(6,7-dihydro-1-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-1H-pyrazolo [4,3-d] pyrimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl] sulfonyl]-4-methylpiperazine citrate.&#xD;
The active study medication is supplied in single use glass vials and as a clear, colourless, sterile, ready-to-use solution containing 10 mg (12.5 mL) of sildenafil. Each mL of solution contains 1.124 mg sildenafil citrate, 50.5 mg dextrose and water for injection.&#xD;
Sildenafil is manufactured under Good Manufacturing Practice (EU-GMP) by Pfizer Inc</description>
