      Preserving kidney function during removal of a kidney tumor is becoming increasingly&#xD;
      important as rates of chronic kidney disease increase. A novel modifiable factor (suture&#xD;
      closure of the defect caused by tumor removal) was discovered on retrospective studies to&#xD;
      account for nearly two-thirds of the 15% volume loss commonly seen in operated kidneys. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that a randomized controlled surgical trial will show that omitting the suture&#xD;
      closure both preserves renal function and will not lead to unreasonable postoperative&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

      Purpose: To evaluate a never before studied modifiable factor affecting renal function after&#xD;
      partial nephrectomy: the suture closure of the renal cortex after tumor removal&#xD;
      (renorrhaphy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing interest in preserving renal function when removing renal tumors. This is&#xD;
      partly due to studies that link chronic kidney disease with cardiovascular events and overall&#xD;
      survival. There is an approximate loss of 10% overall renal function after partial&#xD;
      nephrectomy along with a loss of 15% of the volume in the operated kidney. Studies point to 3&#xD;
      factors leading to this loss in renal function after partial nephrectomy: 1) Poor&#xD;
      preoperative renal function, 2) Ischemia time (clamping the renal blood vessels to decrease&#xD;
      bleeding during surgery, and 3) Loss in renal volume from the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only factor that is considered modifiable is ischemia time, especially when over&#xD;
      20-25-minutes in duration. Modern techniques now aid in keeping the ischemia time below the&#xD;
      25-minute cutoff. Leading experts from institutions such as the Cleveland Clinic, The&#xD;
      University of Southern California, and The Mayo Clinic have concluded that the most important&#xD;
      factor in preserving renal function, renal volume loss, is not modifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: Our question is: if we are removing non-functional tissue (tumor) then why is&#xD;
      there a loss in renal volume (15%) and function (10%)? We hypothesize that by omitting one&#xD;
      particular step during surgery, sewing closed the defect caused by tumor removal, we will be&#xD;
      able to improve renal volume loss and function (RENORRHAPHY CLIP&#xD;
      http://youtu.be/NXOtUHdigj4). Indiana University is in a unique position to study this&#xD;
      hypothesis as two of our surgeons have routinely omitted closing the defect left after tumor&#xD;
      removal (NO RENORRHAPHY CLIP http://youtu.be/ZisMjrm85s8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently accepted abstract, we discovered that omitting the cortical closure (n=28)&#xD;
      resulted in a 0.8% loss in glomerular filtration rate while using the closure resulted in a&#xD;
      7.3% loss (p=0.03). Following this discovery a 3D modeling project was performed to isolate&#xD;
      the volume loss in operated kidneys using pre- and postoperative CT scans (not yet&#xD;
      published). In this study, we discovered a 15% volume loss with cortical closure (n=38)&#xD;
      compared to only a 5% loss without closure (n=20, p &lt; 0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias and confounders cannot completely be removed from our retrospective data making it hard&#xD;
      to believe that others will consider our hypothesis without a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT). We propose a RCT for robotic partial nephrectomy (20 stitch closure vs. 20 no stitch&#xD;
      closure) with the primary outcome being volume change in the affected kidney.&#xD;
