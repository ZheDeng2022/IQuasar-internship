      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of LDE225 that&#xD;
      can be given in combination with everolimus to patients with esophageal or GEJ cancer. The&#xD;
      safety of the drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be&#xD;
      assigned to a combination dose level of the study drugs based on when participant joins this&#xD;
      study. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose level of LDE225. Each new group will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. All&#xD;
      participants will receive the same dose level of everolimus. This will continue until the&#xD;
      highest tolerable combination dose of LDE225 and everolimus is found. Up to 24 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose of the combination of LDE225 and everolimus is found, up to&#xD;
      18 participants will receive the combination dose level that was found to be well tolerated&#xD;
      in the earlier part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will take up to 4 capsules or tablets of LDE225 by mouth 1 time every day.&#xD;
      Participant's doctor will tell participant how many capsules/tablets participant will need to&#xD;
      take. Participant should take the study drug each time with a glass of water (about 8 ounces&#xD;
      total) at the same time every day. Participant should swallow the study drug whole, one&#xD;
      capsule/tablet every 2 minutes, without chewing or opening the study drug. Participant should&#xD;
      eat a light breakfast (such as toast and jam) at least 2 hours before taking the study drug,&#xD;
      then participant should not eat or drink anything for at least 1 hour after the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will take up to 2 tablets of everolimus by mouth 1 time every day with the LDE225&#xD;
      capsules without food. Participant will take the tablets each time with a glass of water at&#xD;
      the same time every day. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed or crushed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant cannot swallow the everolimus tablets, the tablets should be dissolved in&#xD;
      water just before taking them. Add about 2 tablespoons of water into a glass. The tablets&#xD;
      should then be added and stirred gently until the tablets are dissolved. This mixture should&#xD;
      then be drunk. Afterwards, the glass should be rinsed with an additional 2 tablespoons of&#xD;
      water and drunk. Participant's doctor will discuss this with participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant vomits after taking participant's dose of study drugs, participant should not&#xD;
      take another dose that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is very important that participant takes the study drugs given to participant just as the&#xD;
      study doctor tells participant and that participant does not miss any dose. If participant&#xD;
      forgets to take a dose of LDE225, participant should take it as soon as participant remembers&#xD;
      (within 6 hours of the missed dose). If more than 6 hours have passed, participant should&#xD;
      skip that dose and take participant's next dose the next day as planned. If participant&#xD;
      forgets to take a dose of everolimus, participant should skip that dose and take&#xD;
      participant's next dose the next day as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant has a study visit that day, participant should take participant's dose of&#xD;
      study drugs at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will need to store LDE225 in participant's refrigerator at all times. Everolimus&#xD;
      can be stored at room temperature. Participant should not share participant's supply of&#xD;
      LDE225 and everolimus with anyone. Participant will keep a study drug diary to help&#xD;
      participant keep track of participant's study drug doses. If participant misses or delays a&#xD;
      dose, participant should write it down in the diary. Participant should bring the diary to&#xD;
      every study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each cycle and when participant stops taking part in the study, participant&#xD;
      will return any leftover study drugs to the study nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of every cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected&#xD;
           for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week during Cycle 1 only, the study staff will call and ask participant how participant&#xD;
      is doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every 2 cycles after that, participant will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and every 2 cycles after that, participant will have a CT scan or MRI of&#xD;
      the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, extra blood may be drawn to follow up on any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if&#xD;
      the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to&#xD;
      follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 14 days after participant's last dose of study drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check the cholesterol&#xD;
           levels in participant's blood, and to check how well participant's blood clots.&#xD;
           Participant will need to fast for at least 8 hours before this blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a CT scan or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease, if the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected&#xD;
           for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 30 days after the end-of-study visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected&#xD;
           for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 3 months after the follow-up visit, participant will be contacted by the study staff by&#xD;
      telephone and/or seen in the clinic. Participant will be asked about any drugs participant&#xD;
      may be taking and about participant's general health. If participant is called, the call will&#xD;
      take about 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. LDE225 is not FDA approved or commercially available.&#xD;
      Everolimus is FDA approved and commercially available to treat kidney, breast, and pancreatic&#xD;
      cancers. The combination of LDE225 and everolimus to treat esophageal or GEJ cancer is&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 42 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered&#xD;
             potentially unreliable or will not be able to complete the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable&#xD;
             of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective methods of contraception during the&#xD;
             study and 6 months after. Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected,&#xD;
             implanted) are not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the study drug decreases the&#xD;
             effectiveness of hormonal contraception. Highly effective contraception methods&#xD;
             include combination of any two of the following: a) Placement of a non-hormonal&#xD;
             intrauterine device (IUD) or non-hormonal intrauterine system (IUS); b) Barrier&#xD;
             methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps)&#xD;
             with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository; c. Total abstinence (When&#xD;
             this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.);&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. (Continued from # 7): or d) Male/female sterilization. (Sterilization: Patient has had&#xD;
             surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at&#xD;
             least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only&#xD;
             when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone&#xD;
             level assessment. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy&#xD;
             documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study patients,&#xD;
             the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. (Continued from # 8): Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an&#xD;
             appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or&#xD;
             have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal&#xD;
             ligation at least six weeks prior to randomization. In the case of oophorectomy alone,&#xD;
             only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone&#xD;
             level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Male patients whose sexual partner(s) are WOCBP who are not willing to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception, during the study and for 6 months after the end of treatment (Male&#xD;
             patients must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception (e.g.,&#xD;
             spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and continuing&#xD;
             using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months following the&#xD;
             study drug. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as well as during&#xD;
             intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the study treatment&#xD;
             via seminal fluid.).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to LDE 225 or Everolimus in the study or other rapamycin analogs (e.g.&#xD;
             sirolimus, temsirolimus).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who are receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate and strong&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have&#xD;
             narrow therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment&#xD;
             with LDE225. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at&#xD;
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting&#xD;

             within 3 months; c) QTcF greater than 450 msec for males and greater than 470 msec for&#xD;
             females on the screening electrocardiogram (ECG); d) A past medical history of&#xD;
             clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history of prolonged QT-interval&#xD;
             syndrome; e) Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g. congestive heart&#xD;
