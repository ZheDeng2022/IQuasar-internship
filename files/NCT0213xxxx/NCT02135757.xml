  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV multicenter trial to evaluate real-world health outcomes, economic impact&#xD;
      and resistance mechanisms of panitumumab in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address two anticipated issues surrounding personalized medicine and&#xD;
      treatment with panitumumab. First, it will enable to assess the economic impact of&#xD;
      panitumumab in a real-life setting (HEOR study). Second, it will identify new blood-based&#xD;
      mechanisms of resistance, which may lead to new avenues for combination therapy in metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (Blood study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to collect information on quality of life and health care resource&#xD;
      utilization by patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      are to confirm survival data, to assess the quality of life of patients and to assess the&#xD;
      health care resource utilization of patients. The blood biomarker study objective is to&#xD;
      determine blood-based biomarkers of response or resistance to panitumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a mutated KRAS gene will be treated with standard-of-care (SOC) and will&#xD;
      participate to the HEOR study only. Patients with a non-mutated (wild type) KRAS gene will be&#xD;
      treated with panitumumab and will participate to the HEOR study and to the blood biomarker&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, data will be collected on quality of life and work&#xD;
      productivity. Patients will be asked to fill a set of questionnaires at their recruitment in&#xD;
      the study and at every 3 months after treatment initiation. For patients participating to the&#xD;
      blood study (patients with a wild type KRAS), blood samples will be collected before patients&#xD;
      start their treatment, at every treatment and when they discontinue their treatment.&#xD;
