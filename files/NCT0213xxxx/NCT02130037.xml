      Background: research show that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective inreducing&#xD;
      bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder's (BED) symptoms. Today, with the development&#xD;
      of technology there are efforts being made for developinga treatment to these eating&#xD;
      disorders threw the media, most of these attempts are based on the CBT method. The size of&#xD;
      the effect that CBT given threw the internet has on BN and BED is still not entirely clear.&#xD;
      Research presented today are mostly based on treatments that were given threw email or&#xD;
      Skypeor an automatic self- help stage program. These researches show heterogenic results&#xD;
      about the effect it had on eating disorders. In this research we aim to investigate the&#xD;
      effect size that a CBT treatment threw a smartphone application that combines a clinician&#xD;
      online reply and an automatic feedback in addition to astandard ones a week clinic treatment&#xD;
      has on BN and BED symptoms frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Our aim is to make a research using an application that treats that offers an&#xD;
      automatic and human therapist and dietitian reply threw a similar application that is suited&#xD;
      for them. A selected 40 BN or sub-threshold BN or BED patients, men and women ages 18-60&#xD;
      ,that will turn to the &quot;Sheba eating disorder medical center&quot; will include the research. Half&#xD;
      of the participants will receive aCBT treatment threw a smartphone application along with&#xD;
      astandardclinical treatment that includes ones a week session with a therapist and ones a&#xD;
      week session with a dietitian and the other half will receive a standardclinic treatment&#xD;
      alone. We will test the eating disorder symptoms using eating disorders questionnaires at the&#xD;
      starting point, at the end of a six months treatment and six months after finishing the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: This research will allow testing the need and benefit that a personal and direct&#xD;
      patient- therapist connection has over a standardones a week meeting connection format. In&#xD;
      addition, treating with a web application in the future might have a benefit of saving time&#xD;
      spent on getting to the clinic, will allow to shorten the time of the session in the clinic&#xD;
      and will save cost of the face to face treatment.&#xD;
