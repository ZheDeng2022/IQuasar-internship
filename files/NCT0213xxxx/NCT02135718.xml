  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, stratified, and randomized, open-label, placebo study in subjects with&#xD;
      asthma to compare inhalers, ELLIPTA a new dry powder inhaler (DPI) and metered dose inhalers&#xD;
      (MDI). This study is conducted to evaluate subject's preference of several inhaler-specific&#xD;
      attributes individually between an existing MDI and the ELLIPTA a dry powder inhaler.&#xD;
      Subjects who have not used the ELLIPTA inhaler in the past 6 months and their asthma must be&#xD;
      controlled on their current therapy were enrolled. Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be stratified according to their current inhaler use (stable for the past 3 months): 1.)&#xD;
      Currently using a DPI as an inhaled asthma controller therapy OR 2.) Currently using an MDI&#xD;
      as an inhaled asthma controller therapy (No fluticasone MDI use in the last 3 months) OR 3.)&#xD;
      Currently using no inhaled asthma controller therapy (this includes patients using a LTM&#xD;
      and/or SABA only). Once stratified, eligible subjects were randomized (1:1) to one of two&#xD;
      sequences for using the inhaler: ELLIPTA inhaler once daily in Period 1 followed by MDI twice&#xD;
      daily in Period 2 or MDI twice daily in Period 1 followed by ELLIPTA inhaler once daily in&#xD;
      Period 2 for for 5-9 days each. In addition, subjects will be randomly assigned (1:1&#xD;
      allocation) to receive one of two sets of questions: Version 1 presents response options in&#xD;
      the order of ELLIPTA inhaler, MDI, No preference; Version 2 presents response options in the&#xD;
      order of MDI, ELLIPTA inhaler, No preference. At the end of the second trial period, subjects&#xD;
      answered questions which assessed their preference of inhaler attributes. ELLIPTA is a&#xD;
      registered trademark of the GSK group of companies.&#xD;
