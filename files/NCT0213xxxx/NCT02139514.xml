      The purpose of this study is to predict and explain on the basis of brain function and&#xD;
      structure the behavioral and brain effects of an evidence-based intervention for adults with&#xD;
      high-functioning autism, Virtual Reality-Social Cognition Training (Kandalaft et al., 2012;&#xD;
      Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders). Adults with autism will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive either (a) two hours per week of intervention services for five weeks, or (b) a&#xD;
      treatment as usual control. The intervention will focus on enhancing social skills, social&#xD;
      cognition, and social functioning. Outcome measures will evaluate changes in these social&#xD;
      skills, cognition, and functioning using standardized assessments. We will perform structural&#xD;
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at three time points-before, during,&#xD;
      and after treatment (i.e., Time Point #1, 2, and 3).&#xD;

&#xD;
      All the recruitment will be taking place at Yale Child Study Center (YCSC), while the&#xD;
      intervention will be delivered online by therapists located at the Center for BrainHealth at&#xD;
      the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). The intervention is called Virtual Reality-Social&#xD;
      Cognition Training (VR-SCT) and has been approved by the IRB at UTD (approval number #06-54).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Age: 18-40, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A male or female outpatient&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. High-functioning (so that the treatment can effectively benefit the subjects):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of WASI at least 80&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Able to give informed consent prior to initiation of any protocol required&#xD;
                  procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Autism Spectrum Disorder:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Having a current primary diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (including&#xD;
                  Asperger's Disorder) from a licensed psychologist/psychiatrist or from a school&#xD;
                  diagnostician, as defined by the DSM-IV criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For this project, diagnosis will not be determined by our assessment. The&#xD;
                  participants we enroll will already carry a current primary diagnosis of Autism&#xD;
                  Spectrum Disorder. This verification of their diagnosis may also come from study&#xD;
                  personnel who have seen and/or treated the patient prior to his or her&#xD;
                  involvement in the project and can verbally confirm that they carry the proper&#xD;
                  diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) must be at least 4-5 words (the intervention method&#xD;
             requires this)&#xD;
