  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the U.S. population ages and the prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) among older adults&#xD;
      rises, the prevention of OA-associated disability is an important public health priority.&#xD;
      Accordingly, efficacious interventions are needed to manage pain and maintain physical&#xD;
      function among older adults with OA. Because skeletal muscle weakness is a primary&#xD;
      contributory factor to the progression of pain and functional decline among persons with OA,&#xD;
      optimal interventions are those capable of improving skeletal muscle strength. High-intensity&#xD;
      resistance exercise is the best-known method of improving muscle strength; however&#xD;
      high-compressive loads typically induce significant joint pain among persons with OA.&#xD;
      Accordingly, current recommendations include the performance of low- or moderate-intensity&#xD;
      physical exercise - despite the fact that these training paradigms are sub-optimal for&#xD;
      enhancing muscle strength. This application proposes conduct a pilot study to investigate the&#xD;
      potential of an innovative training paradigm with potential to stimulate improvements in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle strength while utilizing low-intensity loads. This paradigm, known as KAATSU&#xD;
      training, involves performing low-intensity exercise while externally-applied compression&#xD;
      mildly restricts blood flow to the active skeletal muscle. The overarching objective of the&#xD;
      present application is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of chronic KAATSU training&#xD;
      for the improvement of skeletal muscle strength and physical function among persons aged &gt; 60&#xD;
      years with symptomatic knee OA and mild to moderate physical limitations. Up to 72&#xD;
      participants will be recruited to participate in this three month intervention study.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention conditions: (1) a standard&#xD;
      exercise intervention consisting of center-based, moderate-intensity resistance training, or&#xD;
      (2) a KAATSU training program matched for overall workload. This study will provide novel&#xD;
      information regarding the therapeutic potential of KAATSU training for improving strength and&#xD;
      function as well as attenuating pain among these individuals. The study will also provide&#xD;
      critical information regarding the long-term, clinical viability of the paradigm by&#xD;
      evaluating participant safety, discomfort, and willingness to continually engage in the&#xD;
      KAATSU training program.&#xD;
