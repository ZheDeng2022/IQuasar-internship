      Men with elevated prostate specific antigen bloodtest and prior negative prostate biopsy have&#xD;
      a 30-60% of harboring occult prostate cancer. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (mpMRI) is an imaging test that may improve prostate cancer detection rates in this&#xD;
      population of men. In this prospective randomized trial multicenter trial the investigators&#xD;
      will assess the detection rates of prostate cancer diagnosis of systematic biopsy compared&#xD;
      with the addition of either a computer targeted system (UroNav - InVivo corp) to sample&#xD;
      suspicious areas identified on mpMRI versus the detection rate mpMRI guided freehand biopsy&#xD;
      (cognitive fusion biopsy). The hypothesis being tested is that computerized fusion guided&#xD;
      biopsy (UroNav) will increase detection prostate cancer compared to cognitive biopsy of these&#xD;
      areas and systematic biopsy alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common cancer in men in the United States, affecting&#xD;
      approximately 250,000 men per year. With the advent of the prostate specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
      blood test, PC has undergone downward stage migration resulting in earlier cancer detection.&#xD;
      In the pre-PSA era, tumors presented with advanced stage which were often visible on&#xD;
      transrectal ultrasound. In the modern era, tumors more often are microscopic and not apparent&#xD;
      on ultrasound imaging which creates a diagnostic challenge in which biopsy is essentially&#xD;
      blind. As a result, many tumors are missed resulting in subsequent biopsies, tumor&#xD;
      progression, and decreased cancer-specific survival due to delayed diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate has now become the&#xD;
      preferred imaging modality to visualize prostate tumors radiographically. mpMRI has become&#xD;
      increasing utilized for targeting tumor suspicious areas in the prostate in men with prior&#xD;
      negative conventional systematic biopsy. Numerous studies have shown MRI targeted biopsy&#xD;
      results in detection of cancer in this subset of men in approximately 30-60% of patients&#xD;
      (refs). In addition, MRI detects a higher number of aggressive prostate cancers which would&#xD;
      require treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methods of incorporating MRI into biopsy targeting have been tested: 1) in gantry/in&#xD;
      bore MRI biopsy 2) Robotic biopsy (Artemis) 3) UroNav ultrasound-MR fusion biopsy. The first&#xD;
      two techniques are cumbersome and difficult to use in clinical practice. The latter&#xD;
      technology is the most widely utilized, user and patient friendly technique. UroNav utilizes&#xD;
      a work-station which imports the MRI and then co-registers (fuses) it with real time&#xD;
      ultrasound; the ultrasound transducer communicates with an electromagnetic received above the&#xD;
      patient to allow the work-station/computer to target suspicious MRI lesions to guide the&#xD;
      users needle to the appropriate 3-dimensional location. Data has shown this to be more&#xD;
      effective than either systematic biopsy or free-MRI guided biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the present study is to compare head-to-head systematic biopsy + freehand MRI&#xD;
      targeted biopsy vs systematic biopsy + UroNav targeted in men with elevated PSA and prior&#xD;
      negative systematic biopsy.&#xD;
