    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that use of an educational story with pictures illustrating&#xD;
      overnight sleep study procedure (also called polysomnography or PSG)accompanied by simple&#xD;
      narrative will be a cost-effective, readily accepted intervention that will contribute to&#xD;
      successful completion of sleep studies among children with disabilities. Children who have&#xD;
      been referred for a clinical sleep study at Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI) will be enrolled&#xD;
      and randomized to either recieve usual care (discussion of polysomnography with referring&#xD;
      clinicians) or educational story intervention. Both groups of participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaries before and after the sleep study. Set-up for the sleep study will be&#xD;
      videotaped so that behavior of the child can be evaluated. The investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      whether successful study completion differs between the two groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a prospective clinical trial comparing parent knowledge of, and child&#xD;
      outcomes for clinically indicated PSG which is part of routine care. Comparisons will take&#xD;
      place before and after either educational intervention or usual clinical care preparing&#xD;
      children for PSG at KKI. Interested families will be recruited through the Kennedy Krieger&#xD;
      Institute (KKI) Sleep Disorders Clinic and flyers will be distributed to other KKI&#xD;
      subspecialty clinics in which clinically indicated PSG may be ordered. Families for whose&#xD;
      children PSG is clinically recommended in KKI Sleep Disorders Clinic will have informed&#xD;
      consent obtained from parents and assent from children in clinic, and randomization will&#xD;
      occur at that time. Alternately, families for whose children PSG is clinically recommended in&#xD;
      that clinic or others may contact the research coordinator for phone screening (telephone&#xD;
      script attached) in order to be consented and assented; randomization will then take place&#xD;
      once informed consent is received. Families randomized to the educational story intervention&#xD;
      group will receive a printed copy of the educational story, as well as instructions on how to&#xD;
      use it. Families randomized to the standard clinical care group will receive a set of&#xD;
      pictures used in standard clinical care without an accompanying educational story.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational story has been developed by the Primary Investigator, who is board certified&#xD;
      in Pediatrics and Sleep Medicine, and the Co-Investigator, who has extensive training in&#xD;
      child clinical and pediatric psychology. It has also been reviewed by professionals at the&#xD;
      KKI Center for Autism and Related Disorders with experience in developing educational&#xD;
      materials for children with disabilities. There is a single version of this story that&#xD;
      parents will be given to take home and review with their child. It is a short, upbeat&#xD;
      narrative about a boy who comes to the investigators pediatric sleep laboratory for his first&#xD;
      PSG. It is illustrated with color photographs depicting the entire PSG process (arrival at&#xD;
      the laboratory, each step of PSG setup, the final appearance of the child with monitoring&#xD;
      applied, the child asleep, and departure the following morning after a successful PSG). The&#xD;
      text has a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 2.5, and Flesch reading ease of 89.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research procedures prior to PSG include completion of the following questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-PSG knowledge questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pediatric Symptom Checklist&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parent Beliefs Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questionnaires will be done 2-3 weeks prior to the night of the PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All families will receive a phone call one week prior to PSG reminding them of their upcoming&#xD;
      procedure, and for families in the intervention group, reminding them to review the social&#xD;
      story. Parents in the intervention group will be asked to review the story at least 3 times&#xD;
      with their child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research procedures for parents on arrival the night of the clinically indicated PSG include&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Post-PSG knowledge questionnaire (on arrival at the laboratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parent Beliefs Scale (on arrival at the laboratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because Dr. Paasch and Dr. Accardo are blinded to the randomization of study subjects, they&#xD;
      will be able to score pre-PSG questionnaires and enter data as needed throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research procedures to be completed by sleep technicians the night of the study are the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adapted Wong-Baker FACES distress scale (based on child distress)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Audio and video recording of equipment setup. Clinical PSG is accompanied by audio and&#xD;
           video recording as part of routine care, but the investigators will extend the video&#xD;
           recording to include equipment setup specifically for the purpose of research in order&#xD;
           to quantify duration of setup time and number of escape behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research procedures for parents prior to discharge from the laboratory will consist of a&#xD;
      post-PSG qualitative questionnaire (prior to discharge from the laboratory) regarding their&#xD;
      experience in the laboratory. In the case of the intervention group, they will also be asked&#xD;
      how the educational story was helpful and whether parents recommended changes to make it more&#xD;
      helpful in future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the PSG and completion of questionnaires, the study is complete.&#xD;
      Therefore the average length of time over which the study takes place, is approximately 3-4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the clinically indicated PSG performed for clinical care purposes,&#xD;
      several steps will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The PSG will be scored per laboratory protocol by a certified registered PSG technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Primary Investigator, Dr. Accardo, will review data and generate a clinical&#xD;
           interpretation of the PSG detailing whether any sleep concerns or diagnoses were&#xD;
           identified during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Audio and video recording will be reviewed by co-investigator Dr. Valerie Paasch based&#xD;
           on the Pediatric Behavior Adjustment Scale (PBAS) to document any child distress and&#xD;
           complete task analysis to document the steps which were completed.&#xD;
