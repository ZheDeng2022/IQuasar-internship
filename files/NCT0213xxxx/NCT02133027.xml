      Objective:To explore the role of the right portal pedicle and Rouviere's sulcus as an&#xD;
      anatomic landmark in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:The investigators are going to select 60 patients intending to perform Laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy from April 2014 to April 2015.Check out the presence of the right portal&#xD;
      pedicle and Rouviere's sulcus during the surgery and divide into the experimental group and&#xD;
      the control group.Experimental group operated in Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with the guide&#xD;
      of Rouviere's sulcus while the Control group operated with the traditional way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis:Compare the differences between the Experimental group and the Control&#xD;
      group in bile duct injury rate,complication rate,blood loss,operative time ,conversion rate&#xD;
      and hospital stay.It is supposed that the results of Experimental group are superior to the&#xD;
      control group,difference is statistically significant(P&lt;0.05). So the investigators can draw&#xD;
      the conclusion that the anatomy method with the guide of right portal pedicle and Rouviere's&#xD;
      sulcus is useful in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;

      Surgical procedures(Experimental group ):Placing the grasping forceps on the neck of the&#xD;
      gallbladder, then retracted upwards and towards the left, so that the posterior aspect of the&#xD;
      hepatobiliary triangle is exposed. the sulcus is seen running to the right of the hilum . In&#xD;
      some patients, the lips of the sulcus are partially fused, with only a small cleft visible&#xD;
      laterally. The sulcus indicates reliably the plane of the common bile duct; dissection may be&#xD;
      started safely by division of the peritoneum immediately ventral to the sulcus and continued&#xD;
      in a triangle bounded by the liver surface, the neck of the gallbladder and the plane of the&#xD;
      sulcus. Even if the bile duct is tented upwards by the traction that has been exerted on the&#xD;
      gallbladder, dissection will be safely ventral to the plane of the duct. Posterior branches&#xD;
      of the cystic artery, may lie in the area of dissection and must be identified with care.Once&#xD;
      a plane has been opened posteriorly, attention may be turned to the anterior dissection,&#xD;
      using the posterior landmarks as a guide. The anterior and posterior dissections can then be&#xD;
      made to meet, thus opening the hepatobiliary triangle completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures(Control group ):A small periumbilical incision is made, with the location&#xD;
      and orientation depending on the patient's body habitus and cosmetic considerations.The&#xD;
      laparoscope is used to explore the abdomen for adhesions and potential injuries that may have&#xD;
      occurred during port placementï¼Œratcheted grasper is inserted through the lateral 5-mm port to&#xD;
      retract the gallbladder fundus in cephalad fashion. An atraumatic grasper is inserted through&#xD;
      the middle 5-mm port to retract the gallbladder infundibulum laterally, exposing the&#xD;
      anteromedial aspect of the triangle of Calot. A hook cautery is used to carefully incise the&#xD;
      peritoneum overlying the triangle of Calot, continuing along the medial aspect of the&#xD;
      proximal gallbladder. As the infundibulum is retracted superomedially, peritoneum overlying&#xD;
      the posterolateral aspect of the triangle of Calot is similarly incised using hook cautery.&#xD;
      All remaining connective tissue is dissected out of the triangle of Calot using blunt&#xD;
      dissection and hook cautery as needed to fully mobilize the gallbladder infundibulum.&#xD;
