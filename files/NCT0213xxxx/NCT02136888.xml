  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that therapeutic and supratherapeutic plasma&#xD;
      exposures to ponesimod do not have an effect on cardiac repolarization exceeding the&#xD;
      threshold of regulatory concern as measured by the QTc (interval from beginning of the Q wave&#xD;
      until end of the T wave corrected for heart rate) interval duration after administration of&#xD;
      multiple oral doses of 40 mg and 100 mg to healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive-controlled,&#xD;
      double-dummy, parallel group, multiple-dose, up-titration study of the electrocardiographic&#xD;
      effects of ponesimod in healthy male and female subjects with a nested cross-over comparison&#xD;
      between moxifloxacin and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to Group A (ponesimod treatment group) or Group B (placebo&#xD;
      treatment group) in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in Group B will be further randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to one of the following sequences: 400 mg moxifloxacin followed by&#xD;
      moxifloxacin-matching placebo or moxifloxacin matching placebo followed by 400 mg&#xD;
      moxifloxacin.&#xD;
