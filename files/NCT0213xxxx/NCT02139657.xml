  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label study of Rabies Immune Globulin (Human),&#xD;
      Caprylate/Chromatography Purified (RIG-C), in approximately 12 healthy subjects. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to characterize the rabies virus-specific antibody titer after a single&#xD;
      intramuscular injection of 20 IU/kg RIG-C and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      RIG-C.&#xD;
