  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has traditionally examined the effects of single&#xD;
      pollutant exposure on human health outcomes; however, to provide a better assessment of&#xD;
      pollutant exposure-associated effect on human health the Agency is moving toward a&#xD;
      multi-pollutant approach. Ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are national ambient air&#xD;
      quality standards (NAAQS) criteria pollutants that are major constituents of ambient air&#xD;
      pollution. This study will address the Agency's goals by investigating the cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      health effects of sequential exposure to O3 and NO2 in healthy adult human volunteers. The&#xD;
      findings of this study will provide data that will inform risk assessment models for O3 and&#xD;
      NO2 exposures. Additionally, the findings will provide insight into how the human health&#xD;
      effects of multi-pollutant exposures differ from those of single pollutant exposures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in air quality over the past several decades, over 100 million people in&#xD;
      the U.S. still live in counties that do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards&#xD;
      (NAAQS) for one or more pollutants. During the course of daily living individuals are exposed&#xD;
      to multiple pollutants from various sources of both natural and anthropogenic origin. It has&#xD;
      become increasingly clear that air pollutant exposure is a risk factor for exacerbation and&#xD;
      perhaps even progression of pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. The majority of controlled&#xD;
      human exposure studies have examined individual pollutants; however, real-world exposures&#xD;
      occur in the context of a complex mixture of pollutants. Different pollutants reach peak&#xD;
      levels at different times during the day, which raises the concern that exposure to one&#xD;
      pollutant may sensitize an individual so that their response to a subsequent exposure may be&#xD;
      enhanced. Thus the sequence of exposure to these agents may affect their relative health&#xD;
      effects and result in certain exposure scenarios being more deleterious than others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define multi-pollutant exposures that are relevant to real world scenarios we consulted&#xD;
      experts in the EPA Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), who advised us to study the effects of&#xD;
      sequential exposure to NO2 and O3, two ubiquitous NAAQS criteria pollutants. Ambient diurnal&#xD;
      profiles of these two pollutants indicate that levels of NO2 often peak in the evening and&#xD;
      morning hours, which are followed by peak ambient O3 concentrations during mid-day. Using&#xD;
      this information we designed the study described here to determine whether sequential&#xD;
      exposure to NO2 and O3, or O3 and NO2, will result in greater pulmonary and cardiovascular&#xD;
      effects than exposure to either pollutant alone. Ozone is a major component of photochemical&#xD;
      smog and is one of the most thoroughly studied gaseous pollutants. Controlled human exposure&#xD;
      studies have been critical in demonstrating that it can cause airway inflammation, including&#xD;
      increases in neutrophil infiltration into the lung and the production of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators, and ultimately decrements in lung function. More recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      ozone can also increase vascular inflammation, as well as alter autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      control of heart rate. Nitrogen dioxide is an oxidant that is produced by natural and&#xD;
      anthropogenic processes. The majority of man-made NO2 results from large-scale&#xD;
      combustion-related processes, such as automobile emissions and the generation of electricity.&#xD;
      Although traffic-related exposures account for the majority of NO2 emissions. Emissions from&#xD;
      natural gas cooking appliances and kerosene-fueled space heaters with inadequate ventilation&#xD;
      can serve as a significant source of human exposure to NO2 indoors. Previous studies have&#xD;
      shown that NO2 concentrations can reach 600ppb in the area surrounding an operating gas&#xD;
      stove, and peak levels may exceed 2000ppb. Controlled human exposure studies have indicated&#xD;
      that exposure to NO2 alone (ranging from 110-2000ppb) results in little to no observable&#xD;
      decrement in lung function; however, NO2 exposure has been associated with increases in&#xD;
      airway hyper-responsiveness, susceptibility to pulmonary infection, and increased pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammation. More recently, exposure to 500ppb NO2 has been associated with changes in&#xD;
      cardiac electrophysiology. Recent epidemiological data indicate that exposure to NO2 from&#xD;
      vehicle emissions were associated with both respiratory and cardiovascular-related mortality.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that sequential exposure to NO2 and O3 (at concentrations similar&#xD;
      to those proposed in this study) results in greater lung function decrements and increased&#xD;
      non-specific airway responsiveness compared to O3 exposure preceded by clean air exposure in&#xD;
      young women. Additional studies have demonstrated that sequential exposure to ozone,&#xD;
      separated by 24 hours, resulted in greater lung function decrements, assessed as forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume in the first second of exhalation (FEV1), following the second exposure&#xD;
      than was observed after the first. Ozone exposure has also been shown to have a priming&#xD;
      effect for subsequent exposure to sulfur dioxide (SO2) in adolescent asthmatics and&#xD;
      allergen-induced responses of perennially allergic asthmatics. Additionally, ongoing research&#xD;
      at the EPA Human Studies Facility has demonstrated that sequential exposure of humans to&#xD;
      diesel exhaust and ozone can result in greater lung function decrement than exposure to&#xD;
      either pollutant alone. Given the complex nature of pollutant exposure, we are interested in&#xD;
      determining if exposure to one pollutant can sensitize a person so that subsequent exposure&#xD;
      to a second pollutant would cause a more pronounced response than would be expected based on&#xD;
      exposure to just the second pollutant alone. Thus, in this study we will examine two exposure&#xD;
      scenarios involving sequential exposures of NO2 and O3. The first involves determining&#xD;
      whether an initial exposure to NO2 will &quot;prime&quot; an individual to a subsequent O3 exposure.&#xD;
      The second involves determining whether an initial exposure to O3, at a concentration that&#xD;
      results in small cardiopulmonary changes that resolve within 24 hours, will augment a&#xD;
      subsequent exposure to NO2. Generally speaking, exposure to NO2 alone is not associated with&#xD;
      robust changes in metrics of cardiopulmonary function; however, we believe that it can&#xD;
      modify, and be modified by, ozone exposure. Specifically, this study will test two general&#xD;
      hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that pre-exposure to a relatively low concentration of NO2&#xD;
      will &quot;sensitize&quot; individuals to a subsequent O3 exposure and lead to greater changes in&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary function compared to O3 exposure preceded by clean air exposure. Second, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that pre-exposure to O3, at a concentration that has been previously associated&#xD;
      with small changes in cardiopulmonary function, will prime individuals to have a greater&#xD;
      response to NO2 compared to pre-exposure to clean air. The information obtained during the&#xD;
      course of this study will enable the EPA to better evaluate the risks associated with&#xD;
      sequential multi-pollutant exposure and potentially provide advice on activities to mitigate&#xD;
      the effects.&#xD;
