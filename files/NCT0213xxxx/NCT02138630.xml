  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capsaicinoids (the active ingredient in hot peppers) have been shown to cause a moderate&#xD;
      increase in energy expenditure (50 kcal/day) as well as reductions in appetite, energy&#xD;
      intake, and (visceral) adiposity. As such, there is considerable interest in capsaicinoid for&#xD;
      weight loss supplements. Owing to the fact that these changes are believed to be driven by&#xD;
      catecholamine release and alterations in fat oxidation, there is growing belief that&#xD;
      capsaicin may also offer potential ergogenic benefits (performance enhancement) during&#xD;
      exercise, similar to the affect of caffeine, which works through similar pathways. Of&#xD;
      particular interest are the recent findings that free-fatty acids in the blood are elevated&#xD;
      2-2.5hrs post ingestion, yet changes in typical cardiovascular or sympathetic nervous tone&#xD;
      indicators (heart rate, blood pressure) were unaffected, suggesting some of the negative&#xD;
      consequences of other stimulants may be avoided. At present, however, more in depth&#xD;
      investigations of the effects on endothelial function, vascular autonomic tone and&#xD;
      inflammation are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are some indications that capsaicinoid ingestion may alter factors associated&#xD;
      exercise performance (such as increased fat oxidation for glucose sparing), to date these&#xD;
      studies have primarily used very low exercise intensities wherein these effects are typically&#xD;
      unnecessary, and results are not generalizable to the typical race intensities of endurance&#xD;
      sport competition. Performance measures have also been a noticeably absent outcome from&#xD;
      research to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: 1), Exercise performance will improve, at a level similar to those demonstrated&#xD;
      for caffeine ingestion 2) ratings of perceived exertion will go down with the effect of&#xD;
      causing intensity to go up 3) During sustained aerobic activity approaching the aerobic&#xD;
      threshold alterations in substrate use will be minimal (but possibly meaningful in regard to&#xD;
      performance); alterations at rest will be more pronounced. 4) acute alterations (6o min post&#xD;
      single dose) in blood pressure, HRV, arterial stiffness and RMR will mirror the effects&#xD;
      observed for more prolonged exposure in phase 1.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be male or female, 18 yr -45yr and free from any known or suspected chronic&#xD;
        conditions. General health and suitability to participate in an exercise/health research&#xD;
        study will be confirmed through use of the PAR-Q+ screening questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any participant who has a positive answer to a screening question will be required to seek&#xD;
        physician approval prior to any physical exercise. Baseline arrhythmia (tachycardia&#xD;
        (&gt;100pbm) and systolic or diastolic hypertension (&gt;140/90 mmHg) will also be reason for&#xD;
        exclusion. During baseline anthropometric assessment we will confirm that participants all&#xD;
        fall within a typical BMI range (20-30 kg/m2) of either &quot;normal&quot; weight or &quot;overweight&quot;,&#xD;
        but not &quot;underweight&quot; or &quot;obese&quot;. Persons who take cardiovascular medications, metabolic&#xD;
        medications, smoke cigarettes, excessively consume alcohol, are prone to heartburn, or have&#xD;
        a previous diagnosis of hyperlipidemia or hyperinsulemia will also be excluded&#xD;
