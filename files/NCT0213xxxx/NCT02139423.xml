    <textblock>
      Universal hearing screening at birth by use of otoacoustic emission (OAE) is now offered in&#xD;
      most maternities in France to detect symptomatic hearing impairment at birth but screening of&#xD;
      cCMV infection is not coupled with this screening. In this study, the feasibility of&#xD;
      achieving before one month of age the diagnosis of congenital CMV diagnosis and as well as&#xD;
      the confirmation of hearing loss in newborns who failed newborn hearing screening will be&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) is the most frequent congenital infection in France. Around&#xD;
      90% of cCMV infected infants are asymptomatic at birth, of whom 7 to 20% develop&#xD;
      sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). cCMV explains at least 10% of all hearing loss cases in&#xD;
      young children. Early antiviral treatment (implemented before 1 month of age) with&#xD;
      ganciclovir or valganciclovir can improve hearing outcome. In the absence of universal&#xD;
      screening, cCMV remains largely undetected because most infected neonates are asymptomatic or&#xD;
      have non-specific symptoms. When symptoms become apparent or develop, it may be too late for&#xD;
      confirmation that the infection is of congenital origin becausediagnosis of congenital&#xD;
      infection is based on the detection of CMV in samples collected within 2 to 3 weeks after&#xD;
      birth. The presence of CMV in samples collected after this time may represent postnatal&#xD;
      infection which does not carry the risk of hearing loss or neurodevelopmental sequelae.&#xD;
      Universal hearing screening at birth by use of otoacoustic emission (OAE) is now offered in&#xD;
      most maternities in France to detect symptomatic hearing impairment at birth but screening of&#xD;
      cCMV infection is not coupled with this screening. In this study, the feasibility of&#xD;
      achieving before one month of age the diagnosis of congenital CMV diagnosis and as well as&#xD;
      the confirmation of hearing loss in newborns who failed newborn hearing screening will be&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
