    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether early treatment of acute&#xD;
      exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) with a combination therapy,&#xD;
      Salmeterol + Fluticasone Propionate (SFP - Advair) will reduce the use of prednisone, known&#xD;
      as the conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine whether early treatment with combination therapy (SFP) can&#xD;
      reduce the use of prednisone (the conventional treatment) in the event of an AECOPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility of this treatment approach and to provide pilot data (needed&#xD;
           for a larger multi-centre clinical trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility and need of assessment during and after exacerbation onset,&#xD;
           health-related quality of life and physical activity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of this approach; this is in terms of the delay in starting&#xD;
           prednisone and an unfavourable outcome (ER visits and/or hospitalization).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are of major importance since they are&#xD;
      associated with adverse effects on morbidity, health status, and costs. Conventional&#xD;
      treatment includes the use of antibiotics and oral corticosteroids (OCS). However, OCS is&#xD;
      associated with significant side effects. This is of considerable importance since&#xD;
      exacerbation occurs on average 2 to 4 times per year in COPD patients. Alternative treatment&#xD;
      such as high dose inhaled corticosteroids has also been shown to be effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of AECOPD. Recently, studies have clearly demonstrated the effect of combination&#xD;
      therapy (SFP) on key inflammatory cells and a marked enhance anti-inflammatory effect when&#xD;
      compared to inhaled corticosteroids alone. Inhaled corticosteroids have a high level of&#xD;
      topical anti-inflammatory activity and a low level of systemic. Additionally, combination&#xD;
      therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting Î²2-adrenoceptor agonists (SFP) appears&#xD;
      to produce significant anti-inflammatory effects in COPD airways that are not seen when&#xD;
      inhaled or oral steroids are used alone. This could offer a potential for an alternative&#xD;
      treatment to oral corticosteroids in AECOPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE None of the inhaled treatments is likely to be adopted and to replace the use of&#xD;
      OCS for the treatment of AECOPD unless it is used promptly at the onset of symptom worsening.&#xD;
      Early treatment has been shown to have clinical importance in accelerating symptom recovery&#xD;
      and reducing hospital admission. Recently, the investigators have demonstrated that the early&#xD;
      treatment of AECOPD can be achieved by the implementation of a written action plan as part of&#xD;
      a self-management education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of action plans helps COPD patients recognize symptom changes, implement self-care&#xD;
      and self-initiate a customized prescription (antibiotics &amp; oral steroids) in the event of an&#xD;
      exacerbation. Self-management education programs with a written action plan that includes&#xD;
      standing prescriptions with combination therapy (SFP) in the event of an exacerbation may be&#xD;
      promising in reducing the use of prednisone in AECOPD, the conventional treatment.&#xD;

    <description>An Acute Exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is defined as a sustained worsening of dyspnea, cough or sputum production leading to an increase in the use of maintenance medication and/or supplementation with additional medication. In addition, exacerbations should be defined as either purulent or non-purulent.&#xD;
Standing prescriptions for exacerbation:&#xD;
1) Purulent exacerbation - Antibiotic: Avelox 400 mg daily for 5 days. 2a) Mild to moderate exacerbation - Combination therapy (SFP - Advair) to be increased as follows: If regular treatment is Advair 250/50 BID then dose should be increased to Advair 500/100 BID for 10 days; if regular treatment is Advair 500/50 BID then increase to Advair 1000/100 BID for 10 days.&#xD;
2b) Severe exacerbation - Prednisone (oral): 40 mg once daily for 7-10 days</description>
