  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the main inhibitory compound in the human brain. Drugs that&#xD;
      enhance its effects by binding on GABA receptors (e.g., benzodiazepines) are used to treat&#xD;
      various diseases such as epilepsy, insomnia, anxiety or movement disorders. However, the use&#xD;
      of these medications is often compromised due to their side effects, like sedation, cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, and addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of these side effects have been linked to a particular type of GABA receptor (GABA A&#xD;
      alpha 1). Therefore, effort is being made to develop drugs that do not act on this receptor,&#xD;
      but maintain their beneficial properties by acting on other types of GABA receptors. AZD7325&#xD;
      is a drug that selectively acts on GABA A alpha 2 and A alpha 3 receptors, but not A alpha 1.&#xD;
      It has been tested in more than 700 people and so far proved to be generally well tolerated.&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography (PET) study in humans demonstrated that AZD7325 binds to GABA A&#xD;
      receptors in the brain after a single dose. Early clinical studies have shown that it has&#xD;
      less sedative and cognitive adverse events as compared with a benzodiazepine lorazepam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will investigate its effects on short interval intracortical inhibition&#xD;
      (SICI). SICI is neurophysiological marker of inhibitory processes in the motor cortex. It is&#xD;
      obtained non-invasively by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In TMS, magnetic&#xD;
      impulses applied over the scalp that in turn induce a current in a small area of the brain.&#xD;
      If applied over the motor areas of the brain, impulses result in muscle twitch that is&#xD;
      recorded with surface electrodes. SICI is enhanced by certain drugs like benzodiazepines that&#xD;
      act on GABA A alpha 1,2,3, and 5 receptor subtypes, but not by zolpidem acting solely on&#xD;
      alpha 1 subtype. Because GABA A alpha 5 receptor subtype is less common in the cortex, it has&#xD;
      been concluded that the drug effects on SICI are related to GABA A alpha 2 and alpha 3&#xD;
      receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If AZD7325 proves to enhance SICI in healthy volunteers, this would create the grounds for&#xD;
      the use of this medication to treat certain neurological disorders in which SICI has been&#xD;
      found to be impaired (e.g., dystonia).&#xD;
