  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria - Subjects must have undergone a prior ASCT for MM and have progressed&#xD;
        within 365 days of stem cell infusion. Patients who underwent syngeneic transplant (i.e.,&#xD;
        transplant from an identical twin donor) rather than autologous transplant are eligible and&#xD;
        syngeneic transplant will be considered equivalent to ASCT for the purposes of these&#xD;
        inclusion/exclusion criteria. Progression will be defined according to IMWG criteria for&#xD;
        progressive disease143 (Table 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who have undergone two prior ASCTs as part of a planned tandem ASCT consolidation&#xD;
        regimen are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in whom first progression is identified between days 366 and 450 (inclusive) after&#xD;
        ASCT will be eligible if progression is identified on their first evaluation for&#xD;
        progression in this window and if they had not been evaluated between days 270 and 365 for&#xD;
        progression. This clause is to account for practice patterns in which patients otherwise&#xD;
        doing well are monitored infrequently (every 3-6 months) for relapse after they recover&#xD;
        from their first ASCT. This will allow infrequently monitored patients to be included if&#xD;
        progression is identified on their &quot;12 month follow-up evaluation&quot; if this appointment&#xD;
        happens to be scheduled just outside the 365-day post-ASCT window. N.B.: There is no&#xD;
        requirement that patients must enroll within 365 days of prior ASCT, and patients may be&#xD;
        treated with other agents, including experimental agents, following relapse/progression&#xD;
        after prior ASCT before enrollment on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have received as part of their initial therapy for MM, prior to first&#xD;
             ASCT, a regimen containing either bortezomib or lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a confirmed diagnosis of active MM prior to first ASCT as defined&#xD;
             by the IMWG criteria143, with the exception that patients treated for active MM on&#xD;
             account of recurrent, complicated infections as the only clinical manifestation or on&#xD;
             account of progressive smoldering MM with imminent clinical complications may be&#xD;
             included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must have signed written, informed consent. Subjects must be ≥ 18 and &lt;70 years of&#xD;
        age. Subjects must have an anticipated survival of &gt;100 days after high-dose melphalan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Subjects must have adequate vital organ function as defined by the following criteria:&#xD;
        Serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 or estimated creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min and not&#xD;
        dialysis-dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/μl and platelet count ≥50,000/μl. SGOT ≤ 3x the upper limit&#xD;
        of normal and total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl (except for patients in whom hyperbilirubinemia&#xD;
        is attributed to Gilbert's syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 45% Adequate pulmonary function with FEV1, FVC,&#xD;
        TLC, DLCO (after appropriate adjustment for lung volume and hemoglobin concentration) ≥40%&#xD;
        of predicted values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Toxicities from prior therapies must have recovered to grade ≤2 according to the CTC 4.0&#xD;
        criteria or to the subject's prior baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have an ECOG performance status of 0-2, unless a higher performance&#xD;
             status is due solely to bone pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to comply with the requirements of the RevAssist program if&#xD;
             maintenance lenalidomide is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have measurable disease on study entry. Measurable disease may include&#xD;
             quantifiable or detectable levels of serum or urine paraprotein. For patients with&#xD;
             minimally secretory disease or non-secretory myeloma on study entry, serum free lambda&#xD;
             or kappa light chain levels or the serum free light chain ratio may be measured and&#xD;
             used for disease monitoring if abnormal. Likewise, for patients with IgA MM in which&#xD;
             serum protein electrophoresis is deemed unreliable due to co-migration of normal serum&#xD;
             proteins with the paraprotein, elevated total serum IgA levels may be considered&#xD;
             measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have stored in usable condition for second ASCT, as judged by the&#xD;
             principal investigator, ≥3x106 CD34+ cells per kg of body weight (either autologous or&#xD;
             syngeneic) stored in at least two bags such that after administration of the minimum&#xD;
             dose of 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg required on this protocol that a separate aliquot of at&#xD;
             least 1 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg remains for rescue infusion in the event of graft&#xD;
             failure. Patients with inadequate stem cells stored may still sign consent and undergo&#xD;
             a mobilization/collection procedure either before or after apheresis for T cell&#xD;
             harvest. If this is required and is undertaken prior to apheresis for T cell harvest,&#xD;
             two weeks must elapse between the last day of stem cell collection and apheresis for T&#xD;
             cell harvest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Table 5 IMWG Criteria for Progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        One or more of the following criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Increase of ≥25% from baseline in Serum M-component (the absolute increase must be ≥0.5&#xD;
        g/dl) (if baseline M-component is ≥5 g/dl, increases of ≥1 g/dl are sufficient to define&#xD;
        progression) and/or Urine M-component (the absolute increase must be X200 mg/24 h ) and/or&#xD;
        The difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (only in patients without&#xD;
        measurable serum and urine M-protein levels) (the absolute increase must be &gt;10 mg/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bone marrow plasma cell percentage (the absolute % must be ≥10%) For cases of IgA MM in&#xD;
        which SPEPs are unavailable or are deemed unreliable due to migration of the paraprotein in&#xD;
        the beta region, total IgA levels may be used to assess progression and response to&#xD;
        therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase&#xD;
        in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium &gt;11.5 mg/dl or 2.65 mmol/l) that can&#xD;
        be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder IMWG Criteria for Diagnosis&#xD;
        of Multiple Myeloma Presence of an M-component in serum and/or urine plus clonal plasma&#xD;
        cells in the bone marrow and/or a documented clonal plasmacytoma. In patients with no&#xD;
        detectable M-component, an abnormal serum FLC ratio on the serum FLC assay can substitute&#xD;
        and satisfy this criterion. For patients, with no serum or urine M-component and normal&#xD;
        serum FLC ratio, the baseline bone marrow must have ≥10% clonal plasma cells; these&#xD;
        patients are referred to as having 'non-secretory myeloma'. Patients with biopsy-proven&#xD;
        amyloidosis and/or systemic light chain deposition disease (LCDD) should be classified as&#xD;
        'myeloma with documented amyloidosis' or 'myeloma with documented LCDD,' respectively if&#xD;
        they have ≥30% plasma cells and/or myeloma-related bone disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PLUS one or more of the following, which must be attributable to the underlying plasma cell&#xD;
        disorder:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Calcium elevation (&gt;11.5 mg/dl) Renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt;2 mg/dl) Anemia&#xD;
        (hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dl or at 2 g/dl below normal) Bone disease (lytic lesions or osteopenia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have inadequate venous access for or contraindications to leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any active and uncontrolled infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have active or chronic hepatitis B [detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)],&#xD;
             hepatitis C [positive serology (HCV Ab)], or HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any uncontrolled medical disorder that would preclude participation as outlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received prior gene therapy or gene-modified cellular immunotherapy. Subject may&#xD;
             have received, however, non-gene-modified autologous T-cells with their first ASCT in&#xD;
             association with an anti-myeloma vaccine (e.g., hTERT or MAGEA3) or vaccination&#xD;
             against infectious agents (e.g., influenza or pneumococcus) as was performed on our&#xD;
             previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have undergone two prior ASCTs if the second ASCT was a salvage ASCT (defined as a&#xD;
             second ASCT performed upon progression following first ASCT) rather than a second ASCT&#xD;
             as part of a tandem ASCT consolidation regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have auto-immune disease (including connective tissue disease, uveitis, sarcoidosis,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, or multiple sclerosis) that is active and severe in the&#xD;
             judgment of the principal investigator, or have a history of autoimmune disease that&#xD;
             has required prolonged immunosuppressive therapy in the judgment of the principal&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have active central nervous system disease, including CNS involvement by malignancy or&#xD;
             evidence of blood in the CNS such as subdural hematoma. If a subject has any&#xD;
             neurological abnormality on examination, a baseline brain MRI is required to exclude&#xD;
             structural disease and/or intracranial bleeding. Patients with clinically significant&#xD;
             intracranial lesions should be excluded. Patients with common age-related changes that&#xD;
             are not clinically significant (i.e. moderate small vessel ischemic changes) do not&#xD;
             need to be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a Class III/IV cardiovascular disability according to the New York Heart&#xD;
