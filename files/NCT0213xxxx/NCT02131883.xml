      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of severe health anxiety is reported to be 1-2% in Western communities. This&#xD;
      functional disorder is difficult for medical doctors to treat, the course of the disorder is&#xD;
      often chronic, and that is costly for the social and health care systems as well as for the&#xD;
      patients. A Cochrane metaanalysis from 2009 finds evidence for effectiveness of individual&#xD;
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for patients with hypochondriasis. But no randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCT) of the effectiveness of classical CBT delivered only in groups for&#xD;
      patients with severe health anxiety (hypochondriasis/illness anxiety disorder) has yet been&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) to examine the effectiveness of group-CBT for patients with severe health anxiety compared&#xD;
      to a wait-list group receiving usual care, 2) to perform a categorical and dimensional&#xD;
      assessment of personality, 3) to examine predictors of outcome especially comorbid&#xD;
      personality disorders, 4) to examine the relation between personality, illness perception and&#xD;
      treatment outcome, 5) to compare the cost-effectiveness of these two treatments, 6) at a 2&#xD;
      years follow up to examine the course and long-term effectiveness of group-CBT for patients&#xD;
      with severe health anxiety and some also followed by psychological treatment for comorbid&#xD;
      personality disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe HA who have received group CBT will at 6-month follow-up compared to a&#xD;
      wait-list group receiving usual care show a significantly reduction in health anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      84 patients referred from medical doctors during 2014-15 to the Clinic of Liaison Psychiatry&#xD;
      in Koege, Region Zealand, Denmark, will be included and block randomised per 14 patients to&#xD;
      either weekly group-CBT with 7 patients and 2 therapists for 3 hours a week in 12 weeks or&#xD;
      wait-list with usual care for 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion: Severe health anxiety (dominant mental disorder), score on WI-7&gt;21,4, age 18-65&#xD;
      years, Danish speaking, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion: Another severe treatment demanding mental disorder, risk of suicide or psychosis,&#xD;
      a serious somatic disease, pregnancy, dependency of drugs, alcohol or medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are included using research criteria for severe health anxiety (for ICD-11) and&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews developed for DSM-IV, SCAN (general psychopathology) and SCID-II&#xD;
      (personality disorders). Criteria for hypochondriasis from ICD-10 and illness anxiety&#xD;
      disorder/somatic symptom disorder from DSM-5 are used for subcategorising. Dimensions and&#xD;
      traits of personality are assessed by the questionnaire PID-5 included in DSM-5, section III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the questionnaire for health anxiety, Whiteley Index 7 (WI-7),&#xD;
      with a cut-off for remission on 21,4 or a blinded diagnostic assessment of no severe health&#xD;
      anxiety present 6 months after end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures are questionnaires for health anxiety (HAI), general&#xD;
      psychopathology (SCL-90-R), level of personality disorders (PID-5), level of functioning&#xD;
      (SF-36), quality of life (WHO-5, EQ-5D), Illness perception (IPQ), alcohol consumption (CAGE)&#xD;
      and register data for number of sick days and use of social and health care and a blinded&#xD;
      global assessment of functioning (F-GAF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data wil be analysed, and results wil be disseminated from 2016.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification and comorbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypochondriasis is broadly defined in the international classification systems for mental&#xD;
      disorders ICD-10 (WHO) and DSM-IV (APA) under somatoform disorders as a preoccupation with&#xD;
      fears and the belief of having a serious disease with the condition lasting for at least 6&#xD;
      months. It is non-delusional, and the symptoms are not better explained by another mental&#xD;
      disorder, it causes distress or impairment of functioning and persists despite appropriate&#xD;
      medical reassurance. Somatoform disorders are defined as syndromes with physical symptoms,&#xD;
      which are not sufficiently explained by physical causes alone, defined somatic illnesses or&#xD;
      comorbid mental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A less stigmatizing name: health anxiety has been suggested, and new research has reported&#xD;
      more valid diagnostic criteria with continuous ruminations of fears and belief of having a&#xD;
      serious disease lasting for at least 2 weeks and the presence of minimum one of five other&#xD;
      symptoms: preoccupation with illness or body, preoccupation with medical information,&#xD;
      suggestibility or autosuggestibility, fear of infection or contamination and fear of&#xD;
      medication. A degree for severity has also been introduced here with either mild or severe&#xD;
      health anxiety split by the presence of minimum one severely distressing symptom or a&#xD;
      significant impairment of functioning [1]. Hypochondriasis and Health Anxiety (HA) are from&#xD;
      now on used synonymously here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HA like other somatoform disorders show high degree of mental comorbidity with depressive&#xD;
      disorders between 15,3-45,2%, anxiety disorders between 22-52,4%, somatoform disorder between&#xD;
      8-21,4% and mental comorbidity in total between 54-78,6% [11,34,46]. HA also show a high&#xD;
      degree of mental comorbidity with personality disorders (PD) between 63-76% [34,35] when&#xD;
      using questionnaire for assessment, but they seem to overestimate the prevalence [36] and&#xD;
      between 40-74% when using SCID-II, the semi-structured interview developed for DSM, that is&#xD;
      the present golden standard for diagnosing PD [39,40].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high degree of mental comorbidity has risen questions of classification, if HA is a primary&#xD;
      mental disorder and therefore its own disease entity, or the symptoms are only secondary to&#xD;
      another mental disorder like a melancholic depression, or if HA is better classified as a&#xD;
      personality disorder [37] or an anxiety disorder [38]. In DSM-V and ICD-11 the disorder&#xD;
      entity is suggested preserved and kept categorized under somatoform disorders, but the name&#xD;
      is suggested changed to illness anxiety disorder in DSM-V and health anxiety in ICD-11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have reported a prevalence for HA in communities between 0,2-4,5% [2,28] and in&#xD;
      primary care between 0,8-7.0% [3-7], and using the new and more valid criteria on 9,5% (12.1%&#xD;
      incl. mild degree) [1] and in secondary care on 10-20% [8-9]. Severe HA has an early onset&#xD;
      with mean age of onset = 25 years [1], an equal sex distribution, it is fluctuating but&#xD;
      persistent with a median duration before treatment on 2- 20 years [10,11,31,45], and it is&#xD;
      distressing and disabling and therefore also costly for our health and social care system&#xD;
      [12,13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personality characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only 2 former studies have assessed patients with HA using SCID-II. One had a small sample&#xD;
      size of 21 psychiatric outpatients, and 74% of these patients were found to have comorbid PD&#xD;
      compared to 52% for other psychiatric outpatients in Greece. Here the most prevalent PD for&#xD;
      HA were histrionic and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders [39]. The other study&#xD;
      included 42 patients with HA and no comorbid OCD or Social Phobia recruited from a community&#xD;
      in USA. This study found, that 40% with HA had comorbid PD, and the most prominent types were&#xD;
      paranoid, obsessive-compulsive and avoidant PD. Here the group of HA were compared to groups&#xD;
      of patients with OCD and Social Phobia, and they found no significant difference between the&#xD;
      prevalence of PD with HA compared to the prevalence of PD with either of these 2 anxiety&#xD;
      disorders [40].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies of personality dimensions for HA have been made. One study used the questionnaire&#xD;
      Personality Assessment Schedule (PAS) and found for hypochondriacal PD a high degree of the&#xD;
      personality traits: hypochondriasis, anxiousness, consciousness and dependence [37]. Other&#xD;
      personality traits for HA that have been reported are high degree of neuroticism, narcissism&#xD;
      and avoidance and histrionic and borderline traits [37,43,44].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from HA are not often diagnosed and treated well by doctors [5]. It causes&#xD;
      frustration for both doctors and patients. Doctors feel powerless towards the patients&#xD;
      continuing suffering and complaints, patients feel they are not taken seriously by the doctor&#xD;
      and do not get sufficient help, and the extensive somatic focus and medical examinations&#xD;
      contribute to the chronic development of the disorder [48,49,59].&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Zealand with app. 2.5 million inhabitants only about 40 patients with HA were referred&#xD;
      from medical doctors to specialized treatment in the existing 2 clinics of Liaison Psychiatry&#xD;
      in 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier on HA was considered untreatable, but psychotherapy with cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) for HA has been developed over the past 2 decades and has shown effective.&#xD;
      There is also evidence from 2 studies reporting moderate treatment effectiveness of SSRI&#xD;
      medication for HA [22,23], but prior to treatment patients with HA favour psychological&#xD;
      treatment over pharmacological treatment, although pharmacological treatment is equally&#xD;
      tolerated [22-24]. A meta-analysis from 2007 includes 6 randomized controlled trials (RCT)&#xD;
      and finds evidence for effectiveness of treatment of HA with short term individual CBT. The&#xD;
      effective factors of the CBT on health anxiety symptoms as primary outcome measure were found&#xD;
      to be cognitive restructuring (cognitive therapy), response-prevention, exposure, and&#xD;
      behavioural stress management, and with resource use as secondary outcome measure also&#xD;
      psychoeducation [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBT for personality disorders has so far only shown effective in long term treatment [65].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group CBT might have some advantages over individual CBT in cost-effectiveness, because of&#xD;
      less therapist time spend per patient, individual CBT is more vulnerable to session&#xD;
      cancellation from the patient and possible effective group dynamics. No studies so far have&#xD;
      compared effectiveness of group CBT to individual CBT for HA, and generally&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and group dynamics have little empirical evidence and need more research&#xD;
      [16-21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 studies on effectiveness of group CBT for HA have formerly been made. They showed treatment&#xD;
      effective and acceptable [25,26,29,30], and one study also showed cost-effective for society&#xD;
      in saved health care [27]. But the sample sizes of 3 of the studies were small, and their&#xD;
      design were not controlled, and for the two RCT studies one began therapy with 8 individual&#xD;
      sessions of CBT [30], and the intervention of the second study was mostly psychoeducational&#xD;
      [29].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to treatment patients generally prefer individual CBT over group CBT, but attrition and&#xD;
      satisfaction with both treatments have shown equal at the end of treatment with dropout rates&#xD;
      between 10-47% [20,21,47].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors of outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a few studies so far have examined predictors of outcome of CBT for HA and often with&#xD;
      conflicting results. 2 studies found no predictive value for sociodemographic variables&#xD;
      [33,62], but one study found a positive predictive value for marital status [32] and one a&#xD;
      negative predictive value for high age [66].&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 studies have found a negative predictive value for a higher degree of health anxiety before&#xD;
      treatment [32,33,66], but the results for pretreatment anxiety, general psychopathology and&#xD;
      chronicity are inconsistent [32,33,62,66]. One study also found negative predictive value for&#xD;
      more dysfunctional cognitions related to bodily functioning, disability at work and&#xD;
      utilization of health care before treatment but no predictive value for comorbid anxiety or&#xD;
      depressive disorders [33].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of comorbid PD in HA for treatment outcome has to our knowledge only been&#xD;
      investigated in one former study. The design included no control group, and the included 36&#xD;
      patients had been non-respondant to previously given pharmachological treatment, and&#xD;
      afterwards they were treated with different duration of individual insight psychotherapy and&#xD;
      anti-anxious medication. Here comorbid PD had a negative predictive value for outcome [62].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of patients with depressive and anxiety disorders and comorbid PD have generally&#xD;
      found worse treatment outcome for both pharmacological and psychological treatments&#xD;
      [41,42,60].&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      No RCT on outcome and effectiveness of classical group CBT for severe health anxiety and&#xD;
      hypochondriasis has yet been conducted. Group CBT compared to individual CBT (and usual care)&#xD;
      for patients with health anxiety might have some therapeutic advantages due to manualised and&#xD;
      structured treatment, favourable group dynamics, improving social skills and creating a&#xD;
      support group, group-CBT might be less costly and therefore have better cost-effectiveness,&#xD;
      but attrition might be worse, so it needs further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial assessment prior to CBT should also include categorical and dimensional assessment of&#xD;
      personality because of possible relevance for prognosis, treatment preference and&#xD;
      possibilities, creation of homogenous groups for group therapy improving acceptability and&#xD;
      outcome, and individual designed CBT as an element of group CBT. But better general knowledge&#xD;
      of personality vulnerability for patients with HA here by using best diagnostics and a larger&#xD;
      sample size than before and new and better assessment questionnaires for personality&#xD;
      dimensions and traits is also relevant for designing more effective treatment and protocols&#xD;
      for individual and group CBT in the future. As more general practitioners become educated in&#xD;
      CBT and programs of Shared Care are introduced, in time this treatment for HA might also be&#xD;
      possible to integrate in primary care more close to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomised controlled trial to examine the treatment outcome of specialized classical&#xD;
      cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) delivered in a group setting for patients with severe&#xD;
      health anxiety (HA) including the evidence based effective factors of individual CBT for HA&#xD;
      [14]. More specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine if patients with severe HA have reduced level of health anxiety or even are&#xD;
           cured 6 months after treatment with group CBT compared to a wait-list group receiving&#xD;
           usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine if patients with severe HA experience a better mental and physical health and&#xD;
           improved social function 6 months after treatment with group CBT compared to a wait-list&#xD;
           group receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine if patients with severe HA show a reduction in health care use and sick days&#xD;
           6 months after treatment with group CBT compared to a wait-list group receiving usual&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To do a categorical and dimensional assessment of personality of patients with severe HA&#xD;
           referred from doctors using a larger sample size than before with best diagnostics and a&#xD;
           new instrument for dimensional and trait assessment (PID-5) to yield new general&#xD;
           knowledge of personality vulnerability for patients with severe HA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To examine predictors of outcome for group CBT for patients with severe HA especially&#xD;
           personality disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To examine cost-effectiveness of group CBT compared to a wait-list group receiving usual&#xD;
           care and a standard duration of individual CBT for patients with severe HA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To examine how the illness perception of patients with severe health anxiety change&#xD;
           after treatment with group CBT compared to a wait-list group receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To examine how the illness perception is related to the personality of patients with&#xD;
           severe HA and the outcome of group CBT compared to a wait-list group receiving usual&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To examine the course for patients with severe health anxiety after this short term&#xD;
           group-CBT and afterwards long term psychotherapeutic treatment for comorbid personality&#xD;
           disorders at 2 years follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe HA who have received group CBT will at 6-month follow-up compared to a&#xD;
      wait-list group receiving usual care show a significantly reduction in health anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe HA who have received group CBT will at 6-month follow-up compared to a&#xD;
      wait-list group receiving usual care have significantly: a) better mental and physical health&#xD;
      and improved global and social functioning, b) lower use of health care services and c) less&#xD;
      sick days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30-60% of patients with severe HA have a comorbid personality disorder. Both patients with&#xD;
      severe HA with or without comorbid PD show reduction in health anxiety from short term group&#xD;
      CBT, but patients with comorbid personality disorder show a significantly lower cure-rate,&#xD;
      than patients without comorbid personality disorder. Patients with severe health anxiety and&#xD;
      comorbid PD (or other comorbid mental disorders) afterwards therefore need long term&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic treatment to be cured. This hypotheses will be examined at 24 month&#xD;
      follow-up, where a part of the patients after group CBT also have received long term&#xD;
      psychotherapy for their PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group CBT is significantly more cost-effective than a wait-list group receiving usual care&#xD;
      and a standard duration of individual CBT for patients with severe HA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group CBT is a feasible and acceptable treatment for the patients (high satisfaction and low&#xD;
      drop-out).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe HA who have received group CBT will at 6-month follow-up compared to a&#xD;
      wait-list group receiving usual care show a significantly more sound illness perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe HA and a comorbid personality disorder have before group CBT a less&#xD;
      sound illness perception than patients without comorbid personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      84 patients with severe health anxiety consecutively referred from family physicians, medical&#xD;
      specialists or hospital wards on Zealand to The Clinic of Liaison Psychiatry in Koege, Region&#xD;
      Zealand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is communicated through relevant homepages, regionsjaelland.dk and sundhed.dk,&#xD;
      and through arranged visits with medical doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are block randomized per 14 patients into 2 groups: group CBT or a wait-list&#xD;
      receiving usual care and after 9 month offered group CBT. Expected drop-out rate on 20% in&#xD;
      group CBT and on wait-list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients referred are initially screened for inclusion by a telephone interview of a&#xD;
      specialist in psychiatry (MS). The telephone interview consist of direct questions for the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, WI-7, the diagnostic criteria for severe health anxiety and&#xD;
      seeking verbal consent to send the first online questionnaire. Each patient fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion is assessed by use of the SCAN interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatry), which is a thorough semi-structured diagnostic interview recommended by the&#xD;
      WHO and is applied in the diagnostics of general mental disorders as defined by ICD-10 and&#xD;
      DSM-IV criteria [50], and by use of the SCID II [51], which is a semi-structured diagnostic&#xD;
      interview for personality disorders developed for DSM-IV. Just before the semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews are performed a non-structured clinical interview and assessment is performed and&#xD;
      ended by psychoeducation and the joint creation of the individual illness model for cognitive&#xD;
      behaviour therapy. Global assessment of functioning (GAF-F) and diagnostic assessment using&#xD;
      DSM-V, ICD-10 and the criteria for severe health anxiety will also be performed in this&#xD;
      initial clinical assessment. The clinical and diagnostic interviews are performed by a&#xD;
      specialist in psychiatry (MS), certified at the SCAN training centre in Copenhagen and&#xD;
      trained in SCID-II assessment before project start. If needed a second opinion on the&#xD;
      patients from another medical doctor at the clinic in Koege is possible (JS). For&#xD;
      inter-rater-reliability assessment 5% of the patients are similarly clinically assessed by a&#xD;
      blinded second rater and specialist in psychiatry. After the patients have answered the 5.&#xD;
      online questionnaire (6 month after end of treatment), they are diagnostically assessed for&#xD;
      severe health anxiety with direct questions for the diagnostic criteria for severe health&#xD;
      anxiety in a telephone interview performed by a blinded second rater and specialist in&#xD;
      psychiatry. Right after this telephone interview MS will see the patients in the clinic as a&#xD;
      conclusion of the treatment and a possibility for the patient to be referred to further&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic treatment, if it is indicated by a comorbid mental disorder and wanted by&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed by means of various self-reporting health measures reported&#xD;
      online (Survey Xact); before clinical assessment (after telephone interview including verbal&#xD;
      consent) (SCAN and SCID-II), 14 days before group start (baseline), at the end of treatment,&#xD;
      and 3, 6 and 24 months after end of treatment (see attached Flowchart Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dimensions and traits of personality are assessed at baseline by the questionnaire&#xD;
      Personality Inventory for DSM-V (PID-5) [52] developed for DSM-V, where it is being included&#xD;
      in the Appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 months after end of treatment the patients are clinical assessed for severe HA by a&#xD;
      telephone interview from a blinded second rater (Cure is defined here as either no diagnosis&#xD;
      of severe HA or a WI-7 score&lt;21,4 6 months after end of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of health care services and sick days from a period of 9 months preceding treatment and 6&#xD;
      months after end of treatment are drawn from relevant registers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6. online questionnaire will be send to all patients at 2 years follow-up. Most patients&#xD;
      have here received the short term group-CBT. Some of the patients have afterwards also&#xD;
      received long term psychotherapeutic treatment for their comorbid personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the control groups will be offered the group CBT immediately after answering&#xD;
      the 6 month follow-up questionnaire of the RCT (no. 5), which then also functions as their&#xD;
      baseline questionnaire. The patients in the control groups are then also given this&#xD;
      questionnaire no. 5 again 9 month after (Their 6 month follow-up from the group CBT). The&#xD;
      patients in the control group are then given one more questionnaire than the RCT treatment&#xD;
      group then a total of 7 questionnaires for the 24 month follow-up prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patients have given written informed consent, they are put on a wait-list for block&#xD;
      randomization until there is a total of 14 patients. When 14 patients have answered the 2.&#xD;
      online questionnaire, they are randomized to 2 groups; group therapy (n=7), starting shortly&#xD;
      after randomization, or wait-list (n=7) with an offer to start group therapy after 9 months.&#xD;
      Patients are randomized by means of a computer algorithm that use predefined concealed random&#xD;
      numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group CBT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are treated in groups of 7 by 2 therapists, that are either medical doctors,&#xD;
      psychologists, psychomotoric or nurses trained in cognitive behaviour therapy and experienced&#xD;
      in treating patients with HA with CBT. 2 teams of therapists (4 therapists) deliver the&#xD;
      treatment, and MS only take part as a therapist if necessary. The therapists are during the&#xD;
      project supervised regularly from an external psychologist. The group therapy includes 12&#xD;
      weekly meetings of 3 hours excl. a 15 minutes break and a booster-meeting of 3 hours&#xD;
      delivered 3 month after end of treatment. The treatment follows a written manual for each&#xD;
      meeting, which is given to the patients at the first meeting. The treatment and manual&#xD;
      generally consists of the CBT elements of goal setting, psychoeducation, symptom&#xD;
      registration, relaxation training, stress management, cognitive restructuring including&#xD;
      individual designed behavioural experiments, response prevention, exposure, relapse&#xD;
      prevention and homework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of therapist competencies and adherence to the manual all group-CBT is&#xD;
      video-recorded, and app. 5% of the essential material is assessed by a blinded rater. The&#xD;
      therapist satisfaction with the group-CBT is rated with a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care group&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the diagnostic assessment and after randomization, patients, referring doctors, and&#xD;
      family physicians are informed in writing about the diagnosis, in the same way as for the&#xD;
      patients randomized for group CBT. But here the patient has been put in the group for usual&#xD;
      care with the offer to receive group CBT after 9 months. This group CBT will not be part of&#xD;
      the primary research project (RCT), but it still takes place at The Liaison Psychiatric&#xD;
      Clinic in Koege. Patients in the usual care group receive a letter stating that they have&#xD;
      been randomized to 9-month with usual care, and in this period they continue usual care by&#xD;
      their other health care providers. The patients in the usual care group are followed-up by&#xD;
      questionnaires in the same way as the patients randomized to group CBT (see attached&#xD;
      flowchart Figure 1). For details regarding timing and characteristics of treatment elements&#xD;
      delivered in the group CBT see attached Figure 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop-outs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients that drop-out (after inclusion) are followed-up by questionnaires in the same&#xD;
      way as the patients randomized to either group CBT or wait-list. This is done for intention&#xD;
      to treat analysis. Also these patients are telephoned to examine reasons for drop-out.&#xD;
      Attending in less than 8 of the total 13 treatment meetings is also defined as drop-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors of outcome (start outcome measures and diagnostic assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. +/- Comorbid personality disorder (PD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The degree of comorbid PD (number of significant traits (SCID-II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The degree of comorbid PD (total score on PID-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The degree of comorbid PD (number of PD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Duration of comorbid PD (age-18)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Type(s) of comorbid PD&#xD;
&#xD;
           Confounders (predictors/mediators) of outcome (pretreatment if not defined)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patient activity in group-CBT (attendance in meetings (objective), homework&#xD;
           (subjective))&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patient group-destructiveness (devaluation, expressed emotions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Therapists CBT-competencies and adherence to the treatment manual. (A blinded rater on&#xD;
           essential 5% of the total videorecordings)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Comorbid mental disorders (somatic symptom disorder (BDS), anxiety disorders (Panic&#xD;
           disorder, GAD or OCD) or depressive disorders (HA is primary and dominant)&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Duration of comorbid mental disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Degree of Health anxiety (WI-7)&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Duration of HA (chronicity&gt;3 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Illness perception&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Global functioning (objective) GAF-F&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. Global functioning (subjective) SF-36&#xD;

&#xD;
       20. Other treatments during group-CBT or follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
       21. Sociodemographic variables (age, sex, network (also partner), education, employment,&#xD;
           economy, home, material goods, concurring litigation, interests/activities)&#xD;
&#xD;
       22. Expectations and satisfaction with the treatment along the full course of the treatment&#xD;
           in the clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of sufficient treatment: Sufficient treatment demands attendance to group-CBT&#xD;
      meetings in at least 8 meetings out of 13 meetings in total. If less attendance occurs, the&#xD;
      patient is defined as drop-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health anxiety is costly for the social and health care system and cause suffering and&#xD;
      disability for the patients. This study will hopefully form the basis of an effective and&#xD;
      evidence-based group therapy for patients with impairing health anxiety and thereby help&#xD;
      increase the patients' quality of life and functional level and reduce social and health care&#xD;
      costs. As more general practitioners are trained in cognitive behaviour therapy and Shared&#xD;
      Care is introduced into primary care, elements of this developed group-CBT can be used for&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of patients with lesser degree of HA in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of patients for the pilot-study will begin primo 2013. The 2 pilot-groups will be&#xD;
      conducted in 2013. Patient inclusion to the RCT will begin primo 2014 and end in 2015&#xD;
      depending on referrals. The rate of referrals is expected to be 4 patients a month. Treatment&#xD;
      groups are expected to run during a course of approx. 2 years. In the same period the PhD&#xD;
      student will participate in teaching, training and courses. In 2016 the last patients will be&#xD;
      followed up, and data will be analyzed and interpreted, and papers to relevant journals will&#xD;
      be written. Please see the enclosed time schedule for the three-year PhD program (Figure 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2 years follow-up assessment (prospective cohort study) will not be a part of the PhD&#xD;
      study, but MS is responsible for this study also. The responsibility of the RCT study of&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and illness perception lies with other researchers mentioned as&#xD;
      collaborators and named specifically under the relevant planned articles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be analysed and published according to the Consort statement [58].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power calculation is based on change in Whiteley-7 scores (scale 0-100). An uncertainty&#xD;
      of the change in Whiteley-7 scores of 25 is estimated from a pilot study and other randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials [11,15,61]. A sample size of 70 was estimated to provide 84.9% power, at&#xD;
      the 5% significance level, to find a difference in mean reductions in Whiteley-7 scores from&#xD;
      baseline to 6 month follow-up of the size 20 and allowing for a drop-out rate of 20% in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant statistical methods for group comparison will be applied, including multiple&#xD;
      regression. In the data analysis, both &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; analyses and analyses of the&#xD;
      clinic's existing data will be performed. There will be applied multiple imputations of&#xD;
      missing outcomes. A statistician is involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also be registered in an international database for clinical trials&#xD;
      (www.clinicaltrials.gov))&#xD;
