      This study is being done to measure the differences between the electrical activity of&#xD;
      muscles and /single muscle fibers in individuals with long-term spinal cord injury and&#xD;
      neurologically intact individuals without spinal cord injury. This study is also being done&#xD;
      to find out if muscle and /single muscle fiber electrical activity, voluntary strength,&#xD;
      reflex measurements, and/or spasms are changed after a single, oral dose of three commonly&#xD;
      prescribed drugs, Rilutek®, isradipine, and Namenda®. These medications are approved by the&#xD;
      FDA for treatment of disorders other than the control of spasms and strength. In this study,&#xD;
      they are being used in an experimental manner. Finally, this study is also being done to find&#xD;
      out whether or not a brief stretching exercise influences reflex measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this study is that aberrant current activity in spinal motoneurons&#xD;
      contributes to spastic hyper-reflexia following chronic spinal cord injury.&#xD;

      Background/Rationale/Literature Review&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyper-reflexia, spasms and loss of motor coordination are common impairments in individuals&#xD;
      with SCI. Though not thoroughly understood, recent studies suggest that persistent inward&#xD;
      currents (PICs) in motoneurons play an important role in generating hyper-reflexia and&#xD;
      involuntary spasms (Gorassini et al. 2004; Nickolls et al. 2004; Norton et al. 2008; Thomas&#xD;
      et al. 2002). Animal models of chronic spinal cord injury point further to the differential&#xD;
      involvement of increased sodium and calcium PICs in prolonged reflexes associated with&#xD;
      spasticity (Harvey et al. 2006; Li and Bennett 2003; Li et al. 2004a; Li et al. 2004c). In&#xD;
      addition, oral administration of the drug Rilutek®, a selective, progressive persistent&#xD;
      sodium current inhibitor, has been shown to decrease flexion withdrawal responses in&#xD;
      individuals with chronic SCI (Theiss et al. 2008), presumably because of the reduction of&#xD;
      persistent sodium currents in participating neurons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the loss of descending cortical drive, monoaminergic input to the spinal cord&#xD;
      is also often disrupted in SCI. As hypothesized by Jacobs and Fornal (Jacobs and Fornal 1993;&#xD;
      Jacobs et al. 2002), serotonin acts to facilitate motor output and inhibit sensory input.&#xD;
      Removal of monoaminergic input in humans may therefore lead to motor weakness and&#xD;
      hyperexcitable reflexes resulting in impaired motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to changes in facilitative or inhibitory modulation of spinal circuits, loss of&#xD;
      descending monoaminergic input may also change the intrinsic excitability of the spinal&#xD;
      neurons themselves. Following complete spinal transection, studies of electrical properties&#xD;
      of spinal neurons below the lesion reveal that initially, interneurons, especially in the&#xD;
      dorsal horn, become hyperexcitable, whereas motoneuron excitability plummets. In the&#xD;
      motoneuron, a key factor in this drastic decrease is a loss of persistent inward currents&#xD;
      (PICs). Persistent currents are conductances that, once activated, do not turn off, or at&#xD;
      least inactivate at an extremely slow rate. PICs have a profound effect on the excitability&#xD;
      of spinal neurons, both amplifying and prolonging their input (Prescott and De Koninck 2005)&#xD;
      and allowing them to produce long lasting outputs, plateau potentials and bistable behavior&#xD;
      (Heckman et al. 2005; Hounsgaard et al. 1984; Lee and Heckman 1998). The loss of PICs has&#xD;
      such a strong impact that motoneurons produce only brief and weak outputs to the&#xD;
      hyperexcitable interneuron inputs (Baldissera et al. 1981; Heckman 1994; Kehne et al. 1985;&#xD;
      Nygren and Olson 1976).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal models of chronic injury, however, motoneuronal PICs return (Li and Bennett 2003;&#xD;
      Li et al. 2004a), restoring the ability of motoneurons to produce sustained output in&#xD;
      response to synaptic input. The return of motoneuronal PICs, which allows motoneurons to&#xD;
      fully recover their ability to produce sustained output in response to synaptic input,&#xD;
      coincides with the appearance of spasticity (Li et al. 2004b). In addition, blocking these&#xD;
      PICs and long-lasting plateau potentials inhibits spastic behavior (Bennett et al. 2001a; Li&#xD;
      et al. 2004a). To summarize, in the animal model of the chronic SCI condition, motoneurons&#xD;
      demonstrate remarkable recovery of PICs, which likely play a major role in transmitting&#xD;
      synaptic reflex inputs that generate spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies in animal models have shown that NaP is essential for the production of&#xD;
      rhythmic firing to sustained or slowly rising inputs, such as the action potential&#xD;
      afterhyperpolarization (AHP) (Kuo et al. 2006; Lee and Heckman 2001). Blocking NaP with&#xD;
      riluzole decreases repetitive-firing capabilities (Harvey et al. 2006; Kuo et al. 2006; Kuo&#xD;
      et al. 2005; Ptak et al. 2005; Theiss et al. 2007; Urbani and Belluzzi 2000) and reduces gain&#xD;
      accompanied by a rightward bias shift in the input-output relation (Kuo et al. 2006; Theiss&#xD;
      et al. 2007), which is indicative of an increase in input needed to initiate output. In&#xD;
      addition, NaP amplifies and prolongs depolarization responses to brief stimuli (Prescott and&#xD;
      De Koninck 2005). CaP, such as the L-type calcium current, are responsible for plateau&#xD;
      potentials, which are a sustained depolarization following cessation of current input&#xD;
      (Hounsgaard and Kiehn 1989; Morisset and Nagy 1999; Russo and Hounsgaard 1996; Voisin and&#xD;
      Nagy 2001). In addition, CaP contributes to prolongation of depolarizing responses to brief&#xD;
      stimuli (Prescott and De Koninck 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In human studies, firing patterns in single motor units from chronic SCI subjects have shown&#xD;
      differences in rate modulation (Thomas and Ross 1997), force-speed relations (Thomas et al.&#xD;
      1997), increases in discharge variability (Thomas et al. 2002), and prolonged duration of&#xD;
      post-synaptic potentials in response to transient inputs using the PSF technique (Norton et&#xD;
      al. 2008). These phenomena, especially those reflecting prolonged involuntary muscle activity&#xD;
      in response to short duration stimuli, have been attributed to the presence of PICs in&#xD;
      motoneurons. Recent results from Theiss (project co-investigator) et al. (2008) have also&#xD;
      shown that administration of pharmacological agents that reduce PICs, e.g. riluzole, (which&#xD;
      reduces NaP), decreases the flexion-withdrawal response in such a way that mimics the effects&#xD;
      of riluzole seen in animal models. These are a right-ward bias shift and gain decrease in the&#xD;
      input-output relation of animal spinal neurons (Kuo et al. 2006; Theiss et al. 2007).&#xD;
      Interestingly, riluzole administration also enhanced agonist specificity in voluntary torque&#xD;
      production by decreasing co-contraction and increasing total torque area during a maximum&#xD;
      voluntary contraction (Theiss et al. 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several pharmacological agents that artificially reduce PICs in animal spinal neurons are&#xD;
      available for human use. Riluzole, a specific, progressive NaP current inhibitor (Ptak et al.&#xD;
      2005; Urbani and Belluzzi 2000) has been proposed as a promising neuroprotective treatment&#xD;
      for acute SCI (Baptiste and Fehlings 2006; Fehlings and Baptiste 2005; Hawryluk et al. 2008;&#xD;
      Schwartz and Fehlings 2002). CaP current blockers, such as nimodipine, (Harvey et al. 2006;&#xD;
      Li and Bennett 2003), have also been tested as a potential treatment in acute SCI to reduce&#xD;
      neuronal excitability (Fehlings and Baptiste 2005; Pointillart et al. 2000; Winkler et al.&#xD;
      2003). Isradipine, a channel-specific CaP current blocker (Fitton and Benfield 1990), has&#xD;
      been proposed as a preventative and acute treatment for Parkinson's disease (Surmeier 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, with the exception of investigations by Theiss (project co-investigator) and&#xD;
      colleagues on the effects of riluzole and isradipine on flexion-withdrawal response and&#xD;
      changes in volitional strength (Theiss et al. 2008, Theiss et al, 2011), the effects of&#xD;
      either agent on motor function, spasms, spasticity and motor unit firing behaviors in chronic&#xD;
      SCI have not been systematically studied. As studies by Theiss et al. (2008, 2011) have&#xD;
      shown, they provide a safe mechanism to examine contributions of intrinsic neuronal currents&#xD;
      to motor impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in animal models have also shown that NMDA-mediated currents have a role in the&#xD;
      production of spastic reflexes in chronic SCI (Bennett et al, 2001b). These currents have&#xD;
      been discussed as another possible contributor to prolonged spasms in human chronic SCI as&#xD;
      well (Norton et al, 2008). Taking these additional studies into account, an additional aim is&#xD;
      to expand our study to include preliminary investigation of a possible contribution of&#xD;
      post-synaptic NMDA-mediated currents to spinal neuron excitability and hyperexcitable&#xD;
      reflexes in chronic SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, muscle stretching is a commonly used, therapist-recommended clinical intervention&#xD;
      for reducing the negative impact of spasticity on motor function (Smania et al 2010, Harvey &amp;&#xD;
      Herbert 2002). As much as seven hours per week of therapy time is spent on stretching&#xD;
      (Taylor-Schroeder et al 2011) and 27-41% of persons with SCI who undergo inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation (Zanca et al 2011) report that they stretch as part of their rehabilitation&#xD;
      program. However, there is no conclusive evidence at present that shows that stretching&#xD;
      influences reflex excitability in persons with spinal cord injury (Bovend'Eerdt et al 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Key Questions, Research Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to investigate the contribution of sodium and calcium&#xD;
      persistent inward currents (PICs) towards mediating the hyper-reflexia and motor control&#xD;
      impairments seen in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) using targeted pharmacological agents.&#xD;
      This study will test the hypothesis that aberrant current activity in spinal motoneurons&#xD;
      contributes to spastic hyper-reflexia following chronic spinal cord injury. Three specific&#xD;
      aims are proposed to evaluate this hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to investigate the key features that distinguish spastic muscle in chronic spinal cord&#xD;
           injured individuals from that of spinally intact controls by assessing differences in&#xD;
           single motor unit firing patterns and time course of responses to transient and&#xD;
           sustained reflex inputs, as well as during voluntary control, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to dissect the relative impact of persistent sodium and persistent calcium conductances&#xD;
           underlying the differences between spastic and non-spastic muscles by assessing changes&#xD;
           in single motor unit firing patterns and time course following oral administration of&#xD;
           Rilutek®, a persistent sodium current inhibitor, and isradipine, a persistent calcium&#xD;
           current blocker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to investigate the impact of NMDA-mediated post-synaptic currents on the differences&#xD;
           between spastic and non-spastic muscles by assessing changes in single motor unit firing&#xD;
           patterns and reflex excitability following oral administration of memantine (Namenda®),&#xD;
           a drug that decreases NMDA currents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional objective of this study is to investigate the effects of a brief intermittent&#xD;
      muscle elongation procedure on reflex excitability by testing reflex responses before and&#xD;
      after a stretching intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Purpose All procedures in this study are for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will advance the understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying hyperactive&#xD;
      reflexes and loss of motor control in chronic SCI. Though not proposed as treatment agents at&#xD;
      this stage, the pharmacological PIC antagonists and NMDA antagonist used in this study are&#xD;
      intended as tools to understand the mechanisms of hyperexcitability. Therapeutically, the&#xD;
      ability to manipulate neuronal excitability (e.g. to increase specificity in volitional&#xD;
      strength or decrease hyper-reflexia) may lead to more effective treatments. Riluzole and&#xD;
      isradipine provide artificial, yet specific, control of PICs. Memantine also provides a&#xD;
      degree of control of synaptic NMDA-mediated post-synaptic currents. Understanding the&#xD;
      cellular mechanisms of SCI impairments and their modulation may identify novel approaches to&#xD;
      control spinal neuron excitability and provide appropriate tailoring of pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments specific to the attributes of an individual's spasticity and impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also add to existing knowledge about the physiological effects of a commonly&#xD;
      used yet with limited evidence base therapeutic intervention for reducing the negative&#xD;
      impacts of reflex hyperexcitability on motor function in SCI.&#xD;
