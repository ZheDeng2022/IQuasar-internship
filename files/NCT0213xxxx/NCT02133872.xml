  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HTN) is the single most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Recent American Heart Association (AHA) statistics&#xD;
      indicate that one-third of all adults in the United States of America suffer from HTN.&#xD;
      Despite advances in life style modification and multi-drug therapies, 20-30% of all&#xD;
      hypertensive patients remain resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These individuals exhibit autonomic dysregulation due to elevated sympathetic activity and&#xD;
      norepinephrine spillover, and low parasympathetic activity. It is generally accepted that&#xD;
      this uncontrolled, resistant HTN is primarily &quot;neurogenic&quot; in origin, involving over activity&#xD;
      of the sympathetic nervous system that initiates and sustains HTN. A surgical approach such&#xD;
      as the recently developed &quot;Simplicity Catheter&quot; assisted renal denervation remains one of the&#xD;
      few options available to these patients. Thus, a mechanism-based breakthrough is imperative&#xD;
      to develop novel strategies to prevent and perhaps eventually cure neurogenic hypertension&#xD;
      (NH). This study is designed to evaluate a low and high dose of minocycline to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that minocycline treatment would produce antihypertensive effects in&#xD;
      drug-resistant neurogenic hypertensive individuals. Minocycline has been selected because of&#xD;
      its demonstrated effects on inhibiting microglial activation and its ability to penetrate the&#xD;
      blood brain barrier. There is no other compound available that is safer and displays&#xD;
      specificity better than Minocycline in inhibiting microglial activation. Thus, the potential&#xD;
      therapeutic benefits of this inexpensive, well tolerated, already FDA-approved drug that has&#xD;
      minimal side effects would be enormous.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred seventy-five (175) subjects who will be randomized to receive either Minocycline&#xD;
      100 mg or 200 mg b.i.d. (twice a day). At baseline, subjects will undergo blood tests (lipid&#xD;
      panel, high sensitivity-C reactive protein, high sensitivity troponin, glucose, metabolic&#xD;
      profile, lipid panel, Cystatin C, albumin and flow cytometry). Peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells will be isolated and used to generate human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)&#xD;
      which will be used for further mechanism studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment of the first two patients and observing a marked reduction in blood pressure&#xD;
      the blind was broken and patients were on active therapy. Because these patients had CVD, for&#xD;
      safety reasons recruitment was halted and the protocol design was modified to an open-label&#xD;
      design of dose titration for each participant beginning at 50 mg/day of minocycline,&#xD;
      escalating to 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day if the primary outcome measure of ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor (ABPM) =/&gt; to 5 mmHg decrease in mean daytime SBP was not achieved. If&#xD;
      patients responded, participation was completed. This revised protocol was resubmitted to the&#xD;
      IRB and approved on 1/6/16. An interim analysis was planned after 40 patients completed the&#xD;
      revised protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to blood collection, a physical exam will be conducted and office systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and pulse pressure (PP) will be recorded.&#xD;
      Patients will be fitted with an ABPM system. Patients will wear the ABPM for 24 hours at&#xD;
      which point they will mail the monitor back to research personnel. At this visit, the study&#xD;
      drug will be dispensed and patients will be instructed to start the study medication after&#xD;
      completing the 24- hour ABPM monitoring period. After this visit, patients will be asked to&#xD;
      return every month till the end of the study at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly visits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 month visits), will include a brief physical examination&#xD;
      and an assessment of medication compliance and tolerance. One tablespoon of blood will be&#xD;
      drawn for flow cytometry analysis, selected cytokines, markers of gut permeability including&#xD;
      zonulin, and iPSCs isolation at the baseline, 3 and 6 month visit only. Study drug will be&#xD;
      dispensed and measurement of SBP, DBP, PP and other vital signs will also be completed.&#xD;
      Office BP readings will be taken in a seated position after 5 minutes of rest according to&#xD;
      Joint National Committee VII Guidelines. At baseline, BP will be measured at each arm, and&#xD;
      the arm with the higher BP will be used for all subsequent readings. Averages of the&#xD;
      triplicate measures will be calculated and used for analysis. At baseline and each followup&#xD;
      visit, patients will be asked to wear the ABPM for 24 hours. Subjects will mail the cuff back&#xD;
      to research personnel when completed. ABPM will be performed using an oscillometric Spacelabs&#xD;
      90207 monitor (Spacelabs Healthcare, Issaqua, WA) with readings taken every 30 minutes in&#xD;
      daytime and every 60 minutes at nighttime. ABPM readings will be averaged for, daytime and&#xD;
      nighttime. Patients will be assessed while adhering to their usual diurnal activity and&#xD;
      nocturnal sleep routine. The antihypertensive drugs, and their doses, used at each visit will&#xD;
      be recorded on standardized forms along with any reports of adverse experiences known to&#xD;
      occur with the drugs used (e.g. lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients respond to treatment, by protocol defined drop in daytime ABPM and/or the need&#xD;
      for down titration of hypertensive therapy they will be considered a responder, complete the&#xD;
      final visit and complete study participation. At the final visit, the same blood tests at&#xD;
      baseline will be repeated. When the patients complete the 6 months of treatment or are&#xD;
      considered a responder at a lower dose, they will come in for their final visit, and return&#xD;
      the ABPM monitor, their participation in the trial will be considered as complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of responders and nonresponders were sent to Montreal as part of IRB201500594 -N to&#xD;
      carry out novel brain imaging of sympathetic centers, and perform autonomic testing.&#xD;
