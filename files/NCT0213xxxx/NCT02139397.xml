      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an investigational drug (DFMO) in&#xD;
      combination with bortezomib, for relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma. DFMO is an&#xD;
      investigational drug because it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA). This study will look at the safety and tolerability of DFMO in&#xD;
      combination with bortezomib as well as the tumors response to this study drug.&#xD;
