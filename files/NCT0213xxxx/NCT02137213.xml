    <textblock>
      At least 30% of patients receiving methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) are suffering from&#xD;
      constipation that often affects effectiveness of MMT and increases its impact on health care&#xD;
      system. Existing treatments include several over-the-counter medications which do not target&#xD;
      the pathobiological basis of opioid-induced constipation and have limited effectiveness. At&#xD;
      the same time well-known medication, naloxone, was already shown to help with constipation in&#xD;
      patients receiving methadone for chronic pain, but was never tried in patients receiving&#xD;
      methadone for opioid dependence. This study is aimed to try naloxone for treatment of&#xD;
      opioid-induced constipation in MMT settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 20 patients receiving MMT and suffering from opioid-induced&#xD;
      constipation. The study has a crossover design - all patients will receive one week of their&#xD;
      regular methadone doses and one week of their regular methadone doses with naloxone added.&#xD;
      Normal saline will be added to methadone-only formulations as placebo. Order of the weeks&#xD;
      will be chosen randomly. Both subjects and investigators will be blinded to the study&#xD;
      condition (i.e. whether naloxone or normal saline is added to methadone preparation on a&#xD;
      given week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: Patients receiving combination of oral methadone/naloxone in ratio 50:1&#xD;
      will have less severe symptoms of constipation compared to those receiving methadone only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis: Addition of oral naloxone to methadone in a ratio 50:1 will not cause&#xD;
      clinically significant opioid withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;

      Background and rationale Opioid-induced constipation is the most common side effect of opioid&#xD;
      therapy - depending on the settings up to 90% of patients taking opioids experience&#xD;
      constipation with the most conservative estimate among MMT patients being 30%. Currently, the&#xD;
      recommended treatment for opioid-induced constipation includes a combination of stool&#xD;
      softeners, stimulants and osmotic laxatives - increased gastrointestinal secretions result in&#xD;
      increased volume and softness of fecal masses, and more intense peristalsis promotes bowel&#xD;
      voiding. The effectiveness of existing treatments for opioid-induced constipation is limited&#xD;
      - they are effective in approximately 50% of cases, often have side effects such as abdominal&#xD;
      cramping and diarrhea and, most importantly, do not address the pathobiological basis of&#xD;
      opioid-induced constipation. Opioids in general and methadone in particular act on peripheral&#xD;
      opioid receptors located in myenteric and submucosal plexus and cause relaxation of&#xD;
      longitudinal and increased tone of inner circular smooth muscles as well as decreased&#xD;
      gastrointestinal secretions that in turn result in constipation. The most logical therapeutic&#xD;
      approach to the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in MMT would be using opioids that&#xD;
      cause selective local reversal of μ-opioid activation with a peripherally-acting opioid&#xD;
      antagonist such as naloxone, which when administered orally does not have systemic effects&#xD;
      due to extremely low oral bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of&#xD;
      methadone and naloxone in 50:1 for treatment of opioid-induced constipation in MMT patients.&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to assess the likelihood of development of opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms in MMT patients who receive combination of methadone and naloxone&#xD;
      compared to those who receive methadone only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Study has a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design: following signing&#xD;
      informed consent and initial assessment 20 subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two groups: group A will receive combination of methadone and naloxone&#xD;
      in a ratio of 50:1 shown to be safe and effective in other trials during week 1 of the study&#xD;
      and methadone only during week 2 of the study. Group B will receive methadone only during&#xD;
      week 1 of the study and combination of methadone and naloxone in a ratio of 50:1 during week&#xD;
      2 of the study. Thus, all participants will receive combination of methadone and naloxone for&#xD;
      one week and methadone alone for one week. Neither study participants, nor the pharmacists&#xD;
      observing the doses, nor study personnel will know if naloxone is added to subjects'&#xD;
      methadone preparations. Allocation to Group A or Group B will be done by random assignment.&#xD;
      The pharmacy research medication management service will prepare the randomization code such&#xD;
      that there will be a balanced assignment after every 4 subjects. Bowel functioning will be&#xD;
      assessed quantitatively primarily using the Bowel Function Index (BFI) at initial assessment&#xD;
      and at the end of weeks one (day 8) and two of the study (day 15). Also data on the number of&#xD;
      complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs), their temporal relationship to medication&#xD;
      administration and outcome will be collected every day prior to administration of the next&#xD;
      dose of methadone. In addition to parameters of bowel functioning Subjective Opiate&#xD;
      Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) will be administered daily in order to assess potential opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods/Data Analysis Primary endpoint of the study is the reduction of&#xD;
      constipation symptoms severity as measured by the difference between BFI scores taken after&#xD;
      one week of receiving combination of methadone and naloxone and after one week of receiving&#xD;
      methadone only. Secondary endpoint of the study is the occurrence of opioid withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms as measured by the difference between the mean SOWS scores taken daily during each&#xD;
      of two weeks of the study. Paired t-test will be used to compare BFI and mean number of CSBMs&#xD;
      between the weeks of treatment with a combination of methadone and naloxone and methadone&#xD;
      alone as well as to compare average SOWS scores between the weeks of treatment with a&#xD;
      combination of methadone and naloxone and methadone alone.&#xD;
