      Insight, or lack of illness awareness, is a prominent and pressing clinical concern in the&#xD;
      treatment and recovery of patients with psychotic disorders. Impaired insight results in poor&#xD;
      treatment engagement and adherence, more frequent hospitalizations, greater positive and&#xD;
      negative symptoms, and poor psychosocial functioning. Addressing these complications early in&#xD;
      the disease process may lead to altered illness course with better outcomes. To date, only a&#xD;
      small number of nonpharmacological interventions have been developed, none of which&#xD;
      adequately address poor insight during the first few years of psychotic illness. Further,&#xD;
      presently available therapeutic interventions do not attend to difficulties associated with&#xD;
      improved insight, such as depression. The purpose of this investigation is to implement a&#xD;
      novel intervention designed to improve insight, metacognition, neurocognition, symptoms, and&#xD;
      ultimately overall functioning in persons with early psychosis. The novel intervention will&#xD;
      integrate a number of previously established therapeutic approaches, such as metacognitive,&#xD;
      narrative, cognitive behavioral and motivational interviewing, and hence be labeled&#xD;
      Integrated Metacognitive Therapy (IMT). In order to measure the efficacy of IMT, all subjects&#xD;
      will undergo a battery of assessments in each of these domains prior to and following either&#xD;
      a novel intervention (N = 10) or treatment as usual (N = 10) for a period of approximately&#xD;
      six months. Throughout the study, each IMT session (N = 10, 24 sessions each) will be audio&#xD;
      recorded, transcribed, and de-identified to allow for careful ongoing qualitative analyses of&#xD;
      potential active and inert ingredients of the approach and ultimately the development of an&#xD;
      IMT manual which can then be tested in a larger, more rigorous randomized control trial. This&#xD;
      investigation will play an important role in advancing current knowledge about treating&#xD;
      insight in early psychosis. Further, it will serve to expand upon the intervention tools&#xD;
      available by producing a much needed treatment manual designed specifically to target insight&#xD;
      during an illness phase crucial for positive long term outcomes in psychosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Advisory Mental Health Council recently called for the development of&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatments that identify and target specific disease processes for&#xD;
      clinical improvement in schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses. One such illness&#xD;
      process, vital for positive outcomes, is impaired awareness of illness or insight. Insight is&#xD;
      often thought of as factual knowledge and acknowledgement of one's illness. More&#xD;
      specifically, insight in psychosis has been conceptualized as a multi-dimensional construct,&#xD;
      with several independent but overlapping dimensions, such as the ability to appropriately&#xD;
      label aberrant mental events (e.g. hallucinations and delusions), recognition of illness, and&#xD;
      willingness to engage in treatment. Relative to individuals with other mental illnesses,&#xD;
      those with psychotic illness have the most impaired insight, presenting a number of&#xD;
      challenges, including: poor treatment engagement and adherence, more frequent&#xD;
      hospitalizations, greater positive and negative symptoms, and poor psychosocial functioning.&#xD;
      This problem is particularly relevant in early phases of psychotic illness, where there&#xD;
      remains a paucity of data. Data that is available has shown decreased insight is associated&#xD;
      with increased symptoms and poorer cognitive functioning, both of which have the potential to&#xD;
      impact illness course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two reasons account for a lack of attention to the development of treatments for insight: i)&#xD;
      the lack of an adequate model of the forces which cause and sustain poor insight and ii) a&#xD;
      failure to consider an integrated treatment. Without an idea of the processes which sustain&#xD;
      poor insight, interventions have been able to offer education about the nature of illness but&#xD;
      have not been equipped to respond to the underlying processes that block the emergence of&#xD;
      insight in treatment. While earlier literature framed insight as a failure to grasp a&#xD;
      specific fact, more recent efforts suggest poor insight is primarily the result of a failure&#xD;
      to create a coherent account of the complex events and personal experiences related to a&#xD;
      psychiatric illness. These difficulties becoming aware of one's illness may be&#xD;
      multi-determined and result from factors including deficits in metacognition, neurocognition,&#xD;
      and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of insight is complex and highly dependent upon metacognitive processes,&#xD;
      which have a unique, potentially moderating role. Metacognition involves a range of faculties&#xD;
      that allow an individual to form representations of mental states of self and others, which&#xD;
      then leads to the formation and revision of thoughts, beliefs, feelings, behaviors, and even&#xD;
      individual aspirations. Therapies targeting metacognitive or mentalizing deficits have been&#xD;
      successfully implemented for personality disorders, depression and anxiety. In psychotic&#xD;
      disorders, decreased metacognitive capacity is thought to result in difficulties identifying&#xD;
      the source of one's experiences, such as illness and its consequences. This leads to an&#xD;
      inability to perceive the self as an active agent in the world and problems in understanding&#xD;
      and acting upon the social cues (emotions and intentions) of others. A recently proposed&#xD;
      Integrated Metacognitive therapeutic approach argues that insight will improve as an&#xD;
      individual utilizes a constructed narrative to make sense of his or her experiences. In other&#xD;
      words, illness and its consequences are understood in an individualized, personally relevant&#xD;
      and acceptable way. Importantly, this approach addresses many obstacles to gaining insight&#xD;
      not addressed by other approaches, including learning to deal with related emotional pain and&#xD;
      depression, loss, and internalized stigma. This view is also consistent with intervention&#xD;
      research showing that establishment of personal meaning is important for recovery, and&#xD;
      promotes improved function and reduced symptoms. Case studies from our group and others have&#xD;
      provided evidence that therapy targeting metacognitive processes is feasible in psychotic&#xD;
      disorders and can indeed improve insight and function in persons with chronic schizophrenia.&#xD;
      However, this approach has not been tailored to target insight, evaluated or tested in&#xD;
      patients in the early phase of psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to metacognitive deficits, neurocognitive deficits have also been commonly&#xD;
      observed in schizophrenia and involve decrements in capacities for attention/vigilance,&#xD;
      verbal memory and executive function. Deficits in executive function have been found to&#xD;
      predict concurrent and prospective assessments of poorer insight, spurring hypotheses that&#xD;
      impairments in executive function leave persons unable to synthesize illness related&#xD;
      experiences into a coherent and adequate story about how and why they are ill. Deficits in&#xD;
      attention and memory may additionally obscure how historical events are connected to each&#xD;
      other. As a whole, neurocognitive deficits may cause difficulties piecing together the&#xD;
      individual's experience of illness into a coherent whole resulting in poor insight.&#xD;
      Therefore, development of personal narratives using an integrated therapy would allow&#xD;
      subjects the opportunity to better understand their illness experience, hence improving&#xD;
      insight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research presented above suggests that improving insight early in the psychotic disease&#xD;
      process would likely result in improved treatment participation, ultimately leading to better&#xD;
      outcomes. Motivated by a clear and pressing need to better address illness insight in early&#xD;
      psychotic illness and recent positive findings related to doing so, the present investigation&#xD;
      serves to test a novel Integrated Metacognitive Therapy (IMT) which targets insight and other&#xD;
      important domains in early psychosis. Assuming IMT is successful, ongoing qualitative&#xD;
      analysis of IMT sessions will allow for manual development, future randomized control trials,&#xD;
      and ultimately treatment dissemination.&#xD;
