    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The side effects of BAY1129980 when given every 21 days different dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the dose level of BAY1129980 that should be tested in future clinical research&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure how much BAY1129980 is in the blood at specific times after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If treatment with BAY1129980 shows any effect on reducing the tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there are specific biomarkers that might be able to explain why some patients respond&#xD;
           to treatment and others do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If treatment with BAY1129980 causes an immune response from the body against the drug&#xD;
           (immunogenicity).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relatively restricted C4.4a expression pattern provides a target for the selective&#xD;
      delivery of a cytotoxic drug to C4.4.a-expressing tumor cells by means of a suitable&#xD;
      antibody-drug conjugate. The subject population eligible for the current study will be those&#xD;
      subjects with advanced malignancies known to express C4.4a, which are refractory to standard&#xD;
      therapy or those without standard therapy or actively refusing any treatment, which would be&#xD;
      regarded as standard and in whom, in the opinion of the investigator, experimental therapy&#xD;
      with BAY1129980 may be beneficial.Depending on the number of dose-escalating steps and the&#xD;
      occurrence of DLTs, the planned numbers of subjects could vary.It is expected that up to 90&#xD;
      subjects may participate in the dose-expansion phase of the study and up to 6-9 subjects may&#xD;
      particpate in the dose re-esclation phase.The study assessments in the expansion phase of the&#xD;
      study are identical to those in the dose-escalation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendment # 3 includes changes to DLT criteria (hematological and non-hematological) and&#xD;
      allows for frequent follow-up for subjects experiencing drug-related liver toxicity that&#xD;
      warrants dose reduction or dose interruptions.&#xD;
