      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a course of chiropractic treatment has a&#xD;
      significant impact on the natural course of infantile colic, specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do parents of colicky infants randomised to the groups receiving a course of McTimoney&#xD;
           chiropractic treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  report a significantly greater improvement in hours of crying than those in the&#xD;
                control group?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  report a significantly greater improvement their own quality of life (anxiety and&#xD;
                depression)?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  report &quot;resolution&quot; of colic following treatment than the control group?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What effect does parental blinding have on parentally-reported symptoms of infantile&#xD;
           colic and parental quality of life?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also include exploratory investigations to determine whether there are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any particular groupings of patient characteristics (for example; 'other' presenting&#xD;
           symptoms, position in the natural course of colic, age of onset, spinal dysfunction,&#xD;
           perinatal factors) that are associated with good or poor outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any particular characteristics of the treatment (e.g. specific adjustments) that are&#xD;
           associated with good or poor outcomes.&#xD;

      Overall Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a two-by-two factorial design combining groups of chiropractic treatment or&#xD;
      'Best Standard Care' with blinded or unblinded parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two treatment groups will be 'Best Standard Care only' (BSC) and 'Best Standard Care plus&#xD;
      chiropractic' (Chiro). Best standard care will be based on the recommendations from United&#xD;
      Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS), using the Map of Medicine care map. Chiropractic&#xD;
      treatment will be delivered according to the protocol defined by the participating&#xD;
      chiropractors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two blinded and two unblinded groups. The blinded BSC group will receive the&#xD;
      'sham' treatment in addition to the BSC counselling. The unblinded BSC group will not require&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, to allow the effects of the n-shaped curve inherent in the natural course of&#xD;
      colic to be evaluated, all groups will be stratified by age at entry (below 4 weeks (expected&#xD;
      increasing crying over the 2 weeks of the main intervention), between 4 and 6 weeks (expected&#xD;
      plateau), and over 6 weeks (decreasing crying)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a longitudinal design over a ~4 1/2 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcomes which take data from the crying diaries, the main data points are&#xD;
      defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline: the 24 hour period of the day before the first treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First treatment: the 24 hour period of the day after the first treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mid-point treatment: the 24 hour period of the day after the second treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final treatment: the 24 hour period of the day after the third treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include data from the following points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up 1: the 24 hour period of the day 7 days after the third treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up 2: the 24 hour period of the day 14 days after the third treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data will be sourced from:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial visit questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up questionnaires approximately 2 days after first treatment, 2 days after 2nd&#xD;
           treatment, 2 days after final treatment, around day 21 and day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be done through 8 main data collection instruments, drafts of which have&#xD;
      now been developed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First contact questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crying Diary (including severity of other symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial Visit Questionnaire - Part 1 (demographics and history)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial Visit Questionnaire - Part 2 (success of blinding)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjustments record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly telephone questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is 160, calculated achieve 80% power, 5% significance level, and using an&#xD;
      estimated standard deviation of around 2 (based on results from similar studies) for a 1 hour&#xD;
      between-groups difference (identified as a 'clinically relevant reduction in crying time'&#xD;
      from a parental survey) and allowing for a 25% attrition rate in the latter 2 weeks (based on&#xD;
      experiences in similar studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary analyses comparisons will be carried out using all the data in one analysis&#xD;
      which will assess the significance of the treatments, the blindness and the age groups in an&#xD;
      ANCOVA. This will include interaction terms to assess whether the treatment effects are&#xD;
      different for the different levels of blindness and for the different age groups and all&#xD;
      baseline variables will be included as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A logistic regression analysis will be used to produce odds ratios for the comparison of&#xD;
      treatment, blindness and age groups. The between-groups differences in proportion (risk&#xD;
      ratio) of patients reporting 'complete resolution' of colic symptoms (PGIS) after first,&#xD;
      mid-point and final treatments (primary outcome) and at follow ups (secondary outcomes)&#xD;
      Adverse events will be reported with no analysis. Extraction of primary data from crying&#xD;
      diaries will be performed by observers blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be performed by a statistician blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis of primary outcomes will be extended to days 21 and 28, as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ANCOVA will be extended to evaluate the between-group differences in&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost of NHS resource usage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration that the infant is fussy It is anticipated that parent compliance in completing&#xD;
           the diary is likely to deteriorate during once the clinic visits have ceased. However,&#xD;
           regular telephone calls will attempt to encourage continued completion. The primary&#xD;
           study outcomes will be based on the first 15 days of the diary and it is anticipated&#xD;
           that there will be greater compliance during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigative Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory investigations seek to establish any associations between the outcome&#xD;
      measures (daily hours crying, presence of other symptoms, Parental Global Impressions of&#xD;
      Severity (PGIS), Parental Global Impressions of Change (PGIC), and 'resolution' of colic)&#xD;
      after first, mid-point and final treatments, and at follow-ups and any other predictor&#xD;
      variables as gathered in the initial visit (Part 1). For example, :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  baseline daily hours crying&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  initial symptom trajectory; worsening, plateau, improving&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  baseline 'other symptoms' not at all, low, medium and high severity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age at onset&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perinatal factors (Miller, 2007)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treatment characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention to treat v per protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is a clinical study, the primary analysis will be done on an intention-to-treat&#xD;
      basis, including any patients who fail to comply with the protocol for their group (e.g.&#xD;
      dropping out of the treatment groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some of the analyses, accurate data is required (e.g. actual adjustments performed) which&#xD;
      cannot be imputed. In these cases, the analysis will be done on a per protocol basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have reported that the majority of dropouts occur in the no-treatment groups&#xD;
      due to worsening symptoms and in the treatment groups due to resolution of symptoms, so data&#xD;
      imputed at last value carried forward will represent a conservative approach. For the primary&#xD;
      crying time outcome data, where there is a record for Day 8, this will be carried forward to&#xD;
      Day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where reasons for withdrawal on the basis of worsening symptoms are given, this will be&#xD;
      included as data points within the PGIS &amp; PGIC analysis, so no imputation will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts will be made to contact any drop-outs to ascertain their reasons for choosing not to&#xD;
      continue in the study and these will be reported separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the other analyses, a longitudinal analysis of variance will assess changes over time for&#xD;
      the treatment, blindness and age groups together with any interactions and covariates.&#xD;
      Although there may be some loss of data in the later time periods, a repeated measures&#xD;
      analysis should be able to cope with this without imputation of missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numbers of subjects responding to the study and progressing to each stage will be recorded on&#xD;
      a CONSORT-style flow diagram.&#xD;
