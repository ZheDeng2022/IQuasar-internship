    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study assessing the efficacy of l-methylfolate as monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate major depressive disorder (MDD). The plan is to enroll 75&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate MDD based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV&#xD;
      (SCID) that have a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-24 (HDRS-24) score between 8-24. The&#xD;
      investigators will collect genotype data on methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR), MTR&#xD;
      and MTRR in this patient population. Subjects will be able to receive their genotype results,&#xD;
      on request, upon completion of the study. The investigators hypothesize that depressed&#xD;
      patients will be more likely to have a mutation in the MTHFR gene&#xD;

      Participation in the study will consist of the following visits and test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit will include being interviewed by a staff member to determine qualification.&#xD;
      This interview will involve a thorough diagnostic interview that asks about different&#xD;
      psychological feelings and It will also involve several rating scales that ask about&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and suicidality. The following&#xD;
      scales will be conducted at this visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-IV&#xD;
      (DSM) (SCID-I) is a clinician-administered, semi-structured diagnostic interview for mental&#xD;
      health disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-24 (HAM-D) is a clinician-administered questionnaire&#xD;
      designed to assess the severity of depression in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) is a clinician-administered questionnaire which&#xD;
      assesses the severity of symptoms of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) is a clinician administered questionnaire to&#xD;
      assess the severity of symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a clinician administered cognitive screening tool&#xD;
      to aid in the detection of mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a clinician-administered rating scale&#xD;
      that quantifies the presence and severity of suicidal ideation and behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) is a 7-point clinician rating of severity of&#xD;
      psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, a physician will conduct a brief medical physical exam which includes: measuring blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulse, and body weight, a current and past medical history and blood will be drawn.&#xD;
      If you are a female of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit The results of the laboratory tests performed at the screening visit will be&#xD;
      reviewed. If eligibility is met, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and weight) will be&#xD;
      measured. Then a member of the research team will ask questions about current symptoms. The&#xD;
      following scales will be conducted at this visit and at all remaining visits in the study:&#xD;
      HAM-D, HAM-A, YBOCS, MoCA, C-SSRS, and the CGI-S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) is a 7-point rating of treatment response&#xD;
      anchored by 1 (&quot;very much improved) and 7 (&quot;very much worse&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected including a sample for genetic testing. Then the first week of study&#xD;
      drug and instructions on how to take it will be given. Please bring any unused study drug to&#xD;
      on the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 1/End of Week 1, 2/End of Week 2, 3/End of Week 4, 4/End of Week 8, 5/End of Week 12&#xD;
      Vital signs will be measured and a member of the research team will ask questions about&#xD;
      current symptoms. Rating scales will be conducted assessing the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any unused study drug from the last visit will be collected and counted. The study doctor&#xD;
      will ask about overall health and wellbeing. Please tell the study doctor about any problems&#xD;
      encountered during the study. The next week's study drug will be given. Please bring any&#xD;
      unused study drug to on the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional blood will be collected at visit 5.&#xD;
