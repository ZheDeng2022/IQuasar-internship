    <textblock>
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase is one of most popular target&#xD;
      molecules in the field of anticancer drug research. EGFR is highly expressed in many types of&#xD;
      tumor cells, which could activate EGFR cytosolic kinase activity by binding to its ligand&#xD;
      EGF, and regulates gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis through&#xD;
      different signal transduction pathways. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), competitive to specifically combined with the EGFR kinase domain, thus&#xD;
      inhibits its kinase activity, thereby blocking cancer cell proliferation or metastasis. At&#xD;
      present, EGFR-TKI has been widely used in clinical activity, especially in patients with EGFR&#xD;
      mutations, which had been proved to achieved a certain effect. But with the passage of time,&#xD;
      a drug resistance is inevitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, studies have found that the cessation of treatment immediately after EGFR-TKI&#xD;
      resistance may lead to rapid progress of cancer. Chemotherapy, as one of the most widely&#xD;
      accepted modality in cancer treatment, might also be one of the salvage therapies of target&#xD;
      treatment. Therefore, in patients with better physical status (PS) scores, chemotherapy is&#xD;
      commonly applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In January 2010, a study published in the journal of Clinical Lung Cancer reported the&#xD;
      application of chemotherapy as salvage treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) patients with resistant to first-line EGFR-TKI treatment. Of the 114 patients&#xD;
      enrolled, 67 received sequential chemotherapy, the other 47 patients received best supportive&#xD;
      care. The results showed that, sequential chemotherapy can improve the survival time of the&#xD;
      patients, compared with chemotherapy and supportive care groups (11.2 months vs. 3.8 months,&#xD;
      P&lt; 0.01). Furthermore, in those who received sequential chemotherapy, a regimen containing&#xD;
      paclitaxel got higher efficiency and disease control rate than those without (48.7% vs.&#xD;
      21.4%, 79.5% vs. 53.5% , P&lt; 0.05), as well as longer progression-free survival (PFS, 5.1&#xD;
      months vs. 1.8 months, P&lt; 0.01) and overall survival (OS, 12.7 months vs. 7 months, P&lt; 0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study in Taiwan which enrolled 195 patients treated with at least 1 cycles sequential&#xD;
      chemotherapy after first-line gefitinib shown similar results. Generally, gefitinib as a&#xD;
      first-line treatment had PFS for 5 months, and the second-line treatment efficiency was&#xD;
      14.4%. Regimens of platinum or paclitaxel had a better treatment efficiency (50.6%). A poor&#xD;
      therapeutic effect was reported for gefitinib as second-line therapy (5.6%). In total, the&#xD;
      median OS of second-line treatment was 12.2 months. In addition, platinum containing regimens&#xD;
      survival better (21.7 months vs. 8.9 months, P&lt; 0.01); patients with mutant EGFR benefit more&#xD;
      in a platinum-based chemotherapy (24.5 months vs. 8.5 months, P&lt; 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab (trade name Avastin ®) is a kind of recombinant humanized monoclonal&#xD;
      immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1) antibody, which can selectively inhibit the combination process&#xD;
      of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, Flt-1 and kinase domain&#xD;
      receptor (KDR) in endothelial cells. A reduction of tumor angiogenesis, blood supply, oxygen&#xD;
      and other nutrients supply could be obtained after the VEGF loss of its biological activity,&#xD;
      thus inhibit tumor growth. The drug was approved for the first-line treatment of advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer in 2004 by America food and Drug Administration (FDA),thus became the first&#xD;
      for clinical use of drugs that targeting VEGF. As the first globally approved anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody drugs, bevacizumab has approved for advanced colorectal cancer, lung&#xD;
      cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and malignant glioma patients, which was used in&#xD;
      more than 500000 cases. In the field of advanced NSCLC treatment, clinical results confirm&#xD;
      bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy can prolong OS and PFS of patients with NSCLC, and&#xD;
      well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thirty-fifth annual meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) conference&#xD;
      released a meta analysis results of bevacizumab combined with platinum chemotherapy for&#xD;
      first-line treatment of advanced non squamous NSCLC. It is confirmed that, treatment with&#xD;
      bevacizumab based chemotherapy for advanced non squamous NSCLC patients could achieve&#xD;
      significant survival benefit, prolong remission time, and expected safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators design this phase II to testify the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      bevacizumab + chemotherapy for EGFR-TKI resistant non squamous NSCLC.&#xD;
