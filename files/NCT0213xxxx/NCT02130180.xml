      Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication of type 1, or &quot;insulin-dependent,&quot; diabetes&#xD;
      (T1DM) and is defined by a high blood glucose level (over 200 mg/dL) coupled with severe&#xD;
      acidosis. In this state the body breaks down fat tissue for adequate energy production. This&#xD;
      results in ketone and acid production, and ultimately DKA. Cerebral edema (CE), or &quot;brain&#xD;
      swelling,&quot; can also occur with severe DKA. Current evaluation for DKA-related CE necessitates&#xD;
      a high index of clinical suspicion and often times such patients receive advanced brain&#xD;
      imaging such as computed tomography (CT) scans.Ocular sonography (ultrasound) is an&#xD;
      alternative imaging technique that can provide immediate diagnostic capability at the bedside&#xD;
      and minimize radiation exposure. This technique has been used to rapidly and accurately&#xD;
      detect increased brain swelling through measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD)&#xD;
      in a number of clinical situations including pediatric head trauma, hydrocephalus and&#xD;
      ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunctions, and altitude sickness in adults. Investigators plan&#xD;
      to conduct a prospective study including children aged 7-18 years. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the utility of sonographic measurements of the ONSD as a tool for&#xD;
      identification of DKA-related CE.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication of type 1, or &quot;insulin-dependent,&quot; diabetes&#xD;
      (T1DM) and is defined by a high blood glucose level (over 200 mg/dL) coupled with severe&#xD;
      acidosis. Children with T1DM lack adequate insulin production. Without insulin, glucose&#xD;
      cannot be used by cells to produce energy and blood glucose levels increase. As a result, the&#xD;
      body breaks down fat tissue for adequate energy production. This results in ketone and acid&#xD;
      production, and ultimately DKA. Often times DKA is present at the time of diabetes diagnosis.&#xD;
      Recent estimates suggest that nearly 30% of children that present with DKA are newly&#xD;
      diagnosed with diabetes. DKA can also occur as a result of poorly controlled T1DM or poor&#xD;
      adherence to insulin therapy. It is common for such patients to have recurrent episodes of&#xD;
      DKA, which may lead to permanent brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral edema (CE), or &quot;brain swelling,&quot; can also occur with severe DKA. It is unclear what&#xD;
      causes CE in children with DKA. Proposed mechanisms include changes in blood flow to the&#xD;
      brain, inflammatory mediation, and alteration in the intracellular and extracellular fluid&#xD;
      composition in the brain. CE can be &quot;clinically apparent&quot; or &quot;subclinical&quot; in terms of&#xD;
      symptomatology. Children with clinically apparent DKA-related CE present with neurologic&#xD;
      deficits and altered mental status. These children are at risk for herniation of the brain&#xD;
      stem due to elevated pressures in and around the brain, and ultimately death. The neurologic&#xD;
      manifestations of clinically apparent DKA-related CE typically occur 4-12 hours after the&#xD;
      initiation of medical therapy. However, cases have been reported to occur prior to initiation&#xD;
      of therapy. Although clinically apparent DKA-related CE is rare, occurring in 0.5-1% of&#xD;
      children with DKA, subclinical DKA-related CE is much more common with estimates suggesting&#xD;
      that up to 54% of children with DKA have underlying CE that goes clinically undetected. Early&#xD;
      identification of both clinically apparent and subclinical DKA-related CE is critical as the&#xD;
      time between initial neurologic symptoms and clinical deterioration can be as little as 3&#xD;
      hours. Moreover, early identification of subclinical DKA-related CE may lead to differences&#xD;
      in medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evaluation for DKA-related CE necessitates a high index of clinical suspicion and&#xD;
      often times such patients receive advanced brain imaging such as computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scans. While CT scans can identify CE, this imaging modality exposes patients to ionizing&#xD;
      radiation, is expensive, and may take considerable time in some instances. Moreover, CE can&#xD;
      occur in the absence of acute change on CT and some patients with subclinical CE may go&#xD;
      unidentified. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to identify subclinical&#xD;
      DKA-related CE, however this is often time-consuming, expensive, requires sedation, or may be&#xD;
      unavailable at some centers. Ocular sonography (ultrasound) is an alternative imaging&#xD;
      technique that can provide immediate diagnostic capability at the bedside and minimize&#xD;
      radiation exposure. This technique has been used to rapidly and accurately detect increased&#xD;
      brain swelling through measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) in a number of&#xD;
      clinical situations including pediatric head trauma, hydrocephalus and ventriculoperitoneal&#xD;
      shunt malfunctions, and altitude sickness in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed, no study has used ocular ultrasound to examine the ONSD in the setting of&#xD;
      diabetes or DKA for identification of clinically apparent or subclinical CE. It is unclear if&#xD;
      patients with T1DM have a fundamentally different baseline ONSD measurement compared to&#xD;
      described normal values. It is also unclear how the ONSD varies during times of&#xD;
      diabetes-related illness, such as high blood glucose levels without criteria for DKA compared&#xD;
      to unequivocal DKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to conduct a prospective study including children aged 7-18 years that&#xD;
      present to the Children's Endocrinology Clinic and Children's Emergency Department. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the utility of sonographic measurements of the ONSD as a&#xD;
      tool for identification of DKA-related CE. Specifically, the primary aim of this study is to&#xD;
      measure and compare the mean ONSD in children with well-controlled T1DM to those presenting&#xD;
      to the Emergency Department (ED) with DKA and to those presenting to the ED with T1DM and&#xD;
      hyperglycemia without criteria for DKA. Investigators hypothesize that the mean ONSD&#xD;
      measurement is smaller in children with well-controlled T1DM compared to children presenting&#xD;
      to the ED with DKA and compared to children with T1DM and hyperglycemia without criteria for&#xD;
      DKA. Secondarily, investigators aim to compare the mean ONSD in children presenting to the ED&#xD;
      with DKA to those presenting to the ED with T1DM and hyperglycemia without criteria for DKA.&#xD;
      The study team hypothesizes that the mean ONSD measurement is larger in children presenting&#xD;
      to the ED with DKA compared children presenting with T1DM and hyperglycemia without criteria&#xD;
      for DKA.&#xD;

        We will conduct a cross-sectional study of pediatric patients aged 7-18 years. This study&#xD;
        will involve recruitment of patients from both the Endocrinology Clinic and the ED. We will&#xD;
        recruit patients from the Children's Endocrinology Clinic with well-controlled T1DM,&#xD;
        defined as having a hemoglobin A1c &lt;8% at time of the clinic visit, no previous episodes of&#xD;
        DKA other than at the time of diagnosis, and no previous hemoglobin A1c values &gt;10%. This&#xD;
        study will also involve recruitment of two subsets of patients from the Children's ED:&#xD;
        those with DKA and those with T1DM and hyperglycemia without criteria for DKA.&#xD;
