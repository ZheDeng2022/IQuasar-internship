    <textblock>
      This research trial is designed to study the safety and effectiveness of combining the study&#xD;
      drug, Natalizumab (Tysabri®) with the standard treatment, the use of steroids, as a new&#xD;
      treatment for acute graft versus host disease (acute GVHD). GVHD is the most common serious&#xD;
      complication, after bone marrow transplant. GVHD occurs when the donor cells (the graft),&#xD;
      treat the recipient's body as &quot;foreign&quot; and attack the cells in the recipient's body. During&#xD;
      this immune system response, donor cells damage body tissues, such as the skin, liver,&#xD;
      stomach, and/or intestines. Acute GVHD can be severe and if severe, potentially fatal to the&#xD;
      transplant recipient. Acute GVHD usually happens within the first several months after&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research is to develop a safer and more effective treatment for acute GVHD,&#xD;
      and particularly for acute GVHD that affects the gastrointestinal (or GI) tract, with the&#xD;
      ultimate goal being safer and more effective transplant therapies for blood cancers such as&#xD;
      leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The only proven effective treatment for patients with acute graft vs host disease is&#xD;
      steroids. Patients not responding to steroid treatment are at high risk for death.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, based on the early symptoms, it is not possible to tell whether a patient will&#xD;
      respond to steroids, when GVHD is diagnosed and treatment with steroids, such as prednisone,&#xD;
      is started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research trial is designed to study the safety and effectiveness of combining the study&#xD;
      drug, Natalizumab (Tysabri®) with the use of steroids to treat acute GVHD in patients at the&#xD;
      earliest stages of clinical symptoms, but, by using a proprietary method developed at the&#xD;
      University of Michigan and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, are predicted to be&#xD;
      at high risk for not responding to steroid therapy, the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators at Mount Sinai have developed a research method believed that it might make it&#xD;
      possible to predict who is at high risk for not responding to steroids. This method, called&#xD;
      Ann Arbor GVHD scoring, uses the levels of naturally occurring chemicals in the blood (called&#xD;
      biomarkers) to determine a patient's GVHD score(1, 2, or 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hypothesis is that most patients with Ann Arbor score 3 GVHD, will not respond well to&#xD;
      steroid treatment. The investigators research shows that almost half of the patients with Ann&#xD;
      Arbor grade 3 GVHD, will die within 6 months of their GVHD diagnosis. Most of the deaths are&#xD;
      due to intestinal GVHD, which sometimes does not develop, until after standard steroid&#xD;
      treatment has already begun.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients with Ann Arbor score 3 GVHD, will be eligible for this study treatment. It is&#xD;
      important to understand that Ann Arbor GVHD grading is not approved for clinical use. It can&#xD;
      only be used as a test for research purposes. In this study, patients must have their blood&#xD;
      tested to determine, if they qualify as Ann Arbor score 3 GVHD, and must start the study&#xD;
      treatment within 3 days of starting systemic steroid treatment for acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will test whether the investigators can improve steroid response and prevent death&#xD;
      from GVHD with the combination therapy, by blocking the donor cells from getting to the&#xD;
      intestine and causing damage. Natalizumab (Tysabri®) is a drug that works by blocking the&#xD;
      signals that cause immune cells like donor cells, to travel to organs like the intestine or&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natalizumab is FDA-approved in adults, to treat Crohn's disease, a chronic condition where&#xD;
      immune cells cause damage to the digestive system (such as the stomach, intestines). It is&#xD;
      also used to treat multiple sclerosis where immune cells cause damage to the nervous system&#xD;
      in the brain. Its intended use is for patients with disease that has not responded to the&#xD;
      standard treatment, or cannot tolerate the side effects from standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natalizumab has never been used for treating GVHD. It is an experimental drug for this study,&#xD;
      because the investigators are investigating a new use for the drug, as a GVHD treatment.&#xD;
