  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a combination of drugs called Ofatumumab and Idelalisib as&#xD;
      a possible treatment for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Small Lymphocytic Leukemia&#xD;
      (SLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to examine the combination of the two drugs, Ofatumumab and&#xD;
      Idelalisib, in participants who have been diagnosed with CLL/SLL and have not previously&#xD;
      received treatment but do require treatment. The investigators hope to observe how&#xD;
      participants' disease will be impacted by this treatment and whether they will benefit more&#xD;
      from combining these drugs together rather than taking them separately. Both of these drugs&#xD;
      have been used in treatment for CLL / SLL and information from those research studies&#xD;
      suggests that these drugs may help patients with CLL/SLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ofatumumab is an antibody engineered in the lab against CD20, a protein on the surface of CLL&#xD;
      cells, which is expressed in CLL. An antibody is a molecule your body creates to identify&#xD;
      foreign substances so that it can destroy them. Ofatumumab has been FDA approved for&#xD;
      treatment of CLL/SLL that has relapsed or progressed on other therapies. Idelalisib is a drug&#xD;
      that blocks one of the signals inside the cells that cause this type of cancer to grow and&#xD;
      survive. The investigators hope that combining Ofatumumab with Idelalisib will stop the&#xD;
      growth of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the side effects of combining these&#xD;
      two drugs, gathering information on the CLL/SLL disease process and how the study affects the&#xD;
      patient's cells, as well as assessing the outcome of the disease. This combination of drugs&#xD;
      has been previously tested, and appeared to be well tolerated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Before the research starts (screening): After signing the consent form, the participant will&#xD;
      be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if they are eligible to be&#xD;
      in this research study. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular&#xD;
      cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that the participant does not take part in&#xD;
      the research study. If the participant has had some of these tests or procedures recently,&#xD;
      they may or may not have to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A medical history, which includes questions about the participant's health, current&#xD;
           medications, and any allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, which includes vital signs, height, weight, and disease assessment&#xD;
           by the size of the participant's spleen, liver, and lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status, which evaluates how the participant is able to carry on with their&#xD;
           usual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An assessment of the patient's tumor by CT (Computerized Tomography) scan, MRI or PET&#xD;
           (Positron Emission Tomography) scans,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy: A study tube (plastic cylinder container that contains&#xD;
           biopsy material) will be drawn during this biopsy to further assess the participant's&#xD;
           disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests, a maximum of 24 teaspoons will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Hepatitis B and C test, will require blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these tests show that the participant is eligible to participate in the research study,&#xD;
      then the participant will be begin will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, the participant will not be able to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional research procedures to be performed at the time of screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Blood tests, including baseline tests so that the investigators can measure any additional&#xD;
      effect of the study drug and disease status&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening procedures confirm that you are eligible to participate in the research&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you take part in this research study, the participant will be given a study drug-dosing&#xD;
      diary for each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days. The diary will also&#xD;
      include special instructions for taking the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Drugs: The participant will first be given Idelalisib daily for two cycles of 28&#xD;
           days each. Idelalisib will be given orally. Once the participant completes 2 cycles of&#xD;
           Idelalisib, then the participant will start to receive a combination of Ofatumumab and&#xD;
           Idelalisib. This regimen will continue weekly to complete 8 weeks (two more cycles).&#xD;
           This will be followed by monthly Ofatumumab and Idelalisib to complete 4 additional&#xD;
           cycles (eight total). The overall treatment period will therefore be 8 months, comprised&#xD;
           of two months of Idelalisib followed by 6 months of Ofatumumab with Idelalisib. After&#xD;
           completing the 8-month treatment, the participant will likely continue Idelalisib.&#xD;
           Restaging with CT scans will happen after Cycle 2, 4, and a final restage will occur 2&#xD;
           months after the completion of Ofatumumab. There will be a tumor response assessment&#xD;
           done during a physical exam after Cycle 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Exams: During all cycles the participant will have a physical exam and will be&#xD;
           asked questions about their general health and specific questions about any problems&#xD;
           that they might be having and any medications they may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans (or Imaging tests): The investigator will assess the participant's tumor by CT&#xD;
           scan. Restaging with CT scans will happen after Cycle 2, 4, and a final restage will&#xD;
           occur 2 months after the completion of Ofatumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy: will be conducted to see if the bone marrow has tumor&#xD;
           cells. A study tube will be drawn during this biopsy to further assess the patient's&#xD;
           disease status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Blood Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Tests will be performed throughout the study so that the Investigator can measure any&#xD;
      additional effect of the study drug and disease status. These tests will be taken on the days&#xD;
      listed below before the participant receive study drug, on some days additional blood will be&#xD;
      drawn after they receive study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 3 Day 1 Cycle 3 Day 8 Cycle 3 Day 15 Cycle 4 Day 21 (last weekly Ofatumumab dose) Cycle&#xD;
      5 Day 1 (first monthly Ofatumumab dose) Cycle 8 Day 1 (last monthly Ofatumumab dose) 2 months&#xD;
      after Ofatumumab therapy completed 6 months after Ofatumumab therapy completed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participant has completed the study treatment, the participant will be monitored&#xD;
      until they start a new type of treatment or are removed from the study. During this time the&#xD;
      participant will meet with your research physician every 3 or 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator would like to keep track of the participant's medical condition for the rest&#xD;
      of their life. The investigator would like to do this by calling the participant on the&#xD;
      telephone once a year to see how the participant is doing. Keeping in touch with the&#xD;
      participant and checking their condition every year helps the investigator look at the&#xD;
      long-term effects of the research study.&#xD;

             the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive serology for Hepatitis B (HB) defined as a positive test for HBsAg. In&#xD;
             addition, if negative for HBsAg but HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb status), a HB&#xD;
             DNA test will be performed and if positive the subject will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If HBV DNA is negative, subject may be included but must undergo HBV DNA PCR testing&#xD;
             at least every 2 months from the start of treatment until 12 months post treatment.&#xD;
             Prophylactic antiviral therapy may be initiated at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive serology for hepatitis C (HC) defined as a positive test for HepC Ab, in&#xD;
             which case reflexively perform an HC RIBA immunoblot assay or hepatitis C viral load&#xD;
             to confirm the result. If the confirmatory test is negative the subject will be&#xD;
