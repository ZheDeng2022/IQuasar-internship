      Conduct a case collection study of breast imaging examinations from women with&#xD;
      mammographically-detected breast lesions for the purpose of conducting subsequent Reader&#xD;
      Studies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective case collection study for the purpose of collecting cases for the&#xD;
      subsequent Reader Studies at a minimum of two clinical sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be recruited from a group of women who have undergone diagnostic&#xD;
      mammography and demonstrate a mammographic lesion in at least one view. Approximately 300&#xD;
      women will be enrolled. Subjects will undergo QTUS following a diagnostic XRM with a&#xD;
      mammographically-detected lesion(s) in at least one mammographic view and will have a lesion&#xD;
      seen on HHUS corresponding to the XRM lesion(s). Potential Subjects will be eligible for&#xD;
      enrollment at the time the corresponding lesion is identified on HHUS. All subjects will&#xD;
      undergo an ultrasound guided aspiration/biopsy with cytology to determine whether the lesion&#xD;
      is a cyst or solid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study site is projected to collect approximately 75 cyst cases and 75 solid cases for a&#xD;
      total of 150 cases, stratified across the four (4) recognized breast tissue density&#xD;
      categories with at least 50% of cases from subjects with heterogeneous and extremely dense&#xD;
      breast compositions. The composition of the cyst cases at each site is projected to consist&#xD;
      of 25 simple cysts and 50 complicated and complex cysts for a total of 75 cyst cases. All&#xD;
      enrolled subjects will undergo ultrasound guided aspiration or biopsy or surgical excision,&#xD;
      as applicable for the index lesion. Cytologic or histologic results for all lesions will be&#xD;
      performed and collected.&#xD;

        Eligibility for enrollment will be open to women of all races and ethnicities who have&#xD;
        completed a diagnostic XRM with a mammographically-detected lesion(s) in at least one&#xD;
        mammographic view and have a lesion seen on HHUS corresponding to the XRM lesion(s). Women&#xD;
        with a normal mammogram at the time of this evaluation are not eligible to participate.&#xD;
        Women younger than 25 years of age will not be eligible to participate. Potential subjects&#xD;
        must not be breastfeeding at the time of diagnostic breast imaging. Patients who have had&#xD;
        breast cancer, breast surgeries, or interventional breast procedures in the past 12 months&#xD;
        will not be eligible to enter the study.&#xD;
