  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, single-arm, one-site therapeutic trial of the combination of&#xD;
      trametinib plus digoxin for advanced melanoma. endpoints are toxicities assessed by nCi CTCae&#xD;
      v4.1 within the first 8 weeks, responses measured by ReCiST v1.1 criteria every 8 weeks with&#xD;
      scans and exams, tumor sensitivity to the drug combination quantified by tumor regressions in&#xD;
      nSG mice, and correlations of response with tumor sensitivity, BRaF status, MaPK inhibitor&#xD;
      exposure history, and tumor sodium pump expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Dosage and administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Trametinib (2mg) will be administered orally on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Digoxin (0.25mg) will be administered orally on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      on a 8-week cycle, duration of treatment can last from 8 to 104 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Toxicities will be assessed via nCi's CTCae v4.1 toxicity criteria. DLTs will be defined&#xD;
           based on the rate of drug-related (definitely or probably) grade 3-5 adverse events&#xD;
           experienced within the first 8 weeks of study treatment. The MTD will be exceeded if&#xD;
           more than 20% of patients on the study experience DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Responses will be measured by ReCiST v1.1 every 8 weeks. Response duration will be&#xD;
           defined as time from first documented response until disease progression. PFS is time&#xD;
           from treatment until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient tumor sensitivity to the drug combination will be quantified by the amount of&#xD;
           subcutaneous established tumor growth inhibition in nSG mice by 5d/week oral gavage with&#xD;
           drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Tumor nRaS status will be determined by tumor Dna extraction, PCR amplification of exons&#xD;
           and Sanger sequencing of nRaS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. History of prior MaPK inhibitor therapies will document MeK inhibitor exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sodium pump subunit expression will be analyzed by pretreatment tumor&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry and a qualitative 0 to 3+ grading system.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the toxicities and estimate the frequency of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)&#xD;
           of digoxin in combination with trametinib in advanced melanoma patients and estimate the&#xD;
           frequency of DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the response rate, response duration and progression free survival (PFS) of&#xD;
           digoxin plus trametinib in advanced melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate NSG xenograft sensivity to the drug combination with clinical response in&#xD;
           the same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare response rates in MAPK inhibitor naive versus refractory patients and NRAS&#xD;
           mutant versus wild-type patients and for sodium pump 3 subunit high tumor expression&#xD;
           versus low tumor expression patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Having established cell culture and xenograft systems for studying patient&#xD;
      melanoma samples, the researchers were able to grow tumors in vitro and in vivo from single&#xD;
      cells and found a correlation of tumor metastatic behavior in immunocompromised mice and in&#xD;
      patients. Recently they have extended the experiments to examine melanoma sensitivity to&#xD;
      novel compounds. In screens of FDA approved drugs, they found several cardenolides including&#xD;
      digoxin that reproducibly exhibited greater toxicity to primary human melanomas as compared&#xD;
      to a range of normal human cells. They then examined the anti-tumor efficacy against primary&#xD;
      human melanomas growing in vivo as xenografts. While trametinib, vemurafenib, and digoxin and&#xD;
      digitoxin individually slowed the growth of human melanomas xenografts, they did not cause&#xD;
      tumor regression. However, the combination of digoxin or digitoxin and trametinib caused&#xD;
      substantial tumor regression using melanomas obtained from multiple patients, some with BRAF&#xD;
      mutations and some without. The effects were dramatically better than trametinib, digoxin,&#xD;
      digitoxin or vemurafenib alone. No difference in efficacy for the combination was seen in&#xD;
      BRAF mutant and BRAF wild-type samples.&#xD;
