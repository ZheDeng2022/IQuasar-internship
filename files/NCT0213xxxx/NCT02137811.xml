  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently an automated test for measuring cancer cell death in the presence of chemotherapy&#xD;
      has been developed. This test has been called the MiCK assay during the ten year development&#xD;
      phase and is now called Correct Chemo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CorrectChemo provides the medical community and patients a way to determine the effects of&#xD;
      different chemotherapies on individual cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MiCK assay has been proven to have clinical usefulness in two studies. In one study using&#xD;
      multiple types of cancer, physicians used the MiCK assay in 63% of the patients. If the&#xD;
      physician used the results to prescribe the chemotherapy treatment, the patients' response&#xD;
      rate, time to the disease getting worse, and overall survival were all significantly better&#xD;
      compared to patients whose physicians did not use the results. In another study of breast&#xD;
      cancer patients, physicians used the MiCK assay in 74% of patients. If the results were used&#xD;
      when planning chemotherapy, response rate and time to the disease started getting worse were&#xD;
      all significantly better compared to patients whose physicians did not use the results of the&#xD;
      MiCK assay The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of patients who have had the&#xD;
      MiCK assay (CorrectChemo) with tumor types, physician attitudes towards the test, and how the&#xD;
      physicians used the test. This study will be gathering this data by reviewing medical charts.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to correlate the clinical outcomes of patients who have had the&#xD;
      MICK assay with tumor type, physician attitudes towards the assay, and how physicians used&#xD;
      the assay by using data in patient charts, and surveying physician attitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine how often physicians use the MiCK assay results in developing a treatment&#xD;
           plan, and which drugs the physician used in treatment. This will be correlated with&#xD;
           patient and tumor demographics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine physician attitudes towards the MiCK assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the clinical outcomes (response rates, time to progression, and overall&#xD;
           survival) in patients who have had a MiCK assay. This will be correlated with pattern of&#xD;
           physician use of the assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The treating oncologist will provide demographic information (patient identifying&#xD;
           number, sex, age, number of prior lines of therapy, performance status) and tumor&#xD;
           information (cell type, stage, metastatic sites, goal of therapy, pre-assay planned&#xD;
           therapy, and post-assay therapy chosen for&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tumor response, patient symptom response, time to progression on each chemotherapy&#xD;
           regimen, and overall survival will be determined from the patient chart and will be&#xD;
           correlated with MICK assay results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physicians will complete a questionnaire on attitudes towards usefulness of the assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigators will correlate tumor response, symptom response, time to progression and&#xD;
           overall survival with drug therapy with drug response in MICK assay for first chemo&#xD;
           regimen after assay, and according to pattern of physician use of the assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will accumulate physician attitudes toward usefulness of the assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent Since this study has no risk to the patient, informed consent will not be&#xD;
      needed. Physicians will have the option of participating, or not participating, in each&#xD;
      patient. Physicians will be compensated for completing chart review and submitting data after&#xD;
      the MiCK assay has been performed, and at 6,12 and 24 months after MiCK assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection from Physicians Data will include demographics and tumor characteristics and&#xD;
      physician attitudes: I used the test to develop a treatment plan yes/no, I found the test&#xD;
      useful yes/no, I found the test to be helpful in planning for palliative care yes/no, I found&#xD;
      the test to be helpful in planning for hospice yes/no. I have these suggestions for&#xD;
      improvement (free text response). Data will include at 6,12 and 24 months clinical outcomes&#xD;
      as judged by the physician: Complete, Partial, Stable, Death, symptomatic improvement patient&#xD;
      felt better same or worse. Data will include at time of progression, did doctor use the MiCK&#xD;
      assay to plan the next treatment, try to get another MiCK assay, or use the assay to plan for&#xD;
      palliative care or hospice.&#xD;
