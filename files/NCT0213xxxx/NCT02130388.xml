    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the body's response to a life-threatening infection. This study will determine if&#xD;
      zinc supplementation is safe to use in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. This&#xD;
      study will also gather preliminary information to evaluate the impact that zinc has on the&#xD;
      immune system (the body's defense system against infection) and whether zinc can help&#xD;
      monocytes and macrophages (specific types of cells that remove infections from the body) work&#xD;
      more effectively.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown that zinc supplementation reduces the length and severity of some&#xD;
      types of medical infections (examples include the cold virus and diarrhea). Because zinc has&#xD;
      been shown to improve the immune system's function, some doctors provide mineral supplements&#xD;
      such as zinc to their patients in the Intensive Care Unit. However, there are no studies to&#xD;
      show how effective zinc is or that have evaluated what dose(s) of zinc are safe in patients&#xD;
      with severe sepsis/septic shock. Nor have studies examined if tolerable doses for septic&#xD;
      patients can improve how the immune system functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If zinc is shown to improve how the immune system functions during sepsis, it could be used&#xD;
      in the future as part of the treatment regimen for patients with sepsis.&#xD;

    <description>This study consists of receiving a dose of zinc once daily while in the ICU for up to 7 days, up to four timed blood draws over the first 10 days of your hospitalization (if you remain in the hospital that long), and collecting some immune cells from your blood +/- lungs. We will review your medical chart at the time of the blood draws and again when you are getting ready for discharge.</description>
