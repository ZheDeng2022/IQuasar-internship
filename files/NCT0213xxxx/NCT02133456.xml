  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To monitor the safety of Shanghai Institute of Biological Products Company's influenza&#xD;
      vaccine in subjects aged 3 years and older through Adverse Events Following Immunization&#xD;
      Surveillance System of China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in the occurrence of adverse events&#xD;
      among influenza vaccines manufactured by SIBP and other companies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inactivated split-virion vaccines from Shanghai Institute of Biological Products Company have&#xD;
      been used for more than 10 years in Beijing population. Some 160 thousands doses have been&#xD;
      sold to subjects aged 3 years and older in this area. We review and summarize spontaneously&#xD;
      reported adverse events from safety surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events were collected through the Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)&#xD;
      Surveillance System. Beijing CDC and local prefectural CDC must organize an expert panel to&#xD;
      investigate adverse events and assess causality, using criteria based on Chinese Standard&#xD;
      Procedures for Vaccination. The panels consist of physicians, epidemiologists, pharmacists,&#xD;
      and other relevant experts. In general, expert panels investigate deaths, life-threatening&#xD;
      illnesses, and permanent disabilities, and immunization-program managers or vaccination&#xD;
      providers investigate common, minor adverse events. Adverse events are classified into one of&#xD;
      five categories: vaccine reactions (common and minor to rare and more serious), program&#xD;
      errors, coincidental illnesses, psychogenic reactions, and unclassifiable events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of vaccination, vaccinees were instructed to report any adverse event to&#xD;
      physicians or vaccination providers. The following adverse events were required to be&#xD;
      reported: adverse events that were fatal or that resulted in disability and clusters of&#xD;
      events (i.e., notably high numbers of similar adverse events related to a certain vaccine) ;&#xD;
      anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions occurring within 24 hours after vaccination; fever&#xD;
      (axillary temperature, &gt;37.5°C), angioedema, or a local injection-site reaction (diameter,&#xD;
      &gt;2.5 cm) occurring within 5 days after vaccination; purpura, an Arthus reaction, febrile&#xD;
      convulsion, seizure, or polyneuritis occurring within 15 days after vaccination; and the&#xD;
      Guillain-Barré syndrome occurring within 3 months after vaccination. Other reactions that&#xD;
      were common and minor (e.g., mild pain and fatigue) were not required to be reported.&#xD;
