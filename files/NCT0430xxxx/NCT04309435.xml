  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment decision-making capacity ('capacity') refers to a person's ability to make&#xD;
      decisions about their treatment. It is an important issue for people diagnosed with a&#xD;
      schizophrenia-spectrum disorder ('psychosis') because impaired capacity can mean a person&#xD;
      does not understand what treatment options are available, or the implications of those&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2018 the National Institute of Health &amp; Care Excellence (NICE) called for clinical trials&#xD;
      of interventions such as talking therapies to help people regain capacity. However, running&#xD;
      these trials can take several years. One way of reducing this delay is to run several trials&#xD;
      at the same time, as part of one bigger trial called an 'Umbrella' trial. Although Umbrella&#xD;
      trials have been used to accelerate the development of physical health interventions, they&#xD;
      have yet to be used in mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of this study are therefore to find out whether people with non-affective&#xD;
      psychosis (schizophrenia-spectrum disorder) will take part in a single (rater) blind Umbrella&#xD;
      trial of talking therapies to improve their treatment decision-making capacity (the DEC:IDES&#xD;
      trial), and to understand their experiences of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before a larger version of the DEC:IDES trial can begin, it needs to be established that&#xD;
      people with psychosis will want to take part in it. Specifically, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      establish whether they will stay in the trial until it is finished, or whether they will&#xD;
      leave early. It will also examine why people might leave DEC:IDES early, so that it can be&#xD;
      improved. For these reasons, a smaller version must be completed first. This will involve 3&#xD;
      small clinical trials, each with N=20 (Treatment N=10; Control N=10), each testing 1 of 3&#xD;
      different interventions. Each intervention has been designed to help participants resolve a&#xD;
      problem which previous evidence suggests may reduce their decision-making ability. One&#xD;
      intervention is designed to improve self-esteem, another is designed to reduce negative&#xD;
      beliefs about psychosis ('self-stigma') and another is designed to help people with psychosis&#xD;
      gather more information before making decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will record how many people participate in and complete the trial, and they&#xD;
      will ask people for their views on what they liked and did not like about taking part. All&#xD;
      this information will help ensure the larger DEC:IDES trial is more acceptable to people with&#xD;
      psychosis.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND &amp; RATIONALE FOR STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
           'Treatment decision-making capacity' ('capacity'), is defined as the ability to&#xD;
           understand, appreciate, and retain information relating to a proposed treatment, weigh&#xD;
           that information and communicate a choice. Capacity is now a pivotal concept in&#xD;
           healthcare and law, and clinicians are legally obliged to respect patient autonomy where&#xD;
           capacity exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Capacity has been referred to as the 'gatekeeper of autonomy'. When it is lost there is&#xD;
           a legal and ethical imperative for clinicians to work to support its return and&#xD;
           retention. However in their scrutiny of capacity-law implementation, the United Kingdom&#xD;
           (UK) House of Lords concluded: &quot;Our evidence suggests that (supported decision-making)&#xD;
           is rare in practice&quot; and The United Nations Committee on the Convention on the Rights of&#xD;
           Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) advised that greater provision of supported&#xD;
           decision-making is essential if the UK is to be compliant with Article 12 of the&#xD;
           Convention on Human Rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite the importance and legal obligation to support capacity there is a lack of&#xD;
           evidence on how to do this effectively. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis&#xD;
           synthesised evidence from 23 studies on capacity in psychosis and found there were no&#xD;
           randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of supported decision-making interventions.&#xD;
           Psychiatrists view the evidence in this area as weak, and the National Institute for&#xD;
           Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have called for RCTs to enhance evidence in this&#xD;
           area. Anticipating this, over the last 5 years the research team, comprising clinicians,&#xD;
           legal experts and researchers, have produced 5 systematic reviews and meta-analyses&#xD;
           addressing various aspects of decision-making capacity in psychosis, and 5 clinical&#xD;
           studies. These indicate that a lack of capacity is likely to stem from interactions&#xD;
           between cognitive, emotional and social factors, the effects of which are moderated by a&#xD;
           person's awareness of them. This model specifically predicts that 'self-stigma', low&#xD;
           self-esteem, and the 'jumping to conclusions' (JTC) bias are likely to have large,&#xD;
           additive adverse effects on their capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Psychological interventions that selectively reduce each of these hypothesised 'causal&#xD;
           mechanisms' have already been developed. The next stage of this research is therefore to&#xD;
           conduct 'interventionist-causal RCTs' (IC-RCTs) to examine whether these interventions&#xD;
           can also cause improvements in capacity. Recommended to accelerate the development of&#xD;
           treatments for psychotic symptoms such as delusions, these sophisticated trials are&#xD;
           capable of producing invaluable information on what causes and improves impaired&#xD;
           capacity. If the trials are run consecutively, people with psychosis could wait 10-15&#xD;
           years for definitive findings and would involve setting up several costly trial&#xD;
           infrastructures to support each trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           One simple solution is to conduct these IC-RCTs concurrently, within one trial&#xD;
           infrastructure. This approach, also known as an 'Umbrella trial', could produce results&#xD;
           in half the time, for half the cost, meaning an effective capacity-supporting&#xD;
           intervention could be produced in 5-6 years, rather than 10-15. The aim of this study is&#xD;
           therefore to conduct the first Umbrella trial in mental healthcare, using this to&#xD;
           accelerate the development of an intervention to support capacity in psychosis. However,&#xD;
           prior to conducting a definitive trial, a variety of feasibility issues need to be&#xD;
           examined in a randomised pilot study. The planned study addresses these.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AIMS &amp; OBJECTIVES&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. DESIGN &amp; PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1. Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study has been designed to find out whether participants can be recruited and&#xD;
           retained in a larger trial characterised by the same design parameters (e.g., allocation&#xD;
           ratio, blind assessment, types of treatment and control offered, multiple sites). The&#xD;
           planned randomised pilot study is therefore a 20-month feasibility/pilot of a multi-site&#xD;
           single (rater) blind Umbrella trial of psychological interventions to support treatment&#xD;
           decision-making capacity in people diagnosed with non-affective psychosis&#xD;
           (schizophrenia-spectrum disorders). It has been designed primarily to examine&#xD;
           post-treatment (8 week) data retention rates for the planned primary outcome [MacArthur&#xD;
           Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T) capacity ratings] in a future&#xD;
           definitive trial. In this and the future study, participants will be randomly allocated&#xD;
           to receive treatment as usual (TAU) plus a psychological intervention to improve either&#xD;
           (i) self-stigma, (ii) self-esteem, or (iii) the jumping to conclusions reasoning bias,&#xD;
           or TAU plus an attention control condition. RQs 3 &amp; 4 will be addressed through&#xD;
           qualitative interviews with participants and referrers/clinicians, using Framework&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Qualitative analysis of change in participant appreciation, as measured by the MacCAT-T,&#xD;
           will be performed using qualitative case study methodology. MaCAT-T appreciation ratings&#xD;
           will also be compared to ratings on the Expanded Schedule for the Assessment of Insight&#xD;
           (SAI-E). Concordance between overall MacCAT-T judgements and pre and post clinical&#xD;
           judgements of referring clinicians, assessed using a version of the Clinical Global&#xD;
           Impression Scale (modified to assess global capacity ratings), will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To minimise piloting costs 75% of the 60 patient participants will be recruited in the&#xD;
           lead site (NHS Lothian). Each intervention group will be compared to its own control&#xD;
           group (each receive the same standardised procedure) to ensure participants in each&#xD;
           trial are equivalent with respect to their presenting mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Participants &amp; setting&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adults (aged 18-65) diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder with impaired&#xD;
           treatment decision-making capacity, and presence of either low self-esteem, high&#xD;
           self-stigma or the JTC bias will be recruited from inpatient and outpatient NHS mental&#xD;
           health services across three UK sites; 75% from NHS Lothian; 12.5% from Pennine Care;&#xD;
           12.5% from Lancashire Care. Of these patient participants, 6 will be invited to attend a&#xD;
           qualitative interview to understand their experiences of participating in the trial, as&#xD;
           part of the Framework analysis. Up to a further 10 will be invited to attend a&#xD;
           qualitative interview to understand and verify any change in their 'appreciation' of&#xD;
           their illness and its treatment. Six clinical or social care staff who have either&#xD;
           referred a participant to the study or have provided substantial care and treatment to a&#xD;
           participant during the study, will also be invited to attend a qualitative interview to&#xD;
           understand their experiences of the trial, again as part of the Framework analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3. Allocation, randomisation and assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Allocation &amp; randomisation: Participants will be assigned to one of the two-arm IC-RCTs&#xD;
           based on whether they have predominantly low self-esteem (defined as scoring 14 or less&#xD;
           on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory), high self-stigma (defined as scoring 60 or more&#xD;
           on the Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness Scale), or the JTC bias (defined as&#xD;
           selecting 2 or fewer beads on The Beads Task). Participants with multiple mechanisms&#xD;
           will be randomly assigned. All participants will then be randomised (1:1) at the start&#xD;
           of treatment session 1 to treatment or control, using randomised-permuted blocks of&#xD;
           random size (block sizes of two or four), administered via a study-specific web-based&#xD;
           portal according to a concealed randomisation sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessments: All participants will receive a full research assessment, by a Research&#xD;
           Assistant (RA) masked to treatment group allocation, at week 0 (baseline) and week 8&#xD;
           (end of treatment). In addition to measures of change (see outcomes), the Clinical&#xD;
           Interview for Psychotic Disorders and the Brief Neurocognitive Assessment will be&#xD;
           administered to confirm diagnosis and assess cognitive functioning, respectively, at&#xD;
           week 0. Participants randomised in the first 8 (Scotland) or 5 (England) months will be&#xD;
           invited to complete a follow-up assessment at week 24. All qualitative interviews will&#xD;
           be conducted with participants and their referrers/clinicians following the patient&#xD;
           participants' 24-week assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.4. Study interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
           Active interventions (each 6 sessions over 8 weeks): Each intervention is structurally&#xD;
           equivalent and will be delivered by the same therapist. The self-esteem intervention is&#xD;
           informed by a previous protocol tested with people with persecutory delusions. The JTC&#xD;
           intervention, developed and trialled by the researchers and colleagues previously, has&#xD;
           been lengthened to 6 sessions by addressing positive beliefs about JTC decision-making&#xD;
           and providing greater practice of non-JTC decision-making. The self-stigma intervention&#xD;
           developed by a team including the current PI, has been reduced from 12 to 6 sessions by&#xD;
           removing self-esteem focused elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inactive attention control (6 sessions over 8 weeks): The therapeutically inactive&#xD;
           assessment component of a protocol developed and piloted previously by the researchers&#xD;
           will be used. To maximise clinical benefit of participation, the potentially active&#xD;
           component of this protocol (psychological formulation) will be provided, but only after&#xD;
           the participant exits the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.5. Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quantitative: An independent statistician will conduct blind analysis of outcome data.&#xD;
           Proportions, means, standard deviations, effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals for&#xD;
           all time points will be reported descriptively, on both a strict intention-to-treat and&#xD;
           per-protocol basis (≥50% attendance in treatment or control). Concordance between (a)&#xD;
           MacCAT-T ratings and clinician ratings of capacity and (b) MacCAT-T appreciation ratings&#xD;
           and SAI-E scores will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Qualitative: A trained RA will prepare topic guides, conduct, record and transcribe the&#xD;
           interviews. Under supervision, the RA will also analyse the qualitative data following&#xD;
           established guidelines for Framework analysis and qualitative case study methodology.&#xD;
           For the Framework analysis, interviews with participants and referrers/clinicians will&#xD;
           address feasibility and acceptability of the trial procedures, problems indicated in the&#xD;
           quantitative data, and potential solutions. This ensures that the issue is not explored&#xD;
           through one lens, but rather various lenses facilitating understanding about multiple&#xD;
           facets of the phenomenon. For the qualitative case study analysis, interviews with&#xD;
           participants will address their views on their diagnosis and treatment, any subjective&#xD;
           change, and the participant's views on the reason for this change.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.6. Progression criteria for a full trial&#xD;
&#xD;
           Funding for a larger trial, using the same trial design, will be sought if the target&#xD;
           recruitment is met and post-intervention (8 week) MacCAT-T data from ≥75% of those&#xD;
           randomised is retained. If this target is not met, findings from the Framework Analysis&#xD;
           will be used to modify the design before further piloting and/or progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.7. Research Team &amp; Expert Advisory Group&#xD;
&#xD;
           This project will receive strong support from: (i) An Expert Advisory group, comprising&#xD;
           of experts by experience, experts in law and policy, and experts in psychosis research;&#xD;
           (ii) Professor Richard Emsley (Co-Investigator) is Professor of Trial Methodology and&#xD;
           former Director of the Manchester Clinical Trials Unit. He sits on the Expert Advisory&#xD;
           Group for the world-leading STAMPEDE Umbrella trial of interventions for prostate&#xD;
           cancer; and (iii) An experienced multi-disciplinary research team selected to ensure&#xD;
           experience and expertise in relation to the interventions, population, outcomes,&#xD;
           methodology and ability to manage the various sites, and to strengthen their trial&#xD;
           infrastructure for the later trial, building on their existing robust collaborations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1. Number of Participants and Sample Size Calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
           The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) guidance was used to calculate that 60&#xD;
           participants (average of 3-4 per month over 12-months) will allow for an estimated&#xD;
           drop-out rate (i.e., data non-retention) of 15%, at week 8, to within a 95% confidence&#xD;
           interval of +/- 9%. The proportion of people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and&#xD;
           impaired capacity who have at least one of the proposed causal mechanisms is estimated&#xD;
           to range from 80-100%. Pilot trials suggest ≥80% of those who have one of these&#xD;
           mechanisms will consent and be randomised, ≥85% of whom will complete the trial. Six of&#xD;
           the 60 participants and six of their referrers or clinicians will be invited to&#xD;
           participate in a qualitative interview for the Framework analysis. Up to a further 10 of&#xD;
           the 60 participants will be invited to participate in the qualitative interview for the&#xD;
           qualitative case study of change in appreciation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2. Identification and Recruitment of Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           One pathway in which participants will be identified is through self-referral. To&#xD;
           facilitate this, a poster will be placed in NHS mental health services to advertise the&#xD;
           study. A study website will be available, including participant information sheets.&#xD;
           Contact details will be provided for those interested in self-referral. Individuals who&#xD;
           self-refer, will only be included in the study if they agree that a mental health&#xD;
           professional involved in their care, can be contacted to obtain information for risk&#xD;
           assessment purposes and to ensure participation is not contraindicated in some way.&#xD;
           Another pathway in which participants will be identified is through clinician-referral.&#xD;
           As per previous trials, local site Principal Investigators will support RAs to visit&#xD;
           clinical services to present the trial, determine initial interest, and distribute&#xD;
           information sheets. The information sheet will detail what participants are asked to do,&#xD;
           how their information will be used and the possible risks and benefits of taking part in&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For potential participants entering the study through self-referral, the RA will obtain&#xD;
           their explicit verbal consent to contact their key worker/ care-coordinator to determine&#xD;
           whether they meet inclusion criteria for the study and to conduct an initial risk&#xD;
           assessment. The RA will also ask the clinical care team if they have any concerns about&#xD;
           the potential participant's capacity to consent to take part in research. Should&#xD;
           participants meet inclusion criteria for the study and continue to express an interest&#xD;
           in taking part, the RA will contact them to arrange an appointment. All potential&#xD;
           participants will have as long as they wish to consider the information sheet prior to&#xD;
           being contacted by the RA, with a minimum period of 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For potential participants entering the study through the clinician-referral pathway,&#xD;
           their clinicians will discuss the study with them and seek their verbal consent to pass&#xD;
           their details on to the research team. A trained and supervised RA will then obtain&#xD;
           contact details of potential participants from their clinicians and contact the&#xD;
           potential participants directly to discuss the study further. Consenting participants&#xD;
           will be given a participant information sheet and any initial questions will be&#xD;
           answered. As in the self-referral case, consenting participants will be recontacted&#xD;
           after a minimum period of 48 hours, with a longer period if required. They will also be&#xD;
           risk assessed, and the eligible ones will participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For those lacking research capacity, the same initial process will be followed. However&#xD;
           in England, the opinion of the potential participant's Consultee will be sought, and in&#xD;
           Scotland, consent from the appropriate person (see consent section) will be sought. In&#xD;
           both countries, the study will not proceed if there is any indication that the potential&#xD;
           participant objects to taking part.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3. Consenting Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the first meeting with the potential participant, the RA will ensure they have&#xD;
           received an information sheet. They will be given the option to review this again and&#xD;
           answer any further questions. All potential participants will be reminded that&#xD;
           participation is entirely voluntary and that deciding not to take part in the study will&#xD;
           have no impact upon the clinical care they receive. They will also be informed of their&#xD;
           right to withdraw from the study at any time, without giving a reason, and reassured&#xD;
           that exercising their right to withdraw will have no impact upon the ongoing care they&#xD;
           receive. Potential participants who still wish to take part will be asked to provide&#xD;
           written informed consent at this stage. Once this has been completed, the study will&#xD;
           commence. This process will be followed for referrers or clinicians who take part in the&#xD;
           qualitative study but adapted to consider the fact that they are not receiving care or&#xD;
           treatment. They will be assured that non-participation or withdrawal will have no effect&#xD;
           on their employment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Capacity is decision-specific. This means capacity to consent to medication or a&#xD;
           hospital admission is distinct from capacity to consent to research or psychological&#xD;
           therapy. Nonetheless, a number of potential participants will lack the capacity to&#xD;
           consent to both. As with a prior case-series, those with research capacity will be&#xD;
           included, but specialist ethical approval to include those who lack it has also been&#xD;
           secured.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Scotland, the legislative requirements of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act&#xD;
           2000, which makes provisions for research with this group will be followed. This means&#xD;
           that in Scotland, Guardians, Welfare Attorneys or nearest relatives will be asked to&#xD;
           provide consent on participants' behalf to taking part. They will be provided with&#xD;
           Research Ethics Committee (REC) approved information sheets and consent forms. In&#xD;
           England, the legislative requirements of the Mental Capacity (England and Wales) Act&#xD;
           2005, which also makes provisions for research with this group will be followed. This&#xD;
           means that in England, Consultees will be asked to provide advice (which is binding on&#xD;
           the researcher) as to whether a participant would wish to take part. They will be&#xD;
           provided with a REC-approved information sheet and consultee declaration form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a participant lacks capacity initially but regains it, their consent to continued&#xD;
           participation in the study will be sought. Participants will be provided with a&#xD;
           REC-approved continued participation information sheet and consent form designed for&#xD;
           those who regain capacity. If a participant has capacity initially but loses it during&#xD;
           the study, procedures for participants who lack capacity at the outset will be adhered&#xD;
           to. This means that in Scotland, Guardians, Welfare Attorneys or nearest relatives will&#xD;
           be asked to provide consent on participants' behalf so that they can continue&#xD;
           participating in the study. Participants will be provided with a REC-approved continued&#xD;
           participation information sheet and consent form. In England, Consultees will be asked&#xD;
           to provide advice (which is binding on the researcher) as to whether a participant would&#xD;
           wish to continue to take part. They will be provided with a REC-approved continued&#xD;
           participation information sheet and consultee declaration form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A trained RA will, in conjunction with the Principal Investigator, determine whether&#xD;
           participants have the capacity to give consent. The latter will ensure RAs and the Trial&#xD;
           Manager attend NHS Scotland and NHS England training on informed consent and working&#xD;
           with people who lack research capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4. Participant withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants can withdraw from the study at any point, without giving any reason and&#xD;
           without their legal rights or usual care being affected. Participants may also be&#xD;
           withdrawn if their continuation is deemed to be harmful. The data monitoring and ethics&#xD;
           committee (DMEC) will review all instances of adverse events, whether or not they are&#xD;
           judged to be attributable to the trial or interventions, and, based on this information,&#xD;
           determine whether the participant should be withdrawn. All events will be reported to&#xD;
           the REC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Advance consent from all participants with capacity will be sought to retain existing&#xD;
           data. This is in the event that they subsequently withdraw due to loss of contact, or&#xD;
           loss of capacity to consent to research, where they have not otherwise informed the&#xD;
           investigator that they wish their data to be removed. No data will be retained for&#xD;
           individuals who lose capacity if the legal representative (Scotland) or Consultee&#xD;
           (England) objects to this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. STUDY SUSPENSION OR DISCONTINUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research would be stopped in the event of a number of therapy-attributable adverse&#xD;
           events. As earlier noted, any serious adverse events will be passed on to the&#xD;
           independent DMEC for review and advice on whether to suspend or discontinue the study.&#xD;
           This advice would be acted upon by the researchers, in consultation with the Sponsor and&#xD;
           REC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. ADVERSE EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions being tested have each been used previously with people with psychosis,&#xD;
      including in randomised controlled trials and no severe adverse events have been reported.&#xD;
      However, to improve the recording and reporting of adverse effects of psychological&#xD;
      interventions, a robust protocol for assessing and managing any such risk will be completed&#xD;
      at end of treatment and at follow-up by RAs masked to treatment condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol, excluding the Adverse Events Questionnaire (which is designed to be completed&#xD;
      after treatment), will also be completed by clinicians during the intervention (i.e., every&#xD;
      session) to complete an assessment of severe adverse events. They will be instructed to&#xD;
      report all adverse events to the trial manager, using a standardised form.&#xD;

They will provide engagement, listening, positive regard and empathy, but they will not develop a psychological formulation, nor will they provide the person with information relating to their problems. They will also not provide self-help material, or encourage the person to test their beliefs, practice new strategies or develop a shared plan for the future. Once the trial is over, however, the therapist will offer to meet with the person to share the results of the assessment and develop a psychological formulation. With the participant's consent, this information will also be shared with the clinical team.</description>
