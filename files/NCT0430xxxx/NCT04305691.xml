    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ixazomib works in treating patients with Kaposi sarcoma.&#xD;
      Ixazomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the overall response rate of ixazomib in participants with Kaposi sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine safety and tolerability of ixazomib. II. Assess changes in Kaposi-sarcoma&#xD;
      associated herpesvirus (KSHV) viral load (VL) by ixazomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlate changes in KSHV VL with tumor response. IV. For human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV)-positive participants, assess changes in CD4 counts and HIV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess changes in quality of life during ixazomib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ixazomib orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      with complete or partial response may continue treatment for an additional 12 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks, then periodically&#xD;
      for up to 2 years.&#xD;

             the marker lesion(s) must be &gt;= 700 mm^2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have documentation of HIV status. If HIV negative, documentation of&#xD;
             a negative HIV rapid test within 21 days before enrollment. If HIV positive,&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Documentation of HIV diagnosis in the medical record by a licensed health care&#xD;
                  provider&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documentation of receipt of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (at least two different&#xD;
                  medications that do not constitute a prescription for pre exposure prophylaxis&#xD;
                  [PrEP]) by a licensed health care provider. Documentation may be a record of an&#xD;
                  ART prescription in the participant's medical record, a written prescription in&#xD;
                  the name of the participant for ART, or pill bottles for ART with a label showing&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) detection by a licensed HIV-1 RNA assay&#xD;
                  demonstrating &gt; 1000 RNA copies/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any licensed HIV screening antibody and/or HIV antibody/antigen combination assay&#xD;
                  confirmed by a second licensed HIV assay such as a HIV-1 Western blot&#xD;
                  confirmation or HIV rapid multispot antibody differentiation assay&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a kit that has been certified or&#xD;
                       licensed by an oversight body within the participating country and validated&#xD;
                       internally (e.g., United States [U.S.] Food and Drug Administration [FDA]).&#xD;
                       WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
                       Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result&#xD;
                       must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial&#xD;
                       assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either&#xD;
                       another type of rapid assay or an extracellular interactome assay (E/CIA&#xD;
                       )that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test&#xD;
                       principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma&#xD;
                       HIV-1 RNA viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 50%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count: &gt;= 1,000/mm^3 (within 21 days before enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin: &gt; 8 g/dL (within 21 days before enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets: &gt;= 75,000/mm^3 (within 21 days before enrollment). Platelet transfusions to&#xD;
             help participants meet eligibility criteria are not allowed within 3 days before study&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) (within 21 days&#xD;
             before enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the elevated bilirubin is felt to be secondary to indinavir or atazanavir&#xD;
                  therapy, then subjects will be allowed on protocol without any limit on the total&#xD;
                  bilirubin if the direct bilirubin is normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine levels within normal institutional limits; or, creatinine&#xD;
                  clearance &gt;= 30 mL/min (as calculated per the Cockcroft-Gault Equation (within 21&#xD;
                  days before enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, must have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac&#xD;
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification within 6&#xD;
             months before study enrollment. To be eligible for this trial, participants must be&#xD;
             class 2B or better within 6 months before enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ixazomib can cause fetal harm. For this reason and because proteasome inhibitors as&#xD;
             well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier&#xD;
             method of birth control and another method such as hormone contraception&#xD;
             simultaneously; abstinence) before study entry, the duration of study participation,&#xD;
             and 90 days after completion of ixazomib administration. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled&#xD;
             on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception or abstain from&#xD;
             heterosexual contact before the study, for the duration of study participation, and&#xD;
             for 90 days after completion of ixazomib administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If HIV positive, participants must have been on antiretroviral therapy with optimum&#xD;
             anti-viral response for at least 6 months with no evidence of KS shrinkage in the last&#xD;
             3 months. Changes of antiretroviral therapy within the prior 6 months for&#xD;
             toxicity/convenience reasons are allowed (as long as participants are on a stable&#xD;
             regimen for 4 weeks, but if any changes in anti-HIV therapy are due to inadequate HIV&#xD;
             control and occurred within the 6 months prior to protocol consent, the patient is not&#xD;
             eligible until 6 months after optimal control is reached and there is no KS regression&#xD;
             in the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If HIV positive, must have been on stable anti-retroviral therapy for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             on a protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimen or nucleoside reverse transcriptase&#xD;
             inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen of at least three drugs. The NNRTIs efavirenz and&#xD;
             etravirine are moderate CYP3A4 inducers and are allowed. There should be no intention&#xD;
             to change the regimen for the duration of the study. Participants who have a high&#xD;
             likelihood of better HIV management with a new antiretroviral regimen should defer&#xD;
             enrollment until the changes are in place and the new cART regimen meets the 4-week&#xD;
             criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ixazomib or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic systemic treatment using strong CYP3A inducers (rifampin, rifapentine,&#xD;
             rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), or use of St. John's wort is not&#xD;
             allowed. Patients who are on chronic use of strong CYP3A inducers must come off 14&#xD;
             days before receiving ixazomib treatment. Because the lists of these agents are&#xD;
             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list;&#xD;
             medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this&#xD;
             information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the participant&#xD;
             will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the participant is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection; uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. This&#xD;
             includes infections requiring systemic antibiotic therapy or other serious infection&#xD;
             within 14 days before study enrollment but excludes ongoing antibiotic therapy for&#xD;
             opportunistic infection (OI) prophylaxis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a second prior or concurrent malignancy that has a natural history&#xD;
             or treatment regimen that has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy&#xD;
             assessment of the investigational regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ixazomib is expected to cause&#xD;
             fetal harm if used during pregnancy. It is not known if ixazomib is excreted into&#xD;
             breast milk, but due to the potential for serious adverse events in a nursing infant,&#xD;
             breastfeeding must be discontinued during therapy and for 90 days after the last&#xD;
             ixazomib dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) before entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have not recovered from other adverse events due to prior anti-cancer&#xD;
             therapy (i.e., have residual toxicity &gt; grade 1), excluding alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for&#xD;
             hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]). All participants will be required to be screened&#xD;
             for hepatitis B. Participants with resolved infection (i.e. participants who are HBsAg&#xD;
             negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and/or&#xD;
             antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) must be screened using real-time&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels.&#xD;
             Participants who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Participants with&#xD;
             serologic findings suggestive of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination (anti-HBs&#xD;
             positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination,&#xD;
             do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants diagnosed with hepatitis C who are hepatitis C antibody positive, whether&#xD;
             hepatitis C RNA level is measurable or not, must have no evidence of cirrhosis and&#xD;
             have liver function tests that conform to the protocol inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral&#xD;
             absorption or tolerance of ixazomib including difficulty swallowing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with grade 1 peripheral neuropathy with pain on clinical examination&#xD;
             during the screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 14 days before enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with symptomatic visceral Kaposi sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had prior treatment that included a proteasome inhibitor&#xD;
