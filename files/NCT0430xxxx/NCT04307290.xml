    <textblock>
      Eighty patients were randomly assigned to either control (CON) or dexmedetomidine (DEX)&#xD;
      group. DEX group received a loading dose of 0.5 µg/ kg of intravenous dexmedetomidine over 10&#xD;
      minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 µg/kg/h until completion of the surgery.&#xD;
      CON group received the same calculated volume of normal saline. Pain outcomes, metabolic and&#xD;
      coagulative changes after tourniquet application, and after tourniquet release were&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A total of 80 patients aged between 20 and 80 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      (ASA) physical status class I-III, who were scheduled to undergo elective TKA were enrolled&#xD;
      in this study. Patients with history of rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or&#xD;
      renal disease, allergy to drug being studied, heart block greater than first degree, left&#xD;
      ventricle ejection fraction &lt; 55%, or chronic administration of anti-inflammatory drugs, or&#xD;
      opioids were excluded. Patients with tourniquet times of less than 60 minutes or longer than&#xD;
      150 minutes or with conversion to general anesthesia during surgery were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization sequence was created using Stata 9.0 (Stata Corp, College&#xD;
      Station, TX, USA) statistical software and was stratified by center with a 1:1 allocation&#xD;
      using random block sizes of 4. Assignments were concealed in sealed envelopes. Participants&#xD;
      were randomly assigned following simple randomization procedures (computerized random&#xD;
      numbers) to 1 of 2 treatment groups: DEX group (n = 40) received intravenous dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      (0.5 μg/kg bolus over 10 minutes, followed by 0.5 μg/kg/h infusion from 10 min before the&#xD;
      start of surgery to the end of surgery), and CON group (n = 40) received an equivalent volume&#xD;
      of normal saline bolus and infusion as placebo until the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, attending anesthesiologists responsible for patient care, and nurses were all&#xD;
      blinded to the anesthetic agent during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and perioperative care Standard monitoring included electrocardiography,&#xD;
      noninvasive arterial blood pressure monitoring, and pulse oximetry. All patients received&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia performed by an attending anesthesiologist and 500 mL Ringer's lactate&#xD;
      solution was administered for hydration before spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia was performed in the lateral decubitus position with the operative knee&#xD;
      uppermost. These patients received an intrathecal injection of 0.5% bupivacaine 15 mg in 5%&#xD;
      glucose at the level of L4-5 via using a 25-gauge needle. Patients were then turned to the&#xD;
      supine position and the level of sensory block evaluated by pinprick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peak level of sensory block, sensory dermatome at tourniquet pain, time between tourniquet&#xD;
      application and onset of pain, and tourniquet pain were performed by an independent&#xD;
      researcher at 5, 10, 15 and 20 min after the spinal injection and then at 10-minutes&#xD;
      intervals until the complete resolution of the sensory block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The affected extremity in all patients was exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage, and a&#xD;
      tourniquet was applied at a pressure of 300 mmHg during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a poorly localized, diffuse pain is felt by the patient at variable times after&#xD;
      tourniquet inflation, despite adequate sensory blockade during surgery, it was considered to&#xD;
      be induced by the tourniquet if it was unrelated to the surgical field, described as&#xD;
      tourniquet pain in the affected extremity. Supplemental analgesia with intravenous fentanyl&#xD;
      100 μg was to be administered if any patient experienced tourniquet pain at any time during&#xD;
      the procedure. General anesthesia would be induced if intravenous fentanyl supplementation&#xD;
      was insufficient. The need for supplemental intravenous fentanyl and any conversion to&#xD;
      general anesthesia were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When intraoperative bleeding occurred, volume replacement with Ringer's lactate solution was&#xD;
      managed according to the decision of an attending anesthesiologist instead of blood products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored every five minutes until the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotension was defined as a 30% reduction of basal MAP, which was treated with ephedrine 5&#xD;
      mg iv. When the HR was &lt;50 beats/minute (bradycardia), glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg was administered&#xD;
      intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of surgery, femoral nerve block to reduce postoperative pain were performed&#xD;
      using a bolus of 20 mL of ropivacaine 0.75%. Concurrently, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)&#xD;
      pump containing fentanyl 1000 μg, ketorolac 150 mg, and ramosetron 0.6 mg in a total volume&#xD;
      of 150 mL of saline was set to deliver a basal infusion of 2 mL/h and bolus doses of 1 mL,&#xD;
      with a 15-min lockout period for postoperative analgesia. PCA volume consumed at 24 and 48&#xD;
      hours after surgery and total PCA volume consumed for 48 hr after surgery. Postoperative pain&#xD;
      intensity at rest was measured using a 100 mm linear visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS score&#xD;
      for pain at rest was measured at 24 and 48 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fentanyl 100 μg was administered for a pain VAS ≥ 50 or ketorolac 30 mg was given for a pain&#xD;
      VAS &lt; 50 or upon patient request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of metabolic, coagulative and temperature changes. The arterial blood samples&#xD;
      were obtained from a radial artery at 1 minute just before the start of spinal anesthesia as&#xD;
      a baseline and at 10 min after tourniquet release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 mL of blood samples were extracted through radial artery and then 1 mL were collected in&#xD;
      the heparinized syringe; following this, the remaining blood samples were immediately sent&#xD;
      through the pneumatic tube system, guaranteeing their processing in the least amount of time&#xD;
      possible, not greater than 5 minutes by institutional standards. The metabolic variables&#xD;
      included pH, lactate, calcium, potassium, bicarbonate, CO2, base excess and coagulative&#xD;
      change included antithrombin III activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tympanic temperature measurements were made using Braun Thermoscan (Thermoscan Inc., San&#xD;
      Diego, CA) inserted into the auditory canal at 1 minute just before the start of spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia as a baseline and at 10 minutes after tourniquet release&#xD;
