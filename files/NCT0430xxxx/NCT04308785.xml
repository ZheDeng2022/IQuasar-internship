  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase II study to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of Atezolizumab with or without Tiragolumab as&#xD;
      consolidation therapy in participants with limited stage small cell lung cancer who have not&#xD;
      progressed during/after chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants can receive concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per local&#xD;
      standard of care, but they must be randomized within 6 weeks from completion of&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. Participants should receive 4 cycles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy dose&#xD;
      of 56-64 Gy (once daily) before randomization, and those participants who have not progressed&#xD;
      during/after CRT will be stratified by response to CRT, radiotherapy timing, and be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Atezolizumab+Tiragolumab arm or Atezolizumab+placebo arm.&#xD;

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 Questionnaire, is a validated, reliable self-report measure. It consists of 30 questions that assess five aspects of patient functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), global health/quality of life, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) with a recall period of the previous week. Scale scores can be obtained for the multi-item scales.</description>

    <description>The EORTC, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, QLQ-LC13 is a modular supplement to the EORTC quality-of-life questionnaire for use in lung cancer.

    <description>The EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire, 5-level version (EQ-5D-5L), is a validated self-report health status questionnaire that is used to calculate a health status utility score for use in health economic analyses. There are two components to the EQ-5D-5L: a five-item health state profile that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, as well as a visual analogue scale (VAS) that measures health state. Published weighting systems allow for creation of a single composite score of the patient's health status.</description>
