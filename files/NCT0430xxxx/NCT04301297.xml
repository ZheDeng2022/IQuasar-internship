    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise two types of chronic intestinal disorders: Crohn's&#xD;
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). CD involves the ileum and colon, but it can affect&#xD;
      any region of the intestine, often discontinuously. UC involves the rectum and may affect&#xD;
      part of the colon or the entire colon (pancolitis) in an un interrupted pattern. In Crohn's,&#xD;
      the inflammation is often transmural, whereas in Ulcerative colitis the inflammation is&#xD;
      typically confined to the mucosa . The extraintestinal manifestations of IBD are common and&#xD;
      may occur in 25%-40% of patients. Inflammatory manifestations in the skin, eyes, liver and&#xD;
      joints are considered primary manifestations. Development of primary extra intestinal&#xD;
      manifestation appears to increase the risk of developing a second extra intestinal&#xD;
      manifestation. Most IBD patients with extra intestinal manifestations have colonic&#xD;
      inflammation, although some patients develop them prior to the onset of colonic symptoms.&#xD;
      Extra intestinal manifestations are usually present at the time of active phase of IBD . In&#xD;
      recent years, there have been reports on renal and urologic complications of IBD. They were&#xD;
      mostly found to be related to ureteral obstruction by oxalate stones, cystitis, acute tubular&#xD;
      necrosis due to volume depletion and AA amyloidosis. Nephrolithiasis and obstructive uropathy&#xD;
      are especially seen with small bowel dysfunction. In a great proportion of IBD patients,&#xD;
      ureteral obstruction is not caused by stones. This non calculus obstruction can occur in&#xD;
      50%-73% of CD patients and 50% of UC patients, and is usually caused by retroperitoneal local&#xD;
      inflammation or by surgical complication (sutures) or colon cancer . There have also been&#xD;
      reports of interstitial nephritis, mainly due to applied anti-inflammatory therapy, such as&#xD;
      5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Serious renal impairment is reported to occur in 1 of 500&#xD;
      patients treated with 5-ASA derivative. On the other hand, there are some reports that renal&#xD;
      tubular damage is an extra intestinal manifestation of IBD and not a toxic side effect of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory therapy using 5-ASA or sulfasalazine. Furthermore, renal failure due to&#xD;
      glomerulonephritis (GN) caused by the immune complex has been reported in several cases as an&#xD;
      extraintestinal manifestation of IBD.&#xD;
