      Open label phase 2 investigational study of efficacy and safety of apremilast 30 mg BID in&#xD;
      chronic atopic dermatitis when added to the FDA approved treatment dupilumab for atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis that is not providing adequate clinical responses.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if apremilast as a combined treatment for atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis will provide increased efficacy outcomes in subjects who are currently using the&#xD;
      FDA approved therapy of dupilumab but have responded only partially or inadequately to this&#xD;
      therapy. Our hypothesis is that adding apremilast will allow patients to go from an&#xD;
      inadequate response to dupilumab to an adequate response defined as an Investigator Global&#xD;
      Assessment (IGA) of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed and dated informed consent indicating the subject has been informed of all&#xD;
             aspects of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject is willing and able to comply with treatment plan, study drug administration,&#xD;
             and study protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has a documented clinical diagnosis of chronic atopic dermatitis for at least&#xD;
             6 months prior to screening visit and is a candidate for systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must fulfill criteria outlined in the following clinical categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must be currently using and experiencing an inadequate response to&#xD;
                  dupilumab which is FDA approved for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic&#xD;
                  dermatitis. An inadequate response is defined as an IGA of 2 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At the time of screening, subject must have a partial or inadequate response to&#xD;
                  their current treatment regimen. A partial or inadequate response at screening is&#xD;
                  defined as having both of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Not having achieved an Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0 (clear) or 1&#xD;
                  (almost clear).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must be on dupilumab for at least 12 weeks and willing to continue on&#xD;
                  dupilumab on a stable dose (40 mg weekly or every other week) while also&#xD;
                  receiving the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             Screening and Baseline. While on investigational product and for at least 28 days&#xD;
             after taking the last dose of investigational product, FCBP who engage in activity in&#xD;
             which conception is possible must use one of the approved contraceptive options&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in&#xD;
             which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (male latex condom or&#xD;
             non-latex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example,&#xD;
             polyurethane]) while on study medication and for at least 28 days after the last dose&#xD;
             of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If receiving concomitant medications for any reason, must be on a stable regimen and&#xD;
             willing to stay on a stable regimen. This includes emollients, which should stay&#xD;
             stable throughout the study&#xD;

        subject's lifetime prior to Baseline Visit or major psychiatric illness requiring&#xD;
        hospitalization within 3 years prior to Baseline Visit. Depression and suicidality will be&#xD;
        assessed through standard-of-care questioning 3. Other than atopic dermatitis, any&#xD;
        clinically significant (as determined by the Investigator) cardiac, endocrinologic,&#xD;
        pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric, hepatic, renal, hematologic, immunologic disease, or&#xD;
        other major disease that is currently uncontrolled 4. Any condition, which places the&#xD;

        ability to interpret data from the study 6. Pregnant or lactating females 7. Concomitant&#xD;
        therapy with CYP450 enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine,&#xD;
        phenytoin), which may cause loss of efficacy of apremilast.&#xD;
&#xD;

             cervix with no evidence of recurrence within the previous 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             11. Use of dupilimab in combination with any other systemic immunosuppressant&#xD;

&#xD;
             12. Use of any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to randomization, or 5&#xD;
