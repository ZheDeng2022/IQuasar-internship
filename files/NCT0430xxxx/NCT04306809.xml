    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Internet-delivered Acceptance&#xD;
      and commitment therapy for PTSD and comorbid chronic pain. First, a pilot study (no&#xD;
      randomization; N=10) will be conducted to test the intervention and assessment procedures.&#xD;
      This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial with waitlist control. The&#xD;
      participants will go through an active internet-based ACT treatment focused on education&#xD;
      about PTSD, value-based exposure for the traumatic memory and avoided situations, and&#xD;
      behavior change through exercises targeting the processes mindfulness, cognitive defusion and&#xD;
      acceptance. The treatment is delivered on a safe internet platform. Participants have planned&#xD;
      telephone contact with their assigned psychologist 3 times during the program and can also&#xD;
      contact their psychologist via a message system in the platform and expect answer within 48&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;

      Objective: The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Internet-delivered&#xD;
      Acceptance and commitment therapy (iACT) for PTSD and comorbid chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 10 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design: All participants are offered treatment. Participants are recruited from the&#xD;
      Pain Rehabilitation Unit at Skåne University Hospital. The unit is a government supported,&#xD;
      regional specialist center focused on assessment and treatment of chronic pain and related&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Baseline and post treatment (2 weeks after treatment) assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted by an assessor who is trained to administer the study measures. Self-report&#xD;
      measures will also collected at this time, post treatment (2 weeks after treatment) as well&#xD;
      as during a 3-month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-and post assessment: Assessors will collect demographic information, self-report&#xD;
      measures, and trauma history. During the pre- and post-assessment the Clinician-Administered&#xD;
      PTSD Scale for DSM-5 will be administered to establish PTSD whether participants met the&#xD;
      DSM-5 criteria for PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pre-assessment the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0 (MINI) will&#xD;
      be administered to detect the presence of other comorbid disorders and assess inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and rule out exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment exit interview: At the post-assessment, the assigned assessor will ask&#xD;
      participants about their satisfaction with and experience of the program, what they found&#xD;
      helpful or unhelpful and suggestions for future improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment: During treatment the treatment credibility scale will be administered to&#xD;
      assess the patients' perceptions of how credible the treatment is following the introduction&#xD;
      of the treatment rationale and the main treatment components (included in the internet&#xD;
      program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety parameters: As a mean to monitor safety and progress participants complete two&#xD;
      self-report measures within the program (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 [PCL-5] and Hospital&#xD;
      anxiety and depression scale [HADS] twice during the program and the therapist can follow&#xD;
      these scores. In addition, participants can report any adverse events during treatment, at&#xD;
      post treatment and follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Self-report measures will be mailed to participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main statistical analysis: Between-group estimates on outcome will be conducted using&#xD;
      repeated measurements. The analyses will be conducted using intention to treat principles and&#xD;
      post hoc comparisons.&#xD;
