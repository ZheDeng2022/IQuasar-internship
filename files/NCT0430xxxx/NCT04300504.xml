  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence suggests that dynapenic abdominal obesity is associated with a greater risk&#xD;
      of falls, functional disability and hospitalisation compared to those with dynapenia, obesity&#xD;
      or neither phenotype. Understanding the pathogenesis underlying this phenotype has the&#xD;
      potential to inform potential treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs can act as messengers at the cellular level to promote or block processes for&#xD;
      muscle growth and repair, amongst other things. There is evidence that ageing changes&#xD;
      microRNA levels in the muscle and that these changes may result in reduced muscle quality and&#xD;
      quantity. However, it is not known whether being obese can change microRNA levels in muscle&#xD;
      and how this relates to physical performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of dynapenic abdominal obesity on microRNA&#xD;
      levels in serum and muscle quality and quantity in the legs of older women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, cross-sectional study. The investigators will recruit 4 groups of&#xD;
      older women: normal weight, normal weight with dynapenia, obese and obese with dynapenia. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure the microRNA levels in serum. The investigators will measure the&#xD;
      quantity and fat content of muscle in the legs using magnetic resonance imaging. Muscle&#xD;
      strength, fatigue and balance will be measured using gait (walking) analysis, balance tests,&#xD;
      and a machine designed to measure leg strength and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure and compare microRNA levels between groups. The investigators&#xD;
      will use databases and computer programmes to look at all of the microRNAs which are&#xD;
      different between groups and see how they affect the muscle. The investigators will compare&#xD;
      muscle strength, size and fatigue between groups. The investigators will explore&#xD;
      relationships of muscle quantity and quality measures with microRNA changes in the muscle.&#xD;
      This approach will allow the investigators to understand how obesity affects the microRNA&#xD;
      profile of muscle and whether this translates into impairment of function and mobility.&#xD;
