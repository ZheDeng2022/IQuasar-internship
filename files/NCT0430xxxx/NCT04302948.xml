  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing treatment&#xD;
      as usual (TaU) for HCV screening (rapid anti-HCV screening and referral) to a intervention&#xD;
      screening that includes TaU plus a rapid point-of-care HCV RNA test in persons experiencing&#xD;
      homelessness. The primary outcome of interest is linkage-to-care. Linkage to care is defined&#xD;
      as evaluation by a health care provider for HCV infection within 30 days of baseline&#xD;
      screening and referral. We will compare the proportion of patients who are evaluated by a&#xD;
      provider within the 30 day window in each study arm: (1) participants who screened positive&#xD;
      with rapid anti-HCV and are referred for evaluation) and (2) Rapid HCV RNA plus TaU (those&#xD;
      who tested positive with both rapid anti-HCV and confirmatory RNA and are also referred to a&#xD;
      provider.) Secondarily, the investigators will also assess HCV RNA levels in both groups&#xD;
      twelve weeks after treatment ends (24 to 36 weeks after anti-HCV screening) to determine the&#xD;
      percent of individuals who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR12), which is a marker&#xD;
      for cure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The goal of this study is to simplify the HCV testing process using combined rapid&#xD;
           screening and confirmation in order to reduce early barriers and improve linkage to care&#xD;
           among a vulnerable high-risk homeless population. The investigators are partnering with&#xD;
           Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless (AHCH) to conduct rapid testing and provide&#xD;
           counseling, test results, and referrals directly on site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After Rapid HCV testing the investigators will randomize participants to 1) counseling&#xD;
           and referral to a provider, or 2) Rapid RNA testing plus counseling and referrals to a&#xD;
           provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's primary is to to assess linkage to care, which is the percent of subjects who are&#xD;
      evaluated by a provider specifically for HCV infection in both groups. Linkage to care will&#xD;
      be determined via medical chart abstraction 30 days after testing. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that there will be a 30% absolute difference in linkage to care between study&#xD;
      arms, with a higher percent of participants in the combined rapid testing group being linked&#xD;
      to a provider for evaluation relative to the control group (rapid anti-HCV alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study's second aim is exploratory in nature and sequentially follows the first aim.&#xD;
           The investigators will also assess HCV Cascade of care in both group, and by medical&#xD;
           chart abstraction (up to 36 weeks after study entry) to determine the number and&#xD;
           proportion of individuals who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR12), which is a&#xD;
           marker for cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study's third aim is a qualitative inquiry into the use of supportive services by&#xD;
           participants during treatment. Such services may include social work, case management,&#xD;
           patient navigation, participation in support groups, etc. The investigators will review&#xD;
           medical charts for this information. The investigators are interested to see if more&#xD;
           individuals in one study arm will access one or more of these supportive services&#xD;
           compared to the other study arm.&#xD;
