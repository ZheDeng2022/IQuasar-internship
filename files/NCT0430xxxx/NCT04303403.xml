  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study to find out if the drug trametinib in combination with&#xD;
      ruxolitinib is safe, tolerable and has beneficial effects in people who has certain type of&#xD;
      cancers including the type that you have. Patients with RAS mutant colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma are invited to participate in this study. This is the first time&#xD;
      that both trametinib and ruxolitinib are studied in combination. Trametinib is marketed in&#xD;
      several countries with the brand name Mekinist® for the treatment of melanoma (a type of skin&#xD;
      cancer). Trametinib has been studied extensively in cancer and has been tested in many&#xD;
      patients. Ruxolitinib is an oral inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 tyrosine kinases and is approved&#xD;
      for treatment of adult polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib has been studied&#xD;
      extensively in many patients.&#xD;
