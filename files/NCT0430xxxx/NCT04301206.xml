    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medical Helpline 1813 (Capital Region, Denmark) handles acute, non-life-threatening&#xD;
      medical emergencies. Approx. 200,000 calls/year concern children (ref: Rasmussen et al), and&#xD;
      about 30% are referred to a pediatric urgent care center. However, many of these children&#xD;
      presents very mild symptoms, which require neither treatment nor paraclinical tests, merely&#xD;
      parental guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to empower the parents when handling their sick children by videos and simple text&#xD;
      accessible from their smartphone. We want the parents to handle mild symptoms at home and to&#xD;
      know when they must contact the medical helpline 1813 or a general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have produced 8 short videos and simple texts about the most common symptoms in sick&#xD;
      children. The material covers about 70% of the symptoms in acute sick children. The material&#xD;
      is developed in collaboration between pediatricians and professional movie producers and is&#xD;
      approved by the Danish Society of Pediatrics and other relevant medical societies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be studied if the new material about symptoms in sick children result in 5% higher&#xD;
      parental self-efficacy among the parents who were allowed to watch the material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it will be studied if the new material resulted in less children examined by a&#xD;
      doctor, and satisfied parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents who call the medical helpline about a medically ill child aged 6 months to 12 years&#xD;
      will be offered to try the new material. If they accept, every second parent will be allowed&#xD;
      given access to the new material, and every other parent will receive the usual triage by&#xD;
      telephone. The results of these otherwise similar groups will be compared. Parents answer&#xD;
      surveys about their experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yield:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videos and simple text may empower parents to handle their sick children. The study may&#xD;
      result in fewer children referred to hospitals, more appropriate use of resources and better&#xD;
      experiences for the families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year there are approximately 200.000 calls regarding sick children younger than 12 years&#xD;
      (injuries excluded) to the medical helpline 1813 in the Capital Region of Denmark (ref:&#xD;
      Rasmussen et al). These children are not so ill that the parents call the emergency helpline&#xD;
      112, but the parents need to contact the health care system outside their general&#xD;
      practitioners' opening hours. After contact with the parents, the medical helpline health&#xD;
      professionals (primarily physicians or nurses) may either: 1) refer the child to a pediatric&#xD;
      department, 2) refer child to assessment in a pediatric urgent care center, 3) guide the&#xD;
      parents on how to perform self-care at home or 4) advice the child to the general&#xD;
      practitioners next work day. About 40 % of the calls to 1813 regarding children are referred&#xD;
      to a hospital. We estimate that 40 % of those presents mild symptoms, which often does not&#xD;
      require treatment or paraclinical tests and many could have benefitted from being observed at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviews conducted in child health related areas, have indicated that quality of health&#xD;
      information varies significantly and Internet searches may reveal information that is not&#xD;
      evidence-based, or may even be inconsistent with international treatment recommendations&#xD;
      (ref: Pehora et al, Fahy et al). Often health information will also focus on diagnosis, not&#xD;
      symptoms, which makes it difficult for parents to navigate the health directions. The study&#xD;
      objective is to investigate if it is possible by using videos and simple action cards about&#xD;
      common symptoms in children - to empower parents and citizens to take better care of sick&#xD;
      children with milder symptoms at home including to know when they must call for medical help.&#xD;
      This project therefore aims to, by increasing parental knowledge, decrease the number of&#xD;
      children admitted to the hospital with mild symptoms, and to decrease the number of children&#xD;
      with late arrival to the hospital with symptoms on critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight videos have been produced, each lasting about 2-3 minutes, about the following common&#xD;
      symptoms: 1) vomiting or diarrhea, 2) difficulties in breathing, 3) fever, 4) abdominal pain,&#xD;
      5) sore throat, 6) a red eye, 7) pain in the ears, and 8) exanthemas. The videos will be&#xD;
      accompanied by text, action cards, and be accessible on a smartphone. The information is in&#xD;
      Danish. The material has been developed in collaboration between pediatricians (medical&#xD;
      content) and professional film/app-makers (creative content) and has been approved by the&#xD;
      Danish Society of Pediatrics and other relevant scientific societies. We want to study the&#xD;
      clinical value of this material before we launch the campaign to the public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents with children aged between 6 months - 11.9 years will, when contacting the medical&#xD;
      helpline 1813, be offered to receive a new information material. If they accept, they will be&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention group (randomized to the new material composed of 8 videos and&#xD;
      corresponding smart cards) or to the control group (randomized to current standard care). The&#xD;
      participants will the following day receive a text message with six questions on&#xD;
      self-efficacy and satisfaction. If the caretaker does not fill out the electronical&#xD;
      questionnaire, they will receive a reminder the next day. All case reports of the included&#xD;
      children will be reviewed and if admitted to a hospital in the Capital Region of Denmark&#xD;
      within 72 hours of the call, the diagnosis, duration and treatment will be registered. For&#xD;
      the intervention group, the use of the material will be logged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size We want to be able to detect if the intervention with videos and action cards&#xD;
      increases the proportions of parents who expressed high self-efficacy by 5%. We do not know&#xD;
      this actual proportion. If it is actually 50%, we want to detect an increase to 55%. We want&#xD;
      a p-value of 0.05 and a probability (power) of 80%. It will require data from about 3300&#xD;
      text-messages in total, randomized in two equal groups&#xD;
      (http://www.openepi.com/SampleSize/SSCohort.htm). We suggest we have data to answer our&#xD;
      research question within 3 months, and the study will be stopped after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and transparency The parents are informed about the study by an automatic voice&#xD;
      message when contacting the medical helpline 1813. Their acceptance to the study is their&#xD;
      informed consent. The project will be described in short at the webpage of the Copenhagen&#xD;
      Emergency Service, where it will be possible to access additional information via a link to&#xD;
      the study at Clinical Trials. The telephone call will be recorded in the Emergency Medical&#xD;
      Services system, based on the actual regular routine. The protocol has been submitted to the&#xD;
      Ethics Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark, who considered it outside their mandate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the project the data will be completely anonymized and it is in no way possible to link&#xD;
      data with actual people. The study will be registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ before&#xD;
      enrolment of the first patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of serious adverse events the study group will consider stopping the study. This&#xD;
      will also be the case if the satisfaction with the contact to the medical helpline 1813 drops&#xD;
      to a very low level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-parametric statistics, two-sided and with significance at p-value &lt;0.05. After one week,&#xD;
      we will perform an interim analysis to study the frequency of acceptance, and the frequency&#xD;
      of high self-efficacy, as well as how the videos have worked technically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives and possible yield:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of positive effect, it must be decided if the videos and action cards will be an&#xD;
      integrated option at the medical helpline 1813. Moreover, it may be considered if the&#xD;
      material is released to all of Denmark. The material could be accessible at smartphones,&#xD;
      iPads, laptops and easy to find on different major national websites.&#xD;
