  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Having an aesthetic smile has become very common among patients today. Recent studies have&#xD;
      shown that people aged 18-49 want to have whiter and brighter teeth. The demand for whitening&#xD;
      has increased by 300% in the last 5 years. New materials and equipment have been developed to&#xD;
      meet this demand, and various whitening techniques have been developed for use at home and in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Determination of color in dentistry; It can be divided into two categories&#xD;
      with the help of visual and computer-aided devices. Eye color determination is the most&#xD;
      widely used method during the construction of a indirect restoration. The evaluation of tooth&#xD;
      color by eye is quite subjective. Physiological variables such as external light source,&#xD;
      experience, age and human eye fatigue, color blindness cause inadequate results. Due to&#xD;
      interpersonal detection differences during color perception, the lack of standardization in&#xD;
      the determination of tooth color can be improved with the use of computer-aided devices such&#xD;
      as spectroradiometer, spectrophotometer, colorimeter and with the help of film-based&#xD;
      photographs and digital photographs. Spectrophotometric approach; the point of view is&#xD;
      interesting, as it allows for an objective application, regardless of the practitioner's&#xD;
      experience. The color selection made with the use of these devices provides a potential&#xD;
      advantage over the color selection made with the eye. Because these measurements are&#xD;
      objective, can be counted and can be obtained faster. Although widespread uses of computer&#xD;
      aided colorimeters and spectrophotometers have been reported in dental studies, most devices&#xD;
      are not suitable for routine clinical use. Color analysis with these computer-aided devices&#xD;
      may cause inaccurate results especially in the evaluation of translucent objects such as&#xD;
      teeth. Therefore, a combination using both eyes and devices should be used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tooth color; It is formed by the combination of enamel, dentin and pulp with different&#xD;
      optical properties. Tooth coloring is divided into two as etiological, internal and external.&#xD;
      External colorants can be removed simply by cleaning. Removal of intrinsic coloring is&#xD;
      possible with chemical bleaching. In the treatment of tooth coloring, whitening is considered&#xD;
      the least aggressive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the increasing interest in aesthetics in recent years, patients' demands for teeth&#xD;
      whitening have increased. Home-bleaching technique, developed by Haywood and Heymann in 1989,&#xD;
      has been the most frequently used method until recently. In this method, the bleaching agent&#xD;
      contains 10% hydrogen peroxide. For 2-5 weeks, whitening is performed by placing the gel in a&#xD;
      plate by the patient every night. The advantages of this method are that it is easy to apply,&#xD;
      low cost, use of lower rates of hydrogen peroxide, and less time spent in the clinic.&#xD;
      However, the disadvantages are that the whitening process is not under the control of the&#xD;
      physician, the patient does not apply the whitening gel regularly, and the procedure takes&#xD;
      several weeks. Office-bleaching technique has been developed in order to make the bleaching&#xD;
      process more controlled, to ensure color stability and to shorten the time. This technique,&#xD;
      which contains a high concentration of (15-38%) hydrogen peroxide, is activated by heat or&#xD;
      light sources. These sources include plasma arc, LED, UV lamps and laser. However, there is&#xD;
      no consensus on the effectiveness of heat and light sources used in tooth whitening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The light sources used during bleaching are expected to increase the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      bleaching and shorten the processing time. Among these, plasma arc and diode lasers have a&#xD;
      wide range of uses. Laser teeth whitening method has been applied for about 15 years and many&#xD;
      laser devices have been recommended for this procedure. It is expected that the treatment&#xD;
      time will decrease and the sensitivity that may occur in the teeth will decrease as a result&#xD;
      of laser application. However, the superiority of laser bleaching compared to other methods&#xD;
      is still controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External root resorption and irritation in soft tissues can be observed during the teeth&#xD;
      whitening, even if in a small amount. It is stated that the sensitivity of teeth after the&#xD;
      procedure is the most common complication by some researchers, but disappears by itself after&#xD;
      the end of the bleaching process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of aesthetic applications in dentistry; morphological, optical and biological&#xD;
      compatibility. Tooth color is one of the most important criteria of aesthetics. Clinically,&#xD;
      two different methods are used in color selection. The first, visual method, includes&#xD;
      evaluation with the naked eye. The second method is colorimeter, spectrophotometer etc. is&#xD;
      the use of devices that measure color. During clinical applications, color selection of&#xD;
      dental materials is done by using visual scales. Color selection by visual method is both&#xD;
      subjective and difficult; it can also lead to inadequate results. During color selection,&#xD;
      erroneous results may occur due to parameters such as ambient light, physician's experience&#xD;
      and age, and eye fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to these existing disadvantages, systems such as spectrophotometers, colorimeters,&#xD;
      digital color meters have been launched to assist the physician in color selection. In&#xD;
      dentistry, spectrophotometers and colorimeters are used to overcome problems related to color&#xD;
      selection with the eye. Although the visual method is used more in the selection of colors by&#xD;
      clinicians, it is stated that the color measurements made by using the visual method and&#xD;
      spectrophotometer together are quite successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Color is formed by the merge of wavelengths in a light beam. In order for an object to be&#xD;
      visible, it must emit light or reflect light from a light source. From the point of view of&#xD;
      dentistry, the property of objects to reflect the incoming light is more important. The&#xD;
      incoming light usually consists of a mixture of various wavelengths, that is, it has a&#xD;
      polychromatic feature. When light comes on an object, it absorbs certain wavelengths and&#xD;
      reflects certain wavelengths. The human eye can distinguish light between wavelengths of&#xD;
      400-700 nμ. Nerve responses play a big role in the appearance of color. As a result of&#xD;
      attached stimulation, the eye gets tired and the reaction of the eye decreases. Color&#xD;
      separation is a subjective issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first color specification was proposed by CIE in 1931. Although this system was developed&#xD;
      in the following years, its principles have still not changed. CIE system uses 3 variables,&#xD;
      X, Y and Z. These variables are based on the spectral response functions defined by the CIE&#xD;
      observer. The CIE chromaticity diagram is also used to define the exact color. In another CIE&#xD;
      color system, three variables are used: L *, a * and b *.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spectrophotometer is a photometric appliance that is used to measure the transmittance,&#xD;
      reflection and true absorption of color. They contain prisms or dispersing parts to create a&#xD;
      continuous color line in their structure. Spectrophotometric color measurements may vary&#xD;
      depending on the light source used and the measurement mode. Some spectrophotometers can be&#xD;
      used according to two different measurement modes: Specular Component Included (SCI) and&#xD;
      Excluded (SCE). Many types of standard light source are also used for color measurement of&#xD;
      dental materials. These devices give three stimulus values x, y, z or CIE L *, a *, b *.&#xD;
      These values can be converted into numerical values and color variables of different objects&#xD;
      can be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the color change caused by laser-activated and chemically&#xD;
      activated vital whitening systems with two different evaluation methods (digital camera and&#xD;
      spectrophotometer). In this way, a comparison of the effectiveness of both the whitening&#xD;
      systems and the reliability of the evaluation methods will be made. It is also aimed to&#xD;
      determine the sensitivity of the teeth that may occur during and after bleaching.&#xD;
