      INTRODUCTION: The pharmaco-invasive strategy is a safe alternative to primary percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ST elevation acute myocardial infarction, who&#xD;
      cannot be in the cathlab in less than 120 minutes. However, previous studies of this strategy&#xD;
      used the femoral artery as the main vascular access. Current studies show that the use of the&#xD;
      radial artery in cases of acute myocardial infarction minimizes the risk of bleeding and&#xD;
      mortality. Therefore, in the scenario where vascular access through the forearm vessels is&#xD;
      recommended, the best timing to perform cardiac catheterization in the pharmaco-invasive&#xD;
      strategy is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the 24-hour hemoglobin drop (acute anemia) between the fast&#xD;
      pharmaco-invasive strategy (within 3 hours) and the standard pharmaco-invasive strategy (3 to&#xD;
      24 hours) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by coronary occlusion treated in&#xD;
      Sancta Maggiore hospitals in São Paulo and underwent to cardiac catheterization through the&#xD;
      forearm vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: A prospective, randomized, multicenter study will be conducted in which 120 subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly divided for fast and standard cardiac catheterization (1: 1). Stent&#xD;
      implantation in the culprit vessel will be performed. The primary objective is to assess&#xD;
      whether the fast cardiac catheterization is non-inferior to the standard strategy for a&#xD;
      hemoglobin (Hb) drop within 24 hours. Considering in the control group an average drop of Hb&#xD;
      0.6 ± 1g / dl and that a drop greater than 3 g/dL of Hb is related to unfavorable clinical&#xD;
      outcome, using a two-tailed alpha of 0.05 and a power of 90% to test the non-inferiority of&#xD;
      the fast strategy with respect to standard strategy, each group will require 60 patients,&#xD;
      totaling 120 individuals to include. However, if Hb fall in the fast strategy is greater than&#xD;
      3 g/dL and this result does not reproduce in the standard strategy, the study will allow us&#xD;
      to show the superiority of the standard approach (between 3 and 24 hours).&#xD;

      The FARAD MI will be a randomized, multicenter prospective study will be conducted. Patients&#xD;
      with the diagnosis of ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction treated at the Sancta&#xD;
      Maggiore Emergency Departments who have been thrombolyzed and aged up to 80 years will be&#xD;
      included. After thrombolysis, patients will be immediately transferred to the Sancta Maggiore&#xD;
      Hospital Itaim Unit and should arrive less than 3 hours after thrombolytic completion. When&#xD;
      they arrive at the Interventional Cardiology Department, they will be explained about the&#xD;
      study and offered to participate in the trial with consequent signature of the informed&#xD;
      consent form. Thereafter, electrocardiogram and blood collection will be performed for&#xD;
      laboratory tests, including hemoglobin, and patients will be randomized (1:1) to fast&#xD;
      pharmaco-invasive strategy (within 3 hours of thrombolytic completion) and standard&#xD;
      pharmaco-invasive strategy (3-24 hours). They will stay in the Interventional Cardiology&#xD;
      Department until the procedure is performed and then the in-hospital care will be continued.&#xD;
      Twenty-four hours after admission to the Interventional Cardiology Department, a new&#xD;
      hemoglobin collection will be performed. Patients who refuse to participate in the trial will&#xD;
      not have any harm in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome. Patients will receive standard&#xD;
      clinical therapy, including dual antiplatelet therapy. Stent implantation will be performed&#xD;
      in the culprit vessel by AMI. The treatment of residual coronary artery disease (coronary&#xD;
      lesions with obstruction greater than 70% or with evidence of ischemia) will be discussed&#xD;
      with the Clinical Cardiology team during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected: gender, age, ST-segment elevation location on the&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), symptoms duration, time from first evaluation to ECG (door-to-ECG),&#xD;
      time from first evaluation until thrombolytic administration (door-to-needle), thrombolytic&#xD;
      used, medications administered at the origin unit, time between the end of thrombolytic and&#xD;
      the beginning of cardiac catheterization, type of procedure (diagnosis and / or&#xD;
      intervention), date and time of procedure, access site, radiation dose, contrast volume,&#xD;
      associated comorbidities, laboratory, weight, height, BMI, coronary artery disease pattern&#xD;
      (Syntax Score), vessel culprit for AMI, type and size of stent used, successful intervention,&#xD;
      coronary flow at the end of the procedure (TIMI), angioplasty technique, residual coronary&#xD;
      artery disease approach, bleeding (BARC), major cardiovascular adverse events (MACE), any&#xD;
      cause and cardiovascular death. The hemoglobin of the patient's admission to the&#xD;
      Interventional Cardiology Department and its variation after 24 hours will be evaluated. If&#xD;
      red blood cell transfusion is required, pre-transfusion hemoglobin will be considered for&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from each patient will be registered in the REDCap platform in a electronic case report&#xD;
      form (CRF) and will be submitted to statistical analysis using the Statistical Package for&#xD;
      the Social Sciences (SPSS) 24 program. The REDCap has some important characteristics such as&#xD;
      role-based authentication and security; real-time data validation and integrity checking;&#xD;
      data assignment and audit capability; storage and sharing of protocols; central storage and&#xD;
      backup of data and data export in formats compatible with known analysis programs as Excel,&#xD;
      SPSS, Statistical Analysis System (SAS), Stata, R software, among others. Data will be&#xD;
      audited by an independent team from Prevent Senior's Institute of Education and Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have the following characteristics will not be included in this trial:&#xD;
      contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy, such as active internal bleeding, clinical signs&#xD;
      of acute aortic dissection, traumatic or prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (&gt; 10&#xD;
      minutes), head trauma in the last four weeks, history of intracranial neoplasia, ischemic&#xD;
      stroke in the past year or previous haemorrhagic stroke, pregnancy, sustained severe&#xD;
      hypertension (≥180 mmHg systolic pressure and / or ≥110 mmHg diastolic pressure), trauma or&#xD;
      major surgery in the last four weeks, use of oral anticoagulants, history of liver or kidney&#xD;
      failure; did not meet reperfusion criteria upon arrival at the Interventional Cardiology&#xD;
      Service of the Sancta Maggiore Hospital Itaim Unit (no improvement in chest pain or reduction&#xD;
      in ST-segment elevation below 50% after thrombolytic administration); having femoral access&#xD;
      as the first choice for invasive stratification; bleeding complications prior to cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization, such as important hematoma and stroke; acute pulmonary edema (dyspnea of&#xD;
      cardiac etiology with increased respiratory effort, hypoxemia and / or desaturation);&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock (systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg associated with signs of tissue&#xD;
      hypoperfusion, such as oliguria, altered level of consciousness, cyanosis, cold and wet&#xD;
      extremities, or vasopressor drug use); do not accept to sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be studied according to the precepts of the Helsinki Declaration and the&#xD;
      Nuremberg Code, respecting the Research Norms Involving Human Beings (National Health Council&#xD;
      resolution: 466/12) of the National Health Council. The study will be explained to patients&#xD;
      when they are admitted to the Interventional Cardiology Department of the Sancta Maggiore&#xD;
      Itaim Hospital and will be required to sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF) before any&#xD;
      invasive procedure is performed. Randomization will be performed through a specific site&#xD;
      after signing the consent form. The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      the Prevent Senior Research Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform the sample calculation, the study of Bertrand OF et al (2010) was used to evaluate&#xD;
      the variation of hemoglobin (Hb) in 24 hours after coronary angioplasty by radial approach.&#xD;
      The control group had a mean hemoglobin drop of 0.6 ± 1g / dL and there were worse outcomes&#xD;
      in patients with a hemoglobin drop greater than 3g / dL. (22) Therefore, considering in the&#xD;
      control group a mean Hb fall of 0.6 ± 1g / dl and a fall greater than 3 g/dL of Hb is related&#xD;
      to an unfavorable clinical outcome, using a two-tailed alpha of 0.05 and a power of 90% to&#xD;
      test the non-inferiority of the fast strategy over the standard strategy, each group will&#xD;
      require 60 patients, totaling 120 individuals to be included. However, if the Hb drop in the&#xD;
      fast strategy is greater than 3 g/dL and this result does not reproduce in the standard&#xD;
      strategy, the study will allow us to show the superiority of the strategy between 3 and 24&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intention-to-treat assessment will be performed. Categorical variables will be presented&#xD;
      as absolute numbers and percentages. Continuous variables will be presented as mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation or median (interquartile range) according to their distribution. The&#xD;
      distribution evaluation of continuous variables will be tested with Shapiro-Wilk. For&#xD;
      continuous variables, the Student's t-test (normal distribution) or Wilcoxon-rank (non-normal&#xD;
      distribution) will be used according to their distribution. For categorical variables the&#xD;
      Chi-square test will be used.&#xD;
