  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the genetic and environmental etiology of&#xD;
      early infant effortful control and infant feeding behaviors, and preschool executive&#xD;
      functioning and eating behaviors. An additional purpose is to establish whether these four&#xD;
      constructs (infant effortful control; infant feeding behaviors; preschool executive&#xD;
      functioning; and preschool eating behaviors) have shared genetic and / or environment&#xD;
      etiologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Evaluate the extent to which genetic influences on infants' effortful control of behavior&#xD;
      are modified by prenatal diet, exercise and stress (2) Estimate the extent to which infant&#xD;
      effortful control of behavior predicts and shares genetic influences with preschool executive&#xD;
      functioning, and preschool eating behaviors. (3) Identify which genes are associated with&#xD;
      infant effortful control behavior, preschool executive functioning, and preschool eating&#xD;
      behaviors. (4) Examine whether there is a pattern of bacteria in the gut microbiome which&#xD;
      associates with infant effortful control of behavior, preschool executive functioning, and&#xD;
      preschool eating behaviors.&#xD;

      The Baylor Infant Twin Study will conduct data collection at four time points. Three visits&#xD;
      will occur at the Children's Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) Metabolic Research Unit at 4&#xD;
      months, 6 months and 12 months. At 4 and 6 months of age, a home visit will also be&#xD;
      conducted. At 24 months of age, study related questionnaires will be sent by postal mail to&#xD;
      be completed and returned to research study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of each visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 months: Mother and twin infants will be admitted to the Children's Nutrition Research&#xD;
      Center (CNRC) Metabolic Research Unit (MRU) at four months corrected gestational age, written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained. At the initial visit, procedures for each infant and mother will be&#xD;
      completed. For each infant, the procedures to be completed at 4 months will be (1) an&#xD;
      observation of the infant's feeding; for this procedure, while the mother is feeding a infant&#xD;
      his/her formula or breast milk(bottle or by breast), a video camera will be recording the&#xD;
      session. If needed, research staff will coordinate timing so that the infants are fed so that&#xD;
      one follows the other. On the other hand, if the infants are usually fed together (tandem&#xD;
      feeding of twin infants), the feeding bottles (or nursing at breast) will be given to each&#xD;
      infant at the same time and mother will feed twin infants together during the feeding episode&#xD;
      as she normally would do. (2) During the feeding episode, for infants who are being bottle&#xD;
      fed, the mother will be asked to use an ordinary infant feeding bottle with an added special&#xD;
      pressure sensor while infant sucks their regular feed from it. The device is a regular baby&#xD;
      bottle that has a special pressure sensing chamber that measures the infant's sucking&#xD;
      patterns, strength and consistency. The mother may decline using the bottle with sensors, or&#xD;
      if tried with the infant but the infant refuses, the feeding will be resumed with the bottle&#xD;
      brought by the mother. (3) Body composition of the infant will be measured using Dual-Energy&#xD;
      X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) using a Hologic Delphi-A densitometer. These procedures provide&#xD;
      estimates of total body bone, fat, and lean mass. (4) Observations of infant's behavior will&#xD;
      be observed and recorded for 20 minutes in these situations: being shown a black and white&#xD;
      checkerboard, listening to a ringing bell, listening and viewing a shaken ball/rattle, and&#xD;
      being presented a ball/rattle, that is later taken away, a puppet game, peek-a-boo game,&#xD;
      playing in a jungle gym, and infant viewing pictures on a computer screen. (5) The physical&#xD;
      activity of the infant will be measured for about 1.5 hours by using three ActiGraph GT3X+&#xD;
      accelerometers (Pensacola, FL, USA), placed on each leg of the infant (below knee and above&#xD;
      the ankle), another device on the infant's waist. (6) A microbiome sample from the infant&#xD;
      will be obtained by study staff collecting fecal sample from diaper for the pattern of&#xD;
      bacteria in infant's gut. (7) A urine sample will be obtained for epigenetic (methylation)&#xD;
      analysis and will be collected by using a special bag that will be placed over the infant's&#xD;
      genital area. (8) Finger nail samples will be obtained by gentle clipping for epigenetic&#xD;
      (methylation) analysis. (9) A saliva sample for genetic DNA analysis will be collected. To&#xD;
      collect the saliva sample, a staff member will gently rub a stick with a cotton end (similar&#xD;
      to a Q-tip) against the infant's cheek for about 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mother will be asked to complete questionnaires for each infant: Infant Behavior&#xD;
      Questionnaire - Very Short Version, Milestones Questionnaire, Infant Feeding History&#xD;
      Questionnaire, and Infant Eating Behavior Questionnaire. The mother will be asked to complete&#xD;
      procedures at the initial visit. First, a maternal microbiome sample; the mother will be&#xD;
      instructed how to collect her fecal sample in the MRU or at her home. Second, a maternal&#xD;
      buccal cell sample will be collected from the mother by gently rubbing a stick with a cotton&#xD;
      end (similar to a Q-tip) against mother's cheek for about 30 seconds. The mother will be&#xD;
      asked to collect her own saliva in a container provided to her.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home visit: Within a week a home visit will be scheduled to assess infants' behavior. The&#xD;
      same process conducted in the laboratory will be conducted at home where infant's behavior&#xD;
      will be observed and recorded for 20 minutes in these situations: being shown a black and&#xD;
      white checkerboard, listening to a ringing bell, listening and viewing a shaken ball/rattle,&#xD;
      and being presented a ball/rattle, that is later taken away, a puppet game, peek-a-boo game,&#xD;
      playing in a jungle gym, and baby viewing pictures on a computer screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 months: Behavior observation, physical activity and body composition measurement outlined&#xD;
      above will be conducted. The mother will complete Infant Behavior Questionnaire - Very Short&#xD;
      Version, Milestones Questionnaire, Infant Feeding History Questionnaire, and Infant Eating&#xD;
      Behavior Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home visit: Within a week a home visit will be scheduled to assess infants' behavior as&#xD;
      outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 months: Behavior observation, physical activity, body composition measurement outlined&#xD;
      above will be conducted. Additionally, a feeding observation to asses food neophobia in twins&#xD;
      will be conducted. The mother will be asked to offer a new food (Quinoa or Couscous) to the&#xD;
      infant. Infant's response to the new food will be video recorded for 3 minutes. The mother&#xD;
      will complete Infant Behavior Questionnaire - Very Short Version and Child Eating Behavior&#xD;
      Questionnaire (CEBQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 month: Mother will be sent (via mail) four Questionnaires for each child: Strength and&#xD;
      Difficulty Questionnaire (SDQ), Milestone Questionnaire, Eating Behavior (Children's Eating&#xD;
      Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ)), Height And Weight Questionnaire. All questionnaires will be&#xD;
      mailed and when completed the mother will return to research staff in a self-addressed&#xD;
      envelope.&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>CEBQ is a parent-report measure comprised of 35 items, each rated on a five-point likert scale that ranges from never to always. It is made up of eight eating behavior sub-scales: Food responsiveness, Emotional over-eating, Enjoyment of food, Desire to drink, Satiety responsiveness, Slowness in eating, Emotional under-eating, and Food fussiness. A higher mean score for each specific sub-scale suggest the child shows a higher tendency toward the respective eating behavior. For example a higher mean score on food responsiveness suggests the child is food responsive.</description>
