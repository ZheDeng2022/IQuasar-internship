  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ach year, it is estimated that an average of approximately 219,000 women in France suffer&#xD;
      physical and/or sexual violence at the hands of their partner or ex-partner. These figures do&#xD;
      not take into account other types of violence such as psychological or economic violence.&#xD;
      Domestic violence has a major impact on the physical, sexual and psychological health of&#xD;
      women victims. For example, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in these women&#xD;
      varies between 33 and 84%, with an average prevalence of 61%, compared with only 2.2% in the&#xD;
      French population as a whole. Multidisciplinary medical, social and legal support for these&#xD;
      women is essential. In France, there are major territorial disparities in terms of the&#xD;
      distribution of facilities for victims of domestoc violence, and not all women victims have&#xD;
      the same access to care depending on their place of residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Maison des Femmes in St Denis has been open since 2016. It offers a unique range of&#xD;
      sanitary, social and judicial services through cooperation with police and justice&#xD;
      departments, for women who have been subjected to any type of violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This facility is unique in France, and the number of consultations continues to increase, and&#xD;
      was more than 8,500 in 2018. The Maison des Femmes model is intended to be exported to other&#xD;
      departments, but first the model needs to be validated, beyond its obvious attractiveness&#xD;
      (illustrated by the number of consultations and the fact that it attracts women from&#xD;
      throughout the Ile de France region) by comparing it to other facilities in terms of its&#xD;
      effect on the management of the women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional prevalence study that estimates the frequency of post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder among women who are victims of domestic violence who used the services&#xD;
      offered at the Maison des Femmes or other dedicated structures, at the initial consultation&#xD;
      and 6 months later.&#xD;
