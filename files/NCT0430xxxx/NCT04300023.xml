    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine the reach and maintenance of an in-home cycling program for&#xD;
      underserved individuals with Parkinson disease and to determine the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      6-month in-home, progressive, tele-exercise cycling program and 3-month health coach&#xD;
      follow-up for those same participants. It will also examine the influence of social support&#xD;
      on exercise frequency, duration, quality of life, and overall activity level.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of exercise for individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) have been well&#xD;
      documented; however, individuals with PD living in rural and underserved urban settings are&#xD;
      largely unable or unwilling to participate in group exercise programs due in large part to&#xD;
      their distance from such programs and financial considerations. Additionally, community based&#xD;
      programs which provide social support and engagement have been shown to benefit elderly&#xD;
      individuals as well as individuals with pathology, but are equally unattainable to this&#xD;
      group. Taking the exercise to these individuals via telemedicine or tele-exercise may be an&#xD;
      ideal means of delivering this type of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this project is to improve outcomes for underserved populations of&#xD;
      individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) by providing access to in-home physical activity via&#xD;
      a telehealth approach. Approximately one million Americans currently live with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      PD and it has been estimated that delaying the progression by 20% would result in a $75,891&#xD;
      savings per individual based on reduced health care costs, income maintenance, increased&#xD;
      duration of life and improved quality of life. However, individuals with PD of lower&#xD;
      socioeconomic status, people of color and rural dwelling seniors have been critically&#xD;
      underserved by clinical and academic programming resulting in poorer health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two studies will examine: 1) the Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation and Maintenance&#xD;
      and 2) the optimal delivery method for an in-home exercise intervention program for&#xD;
      individuals with PD living in underserved communities. A managed and meaningful exercise&#xD;
      intervention will be delivered that not only addresses the benefits of physical activity for&#xD;
      individuals with PD, but also offers a social connection to research staff outside of the&#xD;
      participant's typical caregiver(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1: Examine the reach and maintenance of an in-home cycling program for&#xD;
      underserved individuals with PD. Reach will be assessed by examining the demographic&#xD;
      characteristics of the individuals enrolled and through the administration of a questionnaire&#xD;
      on objective and subjective socioeconomic status to better understand their level of&#xD;
      accessibility to services, perceived barriers and economic status. The investigators will&#xD;
      also explore the implementation of a health coach to promote effective maintenance of the&#xD;
      program after the 6-month intervention. Finally, two interviews will be conducted to better&#xD;
      understand strengths and weakness of the program and to better address the needs of the&#xD;
      participants in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1a: Demographic characteristics including race and socioeconomic status of&#xD;
           the enrolled participants will not statistically differ from the characteristics of the&#xD;
           state of WI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1b: Feedback from participant interviews will inform future delivery of the&#xD;
           in-home cycling program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine the effectiveness of a 6-month in-home, progressive, tele-exercise&#xD;
      cycling program and 3-month health coach follow-up for underserved populations of individuals&#xD;
      with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2a: Participants will improve performance of activities of daily living from&#xD;
           baseline to posttest. These effects will be maintained at 3-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2b: Participants will significantly improve measures of gait and balance&#xD;
           performance and non- significantly improve fall rate from baseline to posttest. These&#xD;
           effects will be maintained at 3-month follow-up in the group piloting implementation of&#xD;
           a health coach, but not in solo follow-up group. Falls data will allow for effect size&#xD;
           calculations for future applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2c: Activity level as measured by an activity monitor will increase from&#xD;
           baseline to posttest. This effect will be maintained at 3-month follow-up in health&#xD;
           coach group, but not in the solo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1: Determine whether incorporation of social interaction during physical&#xD;
      activity significantly improves task adherence and increases task stamina as compared to solo&#xD;
      cycling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1a: Those individuals participating in socially engaged cycling will complete&#xD;
           a significantly greater number of cycling sessions than individuals in the solo cycling&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1b: Individuals in the social cycling group will cycle for longer durations&#xD;
           at each session than solo cyclists, despite the long term goal being 30 minutes per&#xD;
           session for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine whether incorporation of social interaction during physical&#xD;
      activity significantly improves activities of daily living, fall rate and quantity of&#xD;
      movement for individuals with PD. The primary variables for this aim are Performance&#xD;
      Assessment of Self-care Skills Assessment scores, gait velocity and step count.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2a: Socially engaged exercise will result in significantly greater&#xD;
           improvement in measures of instrumented activities of daily living (IADL; as measured by&#xD;
           the Performance Assessment of Self-care Skills (PASS) assessment) as compared to solo&#xD;
           cycling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2b: Fall rate will be non-significantly improved with socially engaged&#xD;
           cycling but not with solo cycling. Weekly calls will be placed to both groups to record&#xD;
           fall rate. Falls data will allow for effect size calculations for future applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2c: Overall activity level, as measured by an activity monitor, will increase&#xD;
           with socially engaged cycling but not with solo cycling.&#xD;
