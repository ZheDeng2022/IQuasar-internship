      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distress, anxiety, and other psychological disorders may be more common in people with&#xD;
      primary brain tumors (PBTs). PBTs can affect their symptoms, quality of life, and their&#xD;
      tolerance of cancer treatments. Researchers want to learn if virtual reality (VR) technology&#xD;
      can help reduce stress and improve mood. VR uses computer technology to make fake experiences&#xD;
      and environments that look real. This allows people to escape from their lives and experience&#xD;
      more positive thoughts and emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if it is feasible to use a VR relaxation intervention in people with PBTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older who have a brain tumor and have recently reported psychological distress&#xD;
      during their participation in the Natural History Study (NHS), protocol #16C0151&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VR intervention and all patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) will be done remotely&#xD;
      using telehealth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be mailed a VR headset. This headset looks like a thick pair of goggles&#xD;
      that is worn over the eyes. Participants will view computer-generated environments on this VR&#xD;
      headset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out symptoms questionnaires at 4 different times points during&#xD;
      participation in this study, including questionnaires for the NHS as well as 4 questionnaires&#xD;
      unique to this study. There are also optional saliva samples collected at these timepoints.&#xD;
      The 4 timepoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the VR intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the VR intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 week later&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 weeks later&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also have a phone interview 1 week after the initial VR interevention,&#xD;
      which will last 10 to 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation lasts 4 to 6 weeks.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological distress is a common concern for patient across the cancer trajectory,&#xD;
           which has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in terms of quality of life,&#xD;
           adherence to treatment regimens, satisfaction with care, and poorer survival in past&#xD;
           research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to alleviate some of the negative aspects of&#xD;
           illness by allowing individuals to escape from their lives and experience more positive&#xD;
           thoughts and emotions, which can be accomplished using cardiac coherence breathing&#xD;
           techniques and distraction (both of which can improve psychological symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past VR research has shown promising improvements in anxiety, pain, distress and&#xD;
           distraction through use of immersive VR interventions, though there is scant evidence in&#xD;
           PBT populations, particularly in the time period surrounding their neuroimaging and&#xD;
           clinical appointments when distress and anxiety can be highest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent evidence has demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation&#xD;
           procedures introduce additional stress for cancer patients, with higher levels of&#xD;
           anxiety, depression, loneliness, and financial toxicity being reported during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The purpose of this phase II clinical trial is to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
           implementing an immersive VR relaxation intervention in a PBT population and to assess&#xD;
           the efficacy of the intervention to improve psychological distress and anxiety at the&#xD;
           time of clinical evaluation. VR is an innovative delivery approach to teach our patients&#xD;
           validated breathing and mindfulness techniques that can improve their psychological&#xD;
           symptoms and their ability to self-manage these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess the feasibility of implementing a VR relaxation intervention in a PBT population&#xD;
      at the time of clinical evaluation (i.e. eligibility, accrual, compliance, adverse device&#xD;
      effects, study completion, and participant satisfaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PBT patients enrolled on the Natural History Study (NHS) trial in the Neuro-Oncology&#xD;
           Branch (NOB) (all tumor types and grades eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients can be newly diagnosed, receiving active treatment, or on surveillance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) who are English-speaking and able to&#xD;
           self-report symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active corticosteroid therapy is permissible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclude patients without tissue diagnosis, recent cranial surgery (less than or equal to&#xD;
           2 weeks), scalp wound healing issues, or seizures within the last 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants have reported greater than or equal to 1 on distres item from MDASI-BT&#xD;
           prior to past clinic appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclude patients who have a hypersensitivity to motion, severe nausea, or visual field&#xD;
           deficits that might interfere with VR experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclude patients with a current diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),&#xD;
           post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), claustrophobia, or panic disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase II feasibility clinical trial with a single arm experimental design. The&#xD;
           VR intervention and all patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) will be done remotely&#xD;
           using telehealth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study will include collection of self-reported PROs for distress, anxiety, mood&#xD;
           disturbance, symptom burden/interference, quality of life, cognitive function,&#xD;
           loneliness, and financial toxicity, as well as optional salivary stress biomarkers.&#xD;
           These measures will be collected at baseline and immediately after a brief VR relaxation&#xD;
           intervention to determine acute effects on distress, anxiety, and biological stress&#xD;
           measures. Repeat post-intervention assessments will be done approximately 1 week and 1&#xD;
           month following the initial intervention to determine sub-acute effects on distress and&#xD;
           anxiety, as well as impact on other symptoms and stress biomarkers. A semi-structured&#xD;
           qualitative interview will also be conducted 1 week after the initial intervention to&#xD;
           assess participant satisfaction with the intervention and how the pandemic has affected&#xD;
           their psychological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive statistics, T-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and multiple logistic&#xD;
           regression models will be used to evaluate the feasibility of the VR intervention.&#xD;
           Linear mixed models and effect size calculations will be used to evaluate the acute and&#xD;
           sub-acute effects of the VR intervention on self- reported PROs. Pearson or Spearman&#xD;
           correlations will be used to evaluate the relationship between the biological stress&#xD;
           measures and self-reported PROs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 120 PBT patients will participate in this study.&#xD;
