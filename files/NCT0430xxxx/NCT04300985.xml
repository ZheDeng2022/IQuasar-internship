      Magnesium sulfate (MS) and dexmedetomidine have already demonstrated the ability to reduce&#xD;
      intra and postoperative consumption of anesthetics and analgesics, among others advantages,&#xD;
      such as blood pressure control and intraoperative bleeding. The MS has also been shown to be&#xD;
      useful in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia control, pulmonary hypertension, asthma, cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmias and pheochromocytoma). Despite these advantages in the use of these important&#xD;
      adjuncts, there is a concern about the quality and awakening time of the patients who use&#xD;
      them. The purpose of this trial is to compare the time and quality of awakening in patients&#xD;
      submitted to general anesthesia and receiving MS or dexmedetomidine as adjuncts in the&#xD;
      intraoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this trial is to compare the quality and the awakening time in patients&#xD;
      receiving MS or dexmedetomidine. The secondary objective is the comparison of postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia in the postoperative hospitalization period. Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      patients present a faster awakening when receive MS as an analgesic adjunct, when compared to&#xD;
      patients who receive dexmedetomidine. Drawing: this is a prospective, controlled, covert&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Magnesium sulfate (MS) and dexmedetomidine have already demonstrated the ability&#xD;
      to reduce intra and postoperative consumption of anesthetics and analgesics, among others&#xD;
      advantages, such as blood pressure control and intraoperative bleeding8,9. The MS has also&#xD;
      been shown to be useful in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia control, pulmonary hypertension,&#xD;
      asthma, cardiac arrhythmias and pheochromocytoma). Despite these advantages in the use of&#xD;
      these important adjuncts, there is a concern about the quality and awakening time of the&#xD;
      patients who use them. The purpose of this trial is to compare the time and quality of&#xD;
      awakening in patients submitted to general anesthesia and receiving MS or dexmedetomidine as&#xD;
      adjuncts in the intraoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this trial is to compare the quality and the awakening time in patients&#xD;
      receiving MS or dexmedetomidine. The secondary objective is the comparison of postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia in the postoperative hospitalization period. Our hypothesis is that patients&#xD;
      present a faster awakening when receive MS an analgesic adjunct, when compared to patients&#xD;
      who receive dexmedetomidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drawing: this is a prospective, controlled, covert trial with random distribution for&#xD;
      noninferiority trialing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key words: general anesthesia, long awakening from anesthesia. METHODS Participants and&#xD;
      endpoints Scenario: The study will be carried out at &quot;Hospital da Sociedade Portuguesa de&#xD;
      Beneficência de Santos - Angiocorpore&quot; (Portuguese Charity Society Hospital). Eligibility:&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for video laparoscopic cholecystectomy, between 18 and 70 years old,&#xD;
      physical status I or II in the American Society of Anesthesiology classification, who have no&#xD;
      allergy or contraindication to the study protocol substances and who voluntarily agree to&#xD;
      participate in the trial and sign the informed consent form (TCLE), will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary disease patients, patients with heart block &gt; atrioventricular block &gt; I, patients&#xD;
      with renal failure, those with brain disease past history, dementia or other psychiatric&#xD;
      diseases, and patients with body mass index &gt; 35 kg/m², will be excluded. Also excluded&#xD;
      patients with Portuguese language limitations and in preoperative use of opioid or&#xD;
      corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: the sample of participants will be distributed in 3 groups. The placebo group&#xD;
      (GP) will receive 100 ml of saline solution (SL) in infusion pump (BI) starting 15 min before&#xD;
      anesthesia with flow of 0.25 ml/kg/h. The dexmedetomidine group (GD) will receive 100 ml of&#xD;
      SL with 200 µg of dexmedetomidine in BI, starting 15 min before anesthesia with flow of 0.25&#xD;
      ml/kg/h. The magnesium sulfate group (GM) will receive 80 ml of MS + 20 ml of SL in infusion&#xD;
      pump starting 15 min before anesthesia induction with flow of 0.25 ml/kg/h. With this&#xD;
      infusion flow, patients of GD will receive dexmedetomidine at a dose of 0.5 µg/kg/h and&#xD;
      patients of GM will receive MS at a dose of 20 mg/kg/h. All participants will be submitted to&#xD;
      balanced anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic induction will be initiated after 5 min of pre-oxygenation, with lidocaine 1.5&#xD;
      mg/kg, fentanyl 3 µg/kg, propofol up to clinical hypnosis, cisatracurium 0.1 mg/kg and&#xD;
      intubation after adequate neuromuscular relaxation. Maintenance will be with sevoflurane at a&#xD;
      concentration under clinical demand, repeating bolus of fentanyl 1µg/kg and cisatracurium&#xD;
      0.03 mg/kg as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: time between the end of anesthetic administration and bispectral index &gt;&#xD;
      60, and a battery of neuropsychological trials for evaluation of postoperative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction tested in the Brazilian population 3 h after the end of anesthetics&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Secondary endpoints: response to the questionnaire of the brief pain inventory and opioid&#xD;
      consumption in the first 2 days of postoperative. Recruitment: patients will be recruited in&#xD;
      the pre-anesthetic evaluation and the evaluations will be done in a covert way in the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period and during the two postoperative days, being recorded the pain&#xD;
      scores and consumption of opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample calculation: the sample of 73 participants was calculated for a 95% confidence index&#xD;
      and a 90% statistical power. For compensation for losses, 90 individuals will be recruited&#xD;
      distributed in 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and allocation Distribution in groups: through electronic drawing on the website&#xD;
      www.random.org and preparation of brown envelopes that will be numbered and will contain&#xD;
      inside a card with the name of the group to which that number corresponds, in addition to the&#xD;
      intervention concerning the group to which it belongs. The draw and preparation of the&#xD;
      envelopes will be conducted by a professional who will not participate in other stages of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking: participants, providers and evaluators will be blinded to group each patient belongs&#xD;
      to. The randomization and allocation will be performed by professional not participating in&#xD;
      any other step of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and management Collection: the time between the end of anesthetic&#xD;
      administration and bispectral index &gt; 60 monitoring will be recorded; cognitive evaluation&#xD;
      will be done at recruitment and 3 h after the end of the anesthesia; the brief pain inventory&#xD;
      questionnaire will be filled in at recruitment and 3 h after the end of the anesthesia;&#xD;
      during hospitalization and in the first 2 days of postoperative the opioid consumption will&#xD;
      be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: the data will be organized in MS Excel spreadsheet, in its MS-Office 2013&#xD;
      version. The results will be obtained through the Statistical Package for Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS) in its version 23.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: continuous variables will be evaluated through Student's t trial. The&#xD;
      normality check will be evaluated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov trial or Shapiro-Wilk trial. The&#xD;
      comparison of parametric data will be done by Student's t trial or Z trial. The nominal&#xD;
      variables will be evaluated by the Chi-square trial. The comparison of nominal variables for&#xD;
      independent samples will be made by the Chi-square trial or Fisher's Exact trial. The&#xD;
      comparison of ordinal or quantitative variables without normal distribution for independent&#xD;
      samples will be done by the Mann-Whitney trial. The correlation between variables will be&#xD;
      evaluated by Pearson's trial for or Spearman, as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up The compared substances are already widely used in anesthesia and present a&#xD;
      very favorable risk/benefit ratio, with no significant incidence of intercurrence related to&#xD;
      them being noted. The selection of patients for the study also makes their use safe. To make&#xD;
      the benefit of its use uniform among the groups, patients with pain scores &gt; 3 (pain verbal&#xD;
      score 0 to 10) will receive 2 mg of morphine at 15-minute intervals, until the pain intensity&#xD;
      is &lt; 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a prescription for home use of dipyrone 1g every 6 hours and&#xD;
      association of codeine (30 mg) with paracetamol (500 mg) in case of pain &gt; 3. RESEARCH ETHICS&#xD;
      This project was submitted to the evaluation of the Research Ethics Committee (CEP/CONEP) in&#xD;
      the Brazil Platform and to the Ethics Committee of participating institution. After their&#xD;
      approval, it is being registered at clinicaltrials.org. Only after these steps the data&#xD;
      collection will started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruited individuals will only participate in the study after signing the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' personal information will be kept confidential, and only the authors will have&#xD;
      access to them before, during and after the trial. The authors declare that they have no&#xD;
      conflict of interest.&#xD;
