  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic autoimmune disease in which inflammation and fibrosis&#xD;
      play a crucial role and lead to severe damage and failure of multiple organs such as the&#xD;
      skin, joints, tendons, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, heart, blood vessels, and kidneys. It&#xD;
      primarily affects women but disease is often more severe in males&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem life-threatening fibrosing disorder that lacks&#xD;
      effective treatment. The link between the inflammation observed in organs such as the skin&#xD;
      and profibrotic mechanisms is not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells that sense pathogens and present&#xD;
      pathogen-derived peptides to T and B cells, thus triggering and influencing adaptive immune&#xD;
      responses. In humans, dendritic cells are most commonly divided into two classes:&#xD;
      plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are type of immune cell that are known to secrete large&#xD;
      quantities of type 1 interferon (IFNs) in response to a viral infection). However, pDCs are&#xD;
      also responsible for participating in and exacerbating certain autoimmune diseases. Activated&#xD;
      pDCs have been observed to accumulate in the skin of SSc patients , contributing to skin&#xD;
      fibrosis in systemic sclerosis, largely through activation of Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8),&#xD;
      which is not normally expressed in these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TLR8 transgenic mice have more skin fibrosis, thicker skin, higher levels of infiltrating&#xD;
      pDCs and higher mRNA expression of inflammatory genes, suggesting an important function of&#xD;
      TLR8 in promoting inflammatory responses and fibrosis.&#xD;
