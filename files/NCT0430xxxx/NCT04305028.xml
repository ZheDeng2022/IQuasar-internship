      The aim of the conducted research is to evaluate the protective effect of rivaroxaban (trade&#xD;
      name of the Xarelto medicinal product), administered together with acetylsalicylic acid&#xD;
      (ASA), in comparison with the effectiveness of using ASA alone, in relation to the distance&#xD;
      of claudication and exercise tolerance in patients with PAD over a period of 3 months. At&#xD;
      present, COMPASS results show that rivaroxaban vascular dose (2.5 mg twice daily) in&#xD;
      combination with ASA (75-100 mg once daily) provides more effective cardiovascular protection&#xD;
      (defined as cardiovascular death, vascular, myocardial infarction and stroke) compared to ASA&#xD;
      alone. So far, however, no scientific studies have been carried out into account the effect&#xD;
      of the drug on the progress of PAD and exercise tolerance in patients.&#xD;

      EXISTING KNOWLEDGE AND MAIN ASSUMPTIONS OF THE PROJECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The first&#xD;
      symptom of PAD is intermittent claudication (IC), which is characterized by the occurrence of&#xD;
      pain, cramps, numbness, and discomfort in the lower limb muscles. They gradually intensify&#xD;
      while walking, forcing the patient to stop. The symptoms are caused by continuous, specific&#xD;
      physical effort and quickly disappear when it is stopped. The reduction of the possibility of&#xD;
      walking leads to a decrease in the quality of life of patients and adds to other dangerous&#xD;
      consequences of atherosclerosis, increased risk of cardiovascular incidents (myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI), stroke, acute lower limb ischemia, Micker M et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatment of patients with IC is aimed at modifying cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors and improving the quality of life by alleviating pain and prolonging the claudication&#xD;
      distance (Goszcz et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. New possibilities for the pharmacotherapy of patients with symptomatic PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the adopted TASC (The Trans Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus), and its TASC&#xD;
           II supplement concerning aspects of management and treatment of patients with chronic&#xD;
           limb ischemia (CLI), drugs used in PAD are divided into nine groups: those with&#xD;
           documented clinical effect used in IC (cilostazol and naphthydrofuryl), drugs with&#xD;
           probable clinical effect used in IC (carnitine and propyl-L-carnitine), lipid-lowering&#xD;
           drugs (statins), drugs with insufficiently proven clinical effects (penthoxyphilin),&#xD;
           anticoagulants, L-arginine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (ketanserin) antagonism, buflomedil, and&#xD;
           defibrotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Antiplatelet drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
           Antiplatelet drugs are used to prevent thrombotic complications in the course of&#xD;
           myocardial infarction, stroke, and thrombi in peripheral arteries. Acetylsalicylic acid&#xD;
           (ASA, aspirin) at doses of 75-325 mg per day, ticlopidine at doses of 250 mg twice a&#xD;
           day, and clopidogrel at doses of 75 mg once a day (CAPRIE, 1996) are proven to be&#xD;
           effective in PAD patients. Recently there have been reports of beneficial effects of&#xD;
           policosanol (a cholesterol-lowering drug with an antiplatelet effect), which prolongs&#xD;
           the claudication distance after 10 weeks of treatment (10 mg once a day; clinical&#xD;
           trial). The results of ASA (100 mg daily) were however inconclusive (Illnait et al.,&#xD;
           2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The group of new antiplatelet drugs, used in PAD patients, includes rivaroxaban (trade&#xD;
           name Xarelto), which in a vascular dose (2.5 mg twice a day) combined with ASA (75-100&#xD;
           mg once a day) provides more effective cardiovascular protection (defined together as&#xD;
           cardiovascular death, MI and stroke) compared to ASA alone in the COMPASS study (Anand&#xD;
           SS et al. 2018; Olinic DM et al. 2018; Connolly SJ, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other studies with the acronyms MACE and MALE, conducted in the PAD patients of nearly&#xD;
           5,000 cases in total, confirm that the use of rivaroxaban provides comprehensive&#xD;
           vascular protection in PAD. The former showed a 28% reduction in the risk of&#xD;
           cardiovascular death/myocardial infarction/brain stroke, the latter a 44% reduction in&#xD;
           the risk of acute lower limb ischemia and a 46% reduction in the risk of acute/chronic&#xD;
           limb ischemia and a 70% reduction in the risk of large amputations. This is the only&#xD;
           anticoagulant that, in combination with ASA, reduces mortality in patients with coronary&#xD;
           artery disease (CAD) and PAD. At the same time, Xarelto, in a vascular dose, in&#xD;
           combination with ASA, does not cause a significant increase in the risk of major&#xD;
           bleedings compared to ASA itself. So far, this drug has not been tested in the context&#xD;
           of prolongation of the claudication distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rivaroxaban inhibits the formation of thrombin and clots by directly inhibiting factor&#xD;
           Xa (activated factor X), thus preventing the transformation of prothrombin into thrombin&#xD;
           and interrupting the final common path of the blood clotting cascade. This drug&#xD;
           competitively inhibits factor Xa with 10,000 times the selectivity of related serine&#xD;
           proteases such as thrombin and factors VIIa, IXa, and XIa. Numerous experimental data&#xD;
           suggest the role of clotting system components in regulating atherosclerosis progression&#xD;
           (Borensztajn K et al., 2008; Borissoff et al., 2009; Platek and Szymanski, 2019).&#xD;
           Various factors of the coagulation cascade mediate these activities, and the broadest&#xD;
           spectrum of action concerns the effect of the complex of factor Xa and thrombin&#xD;
           precisely.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Scientific research confirms the pleiotropic effects of rivaroxaban on the&#xD;
           cardiovascular system. However, most of the currently available observations come from&#xD;
           basic research whose results need to be confirmed in clinical trials. Among the planned&#xD;
           clinical trials that may establish pleiotropic rivaroxaban actions, the PRE -FER-AF&#xD;
           study (PREvention oF thromboembolic events - European Registry in Atrial Fibrillation)&#xD;
           is mentioned as the most important. This study aims to determine the efficacy of oral&#xD;
           anticoagulants other than vitamin K antagonists (NOAC) in preventing endothelial&#xD;
           dysfunction and atherosclerosis progression in patients with atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
           However, it will not provide information on the effect of the drug on the progress of&#xD;
           PAD or exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the study is to assess the protective efficacy of rivaroxaban, administered&#xD;
           together with ASA, in comparison with the efficacy of ASA alone, with respect to&#xD;
           intermittent claudication and exercise tolerance in patients with PAD over a 3-month&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Type of study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prospective, observational, unblinded (open), randomized, case-control, single-centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Description of the study group (age, gender, health status, size of the group).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will include PAD patients in Fountaine stage II, hospitalized in the Clinical&#xD;
           Hospital of Transfiguration (Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Angiology&#xD;
           and Phlebology of the Poznan University of Medical Sciences), monitored in the adjacent&#xD;
           Outpatient Clinic or referred by cooperating physicians who will use a different&#xD;
           protocol of anticoagulation pharmacotherapy to prevent thrombotic events. The&#xD;
           recommended pharmacotherapy does not exceed the standard of treatment in patients with&#xD;
           PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Size of the study group. At least 60 PAD patients will be included. The collection&#xD;
           and observation of the study group will take place until the scientific goal of the&#xD;
           study is achieved. Therefore the possibility of increasing the recruitment of patients&#xD;
           for the study is assumed up to 100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Characteristics of the study group. The inclusion/exclusion criteria, medical&#xD;
           history, and cardiovascular risk factors will be examined. Then patients will be&#xD;
           subjected to objective assessment of exercise tolerance, assessment of claudication&#xD;
           distance, implementation of anticoagulation pharmacotherapy protocol and prospective&#xD;
           study protocol. Venous blood samples (9-18 ml), and capillary blood for diagnostic,&#xD;
           biochemical, and molecular analysis will be collected. Costs will be shared between&#xD;
           cooperating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 Pharmacotherapy. Vascular doses of drugs will be used in one group: 1 x/day ASA&#xD;
           75-100 mg and in the other: 1 x/day ASA 75-100 mg + 2 x/day 2.5 mg Xarelto.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Methods The general study plan assumes up to 5 visits of the patient to the cooperating&#xD;
           centers during the study. First visit to the Hospital-Outpatient Clinic for recruitment&#xD;
           (interview with the patient, obtaining written consent, patient registration, the&#xD;
           appointment of the next visit, and optionally USG-Doppler of arteries). Second visit to&#xD;
           the hospital's blood collection point for fasting blood tests (blood collection for&#xD;
           tests and optionally USG-Doppler of arteries). During the third and fourth visits at&#xD;
           University of Physical Education treadmill tests with additional tests (ECG, ABI, TCPO2&#xD;
           measurements before and after treadmill test, as well as biochemical evaluation of&#xD;
           effort tolerance and subjective assessment of effort using Borg scale) will be&#xD;
           performed. During third visit, randomization will also be done. The fourth visit will be&#xD;
           scheduled after three months. Then data will be collected and analyzed. During the fifth&#xD;
           visit, USG-Doppler of arteries will be performed, and a patient recommendation will be&#xD;
           issued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Clinical characteristics of the studied population. The following clinical data will be&#xD;
      collected for the study: a) results of aortic and lower limb arteries imaging, b) results of&#xD;
      heart function tests, c) assessment of the occurrence and severity of atherosclerotic lesions&#xD;
      in blood vessels (including: ABI, IMT,TcPO2 value), d) results of fasting venous blood&#xD;
      laboratory tests including blood lipid parameters, glucose metabolism, liver and renal&#xD;
      function, homocysteine, folic acid, peripheral blood morphology, blood coagulation&#xD;
      parameters, e) blood pressure parameters, f) results of virological and bacteriological&#xD;
      tests, g) anthropometric data, h) smoking status, i) pharmacotherapy j) coexisting diseases,&#xD;
      k) pain, l) family history of cardiovascular disease and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Treadmill test. The effect of pharmacotherapy will be assessed based on the treadmill&#xD;
      test that will be carried out according to Gardner protocol (Gardner et al., 1991). Patients&#xD;
      will march on a treadmill at a constant speed of 3.2 km/h. The initial angle of the slope&#xD;
      will be 0% and will be raised by 2% every 2 minutes. The test will be carried out in the&#xD;
      Laboratory of Functional Testing of the Department of Physiology and Biochemistry of the&#xD;
      University of Physical Education in Poznan, with no contraindications (based on the result of&#xD;
      an ECG). The subjects will be tested at each of the test dates to assess the claudication&#xD;
      distance on the Katana S30p medical treadmill (Lode BV, Netherlands) (Mika et al. 2009). The&#xD;
      total time of each test will not exceed 16 minutes 40 seconds, and the regeneration time will&#xD;
      be at least 5 minutes. When the patient reports pain (i.e., grade 2 on a subjective pain&#xD;
      assessment scale), the time of occurrence of the claudication will be recorded, from which&#xD;
      the claudication distance (DGCH) will be estimated. The test will be interrupted when very&#xD;
      severe pain occurs that prevents further walking (step 5 corresponding to maximum walking&#xD;
      time), and the maximum walking time will then be recorded. The maximum walking time will be&#xD;
      used to estimate the maximum walking distance (DGMAX). Once the treadmill tests have been&#xD;
      completed, patients will undergo a control ECG examination to exclude ischemic changes in the&#xD;
      heart muscle and cardiac arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3. Evaluation of exercise tolerance. The assessment of exercise tolerance will be carried&#xD;
      out based on the duration of the effort and questionnaires (Borg scale; Smarż et al. 2015),&#xD;
      and biochemical exponents (metabolic equivalent MET-s will be estimated; Bires AM et al.,&#xD;
      2013). At rest and 3 minutes after the exercise, the intensity of metabolic exercise acidosis&#xD;
      will be assessed based on lactate concentration in capillary blood taken from the fingertip.&#xD;
      At the same time, venous blood will also be collected for other biochemical tests, including&#xD;
      gasometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Length of observation. The effects of the treatment will be assessed within three months,&#xD;
      but the observation period can be extended to a maximum of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.5 End points of the study. The main endpoints of this study and the complications have been&#xD;
      developed in accordance with the results adopted in the COMPASS study. Parameters related to&#xD;
      the effects of the treadmill test were added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6 Biological material and its use. Blood samples will be collected for further analysis and&#xD;
      DNA extraction. The concentration of lactate will be tested using EDGE Blood Lactate Test&#xD;
      Strip, ApexBio, (Taiwan). The level of selected blood biomarkers will be assessed by the&#xD;
      immunoenzymatic method (ELISA) for proteins, and TaqMan tests or corresponding methods for&#xD;
      circulating miRNAs and DNA.&#xD;

        The primary selection criterion for all respondents is the presence of PAD and the&#xD;
        Caucasian ancestry. PAD patients with intermittent claudication and no clinical&#xD;
        contraindications to the treadmill test will be enrolled in the study. Patients with PAD in&#xD;
        Stage II Fountaine will be qualified for the study. The disease will be confirmed with an&#xD;
        ankle-brachial index (ABI), with a result of less than 0.90. For all participants, ABI will&#xD;
        be measured at the beginning of the study; the result will be calculated from the ratio of&#xD;
        the highest systolic blood pressure on the limb to the highest systolic blood pressure on&#xD;
        the shoulder.&#xD;
