      This experiment was conducted to investigate the improvement of hypoglycemic index diet&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A low glycemic index diet (LGIT) is a modification of a ketogenic diet (KD) that includes low&#xD;
      carbohydrate, medium protein, and high fat intake.It is a potential new intervention for&#xD;
      refractory schizophrenia.The possible mechanism is that relatively low and stable blood sugar&#xD;
      levels trigger the brain to start applying fat metabolism, helping to compensate for impaired&#xD;
      GABA levels in the brain.KD can effectively treat refractory epilepsy, and its therapeutic&#xD;
      effect on epilepsy is comparable to that of antiepileptic drugs, which have been written into&#xD;
      the treatment guidelines as a good synergist and mood stabilizer in schizophrenia and various&#xD;
      mental disorders.Therefore, it can be assumed that LGIT has a certain effect on the positive&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia as a synergistic agent.In this study, 80 patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia were randomly divided into two groups: LGIT diet and normal diet.The changes of&#xD;
      PANSS and blood lipid before and after treatment were analyzed. Transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS) was used to evaluate the gaba-mediated cortical excitability of patients to&#xD;
      further explore the mechanism of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1)Experimental scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample estimation and selection of cases: although not find LGIT to treat schizophrenia&#xD;
           scale research for reference, but in an article published in 2018 KD the curative effect&#xD;
           of treatment of refractory epilepsy in children and adherence of Meta analysis, Du&#xD;
           Ailing from 1989 to 2018 were analyzed such as relevant information received 503 cases,&#xD;
           termination of the experiments of the main causes of poor adherence to patients and&#xD;
           family members, the loss rate of about 10%.Therefore, 80 cases meeting the inclusion&#xD;
           criteria and exclusion criteria were included in this study, all of which were&#xD;
           inpatients from huangpu district mental health center in Shanghai. The patients were&#xD;
           divided into LGIT group (L) with 40 cases and normal diet group (N) with 40 cases by&#xD;
           random number table method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Meet the diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia in icd-10, and score ≥4 in any item&#xD;
                of p1-7 in PANSS scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
                ② Meet the diagnostic criteria for treatable schizophrenia: in the past 5 years to&#xD;
                three drugs and the appropriate dose and course of antipsychotic drugs (three drugs&#xD;
                at least two chemical structures are different) poor response; Adverse reactions of&#xD;
                patients who cannot tolerate antipsychotic drugs; Even with adequate maintenance&#xD;
                treatment or preventive treatment, the patient still relapses or deteriorates.&#xD;
&#xD;
                ③ Age 18-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with the following diseases: fatty acid transport or oxidation defects,&#xD;
                ketone body synthesis or decomposition defects, mitochondrial diseases, serious&#xD;
                liver diseases, pyruvate carboxylase defects, porphyria, carnitine deficiency, some&#xD;
                immunodeficiency diseases, organic acid urine; ② Patients with bleeding tendency,&#xD;
                severe hypertension and severe heart, liver, lung, kidney failure, severe epilepsy&#xD;
                patients; ③ Serious history of alcohol and drug abuse, addiction; ④ Extremely&#xD;
                excited restless patients;Patients using implantable electronic devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Withdrawal criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ① Complete the 12-week test process;&#xD;
&#xD;
           ② LGIT patients in the experimental group and the normal diet control group continued to&#xD;
           use the original drugs throughout the experiment. If the type or dose of antipsychotics&#xD;
           changed due to the recurrence of the disease, they would withdraw from the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ③ The patient can not tolerate the situation of diet treatment, autonomous request to&#xD;
           withdraw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Before treatment, at the end of the 4th week, the 8th week and the 12th week, venous&#xD;
           blood was extracted from the elbow for four times, and the positive and negative symptom&#xD;
           syndrome scale (PANSS), Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) and Hamilton depression scale&#xD;
           (HAMD) were measured by two professional evalutors with blind evaluation.The&#xD;
           neuropsychological state rating scale (RBANS) was used to assess changes in cognitive&#xD;
           function before and after treatment.Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to&#xD;
           assess changes in cortical excitability mediated by gaba-capable intermediate neurons in&#xD;
           patients before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Efficacy evaluation criteria: according to obvious effect (PANSS score reduction rate&#xD;
           &gt;50%), effective (PANSS score reduction rate 25-50%), invalid (PANSS score reduction&#xD;
           rate &lt;25%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. the LGIT diet of the experimental group consisted of 55% fat, 30% protein and 15%&#xD;
           carbohydrate, and the glycemic index of the food was limited to less than 50. The meal&#xD;
           was prepared by a public nutritionist who evaluated the nutritional composition of the&#xD;
           inpatients provided by the canteen and then added or subsumed the compound nutrition&#xD;
           powder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2)statistical treatment: SPSS21.0 statistical software package was used, measurement data&#xD;
      were expressed as (x-±s), the mean level was 0.05, group t test was used for comparison&#xD;
      before and after treatment, and correlation analysis was multiple stepwise regression&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
