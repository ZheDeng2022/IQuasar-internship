  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) often occurs after thoracoscopic lobectomy in high risk&#xD;
      patients. Insufficient intraoperative infusion is risk factor of AKI. Goal-directed fluid&#xD;
      therapy (GDFT) is individualized fluid infusion strategy, the infusion rate and type is&#xD;
      adjusted according to the individual's fluid response. GDFT during operation can reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of AKI after major surgery. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) integrates a&#xD;
      range of perioperative interventions to decrease postoperative complications after surgery.&#xD;
      In ERAS protocol of lobectomy, restrictive fluid therapy during operation is recommended. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators will compare the effects of GDFT and restrictive fluid therapy&#xD;
      during operation combined with ERAS protocol on the incidence of AKI after thoracoscopic&#xD;
      lobectomy in high risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/design: This is prospective single-center single-blind randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      276 patients scheduled to undergo thoracoscopic lobectomy under general anesthesia combined&#xD;
      with paravertebral block are randomly divided into GDFT group and restrictive fluid therapy&#xD;
      group at a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the incidence of AKI after operation. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are (1) the incidence of renal replacement therapy, (2) length of&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) stay after operation, (3) length of hospital stay after operation ,&#xD;
      (4) incidence of other complications including: infection, acute lung injury (ALI),&#xD;
      pneumonia, arrhythmia, heart failure, myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS),&#xD;
      cardiac infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This is the first study to compare GDFT and restrictive fluid therapy during&#xD;
      operation combined with ERAS protocol on the incidence of AKI after thoracoscopic lobectomy&#xD;
      in high risk patients. The investigators expected that the two methods have the same effect&#xD;
      on the incidence of AKI, but restrictive fluid therapy is simpler to applied than GDFT.&#xD;

      Participants: Patients aged more than 18 years old who are scheduled to undergo thoracoscopic&#xD;
      lobectomy well be enrolled in this trial. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of&#xD;
      the two groups: (1) GDFT group and (2) restrictive fluid therapy group. Participants will be&#xD;
      allocated in a 1:1 ratio using random numbers generated by Microsoft Excel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: All participants will start lung function exercise, quit smoking, reinforce&#xD;
      nutrition after hospitalization. Participants will fast for 6 hours and prohibit of drinking&#xD;
      water for 2 hours before operation. Antibiotic will be used 1 hour before operation. No&#xD;
      premedication will be administered to the patients. The electrocardiography (ECG), pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, invasive arterial blood pressure, nasopharyngeal temperature, and bispectral index&#xD;
      monitoring will be instituted. Urinary catheter will be inserted after anesthesia and removed&#xD;
      immediately after operation. Patients will undergo thoracoscopic lobectomy under general&#xD;
      anesthesia combined with paravertebral block. General anesthesia will be inducted with&#xD;
      sufentanil, propofol, and rocuronium, and maintained with continuous infusion of propofol and&#xD;
      remifentanil, intermittent injection of rocuronium. Lung-protective ventilation strategy will&#xD;
      be used during mechanical ventilation. Recovery from general anesthesia as quickly as&#xD;
      possible. Paravertebral block will be performed under the guidance of ultrasound after&#xD;
      general anesthesia induction. Paravertebral block, patient controlled analgesia and oral&#xD;
      analgesics will be used for postoperative analgesia. Recovering of oral rehydration, eating&#xD;
      and getting out of bed as early as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In GDFT group, the arterial catheter will be connected with FloTrac/Vigileo sensor (Edwards&#xD;
      lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA), The stroke volume variation (SVV) and cardiac index (CI) will&#xD;
      be monitored. Fluid maintenance with 2 ml/kg/h of Ringer's solution of sodium acetate, when&#xD;
      SVV&gt;13%, 4 mL/kg bolus of hydroxyethyl starch will be infused within 5 min. If SVV falls&#xD;
      below 13%, the bolus will be suspended. If SVV is still more than 13%, 100 μg of&#xD;
      phenylephrine will be administered when CI is more than 2.5 L/min/m2, 1 mg of dopamine will&#xD;
      be administered when CI is less than 2.5 L/min/m2. When SVV&lt;13%, but mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP)&lt;65 mmHg, 8 μg of norepinephrine will be administered. The hemodynamic status will be&#xD;
      repeatedly measured every 10 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In restrictive fluid therapy group, fluid maintenance with 2 ml/kg/h of Ringer's solution of&#xD;
      sodium acetate, hydroxyethyl starch will be infused to supply blood loss, the ratio of&#xD;
      hydroxyethyl starch to blood loss is 1:1. 0.01-0.1 μg/kg/min of norepinephrine will be&#xD;
      administered to maintain MAP&gt;65 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: The primary outcome is the incidence of AKI after operation. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include: (1) Incidence of renal replacement therapy, (2) Length of ICU stay after&#xD;
      operation, (3) Length of hospital stay after operation, (4) Incidence of other complications&#xD;
      including: infection, ALI, pneumonia, arrhythmia, heart failure, MINS, cardiac infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The primary outcome of this trial is the incidence of AKI after operation.&#xD;
      Another study showed that the incidence of AKI was 4% and 2.9% in liberal infusion and GDFT&#xD;
      respectively, the efficacy of intervention was 27.5%. Investigators hypothesis that&#xD;
      restrictive fluid therapy combined with ERAS protocol has the same therapeutic effect as&#xD;
      GDFT. The sample size for this study was calculated to achieve a statistical power of 0.8 and&#xD;
      alpha error of 0.05 using a two-sided test. Considering a dropout rate of 10%, 138 patients&#xD;
      are required in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Normally distributed data will be presented as the mean±standard&#xD;
      deviation. Categorical data will be presented as the number and the percentage of patients.&#xD;
      The primary outcome (the incidence of AKI after operation) will be compared between the two&#xD;
      groups with Pearson's chi-square test. The secondary outcomes will be compared between the&#xD;
      two groups with independent-samples Student's t-tests for normally distributed continuous&#xD;
      data and Pearson's chi-square test for categorical data. All statistical test are two-sided,&#xD;
      and a P-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
