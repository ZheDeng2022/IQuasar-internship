      The primary objective is to provide the investigational product, IC14, at the dose of 8 mg/kg&#xD;
      intravenously every 2 weeks for 12 weeks to 6 participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&#xD;
      (ALS). No clinical hypotheses are being tested. An extension for 6 additional doses every 2&#xD;
      weeks will be allowed if the drug is safe and well tolerated.A second extension for 14 doses&#xD;
      every 2 weeks will be allowed if the drug is safe and well tolerated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Manipulation of immune-driven inflammatory responses may have therapeutic utility in&#xD;
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and recent data suggest that ALS may respond to&#xD;
      peripheral intervention by expanding Tregs in mice and humans. The approach with IC14 builds&#xD;
      on this hypothesis by targeting CD14 as a master regulator of the immune response of&#xD;
      peripheral cell populations, which in turn determines the activation status and phenotype of&#xD;
      peripheral T cells that enter the central nervous system (CNS) and drive further microglia&#xD;
      activation .Binding and blocking membrane CD14 (mCD14) on peripheral immune cell populations&#xD;
      with IC14 may thus be a relevant therapeutic target in ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IC14 has been safe, well tolerated and had no serious adverse events related to study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a protocol for 12 weeks of the investigational medication IC14 for 6 participants. An&#xD;
      extension for 6 additional doses every 2 weeks will be done if the drug is safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated. Up to 20 subjects may be screened in order to identify eligible subjects that meet&#xD;
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening visit, the Principal Investigator will review the study procedures and&#xD;
      consent form with the participant. After obtaining informed consent, the participant will&#xD;
      receive IC14 8 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks (Â± 7 days) for 6 doses (12 weeks). An&#xD;
      extension for 6 additional doses every 2 weeks will be allowed if the drug is safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated. A second extension for 14 additional doses every 2 weeks will be allowed if the&#xD;
      drug is safe and well tolerated.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent prior to initiation of any program-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Familial or sporadic ALS defined as clinically possible, probable, or definite by&#xD;
             Awaji-Shima Consensus Recommendations or other standard guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function as defined by the patient's physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females of childbearing potential should be using and committed to continue using one&#xD;
             of the following acceptable birth control methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Sexual abstinence (inactivity) for 1 month prior to screening through study&#xD;
                  completion; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Intrauterine device (IUD) in place for at least 3 months prior to study through&#xD;
                  study completion; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Stable hormonal contraception for at least 3 months prior to study through study&#xD;
                  completion; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Surgical sterilization (vasectomy) of male partner at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. To be considered of non-childbearing potential, females should be surgically&#xD;
             sterilized (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy at least&#xD;
             2 months prior to study) or be post-menopausal and at least 3 years since last menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Males with female partners of childbearing potential must use contraception through&#xD;
             study completion.&#xD;
