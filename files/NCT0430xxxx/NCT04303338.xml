  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess if the masotherapy with neural tension is more&#xD;
      effective than non-neural tension to improve and reduce tremor in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease. The project will be carried out in clinics, where both data collection, assessments&#xD;
      and scales will be carried out, as well as the plan and intervention in which the neural&#xD;
      tension massage therapy of the radial nerve will be applied to the first intervention group;&#xD;
      and massage therapy without neural tension in the second group.&#xD;

      In this study the investigators are going to compare the effectiveness of two treatments&#xD;
      (masotherapy with neural tension and masotherapy with non-neural tension) in patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson disease based on the improved of pain, tremor, functional and life quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are going to divide the number of volunteers in two groups. The first group&#xD;
      is going to be treated during 8 weeks with conventional (non-neural tension) masotherapy in&#xD;
      the upper limb, the other group is going to be treated with radial neural tension masotherapy&#xD;
      during 8 weeks also. To apply the neural tension, the investigators position the patient's&#xD;
      upper limb lowering the scapula, elbow extended, internal rotation glenohumeral, forearm&#xD;
      pronation, bend and cubital deviation of the wrist, fingers bended and thumb adduction, and&#xD;
      finally glenohumeral abduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the results between the different groups, the investigators are going to value the&#xD;
      patients 4 times, the first one before the beginning of the treatment, the second one and the&#xD;
      end of the treatment, the third one after one month completing the treatment, and the last&#xD;
      one after three months completing the treatment.&#xD;
