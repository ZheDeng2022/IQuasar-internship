  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TCN PATHS will recruit 800 people who are prescribed MOUD who are released from 8 detention&#xD;
      facilities. Each individual will be randomized to either 1) standard primary care (SPC) or 2)&#xD;
      a Transitions Clinic Network (TCN) program primary care. Participants will be followed for a&#xD;
      year and complete surveys at baseline and at month 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. At each of these&#xD;
      points research staff will confirm MOUD status. Urine drug screenings will be completed at&#xD;
      baseline, month 1, 6, and 12 if the participant is not incarcerated. When possible, research&#xD;
      staff will collect electronic health records.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: The overall objective of this study is to assess whether the Transitions Clinic&#xD;
      Network (TCN) program, which provides enhanced primary care and opioid use disorder (OUD)&#xD;
      treatment for people recently released from incarceration, improves measures in the opioid&#xD;
      treatment cascade compared to referral to standard primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 800 individuals currently receiving medications for OUD released from eight&#xD;
      local jails (Durham, NC; Minneapolis, MN; Ontario, NY; Bronx, NY; Bridgeport and Niantic, CT;&#xD;
      and Bayam√≥n and Ponce, Puerto Rico)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: This is a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation trial will randomize 800&#xD;
      people to one of two treatment conditions: TCN or standard primary care. People will complete&#xD;
      the enrollment process while in jail (recruitment, screening, consent, baseline assessments,&#xD;
      and randomization). Due to COVID-19 restrictions some jails are limiting researcher assess to&#xD;
      people and some of our sites may enroll participants once they are released, this is referred&#xD;
      to as a community enrollment. Post participants will meet with research assistants for a&#xD;
      structured interview and urine toxicology screening at 1, 6, and 12 months, and a phone&#xD;
      interview at months 3 and 9. 120 people will be selected to participate in Intensive&#xD;
      Longitudinal Assessment (ILA) to access both the acceptability and appropriateness of the TCN&#xD;
      intervention and the multi-level facilitators and barriers of OUD treatment engagement in the&#xD;
      first 30 days following release from incarceration.&#xD;

    <measure>Engagement in opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days following jail release</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study outcome will be engagement in OUD treatment within 30 days of jail release, defined as treatment consistent with the American Society of Addiction Medicine's levels of care (1-4), which allows for a range of treatments and clinical settings consistent with patient's needs and preference (e.g., office-based providers of buprenorphine or naltrexone, OTPs, or intensive outpatient, inpatient, or residential treatments). Patients do not need to be receiving methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone formulations (MOUD) to be considered engaged in OUD treatment. This will be measured based on questions about engagement in OUD treatment. These responses will be used to calculate a count of participants engaged in OUD treatment. As appropriate, this information will be confirmed in the electronic health record or with the addiction treatment facilities after obtaining a signed release.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention in OUD treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following jail release</time_frame>
    <description>Retention in community OUD treatment will defined in accordance with the American Society of Addiction Medicine's levels of care (1-4), which allows for a range of treatments and clinical settings consistent with patient's needs and preference (e.g., office-based providers of buprenorphine or naltrexone, OTPs, or intensive outpatient, inpatient, or residential treatments). Patients do not need to be receiving MOUD to be considered retained in OUD treatment. Consistent with our prior research, this will be measured based on a Yes/No question about engagement in OUD treatment from the Treatment Services Review (TSR). These responses will be used to calculate a count of participants engaged in OUD treatment. As appropriate, this information will be confirmed in the electronic health record or with the addiction treatment facilities after obtaining a signed release. Re-incarceration (and resumption of MOUD in jail) will not count as retained in community OUD treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention on medication for OUD (MOUD)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following initial jail release</time_frame>
    <description>Retention on MOUD will be defined as receipt of any of the 3 FDA approved medications for OUD (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) within 7 days of the index date (release from jail/interview date) regardless of what MOUD participants were on at baseline prior to release. This measure will be collected by using self report and as appropriate, will confirm self-report in the electronic health record or with the addiction treatment facilities after obtaining a signed release.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent days of illicit opioid use</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following initial jail release</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will measure percent days of illicit opioid use during study time frames. Investigators will measure this by asking the participant how many days during the study time frame have they used illicit opioids. A urine toxicology that is positive for illicit opioids on testing will count as three days of using illicit opioids. Using the data from the</description>

    <description>Retention in primary care which is defined as 2 or more visits to primary care in twelve months. Participants will be asked to self-report the number of visits and this data will be used to count the number of participants retained in primary care.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overdose</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following initial jail release</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked about overdose events using self-report, when applicable, be supplemented by data from the electronic health record which will indicate visits to the emergency department and hospitalizations for overdose. In at least four TCN program sites, investigators will have access to administrative payer data (Medicaid) where investigators will be able to examine time to overdose as a secondary outcome. This data will be used to calculate a count of participants experiencing an overdose event</description>

    <measure>Time to Overdose</measure>

    <description>In at least four of the six TCN program sites, investigators will have access to administrative payer data (Medicaid) where investigators will be able to examine time to overdose as a secondary outcome. This data will be used to calculate time to overdose for each participant for each overdose event.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Death</measure>
