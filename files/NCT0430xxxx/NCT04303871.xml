  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are important causes of maternal morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      worldwide. Hypertension is one of the most commonly reported health conditions among pregnant&#xD;
      women and complicates 5-10% of all pregnancies.(Martin et al., 2009) (Wagner et al., 2007)&#xD;
      The measurement of central BP in hypertensive patients became more important because of its&#xD;
      predictive value for cardiovascular events. Direct intra-arterial readings are considered to&#xD;
      be the gold standard method for blood pressure measurement but because arterial cannulation&#xD;
      is associated with risks, alternative non-invasive blood pressure measurements may be used.&#xD;
      (Araghi et al., 2006) In our study, the investigator aimed to assess the accuracy of&#xD;
      non-invasive central blood pressure by oscillometric automated device (Mobil O graph) in&#xD;
      comparison to the invasive blood pressure measurement by arterial cannulation in patients&#xD;
      with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators enrolled 100 pregnant women and 10 healthy non-pregnant women as a control&#xD;
      group, central blood pressure was measured invasively by arterial cannula and non-invasively&#xD;
      by oscillometric automated device (Mobil O Graph).&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigatorshave found a high correlation between non-invasive central blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements and invasively measured both systolic (r 0.968, p=0.000) and diastolic (r 0.687,&#xD;
      p=0.000).&#xD;

      Study Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in our study were subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full history taking including:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Age, full obstetric history including (number of previous pregnancies and abortions),&#xD;
           history of previous illness, duration of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risk factors for developing hypertension as Diabetes Mellitus (DM), history of chronic&#xD;
           hypertension, anti-hypertensive treatment, history of HTN during previous pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Full physical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
           On admission: Patient's weight and height were obtained to calculate Body surface area&#xD;
           (BSA) Vital signs assessment regarding arterial pulse, arterial blood pressure&#xD;
           measurement using mercury sphygmomanometer and proper arm cuff according to the recent&#xD;
           guidelines of arterial hypertension General and local cardiac examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigations : the followings were done at time of hospital admission:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Urine analysis: was done to all participants to exclude the presence of albuminuria&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Echocardiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants underwent resting transthoracic 2D echocardiography, Scans were acquired by&#xD;
      a standard parasternal/apical views using (VIVID S5 instrument, GE Medical Systems, Horten,&#xD;
      Norway) with subjects in the left lateral decubitus position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Blood pressure assessment: was done after control of blood pressure by different&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive drugs mostly on 3rd- 4th day of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Office blood pressure measurement: BP in pregnancy was measured in the sitting position&#xD;
           (or the left lateral recumbent during labour) with an appropriately sized arm cuff at&#xD;
           heart level and using Korotkoff V for DBP. Manual auscultation was the only method used&#xD;
           as it remains the gold standard for BP measurement in pregnancy, because automated&#xD;
           devices tend to under-record the BP and are unreliable in severe preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Non-invasive central BP monitoring: measured by MOBIL-O-GRAPH:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The non-invasive assessment of estimated PWV was performed in a quiet,&#xD;
                temperature-controlled examination room&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Three measurements were taken with a 2-min break between them. The procedure was&#xD;
                performed with the patient in a sitting position and using an adequately sized&#xD;
                cuff. The Mobil-O-Graph 24h NG (IEM, Stolberg, Germany) with inbuilt ARCSolver&#xD;
                (Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna, Austria) This device is a commercially&#xD;
                available brachial oscillometric blood pressure monitor with Food and Drug&#xD;
                Administration and Conformite´ Europe´enne approval. Its blood pressure detection&#xD;
                unit is validated according to the British Hypertension Society and European&#xD;
                Society of Hypertension recommendations. Algorithms were used to obtain&#xD;
                conventional blood pressure readings such as brachial systolic and diastolic&#xD;
                pressures. In the second step, the brachial cuff is inflated to the diastolic blood&#xD;
                pressure level and held for about 10s to record the pulse waves. Subsequently,&#xD;
                central pressure curves obtained through a transfer function from the peripheral&#xD;
                reading are plotted. To estimate aPWV, the ARCSolver method utilizes several&#xD;
                parameters from pulse wave analysis and wave separation analysis combined in a&#xD;
                proprietary mathematical model, whereby the major determinants are age (Mendes,&#xD;
                2015) , central pressure, and aortic characteristic impedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Invasive blood pressure measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannulation technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous cannulation is performed under aseptic conditions, using the radial artery. The&#xD;
      hand and forearm are affixed to an arm board, with the wrist dorsiflexed over a bandage roll.&#xD;
      The thumb should be immobilized as well, to ensure proper anchorage of the artery. the&#xD;
      investigators infiltrate subcutaneously with 2% lidocaine as a local anaesthetic, it helps&#xD;
      also to minimize arterial spasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using palpation of the artery as a guide, the cannula (20-gauge Teflon cannula) is advanced&#xD;
      at a 20° angle to the skin until the arterial wall is pierced. The stylet is then held fixed&#xD;
      and the cannula advanced up the arterial lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cannula was connected to a disposable tubing system and flushed intermittently with&#xD;
      heparinized 0.9% saline solution. This helped prevent occlusion of the cannula by thrombus&#xD;
      .The tubing should be stiff and not contain any bubbles in order to minimize resonance and&#xD;
      damping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The liquid within the tubing was connected to a transducer (Auto Transducer®; ACE Medical,&#xD;
      Inc., Goyang, Korea). The transducer needs to be kept horizontally level with the patient;&#xD;
      traditionally, the right atrium because raising or lowering the transducer relative to the&#xD;
      patient will alter the reading. Zeroing was performed by opening the transducer to&#xD;
      atmospheric pressure and electronically zeroing the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arterial blood pressure signals were recorded and displayed on a bedside monitor (GE&#xD;
      Datex-Ohmeda S/5TM Anaesthesia Monitor, Helsinki, Finland).The whole tubing system was&#xD;
      flushed with sterile normal saline to eliminate air bubbles and tested for system loss.&#xD;
