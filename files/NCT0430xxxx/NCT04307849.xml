      This study will systematically adapt, pilot test, and evaluate an integrated&#xD;
      community/facility intervention to improve the uptake of adolescent-friendly services for&#xD;
      married and unmarried adolescent girls and young women (AGYW; ages 15-25) in a low-income&#xD;
      area with a population of approximately 700,000 in Mumbai, India&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Aim 1: Adapt the health club curriculum and provider/staff sensitization training using&#xD;
      Assessment, Decision, Administration, Production, discussion with Topical experts,&#xD;
      Integration, Training, and Testing (ADAPT-ITT) Formative mixed methods data will be collected&#xD;
      from stakeholders to assess the landscape of adolescent-friendly care and gaps to adapt the&#xD;
      intervention. Intervention sessions will be presented to groups of stakeholders to elicit&#xD;
      feedback on adaptations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formative research entails a mixed methods assessment of the adolescent sexual&#xD;
      reproductive health landscape in the study area, and adaptation of the intervention&#xD;
      components through interactive sessions, consistent with ADAPT-ITT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADAPT-ITT Assessment Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key informant interviews (KIIs) - Qualitative key informant interviews (N=35) will be&#xD;
      conducted with both public and private community-based health providers, NGO workers,&#xD;
      community health workers (CHWs), and parents of young women. Interviews will also be&#xD;
      conducted with government officials at the community and M Ward levels (wards are the&#xD;
      smallest administrative unit of governmental ministries). These interviews will focus on&#xD;
      qualitative mapping of adolescent health and treatment-seeking pathways and providers in the&#xD;
      study area, and factors in the family, community, and elsewhere that influence adolescent&#xD;
      girls' and young women's health. The KIIs will also provide insight into aspects of the&#xD;
      intervention and evaluation tools requiring modification. KIIs will also be invited to join a&#xD;
      community advisory board (CAB) for the duration of the project. This CAB will provide a forum&#xD;
      for AGYW to present their learnings from the adolescent club, and serve as a resource should&#xD;
      community members have questions or concerns about the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-depth interviews with adolescent girls and young women (IDIs) - Qualitative in-depth&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted with 20 AGYW (aged 15-25 years old) to understand their&#xD;
      experiences with healthcare in the study area, treatment-seeking patterns, and factors in the&#xD;
      family, community and elsewhere that influence their health. Young women will also be asked&#xD;
      to comment on the proposed intervention's feasibility and acceptability, and provide input on&#xD;
      aspects of the intervention and evaluation tools that need modification. Roughly equal&#xD;
      numbers of married and unmarried young women will be recruited for participation. Young women&#xD;
      will be recruited with assistance from NGO programs, CHWs, and referrals from other&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey with AGYW on care-seeking patterns and perceptions of healthcare quality and&#xD;
      quantitative analysis - A random sample of AGYW seeking care at a set of public (N=3) and&#xD;
      private (N=3) healthcare facilities in the study area will be selected and asked to&#xD;
      participate in a brief, 20-30 minute survey using validated measures to discuss their&#xD;
      patterns of healthcare-seeking (where they go for different problems, and what influences&#xD;
      those choices), and their perceptions and experiences with adolescent healthcare. For&#xD;
      unmarried participants under the age of 18, consent will be obtained from both a parent and&#xD;
      the young woman. The investigators involved in this study have experience obtaining consent&#xD;
      from parents, and do not anticipate challenges obtaining consent. About 20-25 AGYW will be&#xD;
      surveyed from each facility, with a total N=100-150. Survey data will be entered into R, and&#xD;
      bivariate and multivariate analyses will be conducted to understand factors associated with&#xD;
      AGYW treatment-seeking that may need to be addressed in the health clubs. Analyses will also&#xD;
      explore quality of care to identify elements that may need to be incorporated into the&#xD;
      provider sensitization. This survey will the investigators to apply skills gained in Training&#xD;
      Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theater testing with key stakeholders for intervention adaptations - Theater testing meetings&#xD;
      will be held in which intervention sessions are presented and, in some cases, acted out to&#xD;
      the group. Audience members' responses and post-meeting critiques of the material will be&#xD;
      recorded and analyzed (see below). During the meetings, both general feedback, as well as&#xD;
      whether adolescent health club sessions need to be conducted separately with different age&#xD;
      groups or based on marital status (married adolescents, regardless of age could have&#xD;
      different needs than unmarried adolescents) will be evaluated. Separate meetings will be held&#xD;
      with the following stakeholder groups to present the intervention modules and elicit feedback&#xD;
      on revisions or adaptations: 1) AGYW; 2) community members/KIIs; and 3) healthcare providers,&#xD;
      CHVs, and NGO staff. Additional meetings may be conducted after modifications are made to&#xD;
      ensure agreement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data analysis and finalization of intervention modules - Interviews and group&#xD;
      discussions will be transcribed and translated (as needed, some KII materials will already be&#xD;
      in English) and coded with the qualitative data analysis software, Atlas.ti. Using a&#xD;
      framework approach with codes based on key implementation and conceptual model factors of&#xD;
      interest, data will be coded and analyzed to identify elements of the intervention needing&#xD;
      revision, with additional codes added as novel topics/issues arise.Coding will be conducted&#xD;
      by myself and a research assistant, consulting with Dr. Maitra as needed. Using the formative&#xD;
      data and the expertise of my mentors, the intervention modules will be adapted to the&#xD;
      context, while making sure the key evidence-based elements are not lost. As needed,&#xD;
      additional in-depth coding of the formative qualitative data can be conducted once rapid&#xD;
      analysis for intervention adaptation has been completed. Once the modules have been&#xD;
      finalized, the intervention facilitators will be trained, and the intervention implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Implement a pilot of the intervention and assess implementation outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The provider and staff component will consist of two groups to facilitate participation and&#xD;
      accommodate provider/staff schedules. Four separate groups of AGYW will participate in the&#xD;
      adolescent health club component, using a wait-list control group design. Separate groups are&#xD;
      needed due to the group nature of the intervention activities which limits the number of&#xD;
      people who can participate at one time. Intervention participants will be surveyed pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention to examine acceptability, feasibility, and uptake. Qualitative process data&#xD;
      will also be collected and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess a pilot set of health outcomes for future research. Quantitative pre- and&#xD;
      post-tests will also assess pilot effectiveness health and behavioral outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (the &quot;Testing&quot; phase of ADAPT-ITT: Research Aims 2 and 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADAPT-ITT Model - The ADAPT-ITT model was developed by Wingood and DiClemente as a&#xD;
      systematic approach for the adaptation of sexual health/HIV-related evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions.41 The ADAPT-ITT acronym stands for each of the eight phases of the model&#xD;
      (although not all applications of the model use all phases): assessment, decision,&#xD;
      administration, production, discussion with topical experts, integration, training, and&#xD;
      testing. The assessment phase involves conducting needs assessments with the target&#xD;
      population. The decision phase (which for some studies, such as the one proposed here,&#xD;
      happens before the assessment) occurs when one chooses the evidence-based intervention(s) to&#xD;
      be adapted. Administration involves the use of theater tests or interactive presentations&#xD;
      with key stakeholders to determine what adaptations are needed and to ensure the intervention&#xD;
      will be designed with end-users in mind. The revised/adapted draft of the intervention is&#xD;
      finalized in the production and integration phases with the guidance of topical experts and&#xD;
      information from the theater tests. Once the research team is trained in intervention&#xD;
      delivery, the intervention can be pilot tested and results analyzed. The model explicitly&#xD;
      includes the target population/patients/end-users and other key stakeholders in the process&#xD;
      of intervention adaptation, enabling a participatory approach to implementation. Not all&#xD;
      frameworks or models of implementation allow for this engagement, which is why the ADAPT-ITT&#xD;
      approach was chosen. The ADAPT-ITT model has been used to adapt interventions for sexual and&#xD;
      reproductive health substance use,mental and behavioral health, and chronic health issues in&#xD;
      both international and domestic settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither providers/staff or clinics can be randomized, as only a subset of the&#xD;
      clinics/providers in the study area see enough AGYW to meet inclusion criteria, and some&#xD;
      providers/staff who participate will work in the same clinics. Providers/staff will complete&#xD;
      brief pre- and post-training surveys; however, the primary measures of their intervention&#xD;
      will be derived from the AGYW's outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the adolescent health club component, the pilot study employs a waitlisted control group&#xD;
      design. In this modified version of the stepped wedge design, all groups receive the&#xD;
      intervention, and participants serve as their own controls. This design utilizes a smaller&#xD;
      sample size of AGYW and fewer facilitators, making it more feasible for a K award, while&#xD;
      still enabling all participants to participate in the intervention. The waitlisted control&#xD;
      design also avoids some of the challenges associated with carryover effect that can occur in&#xD;
      other crossover designs, as participants move unidirectionally from control to intervention.&#xD;
      The adolescent health club curriculum (which takes approximately 2.5 months to complete) will&#xD;
      be sequentially administered to four groups, each with a waitlisted control group.&#xD;
      Individuals can be compared to themselves, and the other groups. Sequentially administering&#xD;
      the intervention will be more feasible than administering the intervention simultaneously to&#xD;
      separate neighborhood clusters, limiting the number of facilitators needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provider Sensitization Component and Evaluation - Providers and clinic staff at the public&#xD;
      UHC and health posts, as well as from private clinics known to provide care for adolescents&#xD;
      will be screened to determine if they meet eligibility criteria, and if they do, then they&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in the sensitization workshop. There will be two workshop&#xD;
      groups with 20 participants each. All participants will complete pre/post intervention&#xD;
      surveys, primarily focused on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, using&#xD;
      previously validated measures. After each session, the facilitator will complete a log to&#xD;
      code activities as implemented fully, implemented partially or modified significantly and&#xD;
      describe any changes. The log will also include a section to document any unusual events&#xD;
      associated with any of the sessions, and the effect of these events on implementation,&#xD;
      acceptability, or feasibility. Every other session will be observed and documented in&#xD;
      fieldnotes that will be analyzed to contribute to process evaluation (see analysis details&#xD;
      below). The log and observations will enable a qualitative assessment of intervention&#xD;
      fidelity. A subset will be selected for exit interviews to contextualize the quantitative&#xD;
      measures, and learn about participants' perspectives on feasibility and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescent Health Club Component and Evaluation - Households with AGYW ages 15 to 25 will be&#xD;
      identified by community health workers from randomly selected block sectors of the study&#xD;
      area. Clubs will be conducted in separate neighborhood sectors, to limit contamination.&#xD;
      Conducting club meetings near to the lanes adolescent girls live in will make it easier for&#xD;
      attendance. To further assess and address potential contamination, individuals will be asked&#xD;
      to verify the adolescent health club they attended in the post-intervention survey, whether&#xD;
      they attended an additional health club outside the intervention (such as, in school). If any&#xD;
      contamination is evident based on this question, it will be modeled in the analysis. AGYW and&#xD;
      their mothers (if unmarried and under the age of 18) will be approached by a member of the&#xD;
      research team and the adolescent health club intervention will be explained. If consent is&#xD;
      obtained, the AGYW will be enrolled, and randomized to either participate or join the&#xD;
      wait-list. AGYW will complete the pre-intervention evaluation instrument upon enrollment. In&#xD;
      addition to the activities in the &quot;It's All One&quot; Curriculum spread over eight modules,&#xD;
      providers from the sensitization component will attend one meeting to discuss services&#xD;
      available in the adolescent-friendly clinics, and hear young women's previous experiences&#xD;
      accessing care. Similar to the process for the provider sensitization component, the&#xD;
      facilitator will complete a log after each session to code activities as implemented fully,&#xD;
      implemented partially or modified significantly and describe any changes. The log will also&#xD;
      include a section to document any unusual events associated with any of the sessions, and the&#xD;
      effect of these events on implementation, acceptability, or feasibility. Every other session&#xD;
      will be observed and documented in fieldnotes that will be analyzed to contribute to process&#xD;
      evaluation (see analysis details below). As with the provider component, the log and&#xD;
      fieldnotes will enable a qualitative assessment of intervention fidelity. When young women&#xD;
      complete the curriculum, they will also complete the post-intervention evaluation instrument.&#xD;
      A sub-sample of young women (N=15) will be asked to participate in a focus group discussion&#xD;
      to reflect on the club's impact and acceptability. Domains measured by previously validated&#xD;
      instruments to be covered in the pre- and post-intervention surveys. There are relatively few&#xD;
      validated quantitative measures of implementation outcomes, and none in Hindi, thus the&#xD;
      measure chosen will have to be translated and back-translated to ensure comprehension.&#xD;
