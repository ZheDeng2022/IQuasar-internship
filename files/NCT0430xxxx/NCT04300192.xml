      Primary Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the long-term humoral immune responses to pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus&#xD;
           after homologous and heterologous pertussis vaccine priming regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of the priming regimen on humoral responses to booster&#xD;
           vaccination with Tdap-IPV vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the long-term cell-mediated immune responses to pertussis after homologous&#xD;
           and heterologous pertussis vaccine priming regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of the priming regimen on cell-mediated immune response to&#xD;

&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the safety profile of Tdap-IPV vaccine in each group&#xD;
