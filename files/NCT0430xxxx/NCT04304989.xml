  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Homebound older adults are among the highest users in health care systems. The high use of&#xD;
      health care services is related to their physical limitations compounded by complex health&#xD;
      and social care needs. Homebound older adults can be difficult to reach because they seldom&#xD;
      participate and engage in community services due to their functional limitations, which&#xD;
      leaves their health needs largely unrecognized at an earlier stage. This study tries to bring&#xD;
      this group of older adults to the providers' attention and design a health-social oriented&#xD;
      self-care mHealth program and subject it to empirical testing.&#xD;

      Methods/Design The SPIRIT statement was used as a guideline for this protocol paper. Study&#xD;
      design and setting This is a single-blinded, two-armed randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      research assistant who collects the data is blinded, but the subjects and the health care&#xD;
      providers who are involved in the intervention are not. This study is supported by five&#xD;
      community centers. The centers are widely scattered across Hong Kong, which helps to maximize&#xD;
      the generalizability effect of this program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and recruitment strategy, and randomization The leaders of the community centers&#xD;
      will help draw up lists of potential subjects. Simple random sampling with a fixed sample&#xD;
      size will be employed to recruit subjects. The inclusion criteria of this study are (1) being&#xD;
      aged 60 or over, (2) going outdoors less than once a week in the last six months, (3) living&#xD;
      within the service area of a participating community center, and (4) ability to use a&#xD;
      smartphone. The exclusion criteria are (1) being diagnosed with dementia, (2) inability to&#xD;
      hear, see or communicate, (3) being bed-bound, (4) having an active psychiatric illness with&#xD;
      recent hospital admission within the last six months, (5) living within an area with no&#xD;
      internet coverage, and (6) being already engaged in other mHealth programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be approached and invited to participate in the study. A consent form&#xD;
      will be signed once the subject agrees to participate. The random assignment schedule,&#xD;
      generated using the computer software Research Randomizer, will be compiled by a research&#xD;
      team member who is not involved in subject recruitment. The group assignments will be put in&#xD;
      a sealed envelope and revealed sequentially at the time of randomization. The research&#xD;
      assistant, after successfully recruiting a subject, will call the research team member for&#xD;
      the random assignment. The research team member who has no knowledge of the identity of the&#xD;
      subject will make the assignment based on computer numbers ('1' = video-based mHealth&#xD;
      program; '2' = control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions A three-month program will be designed in this study. There will be two groups&#xD;
      involved in this study, described as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group This group of participants will receive a video-based mHealth program that&#xD;
      includes two main elements: 1) nurse case management supported by a social service team, and&#xD;
      2) individual-specific video messages covering self-care topics delivered via smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrolment, each client in the intervention group will be assigned to a nurse case&#xD;
      manager. The nurse case manager will conduct a structured assessment via telephone call using&#xD;
      the Omaha System. The Omaha System is a comprehensive assessment-intervention-evaluation tool&#xD;
      that identifies 42 problems under the domains of environmental, psychological, physiological,&#xD;
      and health-related behaviors. The Omaha System has been found to be applicable for older&#xD;
      adults in the community and proven valid for use in Hong Kong. Following assessment, the&#xD;
      nurse case manager will guide and empower clients to set their own goals and co-decide their&#xD;
      own plans to manage their health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from monitoring clients' progress in accordance with their contract goals in a weekly&#xD;
      telephone call, the nurse case manager will also send weekly, individual-specific videos with&#xD;
      tips and reminders via smartphone. These videos cover topics of importance to clients&#xD;
      according to the results of the Omaha System. The content of videos includes but is not&#xD;
      limited to chronic disease self-management, healthy behaviors, simple self-care practices,&#xD;
      and medication knowledge. The selected videos are limited to 10 minutes to accommodate the&#xD;
      short attention span of older adults. All videos provided to the intervention group originate&#xD;
      from reliable sources such as the Hospital Authority, the Department of Health, or credible&#xD;
      health or charity organizations. The nurse case manager will first send a testing video to&#xD;
      the client in the first home visit to ensure that the client can receive the video on his/her&#xD;
      mobile. The client can either download the videos or view them online. The videos will run&#xD;
      continuously unless the client presses the &quot;pause&quot; button. Videos can be replayed once by&#xD;
      clicking the &quot;play&quot; button again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A protocol for a referral system will be established with the full support of the&#xD;
      health-social team in accordance with the conditions and needs of the client. The nurse can&#xD;
      initiate a client referral according to the set guidelines. Health referrals include primary&#xD;
      care consultation and hospital service if indicated. Social referrals include home meal&#xD;
      service, psychological counselling and the like. In this team, the nurse case manager is&#xD;
      responsible for providing health-related services such as health education and drug&#xD;
      compliance monitoring, while social workers can provide services including arranging&#xD;
      home-delivered meals, providing psychosocial support, and mobilizing community resources&#xD;
      available in the district. A monthly case conference will be held in the community center&#xD;
      between the nurse case manager and the social worker. Issues such as the progress and any&#xD;
      concerns of the clients, suggestions for interventions, and requirements for modification or&#xD;
      adjustment of goals will be discussed during the meeting. The shared responsibilities are&#xD;
      based on standardized protocols and agreed referral forms and records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group Both the intervention and control groups will receive their respective&#xD;
      community services as usual. The most common services provided by community centers include&#xD;
      meal and laundry services, transportation, health checks and education, and social&#xD;
      activities, but most of them are episodic in nature. Social calls will be provided to the&#xD;
      control group clients by a research team member who will not be involved in data collection,&#xD;
      to minimize possible social effects. Social questions such as &quot;Where will you go tomorrow?&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;What is your hobby?&quot; will be set in the protocol. The research team member will follow&#xD;
      the protocol strictly and will not provide health advice. The older adult clients will be&#xD;
      encouraged to seek medical help whenever they express concern about their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data will be collected at two time points-pre-intervention (T1) and&#xD;
      post-intervention (T2). The baseline and post-intervention data will be collected by the&#xD;
      research assistant, who will be blinded to the grouping. A previous study has found that&#xD;
      collecting data via telephone call can yield the highest response from homebound older&#xD;
      adults, since they seldom go out. The research assistant will be trained and tested on the&#xD;
      inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. Five percent of the data will be randomly selected&#xD;
      for independent review to ensure data quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance mechanism This study will adopt a number of measures to ensure that the&#xD;
      intervention delivery is valid and reliable. The nurse case manager employed in this study&#xD;
      will have extensive experience in community elderly care, with competent level in using a&#xD;
      smartphone, good communication skills, and the ability to work with a team. A training&#xD;
      session will be given to providers in the areas of case management, the referral system, the&#xD;
      Omaha system, telephone counselling skills and guidelines for telephone follow-up. During the&#xD;
      training session and prior to actual implementation of the study, providers will be required&#xD;
      to provide interventions to a simulated client in front of the research team to ensure that&#xD;
      they understand and comply with the set protocols. The health-social team and the research&#xD;
      team will meet regularly to review and discuss the progress of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The present study was granted ethical approval from the Human Subjects&#xD;
      Ethics Sub-Committee (HSESC) of the University prior to the commencement of the study. This&#xD;
      study will not cause any pain or discomfort to participants. Information about and an&#xD;
      explanation of the ethical observations of the study will be provided to all eligible&#xD;
      participants, and they will be asked to sign an informed consent. Participants will be&#xD;
      reassured that they can withdraw from the study at any time without any adverse consequences.&#xD;
      They will remain anonymous and all data will be identified by a case number only. All data&#xD;
      collected from questionnaires will be stored in a password-secured cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size calculation is based on power analysis. Assuming a two-tailed&#xD;
      alpha of 0.05, a probability of 0.2 for beta error (80% power), and an effect size of 0.45&#xD;
      with reference to previous video-based mHealth programs with the same primary outcome measure&#xD;
      (self-efficacy), 84 participants per group are required. With reference to the 10% to 15%&#xD;
      attrition rate reported in previous programs, we assume a 15% drop-out rate in this study,&#xD;
      thus the total sample size needed is 97 participants per group, i.e. a total of 194&#xD;
      participants. However, since this is a pilot study, at least 9% of the sample size of the&#xD;
      main planned trial should be used. To ensure that the power is enough to estimate the group&#xD;
      difference, this will be set at 35% of the sample size of the main planned trial. The total&#xD;
      number of clients required is therefore 68. The flow of this study will follow the Modified&#xD;
      CONSORT Statement extension for individual randomized controlled trials of&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing and analysis The research assistant and the research team member will&#xD;
      independently enter the data into the SPSS software (version 25.0, IBM). The inconsistencies&#xD;
      between these two files will be resolved by retrieving the raw data from the questionnaires.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to detect potential outliers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants' baseline characteristics will be compared using the chi-squared test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test (in case the expected frequencies in any of the cells are lower than 5)&#xD;
      for categorical variables and the two samples independent t-test for continuous variables.&#xD;
      The p-value is set at less than 0.05 as a significant result for the two-tailed test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The between-group (group), within-group (time), and the interaction effects (group x time) of&#xD;
      outcome variables will be analyzed using the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE). Linear&#xD;
      link function will be used for all outcome measures except health service utilization while&#xD;
      Poisson link function will be employed for health service utilization outcomes. Unstructured&#xD;
      working correlation matrix will be adopted to indicate the same spacing between measurements&#xD;
      for each subject. Adjusted GEE models will be employed to evaluate each outcome measures. All&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) method.&#xD;
