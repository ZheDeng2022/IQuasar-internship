    <textblock>
      One of the most effective surgical treatments for obstructive sleep apnoea / hypopnoea&#xD;
      syndrome (SAHS) with global impact on the upper-airway (UA) is the maxilla-mandibular&#xD;
      advancement (MMA). Retrospective-prospective observational study of: clinical outcomes, UA&#xD;
      and dental-cranium-facial (DCF) morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population sample will be patients treated in the Maxillofacial Surgery department of&#xD;
      &quot;Hospital de Cruces&quot;. As inclusion criteria: ≥18 years-old, moderate-severe SAHS in supine&#xD;
      position, multidisciplinary committee of sleep pathology evaluation for surgical indication,&#xD;
      and written informed consents. As exclusion criteria: pregnant woman, SAHS of central origin,&#xD;
      cranium-facial deformities that significantly modify normal UA, different surgery than MMA&#xD;
      and inconclusive / incomplete tests. It is estimated ≥90% males; ≥90% 30-59 years-old; ≤10%&#xD;
      extreme weights; 25% complementary surgeries; and sample size 40. Medical ethics code of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki will be taken into account. To collect the pre- / postoperative data&#xD;
      we will use, calibrated and standardized: polysomnography (PSG), computed tomography (CT),&#xD;
      right face profile picture (RFP) and lateral teleradiography of the cranium (LTC).&#xD;
      Furthermore, the Epworth scale and non-validated subjective self-perception test of facial&#xD;
      aesthetics will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes will be evaluated from PSG using apnoea / hypopnoea index and pulse&#xD;
      oximeter oxygen saturation, and from Epworth scale. UA morphology from CT, globally and by&#xD;
      specific locations, through lengths, volumes, areas, dimensions, and other measurements. DCF&#xD;
      aspects from RFP and LTC, by Ricketts cephalometric basic analysis and facial aesthetics&#xD;
      test. Statistical, descriptive analysis of frequencies and comparative by pairs of&#xD;
      quantitative data will be by t-Student or Wilcoxon test, after checking the variables&#xD;
      normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Upper-airway (UA) morphology does not change as a consequence of maxilla-mandibular&#xD;
      advancement (MMA) in patients with moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnoea / hypopnoea&#xD;
      syndrome (SAHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: UA changes as a consequence of MMA in patients with moderate-severe SAHS. To answer this&#xD;
      hypothesis, the following will be determined: Vertical UA length, volume, axial areas,&#xD;
      ellipticity, uniformity, prevertebral soft tissue (PST) and soft palate (SP) lengths and&#xD;
      position of the hyoid bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Clinical outcomes of MMA in moderate-severe SAHS are not successful. H1: Clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of MMA in moderate-severe SAHS are successful. To answer, the apnoea / hypopnoea&#xD;
      index (AHI), pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SPO2) and daytime sleepiness will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: DCF morphology is unfavourable as a result of MMA in moderate-severe SAHS. H1: DCF&#xD;
      morphology is not unfavourable as a result of MMA in moderate-severe SAHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer, the parameters of the Ricketts cephalometric basic analysis will be quantified and&#xD;
      interpreted, and the patient's self-perception will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specify and quantify morphological changes in key anatomical locations of the UA by computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT), in terms of vertical lengths, volumes, areas, axial dimensions, and other&#xD;
      measurements. These changes happen after MMA surgery in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      moderate-severe SAHS from a representative cohort. We are intended to demonstrate:&#xD;
      shortening, increase in volume and areas, more elliptical and uniform shape, modifications of&#xD;
      PST and SP and more anterior-superior hyoid bone position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objectives, inherent to the treatment received, it is first intended to&#xD;
      determine and evaluate clinical outcomes: objectively by polysomnography, and subjectively by&#xD;
      the Epworth scale. Secondary, it is intended to specify and quantify changes in DCF&#xD;
      morphology: objectively by a two-dimensional cephalometric analysis from lateral&#xD;
      teleradiography of the cranium (LTC) and right face profile picture (RFP), and subjectively&#xD;
      by a non-validated facial aesthetics test (FAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational retrospective-prospective study, which does not make any modification of the&#xD;
      usual clinical practice (surgical indication criteria, procedures, examinations, surgical&#xD;
      techniques...), of: clinical outcomes, UA morphology, and DCF aspects of SAHS patients&#xD;
      undergoing MMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Logistic and organizational process for the participants: Explanations, invitation to&#xD;
           participate, resolution of doubts, delivery of written information sheet and informed&#xD;
           consent, collection of them and FAT. Everything will be done in two face-to-face clinic&#xD;
           consultations that are already part of the usual work protocol of the Maxillofacial&#xD;
           Surgery department of our hospital for patients with SAHS. It is estimated that it only&#xD;
           involves about 10-15 minutes per consultation of extra time, without the need of&#xD;
           additional specific appointments for the present study. With regard to clinical history,&#xD;
           complementary examinations and surgical procedure, nothing additional is required&#xD;
           regarding the usual workflow for SAHS patients in our department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Logistic and organizational process for researchers: It is based on office and digital&#xD;
           work, without biological samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 40 subjects is estimated, compiling previous studies and the Granmo®&#xD;
      calculator. This would achieve significant statistics in all the parameters considered to&#xD;
      answer the main hypothesis, and most of the secondary ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Declaration of Helsinki code of medical ethics for research in human beings will be taken&#xD;
      into account, protecting the health of the participant, being voluntary the inclusion,&#xD;
      interrupting the investigation if it can be detrimental to the well-being of the participant&#xD;
      and agreement of confidentiality in the IC. The &quot;CEIC OSI Exkerraldea-Enkarterri-Cruces&quot;&#xD;
      committee has approved the study (Code CEIC E19/39).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will analyze the qualitative and continuous quantitative variables in categorical&#xD;
      variables. Descriptive statistics of frequencies will be calculated. For statistical&#xD;
      inference, only comparisons are made between two continuous variables, all dependent and&#xD;
      paired (pre- / post-). To verify that the variables follow a normal distribution, the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic will be used. The comparisons will then be made with the&#xD;
      t-Student test for two dependent samples or the Wilcoxon ranks test if they do not follow a&#xD;
      normal distribution. Statistically significant results will be considered if p ˂0.05.&#xD;
