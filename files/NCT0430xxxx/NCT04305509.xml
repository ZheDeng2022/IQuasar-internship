  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a study that was approved nine years ago (EK-22/2009) we could show (i) that spinal&#xD;
      manipulative therapy (SMT) is a very effective and safe treatment for acute and chronic&#xD;
      lumbar disc herniation (LDH); (ii) that SMT is as effective and less expensive than lumbar&#xD;
      nerve root injections and (iii) that the recurrence rate up to one year was very low in acute&#xD;
      and in chronic LDH patients. However, the long-term outcome of this conservatively treated&#xD;
      LDH patients is unknown. Thus, the objective of this amendment is to investigate the&#xD;
      proportion of long-term recurrences in these patients who were treated with SMT for their LDH&#xD;
      and to compare these results with already existing data from other treatments, e.g. surgery.&#xD;
      This is important information to know whether this conservative method is a sustainable&#xD;
      approach for treating LDH.&#xD;

      All 148 patients with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed disc herniation who were recruited&#xD;
      for the study EK 22-2009 will be re-contacted to assess the course of their back problem&#xD;
      during the past approx. nine years using a questionnaire.&#xD;
