      This study will be conducted using a randomized, controlled, crossover design with three&#xD;
      treatments. The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of diabetes-specific formula&#xD;
      on glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study participants will be asked to attend a test session where their glycemic,&#xD;
      insulinemic and satiety response to a test meal will be measured, followed by a seven-day&#xD;
      washout period where they will not receive or consume any study meal during this period. This&#xD;
      cycle will be repeated until all participants complete three test sessions.&#xD;
