      This study was carried out to determine the effect of ACT-based interventions applied to&#xD;

      This research is a pretest, posttest, follow-up, randomized controlled experimental study.&#xD;
      The research was carried out in Şehitkamil and Şahinbey districts, which are two central&#xD;
      districts of Gaziantep Province. 60 parents with disabled children were included in the study&#xD;
      (intervention: 30 parents, control: 30 parents). The research data was collected as pretest,&#xD;
      posttest and follow-up test from the intervention group between April and December 2019, and&#xD;
      the control group between April and September 2019 in three stages. Parental Identification&#xD;
      Form, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale&#xD;
      (DASS-21), Adult Psychological Resilience Scale (RSA-21) were used as data collection form.&#xD;
      After the pre-test data was collected, the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Based&#xD;
      Intervention Program was applied to the intervention group in six sessions. The duration of&#xD;
      each session lasted on average 60-90 minutes. A session was held for each parent once a week.&#xD;
      The control group participated in the training carried out by the guidance service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention programme based on ACT was prepared with the aim of reducing levels of&#xD;
      psychological inflexibility, caregiver burden, depression, anxiety and stress, and of&#xD;
      increasing levels of psychological resilience in parents of CSN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preparation of the interventions and planning of the sessions based on ACT, the&#xD;
      researcher utilised studies in the literature and the basic ACT training she had received.&#xD;
      After preparation of the ACT intervention protocol, it was given its final shape by obtaining&#xD;
      the views of specialists working in this field. The sessions were prepared based on six&#xD;
      components of psychological flexibility found at the basis of ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keywords: Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), special needs child, psychological&#xD;
      inflexibility, resilience, depression-anxiety-stress levels, caregiver burden, public health&#xD;

    <measure>Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire consists of 7 items and evaluates information about psychological consistency. the minimum and maximum values of scale changes between 7 and 49 points.

    <description>The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) is a set of three self-report scales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress.&#xD;
Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 items, divided into subscales with similar content. The depression scale assesses dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest / involvement, anhedonia and inertia. The anxiety scale assesses autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The stress scale is sensitive to levels of chronic non-specific arousal. It assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily upset / agitated, irritable / over-reactive and impatient. Scores for depression, anxiety and stress are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items.</description>
