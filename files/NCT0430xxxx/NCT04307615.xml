  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In swimming induced pulmonary edema (SIPE), there is a lack of knowledge regarding optimal&#xD;
      treatment. The present study was designed to assess the benefit of continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP) compared to oxygen as a first line treatment of SIPE in the out-of-hospital&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Swimming induced pulmonary edema (SIPE) is an unusual condition affecting otherwise healthy&#xD;
      swimmers. SIPE is characterized by acute onset of dyspnea and cough, excessive sputum and&#xD;
      occasionally hemoptysis when swimming in open water. The condition usually resolves&#xD;
      spontaneously within 48 hours, but may result in serious illness and require emergency care.&#xD;
      Case reports describe acute treatment with oxygen alone or in combination with diuretics,&#xD;
      beta-agonist-inhalation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Evidence for optimal&#xD;
      treatment strategy is lacking. This study intends to determine whether oxygen alone or&#xD;
      applied together with CPAP leads to improvement of oxygen saturation and recovery of&#xD;
      patients. The aim is to treat patients on site without involving hospital care. We study a&#xD;
      large cohort of approximately 12 000 swimmers during Vansbrosimningen, Sweden's biggest&#xD;
      annual open water event with a yearly incidence of SIPE about 0,4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients clinically diagnosed with SIPE are randomly assigned in 2 groups receiving&#xD;
      treatment during 20 minutes: (1) oxygen 10l/min or (2) oxygen 10l/min and CPAP 7,5 cm H2O.&#xD;
      Assessment with outcome measures is taken 10 minutes after treatment. Primary endpoint:&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (%) by pulse oxymetry.&#xD;
