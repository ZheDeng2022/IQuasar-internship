  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 15 individuals living with chronic SCI will be recruited for this study. Each&#xD;
      participant will complete an initial clinical assessment before starting a 10-week training&#xD;
      program. The training program will consist of three 45-minute Whole-Body Electrical Muscle&#xD;
      Stimulation (WBEMS)-augmented exercise training sessions for 10 weeks. At each training&#xD;
      session, all adverse events (pain, redness, injury, etc.) will be recorded along with&#xD;
      participants' comments concerning comfort (i.e. Objective 1). The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the use of a WBEMS will result in no serious adverse effect during and following the&#xD;
      training sessions and that it will take less than 10 minutes to don and doff the suit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the fifth session, after participants have had the opportunity to become familiar with the&#xD;
      WBEMS intervention, the immediate effects of the intervention on physiological responses will&#xD;
      be assessed (i.e. Objective 2). It is hypothesized that during a single training session&#xD;
      consisting of WBEMS and exercise, physiological responses and energy expenditure (EE) will be&#xD;
      significantly improved in participants with SCI compared to a training session consisting&#xD;
      solely of exercises without WBEMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the training program, participants will complete the final clinical assessment&#xD;
      to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of the WBEMS-augmented exercise intervention (i.e.&#xD;
      Objective 3). Three months after the end of the training program, the participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a semi-structured interview and questionnaire to evaluate the perceived&#xD;
      benefits of the training program (i.e. Objective 3).It is also hypothesized that participants&#xD;
      will perceive benefits of the 10-week training program such as decreased spasticity,&#xD;
      increased energy and improved mood.&#xD;
