  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TB remains the foremost infectious disease killer globally. A startling statistic is that two&#xD;
      out of every five TB cases globally (40%) remain undiagnosed and untreated. These 'missed' or&#xD;
      undiagnosed cases are disproportionately concentrated in large peri-urban 'slums' and&#xD;
      informal settlements of large cities in Africa and Asia (they are frequently minimally&#xD;
      symptomatic but remain infectious).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of a sensitive low cost same-day test represented a major challenge to active&#xD;
      community-based case finding (ACF) compared to the current model where patients 'self-seek'&#xD;
      care (passive case finding). More recently, sensitive TB DNA-detection tests called Gene&#xD;
      Xpert (Xpert) have become available. This is a nucleic acid amplification test-based&#xD;
      technology which can rule-in a diagnosis of TB in two thirds of smear negative pulmonary TB&#xD;
      cases. GeneXpert® has now been rolled out in many African countries and is the frontline TB&#xD;
      test in primary care clinics in South Africa. The investigators recently showed that&#xD;
      GeneXpert® significantly reduced the time to treatment initiation in the setting of passive&#xD;
      case finding (elaborated in next section). The investigators further showed that GeneXpert®&#xD;
      can be performed by a minimally trained healthcare worker. However, historically technical&#xD;
      and logistical demands meant that the GeneXpert® MTB-RIF assay was not ideally suited to use&#xD;
      at point of care and in South Africa it is still centrally located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small portable battery-operated versions of these tests are now available (EDGE, GeneXpert&#xD;
      two-module mobile platform). The investigators conducted a large study in South Africa and&#xD;
      Zimbabwe (published in 2016) that showed that using the old non-portable version of Xpert on&#xD;
      a mini-truck equipped with a generator was feasible and highly effective for ACF. A&#xD;
      subsequent study funded by the American government (XACT II), showed that using the portable&#xD;
      version of Xpert on the back of a small low-cost scalable panel van (in effect a mobile&#xD;
      mini-clinic) was feasible and had a very high pick-up rate of TB in peri-urban communities&#xD;
      (~10% of those undergoing targeted screening). In this study, the investigators will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that community-based active case finding (ACF) using Gene Xpert Edge (in a low&#xD;
      cost scalable mini-mobile clinic) performed at point-of-care (POC) is feasible and more&#xD;
      effective (lower proportion of TB cases failing to initiate treatment especially if they are&#xD;
      'super-spreaders' i.e. highly infectious) than Xpert performed in a centralised laboratory.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study (XACT III) the investigators will use the same approach (as for XACT&#xD;
      II), but it remains to be shown that such a strategy is scalable and feasible in different&#xD;
      settings where the challenges and conditions vary. More importantly, the investigators need&#xD;
      to methodologically optimize the ACF model. Thus, the investigators aim to determine where&#xD;
      Xpert (the diagnostic test) should be optimally placed from a physical location&#xD;
      point-of-view, i.e. does it really need to be installed in the mobile mini clinic, or, can it&#xD;
      be located in centralized laboratories (as it is now) with samples being sent to these&#xD;
      laboratories? This is a very important question: it is known that sending collected sputum&#xD;
      samples to centralized laboratories will be much easier as it uses existing infrastructure,&#xD;
      however, the downside is between 20 and 40% of patients fail to come back to collect their&#xD;
      results (pre-treatment loss to follow-up; PTLF). Using the diagnostic in the mobile mini van&#xD;
      (at point-of-care; POC) dramatically reduces this PTLF enabling quick diagnosis and&#xD;
      interrupting transmission. To definitively settle the question, a study is needed using the&#xD;
      two different strategies to find out which strategy is most cost-effective yet can rapidly&#xD;
      pick up the most cases and minimize transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two other important sub-questions that the study will answer. Chest X-rays, which&#xD;
      can identify people at high risk of having TB, can now be automatically read by a computer&#xD;
      algorithm (called computer-assisted diagnosis of TB; CAD-TB). It will be very important to&#xD;
      know whether mass screening using CAD-TB can triage individuals i.e. narrow the net so that&#xD;
      the investigators target the ACF only to those at high risk of having TB. This could save&#xD;
      even more money yet be just as effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, a fundamental unanswered question is why individuals with minimal or no symptoms&#xD;
      can be highly infectious (transmit disease)? The investigators need to study this phenomenon&#xD;
      in greater detail using cough aerosol readouts, chest X-rays, and looking at the TB strains.&#xD;
      In addition the investigators would like to screen contacts of individuals with confirmed&#xD;
      tuberculosis This might provide medical science with the information it needs to design&#xD;
      diagnostic or therapeutic interventions to address this important problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the key priority now is to show that the XACT approach is feasible in different&#xD;
      settings and to clarify how the molecular diagnostics should be optimally located. Answering&#xD;
      these questions will allow the initiation of ACF programmes in many countries and will&#xD;
      contribute critical data to policy makers so that guidelines on ACF can be disseminated and&#xD;
      implemented.&#xD;
