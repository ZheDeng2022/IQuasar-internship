  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study researchers want to collect information on how long the pain relief lasts&#xD;
      after a fixed dose of naproxen sodium or hydrocodone/acetaminophen or placebo (contains no&#xD;
      medication) over 12 hours in subjects experiencing moderate to severe pain after having their&#xD;
      wisdom teeth removed. Naproxen Sodium (Aleve®) is a drug that is used for the temporary&#xD;
      relief of minor aches and pains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen is a combination drug used to relieve moderate to severe pain. It&#xD;
      contains an opioid (narcotic) pain reliever (hydrocodone) and a non-opioid pain reliever&#xD;
      (acetaminophen).&#xD;

    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference Over 12 Hours (SPID 0-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity is measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). For each post dose time point, pain intensity difference (PID) is derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the post dose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score). A positive difference is indicative of improvement. Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPIDs) was calculated by multiplying the PID score at each post-dose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values over the specific time period. SPID over 12 hours ranges from -120 to 120. A higher value indicates a better pain reduction.</description>

    <measure>Total Pain Relief Over 12 Hours (TOTPAR 0-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief is measured using Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale (0 = No relief, 1 = A little relief, 2 = Some relief, 3 = A lot of relief, 4 = Complete relief). Total Pain Relief is calculated as the area under the curve of pain relief score over time for the given time period by multiplying the pain relief score at each time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values over the specific time period. TOTPAR over 12 hours ranges from 0 to 48, a higher value indicates more pain relief.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief is measured using Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale (0 = No relief, 1 = A little relief, 2 = Some relief, 3 = A lot of relief, 4 = Complete relief). Total Pain Relief is calculated as the area under the curve of pain relief score over time for the given time period by multiplying the pain relief score at each time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values over the specific time period. TOTPAR over 6 hours ranges from 0 to 24, a higher value indicates more pain relief.</description>

    <description>To quantify the use of opioid analgesics in treatment of post-operative dental pain, the amount of rescue medications (opioids) was converted to a standard unit, which was Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) using below formula:&#xD;

        <title>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference Over 12 Hours (SPID 0-12)</title>
        <description>Pain intensity is measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). For each post dose time point, pain intensity difference (PID) is derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the post dose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score). A positive difference is indicative of improvement. Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPIDs) was calculated by multiplying the PID score at each post-dose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values over the specific time period. SPID over 12 hours ranges from -120 to 120. A higher value indicates a better pain reduction.</description>

          <title>Total Pain Relief Over 6 Hours (TOTPAR 0-6)</title>
          <description>Pain relief is measured using Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale (0 = No relief, 1 = A little relief, 2 = Some relief, 3 = A lot of relief, 4 = Complete relief). Total Pain Relief is calculated as the area under the curve of pain relief score over time for the given time period by multiplying the pain relief score at each time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values over the specific time period. TOTPAR over 6 hours ranges from 0 to 24, a higher value indicates more pain relief.</description>

        <title>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference Over 6 Hours (SPID 0-6)</title>
        <description>Pain intensity is measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). For each post dose time point, pain intensity difference (PID) is derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the post dose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score). A positive difference is indicative of improvement. Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPIDs) was calculated by multiplying the PID score at each post-dose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values over the specific time period. SPID over 6 hours ranges from -60 to 60. A higher value indicates a better pain reduction.</description>
