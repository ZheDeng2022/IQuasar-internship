    <textblock>
      Objectives: The study aimed to compare the success and reliability of an artificial&#xD;
      intelligence application in the detection and classification of submerged teeth in&#xD;
      orthopantomography (OPG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) algorithms were used to detect and classify&#xD;
      submerged molars. The detection module, which is based on the state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN&#xD;
      architecture, processed the radiograph to define the boundaries of submerged molars. A&#xD;
      separate testing set was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the system and&#xD;
      compare it to the expert level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The success rate of classification and identification of the system is high when&#xD;
      evaluated according to the reference standard. The system was extremely accurate in&#xD;
      performance comparison with observers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: The performance of the proposed computer-aided diagnosis solution is comparable&#xD;
      to that of experts. It is useful to diagnose submerged molars with an artificial intelligence&#xD;
      application to prevent errors. Also, it will facilitate pediatric dentists' diagnoses.&#xD;

      Pre-processing, Training, and Classification The study was conducted with balanced data sets.&#xD;
      The case and control data sets were randomly divided into two parts, the training group (27&#xD;
      case group/27 control group) and the test group (10 case group/10 control group) to prevent&#xD;
      the use of the visuals in the training group for retesting. The testing data set was not seen&#xD;
      by the system during the training phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 2943-by-1435 pixel images in the data set were resized to 971 by 474 pixels prior to&#xD;
      training. All OPG images used include the whole dentitions. The training and test data sets&#xD;
      were used to estimate and generate weight factors for the optimal CNN algorithm. An arbitrary&#xD;
      sequence was generated using open-source Python programming (Python 3.6.1, Python Software&#xD;
      Foundation, Wilmington, DE, USA, https://www.python.org/) language and OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas,&#xD;
      and Matplotlib libraries. In this study, Tensorflow for model development was used to&#xD;
      classify submerged primary molars. InceptionV3 architecture was used as transfer learning,&#xD;
      and the transfer values were saved in the cache. Then, fully connected layer and softmax&#xD;
      classifiers were combined to form the final model layers. The training was carried out using&#xD;
      7000 steps with 16G RAM and a PC equipped with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050.&#xD;
