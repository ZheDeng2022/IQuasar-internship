    <textblock>
      This phase IIa trial studies the side effects of abemaciclib monotherapy in treating patients&#xD;
      age 70 years and older with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the incidence of grade 3 or higher toxicities attributed to abemaciclib&#xD;
      monotherapy in adults aged 70 or older with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the full toxicity profile including all grade 2 and higher adverse events, and&#xD;
      patient-reported adverse events (AEs) using Patients Reported Outcomes (PRO)-Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe rates of dose reductions, dose holds, treatment discontinuations due to&#xD;
      factors other than progression, and hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate median (and 95% confidence interval [CI]) failure-free survival,&#xD;
      progression-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe the results of Was It Worth It (WIWI) and Overall Treatment Utility (OTU)&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To describe the rate of adherence to abemaciclib. VI. To determine average plasma&#xD;
      steady-state abemaciclib Ctrough concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate the association of adherence rate with abemaciclib plasma t-rough&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To describe associations between cancer-specific, comprehensive Geriatric Assessment&#xD;
      (cGA) scores and the incidence of toxicities and their grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the association between biomarkers of aging and grades 3 or higher toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 6 months&#xD;
      for 2 years.&#xD;

             impairment [e.g. estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min], history of major&#xD;
             surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's&#xD;
             disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline&#xD;
