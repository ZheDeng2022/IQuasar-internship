    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to examine, in a non-inferiority study, whether the&#xD;
      combination of conventional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can replace&#xD;
      the radiation-based imaging modalities that are currently used to localize pathological&#xD;
      parathyroid glands prior to surgical removal in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will take the form of a prospective paired cohort study where included patients receive&#xD;
      a contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination in addition to the standard preoperative imaging&#xD;
      regimen (subtraction scintigraphy with SPECT/CT and conventional ultrasound). Patients act as&#xD;
      their own controls as all included patients undergo both CEUS and conventional imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human body has four parathyroid glands. These are located in the neck at the backside of&#xD;
      the thyroid gland. The four glands produce parathyroid hormone which regulates the amount of&#xD;
      calcium in the blood. If one or more of the thyroid glands becomes hyperactive, too much&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone is secreted into the blood. This condition is called hyperparathyroidism&#xD;
      and results in elevated serum calcium levels. If left untreated, hyperparathyroidism may&#xD;
      result in weak bones (osteoporosis), bone fractures, kidney stones and a myriad of unspecific&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the vast majority of cases, only one of the four parathyroid glands is responsible for the&#xD;
      disease, and the cure is surgical excision of the hyperactive gland. Such a surgery has&#xD;
      traditionally involved a dissection of both sides of the neck, allowing the surgeon to&#xD;
      visually inspect all four parathyroid glands to determine which gland(s) were hyperactive.&#xD;
      Nowadays, if the hyperactive gland can be identified by parathyroid imaging prior to surgery,&#xD;
      the surgeon can perform a minimally invasive procedure, focusing on the removal of a single&#xD;
      gland. Such a focused procedure minimizes surgical risks and results in a shorter duration of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parathyroid imaging regimen currently requires two out-patient visits on two separate&#xD;
      days. The patient first visits the Department of Nuclear Medicine where a scan involving two&#xD;
      radioactive tracers (a subtraction scintigraphy) and a 3D-examination (a SPECT/CT scan) are&#xD;
      performed. The second visit takes place at the department of Head and Neck Surgery, where a&#xD;
      head and neck surgeon performs an ultrasound examination of the neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scans at the Department of Nuclear Medicine require the patient to lie completely still&#xD;
      for a long time, expose the patient to some degree of radiation, and are relatively&#xD;
      expensive. The ultrasound examination is fast and inexpensive, but isn't as sensitive as the&#xD;
      scintigraphy (76% versus 70-92%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project attempts to increase the sensitivity of the ultrasound examination by adding on&#xD;
      an intravenous contrast agent. The contrast agent stays solely within the blood vessels,&#xD;
      where it enhances the ultrasound signal. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) does not expose&#xD;
      the patient to radiation, is fast to carry out, and the patient can be informed about the&#xD;
      result of the scan immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that by introducing CEUS, we can change the order in which patients are examined&#xD;
      prior to surgery, meaning that ultrasound - with or without an added contrast agent - will be&#xD;
      the primary parathyroid imaging modality, and that patients will only continue to the&#xD;
      Department of Nuclear Medicine if the result of the CEUS examination is uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to examine, in a non-inferiority study, whether the&#xD;
      combination of conventional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can replace&#xD;
      the radiation-based imaging modalities that are currently used to localize pathological&#xD;
      parathyroid glands prior to surgical removal in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will take the form of a prospective paired cohort study where patients receive a&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination in addition to the standard preoperative imaging&#xD;
      regimen (subtraction scintigraphy with SPECT/CT and conventional ultrasound). The CEUS&#xD;
      examiner will be blinded to the results of the subtraction scintigraphy and SPECT/CT. The&#xD;
      surgeon will have access to the results of all the preoperative imaging procedures, including&#xD;
      CEUS. Correct localization of a hyperactive parathyroid gland on preoperative imaging is&#xD;
      confirmed by a histological examination of the surgical specimen.&#xD;
