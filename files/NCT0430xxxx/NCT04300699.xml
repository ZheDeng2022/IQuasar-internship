  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is frequently diagnosed in older women, with over half of all new diagnoses&#xD;
      being in women over 65 years. Current treatment options are based on the results of clinical&#xD;
      trials that often do not include older, less fit patients in whom treatments may be less well&#xD;
      tolerated. Further, in older patients the impact of complex medical and social issues is not&#xD;
      known. The UK lags behind Europe and the United States in the development of research&#xD;
      programs dedicated to improving outcomes for older patients. More research focus is urgently&#xD;
      required to improve the assessment and management of older women with ovarian cancer to&#xD;
      improve survival outcomes, quality of life and functional independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment decisions are made predominantly on age and fitness. However, it has been&#xD;
      shown that undertaking a holistic, geriatric assessment of older patients can highlight&#xD;
      important issues that would not necessarily be identified in a routine oncology appointment.&#xD;
      In this study, we propose to ask oncology teams to undertake a geriatric assessment and&#xD;
      specifically address issues that may arise as a result of this. The assessment comprises 8&#xD;
      simple non-invasive assessments that can be performed in the out-patient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach could result in an important change in clinical practice leading to more&#xD;
      holistic assessment of older cancer patients and better address their specific needs and&#xD;
      manage their cancer treatment. The long-term goal is to show that pro-actively managing&#xD;
      potential issues at the beginning of treatment allows patients to tolerate treatment and&#xD;
      maintain their functional independence, leading to improved quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      FAIR-O is a single-arm, multi-center, phase II intervention trial of a geriatric assessment&#xD;
      in older patients (â‰¥ 70 years old) diagnosed with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or&#xD;
      primary peritoneal cancer. Patients will be approached if they are being considered for&#xD;
      systemic chemotherapy either as neoadjuvant / front-line chemotherapy in the first-line&#xD;
      setting OR for chemotherapy at first relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two cohorts of patients will be recruited and run in parallel (no comparison will be&#xD;
      performed between them):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First-line cohort: patients with newly diagnosed advanced (stage III/IV) ovarian cancer&#xD;
           who have received no prior treatment for ovarian cancer including surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. First relapse cohort: ovarian cancer patients with first relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
      On consenting to the trial, a comprehensive medical and treatment history will be obtained&#xD;
      including blood tests, tumour markers and a CT scan. The CT scan will be assessed for extent&#xD;
      (volume) of muscle mass and compared to reference standards to identify patients with low&#xD;
      muscle attenuation and sarcopenia (i.e. loss of muscle mass).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, consented patients will be asked to undertake a comprehensive Geriatric&#xD;
      Assessment which comprises a collection of 8 tests - all of which are non-invasive. These&#xD;
      test comprise validated questionnaires and functional assessments including the G8&#xD;
      questionnaire, independent activities of daily living (IADL), activities of daily living&#xD;
      (ADL), Charlson co-morbidity score, Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), mini&#xD;
      nutritional assessment (MNA), a timed up-and-go test and a mini cognitive assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Geriatric Assessment will enable the treating clinical team to determine whether the&#xD;
      patient has specific deficits or problems which need further specialist attention with the&#xD;
      aim of ensuring maximum tolerance to chemotherapy treatment. A Study Algorithm will guide the&#xD;
      clinician to the most appropriate actions. These actions may include referral to other&#xD;
      specialist services or referral for specific diagnostic tests. The number and type of&#xD;
      referrals and the time taken for that referral to be performed will be captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the initial assessment in clinic, patients will will continue to attend standard&#xD;
      treatment chemotherapy clinics. Their response to treatment will be recorded including the&#xD;
      emergence of symptoms of study interest. Throughout the study decisions regarding systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy including regimen choice, dose modifications and supportive medications will be&#xD;
      the responsibility of the treating oncologist and will not be determined by the outcome of&#xD;
      the Geriatric Assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited until 60 patients have been recruited to each cohort. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed-up until the end of the study which will be defined as 12 months from study&#xD;
      entry or disease progression or death, whichever comes soonest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of introducing the Geriatric Assessment into the standard of care&#xD;
      chemotherapy pathway is the primary end point of the study and will be statistically&#xD;
      assessed. The number of fully completed assessments that the Research Team are able to&#xD;
      conduct in the predicted target of 120 patients recruited to the trial will determine the&#xD;
      feasibility on introducing the Geriatric Assessment to routine oncology clinics for this&#xD;
      patient cohort.&#xD;
