      Introduction: Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are relatively common conditions and&#xD;
      internal derangement is the most common among them. Different methods have been suggested for&#xD;
      treatment , beginning with conservative approaches ending with surgery. Nowadays, arthroscopy&#xD;
      and arthrocentesis have eliminated the use of many of the more complex surgical procedures.&#xD;
      Despite such advancements, there is lack of prospective, randomized, clinical studies to&#xD;
      support the use of either both. In doing the necessary studies, and comparing the results, it&#xD;
      will be important to develop standardized patient selection criteria and treatment options to&#xD;
      be used by all investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To compare between arthrocentesis and operative arthroscopy in the management of&#xD;
      patients with internal derangement of temporomandibular joint stage II and III Wilkes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: a prospective study was done on 40 patients with temporomandibular&#xD;
      joint internal derangement and were divided into 2 groups, 20 patients were treated with&#xD;
      arthrocentesis and 20 patients were treated with operative arthroscopy.&#xD;

      The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is known as ginglymo-arthrodial joint and is formed by the&#xD;
      bony articulations of the mandibular condyle with the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone.&#xD;
      Interposed between the condyle and the fossa is a piece of dense avascular fibrous connective&#xD;
      tissue namely the TMJ disc which divides the joint into superior and inferior compartments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMJ disorders are relatively common conditions with incidence rate of 28% - 88%. They affect&#xD;
      up to one-third of all adults at some stage in their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two fundamental components form the temporomandibular system, the temporomandibular joint&#xD;
      (TMJ) and the associated neuromuscular system. Any defect of one or both components lead to&#xD;
      temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Symptoms can be unilateral or bilateral involving the face,&#xD;
      head or jaw. TMDs are broadly divided by the American Academy of Orofacial Pain (AAOP) into&#xD;
      muscle related TMD (myogenous), and joint-related TMD (arthrogenous). The two types can be&#xD;
      present concurently, making diagnosis and treatment more testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is one of the most common&#xD;
      temporomandibular disorders. It was defined by Dolwick in 1983 as an abnormal relation&#xD;
      between the temporomandibular disc with respect to the temporal fossa, the mandibular&#xD;
      condyle, and the temporal eminence of the TMJ. It may be present with anterior disc&#xD;
      displacement, with or without reduction, perforation of the the articular disc or even the&#xD;
      retrodiscal tissue, and degenerative changes of the joint surfaces. Clinically, it is usually&#xD;
      accompanied by clicking, pain, limitation of mouth opening, and locking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1989, Wilkes first established a classification which consists of 5 stages based on&#xD;
      clinical, radiologic, and intraoperative findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many methods have been suggested to treat this entity, beginning with conservative&#xD;
      approaches. Medical treatment depending on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and&#xD;
      muscle relaxants, Occlusal splint therapy, and physical treatment are the most frequent&#xD;
      options used among the conservative methods. Those refractory cases in which there was no&#xD;
      effective improvement in terms of mandibular function and pain are amenable to further&#xD;
      surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, surgical treatment consisted of a discectomy, regardless of the type of internal&#xD;
      derangement that was present . However, in 1979, Farrar and McCarty described surgical&#xD;
      repositioning of the disc (discoplasty), showing that it was not necessary to remove the disc&#xD;
      in most instances .&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the period when most surgeons were performing open surgical procedures for internal&#xD;
      derangements of the TMJ, a small group of surgeons was beginning to experiment with&#xD;
      arthroscopic surgery. First introduced by Ohnishi in 1975, this modality opened a new era in&#xD;
      the diagnosis and treatment of such conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, arthroscopic treatment of patients with an internal derangement consisted mainly&#xD;
      of lavage of the joint and later other intra-articular surgical manipulations such as lateral&#xD;
      capsular release, and disc repositioning and fixation were added It has also become clear&#xD;
      from the success of doing arthroscopic lysis of adhesions and lavage of the joint that disc&#xD;
      position is less important than joint mobility and that patients can function successfully&#xD;
      with an anteriorly displaced, non-reducing disc as a result of adaptation of the retrodiscal&#xD;
      tissue and its acting as a pseudodisc It was an understanding of these two concepts that led&#xD;
      to the introduction of arthrocentesis by Murakami and colleagues in l987 This technique was&#xD;
      further refined by Nitzan et al., in 1991 Since that time, this procedure has largely&#xD;
      supplanted arthroscopic lysis of adhesions and joint lavage as the initial approach to the&#xD;
      management of majority of cases with internal derangements of the TMJ .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, arthroscopy and arthrocentesis have eliminated the use of many of the more complex&#xD;
      surgical procedures formerly used to manage intracapsular disease. Despite such advancements,&#xD;
      however, clinicians are still encountering some difficulty in successfully treating many of&#xD;
      these patients. review of the literature reveals that there is lack of prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, clinical studies to support the use of either operative arthroscopy or&#xD;
      arthrocentesis in the management of TMDs. In doing the necessary studies, and allowing for&#xD;
      direct comparison of the results, it will be important to develop standardized patient&#xD;
      selection criteria and treatment options to be used by all investigators .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis of the present study assumes that no significant difference will be found&#xD;
      between operative arthroscopy and arthrocentesis in treating patients with Wilkes stage II&#xD;
      and III internal derangement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to compare between arthrocentesis and operative arthroscopy in the&#xD;
      management of patients with internal derangement of temporomandibular joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted on 40 patients with temporomandibular joint internal derangement.&#xD;
      Patients were admitted, investigated and managed in two departments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maxillofacial and Plastic Surgery Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria&#xD;
           University, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department, University Hospital Infanta Cristina,&#xD;
           University of Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study compared between arthrocentesis and operative arthroscopy in the following points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mouth opening measuring the maximal interincisal opening in millimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lateral excursion movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Protrusive movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pain score using visual analogue scale (VAS) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Presence or absence of clicking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Operative time. Patient selection: Randomized clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomized using computer based random allocation technique into two&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group I: Twenty patients were treated with Arthrocentesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group II: Twenty patients were treated with Operative Arthroscopy Research subjects&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria The patients with TMJ internal derangement was divided into 5 stages&#xD;
           according to Wilkes Classification. Only patients with stages II and III was included in&#xD;
           this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medically unfit patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stages I, IV &amp; V Wilkes (Stage I patients will get benefit from conservative treatment&#xD;
           and stage IV and V represent an advanced stages).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with TMDs secondary to malocclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Psychological instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients operated before for other TMJ problems. All patients were subjected to full&#xD;
           history taking including medical and dental history, full clinical examination: general&#xD;
           and TMJ examination, routine laboratory investigations and preoperative MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique A-Arthrocentesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be carried out under local anesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient is seated at a 45-degree angle with the head turned towards the non-affected&#xD;
           side to allow an easy approach to the joint. After proper preparation of the target&#xD;
           side, the external auditory meatus is blocked with cotton wool soaked in paraffin oil. A&#xD;
           line is drawn on the skin from the middle of the tragus to the outer canthus of the eye.&#xD;
           Entry points are marked along this cantho-tragal line. The first point corresponding to&#xD;
           glenoid fossa is marked 10 mm from the midtragus and 2 mm below this horizontal line,&#xD;
           The second point correspond to the articular eminence is marked 10 mm in front of the&#xD;
           first point and 10 mm below the line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Local anesthesia is applied, avoiding intra-articular injection to permit controlled&#xD;
           sampling of synovial fluid. A 19-gauge needle connected to a 1 ml syringe filled with&#xD;
           lactated Ringer's solution is inserted into the superior joint compartment at the&#xD;
           posterior site. The solution is injected and immediately aspirated, and this procedure&#xD;
           is repeated two more times in order to obtain sufficient fluid for diagnostic and&#xD;
           research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Next, 2-3 ml of Marcaine 0.5% or lignocaine 2 % is injected to distend the upper joint&#xD;
           space and anesthetize the adjacent tissues. Another 19-gauge needle is inserted into the&#xD;
           distended compartment in the area of the articular eminence (anterior entrance site),&#xD;
           enabling free flow of Ringer's solution through the superior compartment. With a&#xD;
           syringe, the solution is either injected directly in to the joint or an infusion bag&#xD;
           containing lactated Ringer's solution placed about 1 meter above the temporomandibular&#xD;
           joint level, is then connected to one of the needles to allow free flow of about 200 ml&#xD;
           of fluid through the joint. On termination of the procedure sodium hyaluronate is&#xD;
           injected into the joint, then the needles are removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-Arthroscopic technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All procedures will be done under general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Instrumentation In all procedures, 1.9 mm, zero-degree optical device, sleeves, sharp&#xD;
           and blunt perforators, adhesion knives, an exploratory probe, and a bipolar electrode&#xD;
           (Karl Storz Endoscopy, Tuttlingen, Germany)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The triple-channel arthroscopic technique of McCain et al is used After the first&#xD;
           puncture of the fossa, a systematic diagnostic arthroscopy is carried out. A second&#xD;
           puncture is carried out aiming at the anterior recess under direct arthroscopic&#xD;
           visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anterior release Through the working cannula additional local anesthesia is injected to&#xD;
           avoid pain and to decrease bleeding; it can also reduce the risk of masticatory muscle&#xD;
           nerve injury. A Knife, coblation or laser probe are used to cut the anterior attachment&#xD;
           of the disc and the neighboring part of the lateral pterygoid muscle. The incision line&#xD;
           is located approximately 2-3 mm anterior to the anterior band of the disc and is carried&#xD;
           out across the whole width from medial to lateral. The depth of the anterior release is&#xD;
           no more than 2 mm to avoid breaking large blood vessels and damaging the masticatory&#xD;
           muscle nerve in the anteromedial synovium. A sharp trocar is inserted to release the&#xD;
           fibres further.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Disc reduction After the anterior release is completed, the obturator is positioned at&#xD;
           the anterior margin of the disc and the disc is pushed backwards. The obturator slides&#xD;
           along the surface of the disc and arrives in the posterolateral recess. The retrodiscal&#xD;
           tissue is pushed down inferiorly and posteriorly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative management Antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are routinely&#xD;
      prescribed for 3 days. The softness of the postoperative diet should be decreased slowly.&#xD;
      Exercises to improve mouth opening are explained to the patient and start 1 week after&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with significant postoperative occlusal changes, a splint is recommended. It is&#xD;
      designed to raise the bite and prevent contact between upper and lower incisors and canines.&#xD;
      Due to the resulting distalization of the bite force, joint loading is reduced, which&#xD;
      contributes to the joint's rehabilitation. The appliance should be left in place around the&#xD;
      clock during the first ten postoperative days, then used at night for four additional&#xD;
      weeks.(24)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow up of all patients was done accessing :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain using VAS (Visual Analogue Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clicking (improvement or persistence).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Range of motion including: maximal interincisal opening, lateral excursion movement and&#xD;
           Protrusive movement&#xD;
