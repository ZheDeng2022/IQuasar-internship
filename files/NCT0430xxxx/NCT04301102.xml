  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine whether a goal-directed algorithm based on the&#xD;
      prevention of arterial hypotension using the Hypotension Prediction Index reduces the&#xD;
      duration and severity of intraoperative hypotension when compared with the recommended&#xD;
      standard therapy and if this intraoperative strategy is associated with better tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation and organ perfusion.&#xD;

      Background: Intraoperative arterial hypotension is associated with poor postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes. The Hypotension Prediction Index developed from machine learning, predicts the&#xD;
      occurrence of arterial hypotension from the analysis of the arterial pressure waveform. The&#xD;
      use of this index can reduce the duration and severity of intraoperative hypotension in&#xD;
      adults undergoing noncardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We will conduct a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial (N=80) in high-risk&#xD;
      surgical patients scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery. All participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to a control or intervention group. Hemodynamic management in the control&#xD;
      group will be based on standard hemodynamic parameters. Hemodynamic management of patients in&#xD;
      the intervention group will be based on functional hemodynamic parameters provided by&#xD;
      Hemosphere platform (Edwards Lifesciences Ltd), including dynamic arterial elastance,&#xD;
      dP/dtmax and the Hypotension Prediction Index. Tissue oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
      non-invasively and continuously recorded by using near-infrared spectroscopy technology.&#xD;
      Biomarkers of acute kidney stress (cTIMP2 and IGFBP7) will be obtained before and after&#xD;
      surgery. The primary outcome will be intraoperative time-weighted average with a mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure &lt; 65mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The aim of the study is to determine whether a goal-directed algorithm based on&#xD;
      the prevention of arterial hypotension using the Hypotension Prediction Index reduces the&#xD;
      duration and severity of intraoperative hypotension when compared with the recommended&#xD;
      standard therapy and if this intraoperative strategy is associated with better tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation and organ perfusion.&#xD;

    <description>Urine immunoassay, commercially known as Nephrocheck® (Biomerieux). The first sample (NC1) will be collected after anesthetic induction, when performing bladder catheterization. The first postoperative sample (NC2) will be collected during the first 4 hours after the patient is admitted to the UCI / REA for their postoperative stay. If the AKIRisk value in that first postoperative sample (NC2) is less than 0.3, no new Nephrocheck® determinations will be collected. If the AKIRisk value in the first postoperative sample (NC2) is greater than 2, no further Nephrocheck® determinations will be made. If the AKIRisk value in that first postoperative sample (NC2) is between 0.3 and 2, we will collect a second postoperative sample (NC3) at 12 hours of the first. No more Nephrocheck® determinations will be made.</description>
