      The aim of this study is to assess the parental expectation for their child behavior in a&#xD;
      group of children with primary dentition during their first dental examination&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of children based on their behavior is one of the most important skills for a&#xD;
      pediatric dentist. The major aspect of child management in the dental care is managing dental&#xD;
      anxiety and fear as it is considered to be the main barrier for successful completion of&#xD;
      dental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental anxiety is a common problem which develops mostly in childhood and adolescence. It can&#xD;
      have major implications for the child, dental team, and dental services. Providing treatment&#xD;
      for the child with dental anxiety can be time-consuming, costly, and demanding for the&#xD;
      clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that a majority of children with dental anxiety present behavior&#xD;
      management problems (BMP) in dental treatment situations. Evaluating a child's level of&#xD;
      anxiety before pediatric treatment is the key, since this anxiety is closely related to their&#xD;
      behavior during dental visits. Therefore, predicting the behavior is a basic requirement to&#xD;
      reduce child's negative attitude during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many behavior rating scales are available to assess and evaluate the behavior of a child on&#xD;
      each dental visit. Frankl et al classified child's behavior into four groups according to the&#xD;
      child's attitude and cooperation or lack of cooperation during dental treatment. This&#xD;
      classification is known as Frankl behavior rating scale, which is one of the most reliable&#xD;
      tools developed for behavior rating of children in dental sittings.&#xD;
