  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to find out whether the use of low-intensity strength exercises during&#xD;
      the 2 weeks before surgery, and while the blood flow to the leg is reduced, will improve the&#xD;
      outcomes after surgery to repair an injured ligament of the knee.&#xD;
