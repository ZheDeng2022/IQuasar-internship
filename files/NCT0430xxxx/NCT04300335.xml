  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is the second most common haematological cancer with a cancer incidence of&#xD;
      around 500 new cases in Austria per year . Novel treatment methods have significantly&#xD;
      increased the cancer-specific survival rate in patients with multiple myeloma. For Austria,&#xD;
      this means that 5- and 10-year survival rates rose from 32.1 to 46.4% and from 19.0 to 25.6%&#xD;
      from the end of the 1980s to the end of the 2000s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longer survival is associated with the need to maintain independence and quality of life in&#xD;
      the longer term. In this context, regular physical training has seen a significant increase&#xD;
      in the importance of cancer in recent years.The guidelines of the American College of Sports&#xD;
      Medicine still contain very general training recommendations for cancer patients. Either 150&#xD;
      minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of intensive endurance training per week are recommended,&#xD;
      supplemented by at least two units of strengthening training and stretching exercises for the&#xD;
      large muscle groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent cross-sectional and pilot study with multiple myeloma patients that was carried&#xD;
      out at the Clinic for Physical Medicine, Rehabilitation and Occupational Medicine at the&#xD;
      Medical University of Vienna (EK 1725/2018), it was on the one hand identified that there was&#xD;
      a discrepancy between these patients on the one hand has given actual and perceived risk of&#xD;
      falling, and on the other hand it is concluded that training recommendations should be&#xD;
      carried out separately in group and individual training according to the actual risk of&#xD;
      falling and fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project is the follow-up to this cross-sectional investigation. The aim is to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility and effects of a structured, physical training program carried out&#xD;
      over a period of 12 weeks on physical performance, quality of life, body composition and the&#xD;
      risk of falling. The effects of patients with increased risk in individual training sessions&#xD;
      are compared to those of lower risk patients in group training sessions. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      study patients will be able to bring training partners with them to their own training units&#xD;
      if available and for their own security. They are evaluated separately according to&#xD;
      qualitative criteria.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of individualized&#xD;
      training support for multiple myeloma patient populations divided into high and low risk&#xD;
      according to their fall and fracture risk. The primary hypothesis is that multiple myeloma&#xD;
      patients who meet the criteria for a high risk of falling and / or fracture can achieve&#xD;
      equivalent adherence rates and training effects through individually compiled individual&#xD;
      training, such as multiple myeloma patients with low risk of falling who conduct group&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adherence rates are recorded via attendance lists for training and video conferences as&#xD;
      well as a training diary for independent training. To record the training effects, physical&#xD;
      performance and functionality are measured and the quality of life, sexuality, depression,&#xD;
      fatigue, sleep quality, work ability and risk of falling are assessed using standardized,&#xD;
      validated questionnaires.&#xD;
