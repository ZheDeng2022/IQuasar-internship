  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to explore the cardiovascular effects of co-agonism at the glucagon and&#xD;
      (glucagon-like peptide-1) GLP-1 receptor. Glucagon and exenatide will be intravenously&#xD;
      infused into participants with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Overall, the aim of the study is to&#xD;
      further the investigator's understanding on the role these endogenous substances have on&#xD;
      normal cardiac physiology, myocardial energetics and myocardial glucose uptake through a&#xD;
      series of PET and MRI imaging studies&#xD;
    </textblock>

      This is a single-centre, single-blinded pilot study designed to understand the role the GLP-1&#xD;
      receptor agonist, exenatide, and glucagon receptor co-agonism has on normal cardiac&#xD;
      physiology, myocardial energetics and myocardial glucose utilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A - Overweight participants with type 2 diabetes will act as their own control and will&#xD;
      undergo a series of three imaging studies (in a randomised order) as detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cardiac positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) with&#xD;
           fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) with placebo (0.9% saline) infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cardiac PET-MRI with 18F-FDG with co-infusion of exenatide and glucagon&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cardiac PET-MRI with 18F-FDG with infusion of glucagon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - Overweight participants with type 2 diabetes will act as their own control and will&#xD;
      undergo a series of two imaging studies (in a randomised order), followed by one optional&#xD;
      visit as detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 7T Phosphorus (P) 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (31P-MRS) with placebo (0.9%&#xD;
           saline) infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 7T 31P-MRS with co-infusion of glucagon and exenatide 3 (optional) 7T 31P-MRS with&#xD;
           infusion of glucagon&#xD;
&#xD;
