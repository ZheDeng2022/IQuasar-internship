  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronotype is defined as the midpoint of sleep and describes a biological construct of an&#xD;
      organism's temporal organisation. Misalignment between the individual chronotype and socially&#xD;
      determined schedules may result in a phenomenon called &quot;social jetlag&quot;. Emerging evidence&#xD;
      indicates that both, a later chronotype and/or a substantial &quot;social jetlag&quot; adversely&#xD;
      affects metabolic health. Young adults may be particularly vulnerable to these exposures&#xD;
      since the chronotype progressively delays from adolescence until early adulthood (approx. 20&#xD;
      years of age) before it advances again. Simultaneously, education in institutions or working&#xD;
      hours starts early during the day, potentially contribute to substantial &quot;social jetlag&quot;.&#xD;
      Data on the development of overweight / obesity prevalence in Germany indicates that rates&#xD;
      are now constant or declining in most adult age groups, with the clear exception of young&#xD;
      adults, in whom rates continue to be on the rise. Nonetheless, the potential contribution of&#xD;
      chronotype and/or social jetlag to this secular trend has not been addressed in Germany.&#xD;
      Hence, the hypothesis of the ChroNu cohort is that individual chronotype and social jetlag&#xD;
      are predictors of (changes in) the body composition in young adulthood (ages 18-25 years) and&#xD;
      that changes in chronotype / social jetlag will result in changes in body composition. The&#xD;
      ChroNu cohort forms part of the overall ChroNu study, which addresses the hypothesis that&#xD;
      timing of food intake which diverges from the individual chronotype constitutes a&#xD;
      characteristic of social jetlag which has adverse short- and long-term consequences for&#xD;
      metabolic health (see The ChroNustudy). This study will recruit 300 healthy, non-obese&#xD;
      students aged 18-25 years enrolled at Paderborn University until February 2020 and follow&#xD;
      these up one year later. Chronotype and social jetlag will be determined using the validated&#xD;
      MCTQ. Body composition will be assessed by bioimpedance analysis (BIA) The ChroNu cohort&#xD;
      study will reveal important information on the relevance of a biologically determined&#xD;
      phenomenon, i.e. the chronotype and the potentially resultant social jetlag for body&#xD;
      composition development in a population vulnerable to increases in body fat.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chronotype is defined as the midpoint of sleep and describes biological construct of an&#xD;
      organisms temporal organisation. It is itself determined by genetics, age, sex, and&#xD;
      environment. Misalignment between the individual chronotype and socially determined schedules&#xD;
      may result in a phenomenon which has been called &quot;social jetlag&quot;. Emerging evidence indicates&#xD;
      that a later chronotype and/or &quot;social jetlag&quot; predisposes to weight gain, higher BMI and&#xD;
      higher odds for type 2 diabetes. A later chronotype has been also associated with a more&#xD;
      adverse body composition. Since the chronotype progressively delays from adolescence until&#xD;
      early adulthood (approx. 20 years of age), before it advances again, young adults may be&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable to such adverse exposures. These exposures may result of a higher&#xD;
      evening energy intake which in turn was observed for a later chronotype at adolescence. A&#xD;
      preferred consumption of energy intake in the evening lead to higher total energy intake.&#xD;
      Social schedules such as early starting hours at schools and universities, which potentially&#xD;
      contribute to substantial &quot;social jetlag&quot;, may influence individual meal timing. The&#xD;
      chronotype, however, may be the main predictor for meal timing like skipping breakfast or&#xD;
      not. However, it is not clear yet whether this affects predominantly early or late&#xD;
      chronotypes in young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the development of overweight / obesity prevalence in Germany indicates that rates&#xD;
      are now constant or declining in most adult age groups, with the clear exception of young&#xD;
      adults, in whom rates continue to be on the rise. Nonetheless, the potential contribution of&#xD;
      chronotype and/or social jetlag to this secular trend has not been addressed in Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the ChroNu cohort is that individual chronotype and social jetlag are&#xD;
      predictors of (changes in) body composition in young adulthood (ages 18-25 years) and that&#xD;
      changes in chronotype / social jetlag will result in changes in body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the investigators aim to study the association between the body composition and the&#xD;
      chronotype / social jetlag at first stage and in a follow-up after one year the causal&#xD;
      relationship between changes in chronotype/social jetlag and body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods 1: participants In the ChroNu cohort study, the investigators will recruit at least&#xD;
      300 students from Paderborn University aged 18 -25 years. Students will be contacted via&#xD;
      social media, mailing-lists, poster and flyer, and presentation of the study in lectures. The&#xD;
      ChroNu cohort study will last from Sept 2019 to approximately Febr 2020. Due to the&#xD;
      restrictions caused by the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, participants were recruited again in June 2020&#xD;
      to fill in an online survey consisting of the same questionairies as at baselineThe follow-up&#xD;
      is scheduled for May - June 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods 2: Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the screening of participants for ChroNu cohort study, eligible participants are asked to&#xD;
      fill in the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ, Â© Roenneberg &amp; co-workers 2015), which is&#xD;
      a validated questionnaire to calculate the individual chronotype. In this questionnaire,&#xD;
      participants are asked about their sleep timing separately for work days and work-free days:&#xD;
      when they go to bed (bed time); when they prepare to sleep); how long it takes them to fall&#xD;
      asleep (sleep latency); when they wake up (sleep end); and how long it takes them to get out&#xD;
      of bed (sleep inertia). The mid-sleep point, which defines the chronotype, is calculated as&#xD;
      the time when falling asleep plus half of the sleep duration. If the sleep duration is longer&#xD;
      on free days than on work days this oversleep is corrected (corrected mid-sleep point): half&#xD;
      of the difference in sleep duration is subtracted. Social jet lag is calculated as the&#xD;
      difference between the mid-sleep time on work days and work-free days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual body composition, which is the outcome of this study, is analyzed using&#xD;
      Bioimpedance Analysis (BIA) (mBCA 515, SECA). For the analyses, waist circumference, body&#xD;
      size and body weight are required: waist circumference is measured midway between the lowest&#xD;
      rib and the iliac crest by trained personal following the World Health Organisation (WHO)&#xD;
      recommendations and entered in the BIA device. Body size is measured by means of an&#xD;
      ultrasonic measuring station (seca 287 dp) from SECA and directly transferred to the BIA&#xD;
      device. For measurement of body weight and body composition participants need to stand on the&#xD;
      BIA device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the chronotype and potentially resultant social jetlag is affected by environment,&#xD;
      participants are asked to fill in additional questionnaires on their daily routines and&#xD;
      diurnal patterns in both physical activity and meal timing and food intake. Questions on&#xD;
      daily routine include start and end time of both university and work if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a following ChroNu nutritional trial, the investigators are looking for the earliest and&#xD;
      latest chronotypes among our ChoNu cohort. Participants each with the earliest and the latest&#xD;
      mid-sleep points among our cohort seem to be suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Linear mixed-effects regression models are used to analyze the&#xD;
      associations between chronotype (continuously in h:mm) as predictor and BMI, body fat, and&#xD;
      visceral fat. The same analyses will be performed for social jetlag as predictor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariable linear and logistic mixed-effects regression models are performed to&#xD;
      investigate associations between the chronotype and the circadian patterns of meal timing and&#xD;
      physical activity. In second step, multivariable regression analysis is used to examine if&#xD;
      the assocation between chronotype and body composition is mediated by the circadian patterns&#xD;
      of both meal timing and physical activity. All basic models will be adjusted for age and&#xD;
      additionally adjusted for potentially confounders which were considered as statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
