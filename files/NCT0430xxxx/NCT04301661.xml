  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the intracellular pharmacokinetics and platelet effects of abacavir&#xD;
      (ABC), lamivudine (3TC), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and emtricitabine (FTC) in persons&#xD;
      living with HIV that are receiving these medications as part of standard HIV care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants remaining on ABC/3TC- or TAF/FTC-containing therapy will be on study for 4&#xD;
      weeks, and will have two visits: a screening visit and one short PK visit consisting of a&#xD;
      single blood draw at week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants switching from their ABC/3TC-containing therapy will be on study for 3 weeks,&#xD;
      and will have nine visits: a screening visit and 8 short PK visits consisting of a single&#xD;
      blood draw at Day 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 18, and 21.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abacavir and lamivudine are recommended antiretroviral medications used in the treatment of&#xD;
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United States and globally. Both agents&#xD;
      are nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), which exert their antiviral&#xD;
      activity following entry into target cells and phosphorylation by intracellular kinases to&#xD;
      their active anabolites, carbovir-triphosphate (CBV-TP) and lamivudine-triphosphate (3TC-TP).&#xD;
      There is limited knowledge regarding the pharmacokinetic (PK) disposition of abacavir and&#xD;
      lamivudine anabolites in red blood cells (RBCs), neutrophils, and platelets. Abacavir has&#xD;
      also been linked with prothrombotic activity and an increased risk of cardiovascular events&#xD;
      in patients on this therapy, central theories of which point towards interference with&#xD;
      purinergic signaling due to its structural similarity to endogenous adenosine and guanosine.&#xD;
      These findings have not been replicated with other NRTI medications, such as tenofovir. This&#xD;
      pilot study will characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of these medications in different&#xD;
      cell types of persons living with HIV (PLWH) on these therapies as part of clinical care, and&#xD;
      will examine endogenous nucleotide levels and metabolic profiles through the use of&#xD;
      metabolomics in platelets specifically to better understand what changes might be happening&#xD;
      within this cell type with the use of these medications.&#xD;
