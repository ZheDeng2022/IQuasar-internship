  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of anodal transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) on pain intensity associated with diabetic neuropathy. The investigators&#xD;
      will conduct real tDCS or sham, over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during 6&#xD;
      separated days. They will evaluate pain intensity, sleep quality, quality of life and anxiety&#xD;
      and depression symptoms via clinical validated scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question is whether tDCS can lessen neuropathic pain and improve sleep,&#xD;
      psychological status and quality of life in patients with diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized, that less neuropathic pain and improved sleep, psychological status and&#xD;
      quality of life after the tDCS sessions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Worldwide, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its chronic complications&#xD;
      are reaching epidemic proportions. By 2045 DM expected to affect 629 million persons.&#xD;
      Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most common complications of DM and is actually the set of&#xD;
      heterogeneous clinical forms. Among diabetic neuropathies, generalized, focal or multifocal&#xD;
      forms are distinguished. The most typical and most common form (up to 80% of cases is&#xD;
      sensory-motor polyneuropathy. It has recently been redefined as a length-dependent symmetric&#xD;
      sensory-motor polyneuropathy attributable to metabolic and microvascular alterations&#xD;
      following exposure to chronic hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk cofactors. Painful&#xD;
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) may be considered a variant; about 15-25% of patients&#xD;
      have painful diabetic polyneuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the definition of neuropathic pain of the International Association for the&#xD;
      Study of Pain (IASP), PDPN is considered as asymmetric sensory-motor polyneuropathy chronic&#xD;
      in which neuropathic pain has been present, for at least 3 months, as direct consequence&#xD;
      abnormalities of the peripheral somatic-sensitive system following diabetic pathology.&#xD;
      Sensory symptoms are more evident than motor symptoms; which is appear in the most distal&#xD;
      portions of the limbs and progress proximally according to a &quot;glove&quot; or &quot;sock&quot; distribution&#xD;
      associated with paresthesias and dysesthesias. The clinical symptoms are related to the type&#xD;
      of nerve fiber involved and typically there are &quot;positive&quot; (tingling, burning, pain,&#xD;
      allodynia) or &quot;negative&quot; sensory symptoms (loss of sensitivity, numbness). The involvement of&#xD;
      small sensitive fibers causes a reduction in thermal sensitivity and pain and this, in turn,&#xD;
      contributes to the deficits in tactile and proprioceptive sensitivity to increase the risk of&#xD;
      a foot injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PDPN is associated with negative repercussions on the quality of life (QoL), activities&#xD;
      of daily livings, sleep disorders, and is the major determinant of depressive symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with PDNP. In fact, depression and sleep disturbances play a negative prognostic&#xD;
      role in the general and diabetic population, and sleep disturbances are associated with&#xD;
      glycated hemoglobin levels higher than 0.35% in type 2 diabetes. The presence of PDPN&#xD;
      determines an increase in the use of medical care and social costs, both directly related to&#xD;
      treatments, and indirect secondary to the reduction of working capacity. The presence of&#xD;
      chronic pain of any nature increases the risk of difficulties in the self-management of&#xD;
      diabetes, in relation to taking therapy, physical activity, adherence to the diet, foot care&#xD;
      and even glycemic self-monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has shown promising results for the treatment&#xD;
      of chronic pain in several types of diseases, being a good and non-invasive alternative to&#xD;
      treat pain in PDPN patients. Also, based on studies that showed changes in the brain activity&#xD;
      of chronic pain patients and on the difficulties faced to treat PDPN, there is a need to&#xD;
      conduct clinical trials using new techniques, such as neuromodulation, to help these patients&#xD;
      to control their pain. Therefore, tDCS emerges as a new tool to be coupled with other&#xD;
      effective treatments already used for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a functionally and structurally heterogeneous&#xD;
      region as well as a key area of numerous brain networks involved in the processing of&#xD;
      cognition effect. Numerous studies have shown that some chronic pain syndromes are associated&#xD;
      with a reduction in the volume of the gray matter of DLPFC. Some studies show that pain&#xD;
      relief manages to reverse these structural changes PDPN. Moreover, previous studies reported&#xD;
      that DLPFC stimulation induces a significant analgesic and antidepressant effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators believe that neuromodulation by tDCS over the left DLPFC would&#xD;
      decrease the pain intensity and improve the general quality of life in patients with PDPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: general PURPOSE Investigate if anodal tDCS over left DLPFC has analgesic effects&#xD;
      in patients with PDPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifics purposes 1- Evaluate the tDCS effects over pain intensity; 2- Evaluate if tDCS has&#xD;
      any effect on sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: The subjects will be allocated consecutively to randomization as an&#xD;
      intervention order using the tool from the randomization.com website (Dallal GE,&#xD;
      http://www.randomization.com). The investigators will use the second generation suggested for&#xD;
      crossover studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedure: All subjects will be treated using two different interventions&#xD;
      (groups respecting the washout period of six weeks to avoid residual effects. The&#xD;
      intervention order will be determined by randomization per group of interventions. Subjects&#xD;
      will be contacted by phone and asked if they want to participate in the study. Those who wish&#xD;
      to participate and qualify according to the selection criteria after completing the&#xD;
      pre-screening questionnaire will be scheduled after reading and signing the consent form (2&#xD;
      copies). During the second visit, all clinical and neurological assessments will be performed&#xD;
      before and after tDCS stimulation phase. Each patient will be clinically and neurologically&#xD;
      assessed before and after the stimulation, allowing data to be collected 4 times (T0, T1, T2,&#xD;
      and T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS protocol: Group Real tDCS: The participant will receive anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC&#xD;
      and the reference electrode will place over the right forearm. The stimulation intensity will&#xD;
      be 2mA DC delivered for 20 min (30 s step-up ramp, 30 s step-down ramp), repeated six times,&#xD;
      during two weeks (Mon, Wed, Frid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group sham tDCS: Identical to the real tDCS, except the participants will only receive the&#xD;
      initial 30 seconds of ramp-up, after which the current will be set to 0 for the remainder of&#xD;
      the 20 minutes.&#xD;
