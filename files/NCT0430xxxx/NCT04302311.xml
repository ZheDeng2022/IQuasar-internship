    <textblock>
      A randomized patient-oriented trial to investigate whether continual symptomatic use of the&#xD;
      Kardia Mobile monitoring device is a superior strategy for diagnosing Atrial Fibrillation&#xD;
      (AF) in comparison to normal ambulatory monitoring with a 24-hour Holter monitor. Patients&#xD;
      with referrals to an Electrophysiologist, symptoms of AF but no documentation of AF, and with&#xD;
      at least one stroke risk factor based on the CHADS2 scoring system are randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      Kardia Mobile monitoring versus Holter monitoring alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Wait-times from referral by a family practitioner to seeing a specialist have increased&#xD;
      greatly over the past 10 years in Canada. The Fraser institute reports an 11 week wait-time&#xD;
      in BC in 20161. Our experience is that this is representative of the wait-time to see a&#xD;
      cardiologist at our institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family doctors can diagnose some cases of atrial fibrillation (AF) with a pulse check and&#xD;
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). However this is the minority of patients and most diagnoses&#xD;
      are made on the basis of more prolonged ambulatory ECG recordings as part of the&#xD;
      investigation of paroxysmal symptoms by a specialist2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an increasing prevalence of AF3 and the consequences of late diagnosis can be dire.&#xD;
      For example a 76 year old lady with treated hypertension and yet to be diagnosed paroxysmal&#xD;
      AF has a risk of 6.7% per year of suffering stroke, TIA or systemic thromboembolus4. During&#xD;
      the ~11 week wait for an appointment plus a further ~8 week wait for thorough diagnostic&#xD;
      testing and further follow up she therefore has a 2.5% risk of having an event. If this is&#xD;
      multiplied across the thousands of patients waiting for appointments across Canada over the&#xD;
      course of a year it is evident that numerous thromboembolic complications could be prevented&#xD;
      through reduction of the time to diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore the first-line investigation for diagnosis of paroxysmal arrhythmia is usually an&#xD;
      ambulatory ECG monitor (Holter/Event monitor)5,6. However, patients frequently do not have&#xD;
      symptoms during the period of monitoring and the diagnostic yield is between 15% and 39%7-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) can provide accurate and thorough ECG monitoring&#xD;
      continuously for up to 3 years. However, they are used late in the diagnostic process and are&#xD;
      too expensive for widespread use for AF screening and so can only have a limited impact on&#xD;
      overall time to diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore have two main problems in early AF diagnosis with paroxysmal symptoms. First&#xD;
      that patients are waiting a long time for diagnostic tests and second that the diagnostic&#xD;
      tools usually used by clinicians are not particularly good at picking up AF. We believe both&#xD;
      issues can be tackled through use of the Karda Mobile in the wait-time prior to an&#xD;
      appointment with a specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kardia Mobile (AliveCor, San Francisco) is a validated, CE marked, single channel ECG&#xD;
      recorder that can be paired with a smartphone. It has a high sensitivity (98%) and&#xD;
      specificity (97%) for AF diagnosis11. This device allows intermittent patient-driven&#xD;
      monitoring based on symptoms. Since smartphones are now owned by 68% of Canadians, most&#xD;
      patients can now access this tool12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the Kardia Mobile could be an excellent tool for the diagnosis of AF in&#xD;
      the wait-time prior to seeing a cardiologist. We aim to expand the role of our AF clinic at&#xD;
      the Royal Jubilee Hospital, Victoria, BC by introducing enhanced wait- time arrhythmia&#xD;
      diagnostics using the Kardia in this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enrol patients at high risk for thromboembolus (scoreâ‰¥1 as per CHADS-65 CCS&#xD;
      algorithm13) who are awaiting an appointment with a cardiologist in our locality for&#xD;
      investigation of paroxysmal symptoms that may be caused by arrhythmia. These patients will&#xD;
      either have standard care with a 24h Holter monitor or enhanced monitoring using the Kardia&#xD;
      Mobile in addition to standard Holter monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to test whether using the Kardia Mobile during the wait-time can reduce the time to&#xD;
      diagnosis of AF&#xD;
