  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are more susceptible to infections than the general&#xD;
      population in relation to some specific therapies or increasing disability. Clearly, the use&#xD;
      of immuno-suppressant/modulatory drugs requires particular attention to the occurrence of&#xD;
      infectious events. In this perspective, among still unmet clinical needs in MS patients is a&#xD;
      comprehensive picture on the immunisation status against infectious diseases, especially&#xD;
      those preventable with vaccines. Despite of the relevance of vaccinations, there are still&#xD;
      some concerns about their utilization in MS patients. In literature, results about their&#xD;
      safety are conflicting or incomplete and it is yet unclear if some vaccines may trigger MS&#xD;
      relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOALS: 1) to assess immunisation status, due to past exposure to natural infectious diseases&#xD;
      or vaccines, against major infectious agents preventable by available vaccines; 2) to assess&#xD;
      the safety of most utilized vaccines in the clinical practice by recording relapses as&#xD;
      adverse event in the considered risk period after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3-year project is conceived as a multicenter, observational, both retro- and prospective&#xD;
      study. A cohort of about 3,000 MS subjects will be enrolled among databases of 25 clinical&#xD;
      Centers in Italy. All patients diagnosed with relapsing remitting (RR) MS according to the&#xD;
      2010 Polman's criteria from 01/2011 to 12/2020 will be enrolled. Available data on natural&#xD;
      immunisation will be collected from the historical clinical records of Centers, taking into&#xD;
      account the presence of specific serum antibodies, whereas available data on vaccinations&#xD;
      will be collected from vaccination records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the impact of vaccines on the risk of relapse, data about patients receiving a&#xD;
      vaccination during the disease will be analysed. The study follow-up period will be between 2&#xD;
      and up to 6 months following vaccination: the 2-month period is considered as the maximum&#xD;
      clinical risk, whereas 6 months as the maximal extension of risk in time. In addition, in the&#xD;
      case of a clinical relapse, the variation of disability will be evaluated with EDSS scale&#xD;
      confirmed at 6 months. These data might shed light on the relationship between vaccination&#xD;
      and MS, adding new insights on their safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge of the immunisation status is crucial for the clinical practice in the&#xD;
      management of the new disease modifying drugs (DMDs), and for the public health to establish&#xD;
      the possible need of a vaccine campaign targeted to MS patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The different available treatments for MS influence the immune system in distinct ways and,&#xD;
      therefore, may lead to specific infectious risks. Whereas immunomodulating therapies have no&#xD;
      impact on infection risks [Cahill 2010; Winkelmann 2016], the most recent drugs with&#xD;
      immunosuppressant activity could increase persons with MS' vulnerability to infections&#xD;
      [Löbermann 2012; Olsson 2014]. MS patients are routinely screened for latent or active&#xD;
      infections before starting any disease modifying drugs (DMDs). Specific infectious agents&#xD;
      should be evaluated for each second line [Williamson 2015, Yang 2014, Kohlmann 2015]. Another&#xD;
      cause of increased susceptibility to infections in MS patients is disability: patients have a&#xD;
      greater risk for serious and fatal infections due to MS-related functional limitations as&#xD;
      pulmonary problems and bladder and bowel dysfunctions [Montgomery 2013; Nelson 2015]. In&#xD;
      addition, there is consistent evidence that exacerbations could be a consequence of&#xD;
      infectious diseases, such as bacterial infections of urinary tract, viral respiratory&#xD;
      diseases or gastroenteritis, with a two-fold increase in risk of relapse after infection&#xD;
      [Panitch 1994; Rutschmann 2002; Loebermann 2012; Williamson 2015]. In such case, the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying relapses are not fully understood [Steelman 2015], but probably&#xD;
      molecular mimicry and bystander activation play a role in this process [Loebermann 2012].&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to promote any prevention strategy that may reduce the risk of&#xD;
      acquiring infections, such as vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination is the main proven tool for primary prevention of serious, and sometimes&#xD;
      life-threatening diseases and one of the most cost-effective public health measures&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 4 main types of vaccines: live-attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines,&#xD;
      subunit/recombinant/polysaccharide/conjugate vaccines and toxoid vaccines. Live vaccines are&#xD;
      made using an attenuated or weakened form of the pathogen. These vaccines have a high&#xD;
      efficacy but, containing a live pathogen, they have a potential risk of infection,&#xD;
      particularly in patients with a natural or acquired immunodeficiency. Further, concerns about&#xD;
      live vaccines administration to close family members of patients have been raised, as there&#xD;
      could be the risk that immunised individual release the live pathogens [Williamson 2016]. On&#xD;
      the contrary, the other types of vaccines can be safely used by persons with an impaired&#xD;
      immune system [www.vaccines.gov].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Italy, before 2017, 4 vaccinations were mandatory for children (against diphtheria from&#xD;
      1939, polio from 1966, tetanus from 1968 and hepatitis B from 1991), whereas several others&#xD;
      were only recommended. Due to inadequate immunisation coverage, the obligation was recently&#xD;
      extended to 10 vaccines, adding the ones against Haemophilus influenzae type B, pertussis,&#xD;
      measles, mumps, rubella and varicella for newborns. In addition, there are other recommended&#xD;
      vaccines at different ages, i.e. vaccination against rotavirus, meningitis B and C,&#xD;
      pneumococcal disease in childhood, against human papilloma virus in adolescents, and against&#xD;
      tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, influenza, pneumococcal disease and herpes zoster for those&#xD;
      aged 65 years and older [www.salute.gov.it].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In MS population, there are some concerns about the utilization of vaccines. It is unclear&#xD;
      (at least for some vaccines) whether vaccinations may trigger the disease or increase the&#xD;
      risk of relapse due to the stimulation of the immune system, as the infections themselves&#xD;
      [Loebermann 2012]. The vaccines against hepatitis B virus, tetanus, tick-borne encephalitis,&#xD;
      H1N1 virus and seasonal influenza are considered safe, even if small groups of patients (with&#xD;
      a very active form of MS) report an increased risk of relapse after influenza or H1N1 vaccine&#xD;
      [Loebermann 2012]. An increased risk of relapses was reported also after yellow-fever&#xD;
      immunisation in a single study conducted in a very small cohort of RR-MS patients [Farez&#xD;
      2011b]. On the other hand, a protective role is reported for some vaccines, for example for&#xD;
      bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine, and for vaccines against tetanus and diphtheria [Loebermann&#xD;
      2012]. For all other vaccines, no data are available [Mailand 2017].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, specific DMDs may increase the risk of infectious complications from vaccines&#xD;
      composed by live attenuated microorganism [MSC for clinical practice guidelines]. Live&#xD;
      attenuated vaccines are considered safe for patients receiving an immunomodulator agent such&#xD;
      as glatiramer acetate or interferon, but there are relatively few data on the safety of these&#xD;
      vaccines for the more recently approved immunosuppressant agents. Hence, patients treated&#xD;
      with these drugs should avoid live attenuated vaccines during the treatment and for a period&#xD;
      of 3 months after discontinuation of treatment [Cahill 2010; Oreja-Guevara 2014]. In&#xD;
      addition, MS patients experiencing a serious relapse should delay the vaccination until 4-6&#xD;
      weeks after the exacerbation [National MS society].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, DMDs could reduce the efficacy of vaccination leaving people susceptible to&#xD;
      diseases, however the published studies showed conflicting results [Williamson 2016].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several new drugs have been developed to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) in the last 2 decades.&#xD;
      Balancing benefit and risk in recent MS treatment management is decisive. In the era of&#xD;
      disease modifying drugs (DMDs), that alter immune function, the reactivation or de novo&#xD;
      acquisition of infectious diseases is gaining great relevance. The understanding of the&#xD;
      potential adverse effects of these immunological active therapies is a key part of the&#xD;
      decision-making process when weighting different treatment options. Consequently, prior to&#xD;
      starting an immunosuppressant treatment, it is necessary to know the immunisation status of&#xD;
      patients, including immunity elicited both by natural infections and vaccinations. The&#xD;
      knowledge of susceptibility to infections of patients is recommended for therapeutic choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First of all, it is mandatory for some immunosuppressant drugs, or suggested for others, to&#xD;
      assess the immunisation status against herpes zoster virus, because the reactivation of this&#xD;
      disease might be serious. Vaccinations against varicella and herpes zoster contain the&#xD;
      live-attenuated virus, so immunocompromised patients should not be immunised with these&#xD;
      vaccines [Williamson 2016]. For the same reason, the immunisation against measles, mumps and&#xD;
      rubella could be recommended in susceptible subjects because these pathogens could trigger&#xD;
      serious complications, such as encephalitis and pneumonia. Therefore, in patients who have&#xD;
      never had natural infections, it could be necessary to take into account immunisation with&#xD;
      these live-attenuated vaccines just early after MS diagnosis, in view of a possible future&#xD;
      treatment with an immunosuppressant drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there are other vaccines against other frequent infectious agents which are&#xD;
      recommended for general population and for groups at risk: tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis&#xD;
      (which require a booster dose every 10 years for all persons), seasonal influenza,&#xD;
      pneumococcal, meningococcal, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), hepatitis A and B virus.&#xD;
      According to the international public health recommendations, all individuals in the older&#xD;
      age groups (usually over 65 years of age) and those from age of 6 months with a chronic&#xD;
      disease with increased risk for severe outcomes of influenza complications, must be&#xD;
      vaccinated every year. The medical conditions that could represent a risk factor for&#xD;
      influenza complications include any situation compromising respiratory functions, as in many&#xD;
      neurological disorders, and the immunosuppression due to disease or treatment&#xD;
      [www.ecdc.europa.eu]. For the same reasons, the pneumococcal vaccine is recommended because,&#xD;
      in susceptible people, flu virus may trigger an infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae&#xD;
      [www.cdc.gov]. Regarding Hib, individuals with a secondary immunodeficiency may be at risk of&#xD;
      developing invasive disease if exposed to the pathogen [Nix 2012]. In case of outbreak of&#xD;
      meningococcal or hepatitis A, or in case of risk of hepatitis B, adults might be vaccinated&#xD;
      [www.ecdc.europa.eu].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another aspect to take into account is the presence of hepatitis B chronic infections, as the&#xD;
      immunosuppressant treatment must be preceded and accompanied by a specific antiretroviral&#xD;
      drug blocking the viral DNA synthesis [Orlicka 2013].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positive effect on individual well being is coupled with a favourable economic impact in&#xD;
      public health. Also in patients with MS, vaccination could reduce the disease burden and&#xD;
      consequently the social cost, as it might reduce eventual relapses or other severe&#xD;
      complications [Rutschmann 2002]. Therefore, the knowledge of the immunisation status could&#xD;
      help policy makers and program strategies to assess the need of a vaccine campaign targeted&#xD;
      to MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these considerations, there are no available data about the prevalence of patients&#xD;
      susceptible to infections, therefore unvaccinated or people never exposed to natural&#xD;
      infections. Concerning the severe and potentially life-threatening infective complications&#xD;
      associated with the immunosuppressant agents used to treat MS, the use of specific registries&#xD;
      and databases to collect and evaluate infection/vaccine safety data after drug approval is&#xD;
      advisable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of most vaccines in MS patients has been only partly investigated, so that a&#xD;
      correlation between vaccination and MS relapses has been hypothesized only for some vaccines.&#xD;
      However, these conclusions are based on few studies, mostly carried out on small study sample&#xD;
      sizes. The lack of large amounts of data regarding the vaccine safety in MS population&#xD;
      precludes the possibility to offer clear-cut recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of the study is to collect historical data on the immunisation status, due to&#xD;
      past exposure to natural infectious diseases or vaccines, in a large multicentric cohort of&#xD;
      MS patients with regards to the most frequent vaccine-preventable viral and bacterial&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim is to assess the potential role of vaccines used in adulthood in&#xD;
      determining/worsening MS inflammatory activity, as well in disease progression. In&#xD;
      particular, any vaccination against hepatitis A and B, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella,&#xD;
      diphtheria, pertussis, seasonal influenza, herpes zoster virus, meningococcal and&#xD;
      pneumococcal bacteria will be considered. In addition to these communicable diseases, the&#xD;
      tetanus vaccine will be included due to the high coverage of this vaccination. MS activity&#xD;
      and progression will be assessed evaluating the occurrence of relapse within 6 months from&#xD;
      vaccination and using the annual relapse rate and its trend during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The project is a 3-year observational, retro- and prospective study. Aim 1:&#xD;
      Multicenter cross-sectional study on the immunisation status, due to past exposure to natural&#xD;
      infectious diseases or vaccines, will be conducted in a MS patient cohort. Sub-analyses will&#xD;
      be stratified by sex, patient's age at the time of enrolment, disease duration from clinical&#xD;
      onset, disability, current/past DMDs, geographic area of birth and residence, type of&#xD;
      vaccine, comorbidity with special regard to autoimmune/immune mediated and/or infectious&#xD;
      diseases. 25 MS Centers from Northern, Central and Southern Italy will represent the study&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: The potential role of vaccines used in adulthood in determining/worsening MS&#xD;
      inflammatory activity, as well on disease progression will be conducted by means of a&#xD;
      self-controlled case series study over the all MS cohort. A 'case' will be defined as&#xD;
      'exposed' if at least one confirmed relapse occurred during the risk period of 2 months and&#xD;
      during the extended risk period of 6 months after vaccine administration; and not exposed&#xD;
      otherwise [Galeotti 2013].&#xD;

        Relapsing remitting (RR)-MS patients consecutively diagnosed from January 2011 to December&#xD;
        2020 will be enrolled in the study upon informed written consent. The choice of January&#xD;
        2011 is suggested by the need to apply the 2010 Polman's diagnostic criteria for MS [Polman&#xD;
        2011] in order to ensure most homogeneous diagnoses across patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both for retrospective and prospective phase, each Center will identify, through clinical&#xD;
        records, newly diagnosed MS patients in the considered period and consistently followed in&#xD;
        the Center, and the enrolment will be made during routine ambulatory visits.&#xD;
