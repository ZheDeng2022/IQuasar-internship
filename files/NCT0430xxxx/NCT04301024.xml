  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitrous oxide gas is used in several application areas : medical as an anesthetic drug ; in&#xD;
      food industry as a foaming and a mixing agent ; industrial to speed combustion. It is also&#xD;
      misused for its hilarant, euphoric and hallucinogenic effect. For this purpose the gas is&#xD;
      transfered in a balloon to be inhaled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As its effects are briefs, its consumption is often perseived as safe. However, some risks&#xD;
      exist and are majorated by the way of use and for some groups of people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2016, the French observatory of drug and substances addiction (OFDT) describes an&#xD;
      increasing misuse of nitrous oxide amoung teenagers and young adults. In november 2019, a&#xD;
      french press release alerts on the recent increasing of neurologic side effects related to&#xD;
      the misuse of nitrous oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That's why, it seems to be interesting to improve the screening of nitrous oxide abuse, in&#xD;
      particular amoung adolescents and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, the investigators would like to determine the characteristics (social, medical,&#xD;
      any drug abuse) of teenagers and young adults who misuse nitrous oxide. Through a&#xD;
      questionnaire, the investigators plan to select teenagers and young adults who consult in an&#xD;
      addictology center dedicated to young drug consumers in Montpellier. This questionnaire is&#xD;
      anonymous. The data will be collected only after obtaining the patient's agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final goal is to create a tool to help general practitioners in screening young people at&#xD;
      risk of nitrous oxyde misuse.&#xD;
