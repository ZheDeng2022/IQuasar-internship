      Study design Observational, single centre, prospective cohort study Planned sample size 100&#xD;
      participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria The study will evaluate a cohort of participants meeting the following&#xD;
      inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after elective and emergency cardiac surgery&#xD;
           using cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. age 18 years and above&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. arterial, central venous and pulmonary arterial catheters have been inserted as part of&#xD;
           routine care Study procedures In addition to routine clinical postoperative data and&#xD;
           blood collection, serum renin levels will be analysed on admission, 6 and 24 hours after&#xD;
           admission to ICU Study duration 6 months&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is integral to cardiovascular homeostasis and&#xD;
      involved in the regulation of blood pressure, electrolyte balance and intravascular volume.&#xD;
      Renin is produced from the renal juxtaglomerular cells and converts angiotensinogen to&#xD;
      angiotensin. Angiotensin is subsequently converted to angiotensin II by&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II also promotes the release of&#xD;
      aldosterone.The RAAS has an important role in hypotension to retain water through aldosterone&#xD;
      and increase systemic vascular resistance mainly through angiotensin II but also through the&#xD;
      release of vasopressin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RAAS can become dysregulated in critically ill shocked patients. In states such as septic&#xD;
      shock the effects of the RAAS are antagonized through the production of vasodilators such a&#xD;
      nitric oxide and both angiotensin I and angiotensin II receptors are down regulated.&#xD;
      Activation of angiotensin I receptors may furthermore result in the production of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines that results in further vasodilation and contributes to&#xD;
      cardiovascular compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the RAAS has been extensively investigated in cardiovascular patients there is a&#xD;
      paucity of studies relevant to ICU. A recent study suggested that raised serum renin levels&#xD;
      in patients with sepsis is associated with acute renal failure. Another study of a small&#xD;
      heterogeneous cohort of critically ill patients compared renin to lactate as marker of tissue&#xD;
      perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As RAAS is closely related to the volume state, there is a physiological rationale to&#xD;
      investigate serum renin levels together with variables to monitor the intravascular volume,&#xD;
      including assessment of the mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf). An analogue of the Pmsf&#xD;
      will be calculated in this study based on routine postoperative haemodynamic monitoring (mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure, MAP, central venous pressure, CVP, cardiac output, CO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is no current research which looks at serum renin as marker of hemodynamic&#xD;
      normalization or association with outcomes after cardiac surgery which is the main purpose of&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum renin as a candidate sensitive biomarker of hemodynamic homeostasis will be compared to&#xD;
      current clinical markers of resuscitation and perfusion including cardiac index, mixed venous&#xD;
      oxygen saturation, lactate and venoarterial carbon dioxide gradients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the serum renin concentration is found to be a marker of resuscitation and hemodynamic&#xD;
      status, the study will examine any associations with lack of hemodynamic normalization and&#xD;
      morbidity in cardiothoracic patients. A pragmatic, composite morbidity outcome at 30 days&#xD;
      will be used as the primary endpoint. This includes renal impairment, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      persistent cardiogenic shock, arrythmia, respiratory failure, delirium and stroke. An&#xD;
      exploratory, secondary outcome will focus on whether serum renin concentrations are&#xD;
      associated with acute kidney injury and the need of renal replacement therapy in post cardiac&#xD;
      surgical patients.&#xD;
