      This research study is being done to test a new device developed for spinal cord injury (SCI)&#xD;
      patients. The purpose of this study is to collect data on how the nervous system signals&#xD;
      travel within the spinal cord of SCI patients. Once the investigators understand that, they&#xD;
      hope to develop a device that may help rehabilitation of SCI patients so that they can regain&#xD;
      function in their lower limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves some imaging studies (e.g. X-rays etc.), surgical implantation of a&#xD;
      portion of the electrical stimulation device, various assessments of body function (e.g.&#xD;
      balance, movement, gait), and physical rehabilitation procedures. What is new and&#xD;
      experimental is the stimulation/sensing device (Intelligent Spine Interface - Commercial,&#xD;
      ISI-C) that will be implanted.&#xD;

&#xD;
      This research study is being done to test a new device developed for spinal cord injury (SCI)&#xD;
      patients. The purpose of this study is to collect data on how the nervous system signals&#xD;
      travel within the spinal cord of SCI patients. Once the investigators understand that, they&#xD;
      hope to develop a device that may help rehabilitation of SCI patients so that they can regain&#xD;
      function in their lower limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves some imaging studies (e.g. X-rays etc.), surgical implantation of a&#xD;
      portion of the electrical stimulation device, various assessments of body function (e.g.&#xD;
      balance, movement, gait), and physical rehabilitation procedures. What is new and&#xD;
      experimental is the stimulation/sensing device (Intelligent Spine Interface) that will be&#xD;
      implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      26. Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to build an Intelligent Spine Interface (ISI) that will interpret&#xD;
      neural information from above a spinal cord injury and transfer that information, via a&#xD;
      state-of-the-art artificial neural network-based computer interpreter, to sites below the&#xD;
      site of injury and restore control of the lower limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, activity-based therapies (physical rehabilitation) are only medical practices&#xD;
      that can be used to enhance recovery after spinal cord injury. However, most affected&#xD;
      patients, who fail to produce active movements voluntarily, experience minimal benefits from&#xD;
      such therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done to develop a new treatment modality for Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)&#xD;
      patients. The purpose of this study is to collect data on how the nervous system signals&#xD;
      travel within the spinal cord of SCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device being used in this study is termed Intelligent Spine Interface. This device&#xD;
      consists of: (1) surgically implanted electrode arrays placed above and below site of spinal&#xD;
      cord injury. These arrays are connected to other device components outside the body (like&#xD;
      &quot;Ripple System&quot;) using specialized wires. (2) &quot;Ripple System&quot; collects readings from&#xD;
      implanted electrode arrays. Together, these components are used to stimulate the spinal cord&#xD;
      and sense any resulting nervous system signals. (3) Personal computer uses specialized&#xD;
      software to interpret the nervous system activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the ISI-C device in this study is considered investigational. This means the&#xD;
      device has not yet been approved by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study should take about 7-8 months to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phases and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Phase: Subject identification, consent process, eligibility review,&#xD;
           preliminary assessments (imaging studies such as x-rays, blood work,&#xD;
           physical/neurological exam, medical history, medication review, pregnancy test,&#xD;
           electrocardiogram to assess heart health)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-rehabilitation Phase: baseline review of SCI related standardized outcome measures&#xD;
           to understand if the device/treatment is producing the desired effect on the participant&#xD;
           physical function (e.g. gait, balance, ability to walk, muscle tone/spasm, bowel&#xD;
           function).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery: Pre-surgery testing, anesthesia administration, lead placement above and below&#xD;
           the site of injury, wound closure and observation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatient Rehabilitation Phase: daily physical rehabilitation sessions in specialized&#xD;
           gaits lab, neurostimulation protocol (small electrical pulses will be delivered to the&#xD;
           implanted electrode array and any spinal cord activity will be recorded), follow-up&#xD;
           SCI-related outcome measures review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery: same as above - surgically implanted leads will be removed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up phase: Follow-up physical and neurological exams to assess if there is a&#xD;
           change in function since baseline&#xD;
