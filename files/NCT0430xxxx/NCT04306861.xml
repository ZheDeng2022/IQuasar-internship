      The purpose of this study is to optimize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences for&#xD;
      imaging pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and correlate MRI biomarkers with the expression of&#xD;
      the tumor suppressor gene SMAD4 and clinical outcomes with the goal of identifying which&#xD;
      biomarkers are predictive of treatment response or non-response. This study will test&#xD;
      magnetic resonance techniques on FDA approved clinical MRI machines in treatment-naïve&#xD;
      patients with biopsy-proven PDAC.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To optimize the following multiparametric MRI sequences for imaging of Pancreatic ductal&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma (PDAC): Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent&#xD;
           (BOLD), Magnetization Transfer (MT), and reduced field-of-view Diffusion Weighted&#xD;
           Imaging (DWI, including low b-values for intravoxel incoherent motion measurements and&#xD;
           high b-values for Diffusion Kurtosis analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure these MRI biomarkers in 20 treatment-naïve patients with biopsy-proven PDAC&#xD;
           who have been referred to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) Pancreatic&#xD;
           Cancer Program for neoadjuvant chemo-radiation therapy (CRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate these MRI biomarkers with histopathology, i.e. the expression of the tumor&#xD;
           suppressor gene SMAD4 and clinical outcomes with the goal of identifying which&#xD;
           biomarkers are predictive of treatment response or non-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It is feasible to develop dedicated MRI protocols with novel MRI techniques including&#xD;
           Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD), Magnetization&#xD;
           Transfer (MT), and reduced field-of-view Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), and to&#xD;
           develop appropriate evaluation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The implementation of these new protocols and evaluation methods in patients with&#xD;
           pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) provide biomarkers which correlate with&#xD;
           histology and outcome in treatment-naïve patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The biomarkers are also predictive of therapy response in patients with PDAC during&#xD;
           neoadjuvant chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) and correlate with the expression of the tumor&#xD;
           suppressor gene SMAD4.&#xD;
