  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory randomized controlled trial study to test feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and proof of concept efficacy of Continuous Diffusion of Oxygen (CDO) adjunct therapy for&#xD;
      decreasing healing time and reducing tissue necrosis post breast reconstruction. The&#xD;
      investigator will assess the benefit of this novel adjunct therapy on successful closure,&#xD;
      tissue oxygenation, scar appearance, and patients centered outcomes including perception of&#xD;
      benefit, pain, sleep quality, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomly (ratio 1:1) assigned to either intervention group (IG) or&#xD;
      control group (CG) and will be followed for four weeks. Both groups will receive standard of&#xD;
      care for wound treatment. IG will also receive CDO adjunct therapy using a novel dressing,&#xD;
      which facilitates continuously supplies oxygen to the wound inside the wound dressing using a&#xD;
      portable device named TransCu O2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study device TransCu O2® is a Class II medical device which has US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance, CE-Mark approval and a Health Canada license for the&#xD;
      treatment of wounds. Outcomes will be assessed on weekly-basis up to 4 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical wound complications such as infection, dehiscence, necrotic tissue, surgical&#xD;
      revision, and poor cosmesis are unfortunately highly prevalent in patients post breast&#xD;
      reconstruction. In particular, necrosis/ischemia post breast reconstruction because of poor&#xD;
      blood circulation is highly prevalent and is estimated to be occurring in up to 75% of cases&#xD;
      leading to excessive scar formation. Some factors such as active smoking or an underlying&#xD;
      disease such as diabetes and history of radiation therapy could increase the likelihood of&#xD;
      excessive scar and/or necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases surgical wounds are managed with a simple island dressing, wool padding and a&#xD;
      light retention bandage. It could be argued that such low cost, traditional dressings are&#xD;
      adequate for most surgical wounds. However, patients with poor tissue blood circulation often&#xD;
      require modern wound care products that offer additional benefits, in particular among those&#xD;
      with vascular and poor tissue oxygenation problem. Poor tissue oxygenation and poor skin&#xD;
      perfusion could lead to surgical wound complications such as wound inflection, tissue&#xD;
      necrosis, pain, trauma and untimely surgical revision. In particular, the presence of&#xD;
      non-viable necrotic tissue is significant as it can be responsible for delaying healing,&#xD;
      prolonging the inflammatory response, mechanically obstructing contraction and impeding&#xD;
      re-epithelialisation. It also provides a focus for wound infection and surgical revision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even after successful healing, necrotic tissue could still lead to excessive scar formation.&#xD;
      Many of these scars can be problematic, being aesthetically unpleasant and causing&#xD;
      discomfort. Blood supply is a significant factor in wound healing, and area of the skin with&#xD;
      rich supply of vasculature is known to heal with finer scars. Several studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that mild hypoxia (lack of transcutaneous oxygen) is present in early scars,&#xD;
      moderate hypoxia in proliferative scars, and severe hypoxia in regressive scars. Oxygen&#xD;
      levels then return to normal in mature scars, which is consistent along with the dynamic&#xD;
      change in microvessel density. Therefore level of transcutaneous oxygen could be a&#xD;
      determinant factor in formation of excessive scar formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Diffusion of Oxygen (CDO) is a treatment modality that delivers pure oxygen to&#xD;
      wounds using the same basic mechanism as breathing, namely direct diffusion into the wound&#xD;
      from a moist surface. Because impaired blood flow results in impaired oxygen supply to&#xD;
      incisional wounds, investigators have researched the potential of oxygen saturation, or&#xD;
      supersaturation, to reinitiate or even accelerate wound healing. Oxygen has been shown to&#xD;
      result in not only faster wound closure, yet also better strength of repair and higher&#xD;
      organization of collagen, which in turn can result in lower wound recidivism and better scar&#xD;
      appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this feasibility and proof of concept study, The investigator plan to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of oxygen on incisional wound repair and scarring after mastectomy and breast&#xD;
      reconstruction. The investigator will use a device (TransCu O2® Oxygen Delivery System )&#xD;
      which continuously supplies oxygen to the wound inside the wound dressing. The device the&#xD;
      investigator used, the TransCu O2 System, (EO2 Concepts®, San Antonio, TX) is small, wearable&#xD;
      and silent. The system is FDA-approved and CDO therapy has been the subject of a growing body&#xD;
      of clinical experience and scientific investigations demonstrating good results. The therapy&#xD;
      is similar in theory to the intermittent application of oxygen through Hyperbaric Oxygen&#xD;
      (HBO) and Topical Oxygen (TO), with a few key differences summarizing in the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) CDO provides continuous therapy, providing ~twenty-fold longer time of oxygen delivery&#xD;
      versus intermittent therapies that are only applied 90 minutes a day. 2) CDO allows for full&#xD;
      patient mobility during treatment, thereby reducing the risk of non-compliance and reducing&#xD;
      overall costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator have successfully used CDO therapy to reduce likelihood of tissue necrosis&#xD;
      after surgical closure post lower extremity amputation as well as post parathyroid surgery,&#xD;
      in which over 20 subjects were recruited and no adverse outcomes were reported. The&#xD;
      investigator plan to extend our study to determine whether CDO therapy would show decreased&#xD;
      healing time and better scar cosmesis early on for standardized incisional wounds such as&#xD;
      breast reconstruction. The investigator hypothesis that using CDO will reduce the likelihood&#xD;
      of necrotic tissue as well as severe incisional scar post-surgical closure by improving&#xD;
      transcutaneous oxygen levels during wound healing process. The investigator will examine the&#xD;
      validity of this hypothesis using a pilot randomized controlled trial using a convenient&#xD;
      sample of 40 people (20 subjects per arm) after mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery.&#xD;
