  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy potential of using real-time&#xD;
      positive auditory feedback to improve gait pattern in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD).&#xD;
      The components of walking are commonly affected in patients with PD. Gait training for PD is&#xD;
      usually based on verbal cues from the therapist that are only moderately effective. Based on&#xD;
      good principals of gait and neuroplasticity, the Heel-To-Toe (Heel2Toe) sensor was developed&#xD;
      to provide real-time auditory feedback during walking training. Methods: A two-group,&#xD;
      randomized feasibility trial is planned with repeated measures of gait parameters and walking&#xD;
      outcomes. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Outcomes after the 5&#xD;
      training days will be obtained directly from the Hee2Toe device for both groups (with and&#xD;
      without auditory feedback). The primary outcome is walking capacity measured by the&#xD;
      Six-Minute Walk Test and the Standardized Walking Obstacle Course. Gait parameters will be&#xD;
      captured by the Heel2Toe device Expected Contributions: Gait training using the Heel2Toe&#xD;
      sensor will be potentially effective for improving walking pattern in people with PD.&#xD;

      As this is a feasibility study, the main analysis will focus on within-group change over the&#xD;
      intervention period of 3 months using indices of reliable change(36). This method assesses&#xD;
      the number of people who changed in each of the groups based on the magnitude of change&#xD;
      relative to pre-post variability and correlation. We will estimate the proportion of people&#xD;
      with reliable change. Estimates from the pilot study will be used to plan the main trial if&#xD;
      the pilot demonstrates feasibility. For the maintenance period, reliable change from baseline&#xD;
      will also be estimated and used to identify the proportion of people who maintained reliable&#xD;
      change or who gained/lost this status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to detect a minimal important within-group change of moderate magnitude&#xD;
      or greater (effect size Â½ standard deviation) with adequate precision. A sample size of 20&#xD;
      per group with completed follow-up will provide a 95% confidence interval with precision that&#xD;
      excludes an effect size of 0.03.&#xD;

    <description>The Heel2Toe group will have 5 therapy sessions to learn to trigger the sensor with a strong heel strike and how to use device for home practice for 3 months. During the home practice, participants will be instructed to walk with the device for a minimum of 10 minutes per day in feedback mode. They will be provided with a workbook outlining simple exercises targeting functions needed to walk well (Walk-BEST Workbook) in paper and as a mobile app.</description>
