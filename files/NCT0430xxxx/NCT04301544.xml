      FINOMAIN is a community-based, cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) of dance&#xD;
      intervention INDAK and standardized vascular care. The study aims to develop and assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a cost-effective and culturally - fit intervention for Filipino older adults&#xD;
      at high risk for developing dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of dance intervention INDAK on&#xD;
      cognitive function as assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive&#xD;
      (ADAS-Cog), Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST), and Executive Function Composite (EFC) among&#xD;
      older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To increase the sensitivity of primary&#xD;
      outcome for various composites of cognition, aside from ADAS-Cog that assesses core cognitive&#xD;
      deficits of dementia, investigators will develop an executive function composite that will&#xD;
      combine measures of executive control using performance outcomes on tests including Trail&#xD;
      Making Test (TMT), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), and&#xD;
      Number Cancellation Task (NCT). Executive function composite scores have been used to track&#xD;
      aging populations at risk for dementia and are shown to be sensitive in capturing&#xD;
      cerebrovascular benefits and used as instruments in studies with similar non-pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention (i.e. aerobic exercise, dance). Additionally, the investigators will add MST&#xD;
      which is a measure for episodic memory, memory representations and pattern discrimination&#xD;
      which are all cognitive domains highly correlated with hippocampal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective of the study is to determine the effect of dance on neuroplasticity as&#xD;
      measured by brain volumetry and functional connectivity demonstrated through Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and change in other behavioral and functional outcomes of&#xD;
      participants with MCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FINOMAIN is a single-blind (assessor blinded), community-based, cluster randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (cRCT) of a multi-component intervention with two arms. The intervention arm will&#xD;
      receive 12 months (1 hour, 2 times per week) of training on the ballroom dance modules called&#xD;
      INDAK (Improving Neurocognition through Dance and Kinesthetics), nutrition counseling, and&#xD;
      vascular risks management. The control group will receive the same nutrition counseling and&#xD;
      vascular risk management except for dance (INDAK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: In this pilot trial of FINOMAIN, the study aims to enroll at least 72 (20%&#xD;
      of total sample size of 328) community-dwelling Filipino older adult participants aged 60&#xD;
      years and above with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on Petersen criteria and&#xD;
      documented by cognitive symptoms and cognitive performance on the standardized cognitive test&#xD;
      (ADAS-Cog) which is ≥ 1.5 standard deviation (SD) below Filipino norms for ADAS-Cog and has a&#xD;
      Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5. Participants should not fulfill DSM-V criteria for&#xD;
      major neurocognitive disorders. The absence of dementia is further confirmed when there is no&#xD;
      functional impairment based on the Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)&#xD;
      scale and no significant neuropsychiatric symptoms as detected by the Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Inventory - Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Exclusion to study are major sensory impairment (i.e.&#xD;
      hearing and visual impairment) that limit testing, dance participation and a pre-existing&#xD;
      illness that in the judgment of the study physician precludes engagement in moderate physical&#xD;
      activity such as INDAK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be 24 months, but the study intervention will last for 12 months. The&#xD;
      intervention arm will receive 12 months (1 hour, 2 times per week) of training on the dance&#xD;
      modules called INDAK, nutrition counseling and vascular risks management. The control group&#xD;
      will receive the same nutrition counseling and vascular risk management except dance (INDAK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention team consists of research nurses, nutritionists, physicians and dance&#xD;
      teachers. The dance intervention INDAK is a structured modular dance consisting of 8 types of&#xD;
      ballroom dances with increasing complexity. The INDAK intervention will be done two times a&#xD;
      week, one hour each time, for 12 months. The nurse will use a logbook to register the&#xD;
      frequency and duration of participation for each participant. From our previous experience,&#xD;
      adverse events were infrequently limited to musculoskeletal pains in the first two weeks of&#xD;
      study. However, to ensure safety, a trained nurse will always be present at each dance&#xD;
      session and liaise with local hospitals in case of unexpected events such as fall, dizziness,&#xD;
      or general exhaustion occur. The nurse records the vital signs of all participants before and&#xD;
      after the dance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutrition counseling is based on &quot;Pinggang Pinoy&quot; or Filipino plate recommendation of the&#xD;
      Filipino Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) and standardized vascular care for hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes, and dyslipidemia based on Filipino standard guidelines. The nurses will monitor the&#xD;
      participants every month and use a logbook to record their compliance and advise participants&#xD;
      on a continuing basis. The community physicians and nurses will meet with the participants at&#xD;
      3, 6, and 9 months to monitor their cardiovascular and metabolic conditions and revise their&#xD;
      management plan if necessary. If the nurses detect an urgent problem during the monthly&#xD;
      monitoring, nurses must alert participants to see the community physicians on an ad-hoc&#xD;
      basis. The participants will also be provided with a diary to log their implementation of&#xD;
      risk management plans and issues that need to be discussed with the nurses and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be conducted by the assessment team (i.e. neurologists, psychologists&#xD;
      and nurses) on the 6th and 12th month of the intervention. To ensure blinding, participants&#xD;
      are asked not to discuss any intervention with anyone. At each meeting, the same clinical&#xD;
      data as from the baseline assessments and laboratory tests will be collected as mentioned&#xD;
      above. Neuroimaging will be done 12 months from baseline. After all data are collected and&#xD;
      encoded, data cleaning, processing, and analysis will be done. The following are the methods&#xD;
      for data acquisition, processing, and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI acquisition, processing, and analysis: Participants will be scanned in a 3T MRI scanner&#xD;
      (Philips Achieva) using an 8-channel head coil. The ADNI-3 (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/adni-3/)&#xD;
      recommended imaging protocols will be used to allow data to be comparable with the ADNI&#xD;
      centers and good potential for data sharing on open access platforms. For resting-state fMRI,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to keep their eyes open and fixate on a cross (10 minutes). The&#xD;
      fMRI task: Participants will undergo 2 runs (6 -7 minutes each) of the visual working memory&#xD;
      task. Each cycle consists of 1 block of high-load and 1 block of low-load that had 2 trials&#xD;
      each. Each block is interleaved by a 1.6 seconds interval and block duration of 20 seconds.&#xD;
      There will be 10 cycles in each run adding up to a total of 20 high-load and 20 low-load&#xD;
      trials. Each run lasts 400 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM8) will be applied for overall brain volumetric analysis with the&#xD;
      high-resolution MPRAGE T1-weighted image acquisition. FMRIB Software Library (FSL) and Tract&#xD;
      Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) will be applied for diffusion MRI to understand changes in&#xD;
      structural connectivity. The high-resolution MPRAGE scan will also be applied for automated&#xD;
      hippocampal volumetric studies using NeuroQuant. Coronal axial thin T2-weighted and FLAIR&#xD;
      will be used for detecting subcortical and deep white mater hyperintensities (WMH). The fMRI&#xD;
      data will be pre-processed and analyzed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12)&#xD;
      software package. All structural and functional images will be re-oriented before the EPI&#xD;
      data is pre-processed using the conventional procedure in three phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis (Neurocognitive and behavioral measures): The primary outcome which is&#xD;
      the change from baseline (ADAS-Cog, MST, and EFC which a composite of Verbal Fluency Test&#xD;
      (VFT), Number Cancellation Task (NCT), Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST) and Trail Making&#xD;
      Test (TMT) and the secondary outcomes (neuroimaging: MRI, GDS, EQVAS BBS) will be analyzed in&#xD;
      the intent-to-treat population as well as in the per-protocol population (complete at least&#xD;
      80% of INDAK modules and participate in at least 30 minutes of dance each time). The study&#xD;
      will employ univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistics. For univariate, descriptive&#xD;
      statistics (mean/SD; frequencies/percentages) will be used to summarize socio-demographic and&#xD;
      other baseline characteristics. The bivariate analyses that examine underlying relationships&#xD;
      between the outcomes and other clinical characteristics are the following: t-test for&#xD;
      continuous variables and Chi-square test (or Fisher Exact Test when 20 of the cells have the&#xD;
      expected count less than five) for categorical variables to compare baseline data and outcome&#xD;
      measures at baseline between the intervention and control groups. For multivariate analyses,&#xD;
      the study would estimate the effect from baseline to follow-up at 12 months between&#xD;
      randomization groups. Since the participants will be measured 3 times (baseline, 6 months, 12&#xD;
      months), the study will be using the repeated measures analysis of covariance (RM ANCOVA) to&#xD;
      test the significance between group means but controlling for possible confounders. To&#xD;
      analyze for the secondary outcomes, the power will be calculated retrospectively to see if&#xD;
      the sample size is big enough to prove statistical significance. Assuming that enough power&#xD;
      is yielded, repeated measures ANCOVA will also be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of study analysis will be done for three months and the final report will be prepared&#xD;
      for three months to answer the aims of the study on how multicomponent intervention&#xD;
      significantly maintains or improve cognition of older adults with MCI as measured by primary&#xD;
      outcomes and how the intervention affects neural plasticity and functional connectivity as&#xD;
      measured by MRI after 12 months of the study period.&#xD;
