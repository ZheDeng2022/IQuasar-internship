    <textblock>
      The study is designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of KBL693 in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. KBL693 has been developed as a potential new treatment for moderate to severe&#xD;
      asthma..&#xD;

             Please note: participants with out of range values, which are not clinically&#xD;
             significant as per the principal investigator's (PI) discretion, will be allowed. The&#xD;
             PI may delegate this responsibility to a suitably qualified and trained study team&#xD;
             member.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The participant is, in the opinion of the PI (or delegate), generally healthy based on&#xD;
             assessment of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, and the results&#xD;
             of the haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, serology, and other relevant&#xD;
             laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Baseline laboratory test values within reference ranges based on the blood and urine&#xD;
             samples taken at Screening and on Day -1. Out of normal ranges values may be accepted&#xD;
             by the PI, if not clinically significant&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have regular bowel movements (e.g., once daily)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male participants must agree to practise true abstinence; be surgically sterilised&#xD;
             (performed at least 6 months prior); or agree to use of a condom if sexually active&#xD;
             with a female partner of childbearing potential, from Screening through 90 days after&#xD;
             the final dose of the investigational product (IP).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to practise true abstinence or agree to&#xD;
             use effective contraception from Screening through 90 days after the final dose of the&#xD;
             IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Effective contraception includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;) for at least 1 month prior to Day 1, plus use of&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Vasectomised male partner (performed at least 6 months prior) who has been&#xD;
                  documented to no longer produce sperm&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Women of non-child-bearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Must have documented evidence of surgical sterilization at least 6 months prior&#xD;
                  to Screening visit e.g., tubal ligation, hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Must be post-menopausal for at least 12 months prior to Screening, as documented&#xD;
                  by measurement of follicle stimulating hormone level (≥40 mIU/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female participants who are pregnant or lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The participant's corrected QT interval (QTcF) (Fridericia's correction) is &gt;450 msec&#xD;
             (males), and &gt;470 msec (females) at Screening or on Day -1. An out-of-range or&#xD;
             abnormal ECG will be repeated at PI's discretion. In total, 3 ECGs should be recorded&#xD;
             consecutively at Screening and on Day -1, and the PI (or delegate) must evaluate the&#xD;
             triplicate ECG. If the participant's QTcF is &gt;450 msec (males) or &gt;470 msec (females)&#xD;

             product unless in the opinion of the PI the medication will not compromise participant&#xD;
             safety or interfere with study procedures or data validity. Participant may be&#xD;
             rescreened after a washout period of 14 days. Please note use of oral contraceptives&#xD;
             and paracetamol up to 2 g/day and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for&#xD;

             food or other precipitating agent (e.g. bee sting). Please note participants with&#xD;
             clinically stable mild allergic conditions such as hay fever and mild eczema may be&#xD;
             enrolled at the discretion of the PI&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
             (HbsAg), or hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV)at Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Positive screen for drugs of abuse and cotinine at Screening or on Day -1. Positive&#xD;
             screen for alcohol on Day -1.&#xD;
