  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance (IR) is an early metabolic alteration in chronic kidney disease (CKD)&#xD;
      patients, becoming almost universal in those who reach the end stage of kidney failure. The&#xD;
      skeletal muscle represents the primary site of IR in CKD, and alterations at sites beyond the&#xD;
      insulin receptor are recognized as the main defect underlying IR in this condition. The&#xD;
      etiology of IR in CKD is multifactorial in nature and may be secondary to disturbances that&#xD;
      are prominent in renal diseases, including physical inactivity, chronic inflammation,&#xD;
      oxidative stress, vitamin D deficiency, metabolic acidosis, anemia, adipokine derangement,&#xD;
      and altered gut microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IR has been solidly associated with intermediate mechanisms leading to cardiovascular (CV)&#xD;
      disease in CKD including left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular dysfunction, and&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. Recent studies have identified a muscle factor β-aminoisobutyric acid&#xD;
      (BAIBA), which is produced by skeletal muscle during physical activity. BAIBA have been found&#xD;
      to link with sedentary life style, abdominal obesity, and impairments in carbohydrate and&#xD;
      lipid metabolism. A few studies have shown that BAIBA can protect from diet-induced obesity&#xD;
      in animal models. It induces transition of white adipose tissue to a &quot;beige&quot; phenotype, which&#xD;
      induces fatty acids oxidation and increases insulin sensitivity. While the exact mechanisms&#xD;
      of BAIBA-induced metabolic effects are still not well understood, the aim of this study is&#xD;
      want to study its relationship with muscle wasting and insulin resistance in a group of&#xD;
      non-diabetic hemodialysis patients.&#xD;

      Study Design and Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an observational, cross-sectional and prospective cohort study. One hundred and&#xD;
      fifty patients on non-diabetic hemodialysed patients will be included for the cross-sectional&#xD;
      survey; Twenty healthy subjects will be elected as the controls. Prevalent adult HD patients&#xD;
      with dialysis vintages over 3 months will be recruited. Patients are maintained on regular HD&#xD;
      prescription, three times a week, for four-hour sessions. Subjects with significant comorbid&#xD;
      conditions such as cancer, heart failure, or severe liver disease and chronic infection such&#xD;
      diabetic foot will be excluded. This study is conducted according to the guidelines laid down&#xD;
      in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures were reviewed as well as approved by the&#xD;
      Regional Hospital Ethics Committee. All subjects should give their written informed consent&#xD;
      to participate in the study. Subjects' demographic and clinical characteristics, including&#xD;
      age, gender, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), dialysis vintage, and Kt/V will be&#xD;
      recorded, and comorbidities and current therapies will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric and biochemical assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic and diastolic blood pressures are taken with the subjects in the supine position. A&#xD;
      measurement of height and weight was performed on all subjects. Waist circumference was&#xD;
      measured at the midpoint between the lower border of the rib cage and the iliac bone. The&#xD;
      concentration of plasma insulin was assayed by radioimmunoassay. Fasting plasma glucose was&#xD;
      measured using the glucose oxidase method. HbA1c was measured by affinity chromatography.&#xD;
      Total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol levels were measured enzymatically using&#xD;
      an autoanalyzer (Hitachi 747; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Serum insulin concentrations are&#xD;
      determined by IRMA. Adiponectin and leptin concentrations are measured using a commercially&#xD;
      available ELISA kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each subject, the blood samples are drawn from the arteriovenous fistula in of each&#xD;
      participant in the morning after fasting for at least 8 h and on the day of hemodialysis. The&#xD;
      samples are properly processed, refrigerated at 2-8 C, and the plasma is separated&#xD;
      immediately by centrifugation. Each serum sample is heat-inactivated by incubation at 65 C&#xD;
      for 30 min. Fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA), a negative control,&#xD;
      is treated with activated charcoal (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) overnight at 4 C and filtered&#xD;
      to remove all small molecules and AhR agonists that might have been present. TCDD, a positive&#xD;
      control for AhR agonists, was purchased from Sigma Co. Plasma BAIBA levels are assessed by a&#xD;
      Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, as previously described&#xD;
      (15). Cell-based AhR ligand activity (CALA) assay and ELISA assay will be performed (16)&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOMA-IR, HOMA-%B, HOMA-%S, and disposition index are calculated by the following formulae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOMA-IR1 = [fasting insulin (mU/l) × fasting glucose(mg/dl)× 0.0555]/22.5 HOMA-%B1 = [20 ×&#xD;
      fasting insulin (mU/l)]/[(fasting glucose(mg/dl) × 0.0555)-3.5] HOMA-%S1 = [1/ HOMA-IR1] ×&#xD;
      100% Disposition index 1= (HOMA-%S1/100) × (HOMA-%B1/100)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEXA is a widely used reference method for body FFM and FM measurements.(10) DEXA was&#xD;
      performed using a Lunar Prodigy (GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI). Whole-body scans were&#xD;
      performed according to manufacturer's instructions, and body FM (FMDEXA), LTM (LTMDEXA) and&#xD;
      bone mineral content were analyzed using the manufacturer's software. The DEXA method uses an&#xD;
      X-ray tube with a filter to generate low-energy (40 kV) and high-energy (70 or 100 kV)&#xD;
      photons. When photons at different energy levels pass through tissue, their absorptions can&#xD;
      be expressed as a ratio of attenuation at lower or higher energy levels. DEXA estimate of FFM&#xD;
      was calculated as a sum of LTMand bone mineral content estimates. All patients were examined&#xD;
      by the same observer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioelectric Impedance Spectroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole-body bioelectric impedance spectroscopy (BIS) measurement using a body composition&#xD;
      monitor (BCM: Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) was performed on each of the&#xD;
      participants enrolled in the study by a specific member of the staff who had completed a&#xD;
      training course in the BCM technique. The BCM measures the impedance spectroscopy at 50&#xD;
      different frequencies between 5 kHz and 1 MHz. Measurements were taken on the day before&#xD;
      dialysis with the patient calm, supine, and relaxed in the dialysis bed for 10minutes. Four&#xD;
      electrodes were placed on the patient's hand and foot on the side contra lateral to their&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula. Specific exclusion criteria were dictated by the device and included&#xD;
      history of a pacemaker, defibrillator, metallic sutures, or stent implantation and amputation&#xD;
      of a major limb. As a multifrequency bioimpedance device, BCM not only provides extracellular&#xD;
      (ECWBCM), intracellular (ICWBCM), and total body water (TBWBCM) measurements but also&#xD;
      estimates the body composition in terms of lean tissue mass (LTMBCM-mainly muscle), fat mass&#xD;
      (FATBCM), adipose tissue mass (ATMBCM-mainly fat), and overhydration (OH) according to the&#xD;
      body compositionmodel.(17) This device combined BIS with the BCM model described in Chamney&#xD;
      et al,11 and it takes into account the dissimilar hydration of relevant tissues. Briefly, the&#xD;
      device was modified to reflect the presence of excess fluid accumulated due to pathologic&#xD;
      reasons, that is, patients with kidney failure. It has therefore set constants for each of&#xD;
      the body composition compartment. This device has been shown to be as precise as the gold&#xD;
      standardreference methods and has been validated against reference methods for volume status&#xD;
      and body composition assessments in healthy and HD populations, with methods frequently used&#xD;
      in the 4-compartment model. The percentage proportions of LTMBCM, FATBCM, andATMBCM were&#xD;
      denoted accordingly as pLTMBCM, pFATBCM, and pATMBCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle Strength&#xD;
&#xD;
      The muscle function will be assessed on the same day of the recruitment immediately before&#xD;
      starting the HD session by handgrip strength measurement, using a handle dynamometer. The&#xD;
      test is performed conducting three attempts with each hand, and the mean of the strongest&#xD;
      hand is used to determine muscle strength&#xD;
