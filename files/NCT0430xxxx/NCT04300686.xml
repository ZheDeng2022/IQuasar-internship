      Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a rare chronic inflammatory arteritis, which lacks an effective&#xD;
      well-accepted intervention strategy. We classify TAK patients into 3 levels, including mild,&#xD;
      moderate, and severe. And the biological agents tocilizumab and adalimumab are randomly&#xD;
      prescribed in severe patients, to find out the relatively better treatment strategy,&#xD;
      facilitating better intervention strategy in severe TAK patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a rare chronic inflammatory arteritis, which lacks an&#xD;
      effective well-accepted intervention strategy. Previous studies have revealed that&#xD;
      methotrexate, tofacitinib, adalimumab, and tocilizumab were effective in controlling disease&#xD;
      activity and preventing disease relapse in some TAK patients, especially the latter two&#xD;
      biological agents. However, we believed that different patients should be prescribed&#xD;
      different drug combinations, i.e. personalized medicine, to obtain the optimal intervention&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here we tried to classify the TAK patients into three levels including mild, moderate, and&#xD;
      severe, and prescribe different drug interventions to discover which biological agent is&#xD;
      better in severe TAK patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

      severity of TAK patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
      1.2. Based on the TAK patients in the ECTA cohort (Clinical trials. No: NCT03893136), we&#xD;
      tried to compare the treatment efficacy of biological agents between tocilizumab (TCZ) and&#xD;
      adalimumab (ADA) in severe TAK patients, with a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other important detailed description of the study are listed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basic treatment of prednisone:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The initial prednisone dose is 40mg.qd.po, and maintained for 1 month. After 1 month's&#xD;
           treatment, the dose is gradually tapered to 15mg by 5mg per 2 weeks. Subsequently, the&#xD;
           dose is decreased to 5mg by 2.5mg per 3 months. The 5mg is the final target maintained&#xD;
           dose. In the treatment, if the relapse occurs, the dose of prednisone returned to the&#xD;
           last dosage. For example, if the patient gets a relapse at the dose of 15mg of&#xD;
           prednisone, then the dose of prednisone returned to 20mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The relapse of TAK is defined according to the &quot;2018 Update of the EULAR recommendations&#xD;
           for the management of large vessel vasculitis&quot;. Relapse includes major relapse or minor&#xD;
           relapse. Major relapse: Recurrence of active disease with either of the following: a.&#xD;
           Clinical features of ischemia* (including jaw claudication, visual symptoms, the visual&#xD;
           loss attributable to TAK, scalp necrosis, stroke, limb claudication). b. Evidence of&#xD;
           active aortic inflammation resulting in progressive aortic or large vessel dilatation,&#xD;
           stenosis or dissection. Minor relapse Recurrence of active disease, not fulfilling the&#xD;
           criteria for the major relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ADA: 40mg bim IH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. TCZ: 8mg/kg qm ivgtt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treatment shift: if the TAK patients in ADA group failed to reach clinical remission at&#xD;
           the end of 24th week, they would be shifted to TCZ group starting a new round of&#xD;
           induction and complete the rest 24-week follow-up; and vice versa;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the follow-up, the disease remission and related markers are monitored.&#xD;

After the 24 weeks of treatment, the disease remission is evaluated (primary endpoint). If the disease activity is alleviated (remission), the strategy would be maintained for another 24weeks, otherwise (resistant), the treatment strategy would be shifted to the opposite for 24weeks.
