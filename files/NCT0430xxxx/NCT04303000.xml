  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deaths relating to opioid overdose have rapidly increased over the past two decades. Due to&#xD;
      the serious public health concern of the opioid epidemic, federal agencies recommend&#xD;
      employing various harm reduction interventions. The implementation of Opioid Overdose&#xD;
      Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) programs is effective in reducing opioid overdose&#xD;
      mortality, yet these programs do not reach many high-risk individuals. Traditionally, OEND&#xD;
      program venues are found in large, urban medical centers, drug treatment facilities, and&#xD;
      needle exchange programs. Identifying unreached, high-risk individuals and providing training&#xD;
      and naloxone kits through online recruitment could significantly expand access to this&#xD;
      life-saving intervention. The primary goal of the current proposed project is to examine the&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility of online recruitment, online opioid overdose and naloxone&#xD;
      administration education, and postal distribution of naloxone kits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, with over 65% of&#xD;
      drug related fatalities resulting from the use of opioids. The continually increasing rates&#xD;
      of opioid overdose deaths in the last two decades have led to the declaration of an opioid&#xD;
      epidemic. Over a brief 15-year period, from 1999-2014, drug overdose related deaths tripled&#xD;
      and rates have continued to sharply escalate since then. Federal agencies have responded to&#xD;
      this crisis with various recommendations including enhancing harm reduction approaches such&#xD;
      as naloxone distribution. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can be used to reverse opioid&#xD;
      overdose. Though it is typically administered in Emergency Departments, laypersons have&#xD;
      recently been successfully trained through Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone&#xD;
      Distribution (OEND) programs to recognize signs of opioid overdose and perform timely&#xD;
      administration of naloxone in homes and community settings while awaiting medical services.&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated that OEND programs effectively reduce opioid overdose&#xD;
      mortality and are safe and cost-effective. However, OEND programs are typically implemented&#xD;
      in urban areas as part of large medical center research programs, needle exchanges, or drug&#xD;
      treatment programs. Individuals living in areas without these programs or services lack&#xD;
      access to critical and life-saving OEND. The current proposal will examine the acceptability&#xD;
      and feasibility of online recruitment, online opioid overdose education, and postal&#xD;
      distribution of naloxone kits (N=80). Opioid users at risk for overdose will be recruited&#xD;
      online through Craigslist. If eligible, participants will complete an opioid use&#xD;
      questionnaire and will indicate if they are interested in receiving opioid overdose and&#xD;
      naloxone administration training. If interested, they will complete pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention knowledge questionnaires, engage in audiovisual training, and half will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive a naloxone kit in the mail while the other half will be given&#xD;
      information on where they can receive a naloxone kit. All participants will complete remote&#xD;
      follow-up assessments at 1, 2, and 3 months post study to evaluate naloxone kit use and&#xD;
      outcomes. This study will evaluate a novel approach to providing OEND to individuals with&#xD;
      otherwise limited access to this type of intervention. Successful implementation of remote&#xD;
      OEND through this project would support future employment of similar remote programs to&#xD;
      expand this critical harm reduction strategy to high-risk individuals in areas lacking&#xD;
      traditional OEND programs.&#xD;
