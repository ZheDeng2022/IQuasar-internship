  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are: (1) in the dose-escalation part: to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MORAb-202 in&#xD;
      participants with selected tumor types (ovarian cancer [OC], endometrial cancer [EC],&#xD;
      non-small cell lung carcinoma [NSCLC], triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC]), and (2) in&#xD;
      dose-confirmation part: to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of MORAb-202 in&#xD;
      participants with EC at selected doses and to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      MORAb-202.&#xD;

             drug preceding informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants with brain or subdural metastases are not eligible, unless they have&#xD;
             completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this&#xD;
             indication for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this study. Any signs&#xD;
             (example, radiologic) or symptoms of brain metastases must be stable for at least 4&#xD;
             weeks before starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Any other invasive malignancy that required treatment (other than definitive surgery)&#xD;
             or has shown evidence of recurrence/progression (except for non-melanoma skin cancer,&#xD;
             or histologically confirmed complete excision of carcinoma in situ) during the 2 years&#xD;
             prior to starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Significant cardiovascular impairment. History within 6 months prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of study drug of: congestive heart failure greater than New York Heart Association&#xD;
             (NYHA) Class II); unstable angina; myocardial infarction; stroke; cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
             associated with hemodynamic instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Clinically significant ECG abnormality, including marked prolonged baseline QT as&#xD;
             corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) (repeated demonstration of a QTcF interval&#xD;
             &gt;500 milliseconds [ms]). A history of risk factors for torsade de pointes (example,&#xD;
             heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT Syndrome) or the use of&#xD;
             concomitant medications that prolong the QTcF.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Previously known to be Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive. Testing at entry&#xD;
             not required.&#xD;
&#xD;

             positive beta human chorionic gonadotropin [ß-hCG] or human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             [hCG]) with a minimum sensitivity of 25 International units per liter (IU/L) or&#xD;
             equivalent units of ß-hCG [or hCG]. A separate baseline assessment is required if a&#xD;
             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first&#xD;
             administration of the study drug. Scheduled for surgery during the study, other than&#xD;
             minor surgery which would not delay study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Females of childbearing potential who within 28 days before study entry, did not use a&#xD;
             highly effective method of contraception, which includes any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total abstinence (if it is their preferred and usual lifestyle)*&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a contraceptive implant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  an oral contraceptive (participant must be on a stable dose of the same oral&#xD;
                  contraceptive&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  product for at least 28 days before dosing and throughout the study and for 90&#xD;
                  days after study drug discontinuation)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  do not agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (as described&#xD;
                  above) throughout the entire study period and for 90 days after study drug&#xD;
                  discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For sites outside of the Europe, it is permissible that if a highly effective method&#xD;
             of contraception is not appropriate or acceptable to the participant, then the&#xD;
             participant must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception, that is,&#xD;
             double-barrier methods of contraception such as latex or synthetic condom plus&#xD;
             diaphragm or cervical/vault cap with spermicide. NOTE: All females will be considered&#xD;
             to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at&#xD;
             least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, and without other known or&#xD;
             suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically (that is, bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1&#xD;
             month before dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as&#xD;
             refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated&#xD;
             with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be&#xD;
             evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. For Dose-Escalation only: Males who have not had a successful vasectomy (confirmed&#xD;
             azoospermia) or they and their female partners do not meet the criteria above (that&#xD;
             is, not of childbearing potential or practicing highly effective contraception&#xD;
             throughout the study period and for 90 days after study drug discontinuation). If the&#xD;
             female partner is pregnant, then males who do not agree to use latex or synthetic&#xD;
             condoms throughout the study period and for 90 days after study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
             No sperm donation is allowed during the study period and for 90 days after study drug&#xD;
             discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has, or has a history of, non-infectious pneumonitis/ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. History of any clinically significant pulmonary disease, pneumonectomy, or chest&#xD;
             radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Scheduled for surgery during the study, other than minor surgery which would not delay&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has an active clinically significant (in the opinion of the Investigator) infection&#xD;
             requiring systemic therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug, or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required&#xD;
             during the study. Inactivated vaccines (such as hepatitis A or polio vaccines) are&#xD;
             permitted during the study. Seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines that do not&#xD;
             contain live virus are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Any prior hypersensitivity to monoclonal antibodies or contraindication to the receipt&#xD;
             of corticosteroids or any of the excipients (investigators should refer to the&#xD;
             prescribing information for the selected corticosteroid).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Known intolerance to either of the components of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Any medical or other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator would&#xD;
             preclude the participants participation in the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Is receiving any medication prohibited in combination with the study treatment(s) as&#xD;
             described in the product label for eribulin, unless medication was stopped within 7&#xD;

&#xD;
         24. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
