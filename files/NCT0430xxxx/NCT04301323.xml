  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myopia currently affects 30% of the world and by 2050, almost 50% of the world will be myopic&#xD;
      based on conservative estimates.1 In 2050, this will equate to almost 5 billion people with&#xD;
      myopia, and those with high myopia will total almost 1 billion.1 Due to the growing public&#xD;
      health concerns surrounding myopia, including treatments for visual complications associated&#xD;
      with high myopia, the resultant lost productivity and increased cost to society, a solution&#xD;
      to ameliorate this issue is imperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment strategies cannot prevent myopia, and their ability to slow myopia&#xD;
      progression is variable, ranging from 10% to 59%.2 Based on the meta-analysis between the&#xD;
      different interventions for myopia control, atropine eye-drops were proved the most effective&#xD;
      strategy.3 Atropine has been used in myopia control treatment over the last 30 years in many&#xD;
      countries with no serious adverse events reported.4-6 Moreover, atropine, a non-selective&#xD;
      antimuscarinic agent, has been regularly applied in multiple other ocular conditions with&#xD;
      respect to the official FDA approvals.7 8 Regarding the myopia management, recent studies&#xD;
      show the significant effect of low dose atropine in controlling the progression of spherical&#xD;
      equivalent with the least side-effects such as photophobia and blurry near vision.9 However,&#xD;
      the lack of substantial data in reducing the axial growth rate of low dose atropine proposes&#xD;
      a need of either using higher dose of atropine or in combination with other pharmaceutical&#xD;
      agent having such the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore aim to determine in a two-year clinical trial, the efficacy of the eye drops&#xD;
      used in our clinical trial for its role in slowing progression of myopia.&#xD;

      6.1. NULL HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in the rate of progression of myopia as determined by change in&#xD;
      spherical equivalent refractive error over time between PX using test eye drops compared to&#xD;
      PX in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in the rate of progression of myopia as determined by change in axial&#xD;
      length over time between PX using test eye drops compared to PX in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2. DESCRIPTION Statistical analysis is planned to commence on completion of trial&#xD;
      monitoring and the submission of the data analysis request form. Any interim analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted as described in this section unless a documented request is received from the&#xD;
      Sponsor and approved by the trial PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data stored in relational databases will be imported into SPSS / STATA software for&#xD;
      statistical purposes. Data will be investigated for quality using range checks and frequency&#xD;
      distribution. Underlying distributions of variables will be tested. In general, variables&#xD;
      measured on an interval scale with a sufficiently large sample size will be considered to&#xD;
      follow a normal distribution. Outputs from the statistical analysis such as statistical&#xD;
      tables will be copied over to Excel. All statistical results will be reported in Excel&#xD;
      format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3. NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS Prior studies indicated that the annual progression of refractive&#xD;
      error in Asian children using single-vision spectacles was -0.70 ± 0.45D. Thus approximately&#xD;
      a minimum of 35 successfully enrolled subjects are required in each study group in order to&#xD;
      demonstrate a statistically significant 50% difference in myopia progression (0.35 ± 0.45D)&#xD;
      between test and control groups at the 5% level of significance with 80% power, using a&#xD;
      2-tailed distribution and assuming 20% dropouts. The detectable difference of 0.35±0.45&#xD;
      equates to an effect size of 0.78. G*power was used to compute the sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4. SIGNIFICANCE A p-value less than or equal to 5% will be considered to be statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.5. INTERIM ANALYSIS The clinical trial will employ at least one interim analysis.&#xD;
      Statistical adjustments to the level of significance for interim analysis will be based on an&#xD;
      alpha spending function where the information fraction of the annual data at the time of the&#xD;
      interim analysis will be multiplied by 5%. However, the interim analysis used to justify the&#xD;
      need for study termination will set the statistical significance to 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6. ANALYSIS Participants who have commenced the clinical trial treatment will be included&#xD;
      in the analysis dataset. Reasons and frequency distribution of participants discontinued at&#xD;
      baseline will be reported. The analysis of efficacy variables such as subjective ratings will&#xD;
      employ only scheduled and evaluable visits. The analysis of safety variables such as adverse&#xD;
      responses will include all visits, including all unscheduled visits. The trial PI can request&#xD;
      an analysis of only those participants who have completed the trial. The default type of&#xD;
      analysis will follow an Intent-to-Treat principle. The analysis plan for each primary and&#xD;
      secondary endpoint is described here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6.1. Primary Endpoint: Myopic progression using cycloplegic spherical equivalent Spherical&#xD;
      equivalent will be recorded on an interval scale as obtained directly from the instrument.&#xD;
      Progression of spherical equivalent defined as the change from baseline for each&#xD;
      participant-eye will be computed and summarised as means ± standard deviations for each&#xD;
      visit. Progression will be analysed using the intent to treat principle by linear mixed&#xD;
      model. This model will account for the intra-subject correlation due to eye specific data and&#xD;
      repeated visits by using subject random intercepts. The fixed effects will include treatment&#xD;
      groups and visits. Subjects will be factored as random effects. The model will also include&#xD;
      confounding demographic factors and baseline readings to obtain unbiased estimates. Estimated&#xD;
      means and its confidence limits will be reported based on the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression of spherical equivalent will also be converted to a binary format using a&#xD;
      progression value such as -0.5D. Binary outcome variables will be analysed using logistic&#xD;
      regression. Robust estimator of variance will be used to account for within subject&#xD;
      correlation due to eye specific data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6.2. Secondary Endpoint: Myopic progression based on axial length change Axial length will&#xD;
      be recorded on an interval scale as obtained directly from the respective instruments.&#xD;
      Progression of axial length defined as the change from baseline for each participant-eye will&#xD;
      be computed and summarised as means ± standard deviations for each visit. Progression in&#xD;
      axial length will be analysed using the intent to treat principle by linear mixed model. This&#xD;
      model will account for the intra-subject correlation due to eye specific data and repeated&#xD;
      visits by using subject random intercepts. The fixed effects will include treatment groups&#xD;
      and visits. Subjects will be factored as random effects. The model will also include&#xD;
      confounding demographic factors and baseline readings to obtain unbiased estimates. Estimated&#xD;
      means and its confidence limits will be reported based on the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6.3. Adverse Events Adverse events will be recorded on a binary scale of 0 and 1, where 1&#xD;
      denotes the incidence of a new event. Data will be summarised as incidence over&#xD;
      participant-time and as a percentage of participant or participant-eyes. Incidence of the&#xD;
      event over participant or participant-eyes will be compared between trial groups using&#xD;
      logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6.4. Other Variables Data will be summarised as means ± standard deviations for variables&#xD;
      measured on an interval scale and median ± interquartile range for ordinal variables and&#xD;
      percentages for those that are categorical. Other commonly used tests of significance at each&#xD;
      visit may include paired t-tests and group t-test for parametric data and Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed-rank test and rank sum test for non-parametric data. Test of other variables may also&#xD;
      include Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and repeated measures ANOVA to test for&#xD;
      between-participant and within-participant factors. Test of other categorical variables may&#xD;
      include McNemar's, Fisher's Exact and Chi-Square tests for within- and between-participant&#xD;
      factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6.5. Statistical Adjustments Difference between trial groups will be ascertained at the&#xD;
      baseline visit. If there are significant differences, the baseline value can be used as a&#xD;
      covariate adjustment in the statistical model. Difference from baseline can also be computed&#xD;
      and used for further statistical analysis. If the differences are statistically significant,&#xD;
      but of low clinical significance, the analysis can be conducted without these adjustments.&#xD;
      However, the clinical relevance of the baseline differences will be discussed with the trial&#xD;
      PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneous multiple group comparisons in a post-hoc analysis will be corrected using&#xD;
      Bonferroni correction. No adjustments will be made for testing multiple endpoints such as&#xD;
      multiple subjective ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6.6. Deviations from Statistical Plan The end of study analysis will be conducted as&#xD;
      described in the protocol. Any changes to this plan will be documented in the data analysis&#xD;
      request form and will need to be duly authorised by the study principal investigator. The&#xD;
      data analysis request form will be retained along with other study documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.7. SUB GROUP ANALYSIS The planned sub group analysis will be used only to investigate&#xD;
      further hypotheses and not to make any conclusive inferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.8. CRITERIA FOR TERMINATION OF THE TRIAL FOR FINAL DATA ANALYSIS The trial will be&#xD;
      terminated upon completion of the final visit by the last active participant or if any of the&#xD;
      conditions of Section 6.4 (Participant Withdrawal) are met. An active participant is one who&#xD;
      is enrolled in the clinical trial and has not been discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.9. PROTOCOL DEVIATION PROCESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF DATA&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial team will bring deviations to the attention of the PI who, pending the&#xD;
      significance of the deviation, will discuss with the Biostatistician, and with the Sponsor,&#xD;
      as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When applicable, at the end of each protocol, protocol deviations will be reviewed (masked)&#xD;
      to determine whether any data should be excluded from the final analysis. A list of protocol&#xD;
      deviations and a recommendation of the PI as to how to use the data collected at the&#xD;
      respective visit will be given to the Sponsor for approval prior to data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual datapoints that are missing will be excluded from analysis involving only those&#xD;
      specific variables. A participant's complete visit data will not be excluded if some of the&#xD;
      observations are missing. Data from unscheduled visits will be used only for adverse response&#xD;
      analysis. Inclusion of outliers in the analysis will be based on the magnitude of change in&#xD;
      test statistics with and without the outliers. Outliers will preferably be retained unless&#xD;
      there is significant change in test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Ophthalmologist, in conjunction with the PI (Research Ophthalmologist), may&#xD;
      label the clinic visit as &quot;non evaluable&quot; on any deviations as deemed appropriate. This would&#xD;
      then be used to exclude the clinical trial visit from the analysis. Any other&#xD;
      variable-specific exclusion will be listed in the analysis request form and approved by the&#xD;
      trial PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A list is generated of all protocol deviations reported, and this information and any&#xD;
      subsequent analysis and comment, is included in the final &quot;Clinical Investigation - End of&#xD;
      Clinical trial Report&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 7.1. CRTC MONITORING A monitor will ensure all&#xD;
      essential documents are in place prior to study commencement and that all participants have&#xD;
      signed the participant informed consent form prior to any study procedures being performed.&#xD;
      No other monitoring will be performed due to the scale of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS Protocol amendments will be submitted to the Sponsor and HREC for&#xD;
      review and approval prior to implementation, unless the change required is to eliminate an&#xD;
      immediate hazard to participants, or involves only administrative and/or logistical aspects&#xD;
      of the studies (e.g. change in contact numbers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3. PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS The Investigator will not deviate from the protocol except if the&#xD;
      deviation affects Participants' rights, safety and well-being. Any deviation from the&#xD;
      protocol shall be recorded together with an explanation, including corrective and preventive&#xD;
      actions and reported to the required bodies within the specified timeframe. The Sponsor is&#xD;
      responsible for analysing and assessing the significance of the deviation and determining if&#xD;
      data will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.4. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION OF EQUIPMENT Equipment will be monitored regularly for&#xD;
      maintenance and calibration as per relevant Institute / CRTC SOPs, company and product&#xD;
      manuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The protocols require HREC approval prior to start and will be&#xD;
      conducted as per the applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator is to ensure that the protocol, PI/ICF, Investigator Brochure, available&#xD;
      safety information, information about payment and compensation to participants, advertising&#xD;
      or any clinical trial-specific information provided to participants (including potential&#xD;
      participants), the Investigator's CV and/or evidence of appropriate qualifications and any&#xD;
      other documentation they may request are submitted, reviewed and approved by the HREC. Any&#xD;
      subsequent amendments will be reviewed and approved by an HREC prior to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1. CONFIDENTIALITY Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the studies by all parties&#xD;
      involved in accordance with guidelines under Section 95 of the Privacy Act 1998, and&#xD;
      guidelines approved under Section 95a of the Privacy Act 1998 (December 2001). Data will be&#xD;
      secured against unauthorised access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy and confidentiality of information about each participant will be preserved in the&#xD;
      reports and any publication of the clinical trial data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2. INFORMED CONSENT The informed consent process and documentation to be used for the trial&#xD;
      will be reviewed and approved by the HREC prior to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent process provides the participant with ongoing explanations that will&#xD;
      allow them to make educated decisions about whether to begin or continue participating in the&#xD;
      trial. The Investigator will discuss the trial with the participant and the participant will&#xD;
      have the opportunity to ask questions before, during and after the trial. The participant&#xD;
      will be informed that at any time during their involvement in the trial, they have the&#xD;
      opportunity to withdraw this consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI/ICF provides a summary of the trial, including its purpose, procedures and schedule,&#xD;
      potential risks and benefits, and alternative treatments. It also explains the participant's&#xD;
      rights once in the trial. The participant is given sufficient time to consider whether or not&#xD;
      to participate and if they agree to voluntarily take part, they give their consent by signing&#xD;
      the PI/ICF.&#xD;
