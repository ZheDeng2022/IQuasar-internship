    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 year. The progression is defined consistent with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria for solid tumors.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Objective Response Rate is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete or partial response to treatment,consistent with RECIST version 1.1 criteria for solid tumors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Disease Control Rate is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete or partial response to treatment or stable disease, consistent with RECIST version 1.1 criteria for solid tumors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>percentage of patients with Clinical Benefit Response</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Composite measure based on patient-reported pain (per Faces pain scale revised), patient-reported pain medication, Karnofsky performance status(KPS), and weight. Clinical benefit is indicated by either:(a) improvement in pain (less pain intensity with stable or decreased pain medication; or less pain medication with stable or decreased pain intensity with stable or improved KPS; or (b) improvement in KPS with stable or improved pain.With stable for KPS and pain, clinical benefit may be indicated with an observation of positive weight change.&#xD;
Clinical benefit response (CBR) was classified weekly and a patient was considered a clinical benefit responder if clinical benefit was observed and maintained over a 4 week period.</description>
