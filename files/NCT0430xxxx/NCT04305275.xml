    <measure>Change From Baseline Compared to Placebo in The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment (TETRAS) Performance Subscale Part 4 Upper Limb Tremor Score on Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>TETRAS is a validated, comprehensive clinical assessment of essential tremor. For the performance subscale part 4 upper limb (UL) tremor score, all 3 maneuvers in the UL assessments of part 4 (subscale 4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for the left arm and then for the right. The part 4 subscale ordinally rates postural (limbs extended forward and wing-beating [elbows flexed]), and kinetic (finger-nose-finger maneuver) tremor on a 0 to 4 severity scale in 0.5-point increments. TETRAS Part 4 score for each upper limb ranges from 0 to 12 and for both upper limbs from 0 to 24.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Compared to Placebo in TETRAS Performance Subscale Part 4 Upper Limb Tremor Score at all Other Timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, 8, 15, 22 and on Day 42 (or Early Termination Visit [ETV] / End of Study [EOS])</time_frame>
    <description>For the performance subscale part 4 upper limb (UL) tremor score, all 3 maneuvers in the UL assessments of part 4 (subscale 4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for the left arm and then for the right. The part 4 subscale ordinally rates postural (limbs extended forward and wing-beating [elbows flexed]), and kinetic (finger-nose-finger maneuver) tremor on a 0 to 4 severity scale in 0.5-point increments.

    <measure>Change From Baseline Compared to Placebo in Kinesia ONE Accelerometer Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and on Day 42 (or ETV / EOS)</time_frame>
    <description>Kinesia ONE is a wireless motion sensor worn distally on the index finger, which utilizes 3 orthogonal accelerometers and 3 orthogonal gyroscopes to monitor three-dimensional motion. Via the Kinesia ONE software application, measures of three-dimensional motion are converted to scores ranging from 0 to 4. Higher scores indicate greater tremor severity. Motion in each arm will be captured separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Compared to Placebo in TETRAS Scale Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and on Day 42 (or ETV / EOS)</time_frame>
    <description>The ADL subscale will assess how ET impacts typical activities of daily living (speech, eating, drinking, dressing, personal hygiene, writing, occupational impairment, social impact and activities affected by upper limb (UL) tremor). It consists of 12 items, each rated from 0 (normal activity) to 4 (severe abnormality) with overall ADL score range of 0 to 48.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Compared to Placebo in TETRAS Total Performance Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and on Day 42 (or ETV / EOS)</time_frame>
    <description>The total performance score is based on overall rating of tremor amplitude in the voice, limbs, head, face, trunk, while performing pre-specified tasks, and functional task capabilities (handwriting, spiral drawing, and holding a pen over a dot). Each of these items is rated from 0 (no tremor) to 4 (severe tremor) with an overall performance score of 0 to 64.</description>

    <description>A TEAE is defined as an AE with onset after the start of investigational product (IP), or any worsening of a pre-existing medical condition/AE with onset after the start of IP and throughout the study.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Participant has a diagnosis of ET, defined as isolated tremor syndrome consisting of&#xD;
             bilateral upper limb action tremor for at least 3 years prior to screening, with or&#xD;
             without tremor in other locations and absence of other neurological signs, such as&#xD;
             dystonia, ataxia, or parkinsonism, isolated focal tremors (eg, voice, head), task- and&#xD;
             position-specific tremors, sudden tremor onset or evidence of step-wise deterioration&#xD;
             of tremor.&#xD;
