  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there has been an increased interest in evaluating binocular therapies (e.g&#xD;
      perceptual learning and dichoptic treatment) for amblyopia. They are designed to improve&#xD;
      amblyopia through binocular stimulation by unlocking binocular visual function. The objective&#xD;
      of the study is to compare the visual and sensory outcome of 2-hour patching to dichoptic&#xD;
      stimulation using virtual reality head mounted display in the management of patients with&#xD;
      moderate anisometropic amblyopia. The investigators will include children older than 6 years&#xD;
      and adults up to the age of thirty five years with anisometropic amblyopia who either had no&#xD;
      prior treatment for amblyopia or had prior treatment for amblyopia using patching therapy but&#xD;
      with residual amblyopia defined as &gt;= 0.3 logMAR lines between the best-corrected visual&#xD;
      acuity in the sound eye and in the amblyopic eye and with moderate amblyopia in the more&#xD;
      anisometropic eye defined as best-corrected visual acuity better than 6/60 but =&lt; 6/18.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups according to age using stratified randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group P: (Patching Group): This group will have 2 hours of patching each day for 10&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group D (Dichoptic Group): This group will have 1 hour of dichoptic stimulation using&#xD;
           the virtual reality system twice a week for 10 weeks for a total of 20 hours of&#xD;
           training.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators are planning to conduct a study to compare the visual and sensory outcome&#xD;
      of 2-hour patching to dichoptic stimulation using virtual reality head mounted display in the&#xD;
      management of patients with moderate anisometropic amblyopia. This is a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial. The investigators will include children older than 6 years and adults up to the age of&#xD;
      thirty five years with anisometropic amblyopia who either had no prior treatment for&#xD;
      amblyopia or had prior treatment for amblyopia using patching therapy but with residual&#xD;
      amblyopia defined as &gt;= 0.3 logMAR lines between the best-corrected visual acuity in the&#xD;
      sound eye and in the amblyopic eye and with moderate amblyopia in the more anisometropic eye&#xD;
      defined as best-corrected visual acuity better than 6/60 but =&lt; 6/18.n Recruitment will occur&#xD;
      from the Ophthalmology Outpatient Clinics in Kasr El-Ainy Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients who agree to participate in the study will undergo a 1-hour trial session&#xD;
      of dichoptic stimulation using the same head-mounted virtual reality system that will be used&#xD;
      in the study to ensure that the patient can use the system. Only patients who are able to&#xD;
      understand and to complete the 1-hour session will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups according to age using stratified randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group P: (Patching Group): This group will have 2 hours of patching each day for 10&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group D (Dichoptic Group): This group will have 1 hour of dichoptic stimulation using&#xD;
           the virtual reality system twice a week for 10 weeks for a total of 20 hours of&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be further subdivided into 2 subgroups according to whether prior patching&#xD;
      therapy has been done and failed, or the patient has never received any form of patching&#xD;
      therapy. The difference in the outcomes in both subgroups will be analyzed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a baseline ophthalmological examination including visual acuity&#xD;
      testing, manifest and cycloplegic refraction, slit lamp examination with funduscopy, cover&#xD;
      test and worth four dot test. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) will be measured using a&#xD;
      single crowded letter in an ETDRS chart mounted on a computer display projector. The&#xD;
      stereoacuity will be measured using the TNO test. The motor alignment will be evaluated using&#xD;
      prism and alternating cover test at 6 meters and at 33 cm. BCVA and stereoacuity will be&#xD;
      measured before and after 10 weeks of treatment. Then, they will be re-measured 10 weeks&#xD;
      after the cessation of both treatments to assess their long-term effects. All measurements&#xD;
      will be taken by an investigator who will be masked to the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dichoptic treatment group: Dichoptic visual training will be performed with the patient&#xD;
      wearing his spectacles using the computer game included in Vivid Vision (Vivid Vision, San&#xD;
      Francisco, USA) which will be run in the Oculus Rift OC CV1 virtual reality head mounted&#xD;
      display (Oculus VR, Menlo Park, California, USA). Each subject will have 20 treatment&#xD;
      sessions, divided into 1 hour-sessions performed twice a week for 10 weeks. Each session will&#xD;
      be 60 minutes. Adherence to the treatment regimen will be assessed by the number of hours&#xD;
      spent in training at the end of 5th week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patching group: Patients in the control group will be instructed to continue wearing&#xD;
      spectacles if required. Patients will be prescribed two continuous hours of daily patching&#xD;
      with at least one hour of near activities during patching. Adhesive skin patches will be&#xD;
      provided by the study. The parent/patient will be instructed to spend at least one of the&#xD;
      hours of patching time each day performing eye-hand coordination activities at near.&#xD;
      Adherence to the treatment protocol will be assessed by having the parent call / send a&#xD;
      message to an investigator at the start and end of the occlusion sessions completed each day,&#xD;
      thus making the most as accurate as possible assessment of the patient's adherence to the&#xD;
      prescribed treatment. Written consent will be obtained by either the principal investigator&#xD;
      or other investigators in the study. Adverse events will include any sense of dizziness,&#xD;
      vertigo, or diplopia at any time and will be tabulated and reported at the end of each week.&#xD;
      The data will be collected with privacy and confidentiality as patients will be allocated ID&#xD;
      numbers and data will be analyzed accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 38 participants in each group will be selected to have 90% power with a&#xD;
      2-sided type I error of 5% to detect a treatment group difference at 10 weeks if the true&#xD;
      difference in the mean gain of new letters was 3.75, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of&#xD;
      change of 5 letters, based on a prior PEDIG study. Assuming a 10% drop-out rate, a total of&#xD;
      42 patients in each group will need to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between both groups will be done using independent t-test for continuous variables&#xD;
      and Fisher Exact test for categorical variables. Analyses for secondary outcomes of visual&#xD;
      acuity and stereoacuity will be adjusted for multiple testing using the Bonferroni method&#xD;
      such that the overall type I error rate will be 5% within the 2sets of secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will be conducted for secondary outcomes and adherence measures for&#xD;
      participants assigned to control treatment who later received 10 weeks of binocular&#xD;
      treatment. Log file data at 5 weeks and 10 weeks will be used to quantify measures of&#xD;
      adherence (treatment duration and change in contrast presented to the fellow eye) and to&#xD;
      examine the relationship between these adherence measures and treatment response. For each&#xD;
      participant, the total hours of completed and prescribed game play will be calculated, and&#xD;
      the percentage of prescribed treatment completed (adherence) will be computed using the ratio&#xD;
      of the completed and prescribed hours of game play for that interval. Analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Inc, Cary, NC).&#xD;
