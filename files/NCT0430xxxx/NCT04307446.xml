  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed project the investigators will evaluate the feasibility of Immersive Virtual&#xD;
      Reality (IVR) and assess the initial effects of IVR on symptoms, affect, and tolerance to&#xD;
      cutaneous stimuli. In this single-arm trial, the investigators will recruit 20 adults with&#xD;
      CBP. Prior to their IVR experience, subjects will complete multiday baseline assessments&#xD;
      using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology to establish typical levels of&#xD;
      symptoms and affect. Afterward, in a single experimental session, they will participate in&#xD;
      two counterbalanced IVR sessions: one 10-minute and one 20-minute. Immediately after each&#xD;
      session the investigators will measure current symptoms and affect using valid and reliable&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires, and we will measure changes in tolerance to cutaneous stimuli&#xD;
      using quantitative sensory testing. We will measure symptoms and affect for 72 hours after&#xD;
      the experimental session using EMA to determine if there is a carryover. At the completion of&#xD;
      this study, we will continue to work with stakeholders to develop clinically relevant IVR&#xD;
      interventions for people with CBP.&#xD;

      Visit 1-Remote: Consent. Random assignment: Subjects will complete informed consent and data&#xD;
      collection of baseline information (demographics, medical history, perceptions of pain, and&#xD;
      experiences with VR), surveys on pain, Pain interference, fatigue, and affect. The&#xD;
      investigators will also help the participant upload the EMA technology onto their personal&#xD;
      phone or tablet. Subjects will then be randomly assigned to receive either the 10- minute IVR&#xD;
      session first or the 20-minute IVR session first. Visit 1 will take between 45 and 60&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple Baseline EMA-Remote: Visit 2 will be scheduled 1-2 weeks later. During the time&#xD;
      between visits the investigators will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) technology to&#xD;
      collect multiple measures of pain, fatigue and affect. In EMA subjects respond to prompts&#xD;
      delivered through their cell phone or tablet (&quot;pings&quot;) with documentation of current&#xD;
      symptoms. It is a well-recognized method to capture immediate, synchronized experiences in&#xD;
      subjects' natural environments. During this data collection period subjects will be &quot;pinged&quot;&#xD;
      3x daily and asked to rate their current levels of pain, fatigue, and affect. Time to&#xD;
      complete these responses will be 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2-In person: pre Survey/Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST); First VR visit; post&#xD;
      Survey/QST. The investigators will collect current pain, pain interference, fatigue and&#xD;
      affect, and Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). QST involves cutaneous (skin) psychophysical&#xD;
      (semi-subjective) testing to assess sensory and pain perception pathways. QST quantifies the&#xD;
      thresholds of detection of stimuli, the perceived intensity, and the temporal summation&#xD;
      (changes in perception over multiple applications). These pain testing procedures are&#xD;
      widely-accepted, non-invasive, and non-tissue damaging. The investigators will complete two&#xD;
      types QST. Mechanical Pressure Pain Thresholds (MPPTh) will be assessed using a digital&#xD;
      pressure algometer on the right upper trapezius and right thumb MP joint. Mechanical Temporal&#xD;
      Summation of Pain (MTSP) will be assessed using weighted pinprick stimulators. The&#xD;
      investigators will apply a train of 10 stimuli at the rate of 1 per second on the middle&#xD;
      finger of the right hand, and subjects will rate the painfulness of the first, fifth, and&#xD;
      tenth stimulus. All subjects will take part in two VR experiences (10 min and 20 min) for a&#xD;
      total of 30-minutes in VR. After each experience subjects will rate their current pain,&#xD;
      fatigue, and affect, and the investigators will complete QST. At the end of both sessions the&#xD;
      subjects will rate their experiences of immersion using the Igroup Presence Questionaire,&#xD;
      engagement using the Use Engagement Scale (UES), and simulation tolerance using the Simulator&#xD;
      Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). The investigators will also ask a series of open-ended&#xD;
      questions about the participant's experiences with IVR and participation in the study. These&#xD;
      will include questions about their enjoyment, perceptions of pain, and what they liked/did&#xD;
      not like about the IVR experience as well as questions about the burden of being in the&#xD;
      study. Visit 2 will take 1.5 to 2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Visit 2 EMA-Remote: Subjects will complete three more days (72 hours) of 3x a day&#xD;
      prompts for pain, fatigue and affect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3-In person: pre Survey/Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST); Second VR visit; post&#xD;
      Survey/QST&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Visit 3 EMA-Remote: Subjects will complete 2 more days (48 hours) of 3x a day prompts&#xD;
      for pain, fatigue and affect.&#xD;
