  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single oral doses of&#xD;
      NCO-48 Fumarate in healthy subjects. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of NCO-48 Fumarate and its active metabolite, tenofovir (TFV),&#xD;
      in healthy subjects following single oral doses and to evaluate the effect of food on the PK&#xD;
      of a 30 mg dose of NCO-48 Fumarate in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, ascending single oral&#xD;
      dose study. NCO-48 Fumarate will be assessed in healthy subjects (6 groups of 8 subjects&#xD;
      each). Subjects will receive a single oral dose of NCO-48 Fumarate or placebo capsules in 1&#xD;
      or 2 periods, depending on the dose group, under fasting conditions (unless otherwise&#xD;
      indicated) and will be followed for a 1-week observation period. Safety assessments will be&#xD;
      performed and NCO-48 Fumarate and TFV PK will be assessed. The planned doses for this study&#xD;
      are 2, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 mg. Each group of 8 subjects (Groups 1 to 6) will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either NCO-48 Fumarate or placebo (6 subjects to receive&#xD;
      active drug and 2 subjects to receive placebo) as a single dose on Day 1 of Period 1 in the&#xD;
      fasted state. A preliminary assessment of food effect will be conducted in Group 3. Subjects&#xD;
      in Group 3 will receive study drug in Period 1 under fasted conditions and return after a&#xD;
      minimum of 14 days to receive study drug under fed conditions. There will be a Screening&#xD;
      Period of up to 30 days. All subjects (Periods 1 and 2) will be observed through the morning&#xD;
      of Day 3 (48-hour post-dose assessment). Safety assessments and NCO-48 Fumarate and TFV PK&#xD;
      sample collection (blood and urine) will occur during this time. Subjects will be discharged&#xD;
      from the study site after the 48 hour assessments and return to the study site on Days 5 and&#xD;
      7 (final visit) for follow-up procedures. After the Day 7 follow-up procedures for each&#xD;
      group, evaluation of all safety and tolerability data collected during the period, and&#xD;
      evaluation of any available PK data, the dose for the next group of subjects will be&#xD;
      determined by the Safety Monitoring Panel (SMP).&#xD;
