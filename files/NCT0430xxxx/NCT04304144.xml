  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AL amyloidosis begins in the bone marrow where abnormal proteins misfold and create free&#xD;
      light chains that cannot be broken down. These free light chains bind together to form&#xD;
      amyloid fibrils that build up in the extracellular space of organs, affecting the kidneys,&#xD;
      heart, liver, spleen, nervous system and digestive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of CAEL-101 to&#xD;
      facilitate progression of further clinical trials and evaluate safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      CAEL-101 in combination with the standard of care (SoC)&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone (CyBorD) chemotherapy and daratumumab .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, sequential cohort, dose-selection study of CAEL-101 in&#xD;
      Mayo Stage I, Stage II and Stage IIIa AL amyloidosis patients. CAEL-101 will be administered&#xD;
      in combination with the standard of care (SoC) cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone&#xD;
      (CyBorD) chemotherapy and daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into two parts with the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A defines the safety and tolerability of CAEL-101 in combination with SoC CyBorD&#xD;
           and determines the recommended Phase 3 dose (RP3D) of CAEL-101&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B evaluates the safety and tolerability of CAEL-101 in combination with SoC CyBorD&#xD;
           and daratumumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of CAEL-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A of the study will employ a 3+3 dose escalation design. At least 3 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in each dose cohort unless adverse events (AE) preventing further dosing are&#xD;
      observed. CAEL-101 will be administered in combination with the SoCCyBorD chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, a minimum of 6 new patients will receive CAEL-101 administered in combination with&#xD;
      SoC CyBorD and daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from both Parts A and B will receive CAEL-101 therapy weekly and SoC throughout the&#xD;
      safety observation period. CAEL-101 study drug infusions will continue, with dosing&#xD;
      approximately every two weeks (q2wk) thereafter. SoC will continue per the Investigator's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 25 patients will be enrolled in the study at approximately 3 investigator&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with CAEL-101 until death, unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic&#xD;
      deterioration, Investigator decision, patient decision or Sponsor decision to terminate the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
