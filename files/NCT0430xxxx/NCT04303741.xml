  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-labeled, multi-centered,single-arm, Investigator-initiated clinical&#xD;
      trial of camrelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) in combination with apatinib (a VEGFR2 TKI) and&#xD;
      eribulin mesylate in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer. We will enroll 46&#xD;
      subjects (Simons two stage design). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      camrelizumab combined with apatinib and eribulin in the treatment of advanced TNBC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This a phase II, open-labeled, multi-centered, single-arm, investigator-initiated clinical&#xD;
      trial to assess the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combination with apatinib and&#xD;
      eribulin in female patients age of 18 to 70 with advanced TNBC, and previously treated with&#xD;
      at least one line of systemic therapy in the advanced setting. Prior therapy&#xD;
      (adjuvant/neoadjuvant/advanced) must have included an anthracycline and a taxane. The number&#xD;
      of patients to be included is 46 patients (Simons two stage design). The primary objective is&#xD;
      to assess the overall response rate (ORR). All enrolled patients will be treated with&#xD;
      camrelizumab 200mg (iv. 3mg/kg for patient whose weight is below 50kg) on day 1 of each&#xD;
      21-day cycle, and apatinib 250mg daily (po, d1-d21), in combination with eribulin mesylate at&#xD;
      1.4 mg/m2 (iv.) on day 1 and day 8 of every 21-day cycle.&#xD;
