      Research Question: Does the gut microbiome contribute to muscle anabolic resistance to&#xD;
      protein supplementation in older adults?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Loss of muscle occurs with age and skeletal muscle in older adults can display&#xD;
      anabolic resistance to protein in diet. It has been hypothesised that the gut microbiome may&#xD;
      play a role in this relationship and therefore could be targeted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to test whether modulation of the gut microbiome, in addition to protein&#xD;
      supplementation, can improve skeletal muscle function versus protein supplementation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blinded, randomised, placebo controlled, dietary intervention study. Twin pairs will&#xD;
      be randomised to either receive protein supplementation plus placebo or protein&#xD;
      supplementation plus a gut microbiome modulator (prebiotic plus probiotic) for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Primary outcome will be muscle function measured using chair-rise time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anabolic resistance warrants further characterisation to guide future therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions, especially considering its role in the development of disability, sarcopenia&#xD;
      and frailty.&#xD;

      Research Question: Does the gut microbiome contribute to muscle anabolic resistance to&#xD;
      protein supplementation in older adults?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength occurs with increasing age and is&#xD;
      associated with loss of function, disability, and the development of sarcopenia and frailty.&#xD;
      Dietary protein is essential for skeletal muscle function, but older adults do not respond as&#xD;
      well as younger people to protein, so called 'anabolic resistance'. The aetiology and&#xD;
      molecular mechanisms for this are not understood, however a number have been proposed. The&#xD;
      gut microbiome is known to play a key role in a number of these postulated mechanisms. This&#xD;
      has led us to hypothesise that the gut microbiome may mediate anabolic resistance and could&#xD;
      represent an exciting new target for ameliorating muscle loss in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to test whether modulation of the gut microbiome, in addition to protein&#xD;
      supplementation, can improve skeletal muscle function versus protein supplementation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blinded, randomised, placebo controlled, dietary intervention study. Volunteers will&#xD;
      be recruited in twin pairs from TwinsUK cohort, for which extensive baseline data are&#xD;
      available. The twin nature of the study allows for close genetic and environmental matching&#xD;
      at baseline. Each pair will be randomised to either receive protein supplementation plus&#xD;
      placebo or protein supplementation plus a gut microbiome modulator (prebiotic plus&#xD;
      probiotic). Intervention period will be 12 weeks. Clinical and biochemical measures will be&#xD;
      taken at 0, and 12 weeks, with 2-monthly contact. Gut microbiota composition will be&#xD;
      measured, alongside a battery of physical assessments. Primary outcome will be muscle&#xD;
      function measured using chair-rise time. The trial will be delivered remotely using video&#xD;
      calls, and postal boxes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anabolic resistance warrants further characterisation to guide future therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions, especially considering its role in the development of disability, sarcopenia&#xD;
      and frailty. Therapeutic options are badly needed, particularly for older adults who cannot&#xD;
      undertake exercise programmes.&#xD;
