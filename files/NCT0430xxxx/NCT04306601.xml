      Low-intensity focused ultrasound can be effective in severe TBI patients with disorder of&#xD;
      consciousness. This study is a prospective single arm, open-label and explorative clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the therapeutic effect of recovery from DoC and safety of low-intensity&#xD;
      focused ultrasound stimulation at thalamic area in patients with post-traumatic DoC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important global health concern. It is estimated that&#xD;
      about 70 million individuals will suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year. Serious&#xD;
      TBIs for hospitalization or death is at least 10 million annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, advances in neurocritical care have led to an increase in the number of severe TBI&#xD;
      patients recovering cognitive and physical function, eventually returning to independent&#xD;
      life. However, some of severe TBI patients fail to fully recover consciousness. This&#xD;
      condition is called disorder of consciousness (DoC). They recover from coma and maintain&#xD;
      sleep-wake cycle, but have impaired awareness of themselves and their environment. These&#xD;
      states are called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome or minimally conscious state. These&#xD;
      conditions make patients loss all autonomy and heavy emotional and financial burden on their&#xD;
      families. In addition to these devastating effects, these conditions are known to increase&#xD;
      burn out rates in caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, patients with post-traumatic DoC were considered to be &quot;nothing to do&quot;. However,&#xD;
      treatments such as sensory stimulation, physiotherapy, and medication have been used and&#xD;
      studied recently. Sensory stimulation is based on the idea that enriched stimulations benefit&#xD;
      neural plasticity and recovery. Most studies of sensory stimulation have been case-reports,&#xD;
      with few randomized controlled study. Physiotherapy mainly includes range of motion, posture&#xD;
      changes, and so on. Almost all hospitals offer physiotherapy, but there is still insufficient&#xD;
      evidence to conclude that it is effective for patients with post-traumatic DoC. Studies on&#xD;
      pharmacologic treatments in patients with DoC are mainly related to dopaminergics, because&#xD;
      dopaminergics can stimulate the reticular activating system to improve wakefulness and&#xD;
      attention. Among them, amantadine is proved to be an effective treatment through a large&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial in patients with post-traumatic DoC. However, although&#xD;
      amantadine is effective in accelerating the pace of recovery, there is a limitation that the&#xD;
      effect on long-term outcomes remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a scientific understanding of the consciousness grows, many studies have been conducted to&#xD;
      restore the consciousness by neuromodulation techniques, such as median nerve stimulation,&#xD;
      dorsal column stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Median nerve&#xD;
      stimulation was attempted to direct sensory stimulation to the brain. However, it has been&#xD;
      shown to be ineffective in small randomized controlled study. Attempts to stimulate the&#xD;
      dorsal column of spinal cord directly have been made. However, because it is invasive&#xD;
      procedure, no randomized controlled studies have been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 10 years, as a restorative treatment of consciousness after TBI, the&#xD;
      neurostimulation such as tDCS, rTMS and DBS has received increased attention. In a&#xD;
      double-blind sham-controlled crossover design study, Thibaut et al. have investigated the&#xD;
      efficacy of tDCS in 55 DOC patients. Significant behavioral changes were observed after tDCS&#xD;
      in MCS patients, but after 1 year, the effect was not maintained. DBS has been generally used&#xD;
      in Parkinson's disease, but it has been also performed in patients with DoC because it can&#xD;
      directly stimulate thalamus. Improved the consciousness after DBS have been reported , but&#xD;
      the evidence isn't still sufficient and the risk is too high to be administered to patients&#xD;
      with post-traumatic DoC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) has been newly proposed as a technique to overcome&#xD;
      the limitations of existing neurostimulation techniques. LIFU has a spatial resolution of&#xD;
      only 2-5 mm and a depth of penetration of more than 10-15 cm. Thus, it can pass through the&#xD;
      skull to stimulate the deep brain tissue and can also stimulate finely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, we have focused on studies of stimulating nerve tissue using a focused&#xD;
      ultrasound stimulation system. It was reported that activation and inhibition control of&#xD;
      motor and visual nervous system in rabbits can be achieved using a focused ultrasound&#xD;
      stimulation system. We also reported that the thalamus of anesthetized rats was stimulated&#xD;
      with a focused ultrasound stimulation system, resulting in a shorter recovery time from&#xD;
      anesthesia. The image-guided navigation system using MRI made it possible to focus the&#xD;
      ultrasound stimulation at the target point of the brain with high accuracy. In 2018, a&#xD;
      wearable FUS headgear for a rat model was developed and the effect of long- term changes of&#xD;
      brain function by focused ultrasound stimulation was reported, thereby identifying the&#xD;
      possibility of neuroplasticity using LIFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, Monti et al. reported a clinical case of recovery of consciousness in a traffic&#xD;
      accident patient who had been in a coma for about 20 days. The central thalamic area of the&#xD;
      patient was stimulated with LIFU for 5-10 minutes each day, restoring consciousness from the&#xD;
      3rd day and starting walking on the 5th day. This result is supported by the relationship&#xD;
      between central thalamus and consciousness. In addition, it is similar to the case that&#xD;
      central thalamus stimulation using DBS in the patient who had MCS for 6 years after TBI&#xD;
      modulated behavioral responses of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on above results, this study's aim is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of recovery&#xD;
      from DoC and safety of LIFU stimulation at thalamic area in patients with post-traumatic DoC.&#xD;

The CRS consists of 25 hierarchically arranged items that comprise 6 subscales addressing auditory, visual, motor, oromotor, communication, and arousal processes. Scoring is based on the presence or absence of specific behavioral responses to sensory stimuli administered in a standardized manner. The lowest item on each subscale represents reflexive activity, whereas the highest items represent cognitively mediated behaviors.&#xD;
The total minimum and maximum values are 0 and 23.</description>
