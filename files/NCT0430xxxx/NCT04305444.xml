  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeted drug therapies have greatly improved outcomes for patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However,&#xD;
      single drug therapies have limitations, therefore, the current study is evaluating a novel&#xD;
      oral combination of targeted drugs as a way of overcoming these limitations. This study will&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of the triple combination therapy, DTRM-555, in patients with R/R CLL&#xD;
      or R/R non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in three parts: Phase Ia, Phase Ib and Phase II,&#xD;
      disease-specific expansion cohorts. Phase Ia explored escalating doses of a monotherapy of a&#xD;
      novel Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor, DTRMWXHS-12. Phase Ib explored two&#xD;
      combination therapies, DTRM-505 (DTRMWXHS-12 and everolimus) and DTRM-555 (DTRMWXHS-12,&#xD;
      everolimus and pomalidomide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current Phase II study will further examine the investigational triple combination&#xD;
      treatment, DTRM-555 for efficacy and safety. The study is being conducted in five&#xD;
      disease-specific cohorts: Activated B-Cell (ABC) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Germinal&#xD;
      Center B-Cell (GCB) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Richter's Transformation, transformed&#xD;
      Follicular Lymphoma, and relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Objective of the Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of the triple&#xD;
      combination therapy, DTRM-555, in the five disease-specific cohorts. The Secondary Objectives&#xD;
      are (1) to determine the safety of DTRM-555 in the cohorts and (2) to obtain the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of DTRM-555 (i.e., DTRMWXHS-12, everolimus and pomalidomide).&#xD;
