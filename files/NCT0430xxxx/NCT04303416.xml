  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the most common genetic disorder of the brain white matter&#xD;
      with an incidence of 1:14,700 births. It is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene, which&#xD;
      encodes a transporter of very long-chain fatty acids (VCLFA) into the peroxisome for&#xD;
      degradation. As a consequence VLCFA accumulate in tissues and plasma being the pathognomonic&#xD;
      biomarker for diagnosis. The excess of VLCFA produces mitochondrial ROS and oxidative damage,&#xD;
      a major factor driving X-ALD pathogenesis. Other key dysregulated pathways are energy&#xD;
      production, mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, proteostasis, and ER stress. Current&#xD;
      therapeutic options are unsatisfactory, restricted to bone marrow transplant and gene&#xD;
      therapy, for which most patients do not qualify. The encouraging results of plasma exchange&#xD;
      (PE) with albumin replacement for Alzheimer's Disease prompted us to start this study. Our&#xD;
      rationale is the following: In plasma, VLCFA are transported by lipoproteins and albumin.&#xD;
      Albumin is the major transporter of fatty acids (FA) to the brain. ABCD1 deficiency induces&#xD;
      inflammation and increases blood-brain barrier leakage, which could facilitate increased&#xD;
      permeability to albumin. We posit that replacement of albumin would lower VLCFA levels in&#xD;
      plasma through peripheral sink mechanisms, diminishing the quantity of VLCFA reaching the&#xD;
      brain, and would prevent lipid peroxidation. A pilot proof-of-concept study in 5 X-ALD&#xD;
      patients will be carried out to replace endogenous albumin through PE applied, once a week&#xD;
      the first month and monthly for 5 months. A 6 months follow-up after the end of the treatment&#xD;
      will be carried out.&#xD;
