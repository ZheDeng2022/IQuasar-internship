    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of intestinal microbiota therapy on gastro-intestinal&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). This is a mulicenter randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial conducted at university hospitals in Oslo, Tromsø, Bergen and Trondheim in&#xD;
      Norway. In part A1, half of the patients will receive active substance (intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      cultured in the lab - &quot;ACHIM&quot;) in the small intestine twice by gastroduodenoscopy, the other&#xD;
      half will receive placebo. The primary outcome will be measured on week 12 by patient&#xD;
      reported outcome measures. In part A2, all participants receive ACHIM at week 12, with an 8&#xD;
      week follow-up for all. A step-wise follow-up will be done in part B up to 16 weeks after&#xD;
      week 20 until the last participant finish week 20 visit, which is defined as end of study.The&#xD;
      blind from the first intervention will not be opened before end of study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The 20-week study period consists of a 12-week induction phase (Part A1), with randomized, double-blind parallel group interventions by endoscopic infusions at weeks 0 and 2, and an 8-week maintenance phase (Part A2) where all participants receive one single open label endoscopic infusion on week 12. Additionally, all participants who complete the 20-week study period are followed for a maximum 16 weeks monitoring period (Part B) to obtain longer-term data on safety and durability of intervention effects.</intervention_model_description>
