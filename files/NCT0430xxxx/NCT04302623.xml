      Study Aim: This study will explore the feasibility and effectiveness of a yoga program for&#xD;
      patients with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A superiority RCT with 30 participants per group. Adult patients with IBS fluent in&#xD;
      English who do not have major physical impairments or cognitive, psychological, or&#xD;
      psychiatric disorder will be recruited and randomly using the REDCap randomization module to&#xD;
      either a yoga intervention delivered (a) a yoga intervention delivered online led by a yoga&#xD;
      facilitator or (b) a advice only control group. The 8-week Hatha Yoga intervention consists&#xD;
      of Yoga Namaskar, Nadi Shuddhi (alternate nostril breathing), mantra chanting, and breath&#xD;
      watching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Yoga program. Participants will be asked to practice the yoga program daily at home&#xD;
      and will be given access to the yoga videos hosted on the University of Calgary study&#xD;
      website, as well as written program instructions, and frequently answered questions. A brief&#xD;
      description of the video content will be provided to inform the participant of its content&#xD;
      and length. Additional website content will include study information, study schedule, and&#xD;
      contact information, as well as a pre-recorded educational session. In addition to the daily&#xD;
      program describe above, the facilitator-led intervention will be delivered online by a&#xD;
      certified yoga facilitator using the Microsoft Teams platform. Participants in group of 3 to&#xD;
      5 will be collated to enhance effectiveness of the study processes. Our team has experience&#xD;
      with this approach, as this strategy is currently used with previous yoga study. Yoga classes&#xD;
      will be held once per week for 8 weeks, with the first session lasting approximately 1.5&#xD;
      hours and subsequent sessions up to 60 minutes. The total allocated time for the introductory&#xD;
      session will include the class set-up, introductions, educational material (please see&#xD;
      below), overview of practices, teaching of practices, practice corrections/enhancements,&#xD;
      modifications, and practice expectations. Each follow-up class will include review from the&#xD;
      previous week, questions and answers, individual corrections and/or modifications. For&#xD;
      individual corrections, the yoga facilitator will ask the participant to do the practices and&#xD;
      receive corrections, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2. Advice-only control group. This group will receive general education on IBS, the&#xD;
      mind and gut connection, and the role of mind-body therapies in the management of IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 8 weeks. The primary effectiveness&#xD;
      outcome will be the severity of IBS symptoms, and secondary effectiveness outcomes include&#xD;
      microbiome analysis, quality of life, anxiety and depression symptoms, perceived stress,&#xD;
      fatigue, and severity of somatic symptoms. Microbiome composition will be measured using&#xD;
      shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Microbiome sequences will be analyzed for alpha diversity,&#xD;
      beta diversity, species composition, functional composition and biomarker discovery. To&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of each intervention, recruitment and attrition rates, adherence,&#xD;
      program preferences and satisfaction, and adverse event outcomes will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Study Aim. This study will explore the feasibility and effectiveness of a yoga program for&#xD;
      patients with IBS. Objective. Examine the feasibility and effectiveness of an 8-week online&#xD;
      live facilitator-led yoga program compared to a wait-list control. Hypothesis. Yoga delivered&#xD;
      online live by a facilitator will have the superior effectiveness in reducing IBS symptoms&#xD;
      compared to advice only control group after 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBS is a highly prevalent disorder affecting 12% of Canadians. One in five individuals with&#xD;
      IBS has one or more psychiatric disorder, and 50% have at least one comorbid somatic symptom.&#xD;
      Frequently used therapies are targeted toward symptom reduction with modest benefits, whereas&#xD;
      treatments with greater therapeutic effect may be associated with side effects. This leaves&#xD;
      many patients dissatisfied with their symptom management, resulting in half of patients using&#xD;
      alternative therapies. The underlying cause of IBS is likely multifactorial and the interplay&#xD;
      of the brain-gut axis in the pathophysiology of IBS has been well established. An altered&#xD;
      stress response, arising through either psychological and/or physiological mechanisms is&#xD;
      hypothesized to be involved in the impairment of the signalling between the brain and the&#xD;
      gut. This demonstrates a connection between gut function, stress, and psychological&#xD;
      processes. Therefore, therapies that focus on mind-body interactions and stress reduction,&#xD;
      may be useful adjunctive treatments for IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yoga is a traditional &quot;mind-body-breath&quot; discipline that includes yogic postures, structured&#xD;
      breathing, and meditation. Several potential mechanisms for the effectiveness of yoga that&#xD;
      have applicability to IBS have been proposed, including reducing the upregulated sympathetic&#xD;
      activity and increasing the parasympathetic response. The investigator's recent review of the&#xD;
      literature has identified four randomized controlled trials that examined traditional yoga&#xD;
      practice as therapy for adult IBS patients. All trials found yoga as more effective compared&#xD;
      to pharmacological treatment, and equally effective as dietary interventions or&#xD;
      moderate-intensity walking. Both physical (IBS symptom severity, gastric motility, autonomic&#xD;
      and somatic symptom scores, physical functioning) and mental (depression, anxiety,&#xD;
      GI-specific anxiety, and QOL) improvements were seen. The current literature supports that&#xD;
      yoga is effective, safe and it may target multiple mechanisms involved in the treatment of&#xD;
      IBS symptoms as previously described. Although yoga is effective in managing IBS symptoms,&#xD;
      further research is needed to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of yoga as a&#xD;
      therapeutic option in clinical practice for patients with IBS, while also examining delivery&#xD;
      strategies (face-to-face vs. online) to more optimally understand how to sequence therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions and whether this improves initiation and adherence to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design. Superiority trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment. Potential participants will be identified through several avenues, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gastroenterologists will screen IBS patients using the study eligibility criteria and&#xD;
           following the patient's verbal consent, will share the patient's contact information&#xD;
           with the study coordinator. Patients have previously given verbal permission at the&#xD;
           clinic to their gastroenterologist to be asked to participate in research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-referral through poster advertising in the GI clinics at Foothills and South Health&#xD;
           Campus. In addition, the study will be advertised on the Faculty of Medicine TVs on the&#xD;
           Foothills campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IMAGINE (Inflammation, Microbiome and Alimentation Gastro-intestinal and&#xD;
           Neuropsychiatric Effects) cohort study at the University of Calgary: The IMAGINE study&#xD;
           will send an initial email to all its IBS patients who have consented to be contacted&#xD;
           for future studies. This email will explain the current study and connect interested&#xD;
           participants with the study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Self-referral through the Primary Care Networks (PCNs) in Calgary. Primary care&#xD;
           physicians and/or dieticians (depending on the PCN clinic) will inform their IBS&#xD;
           patients of the study and provide the patient with a brochure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Through the use of a privately owned Facebook group called 'Low FODMAP Canadians', a&#xD;
           group managed by two Canadian dieticians Lauren Renlund, MPH, RD and Audrey Inouye, RD.&#xD;
           This group has over 2.1K members who have IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Participants who indicated interest in this study in a previous survey (REB19-1456) and&#xD;
           have given their consent to be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening. Consented participants will complete a mental health evaluation using the Patient&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Individuals who score 20 points or higher on the PHQ-9&#xD;
      indicating sever depression will not be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. Participants will be assigned randomly using the REDCap randomization module to&#xD;
      either (a) a yoga intervention delivered online led by a yoga facilitator or (b) a advice&#xD;
      only control group. The intervention group will receive a yoga program described below called&#xD;
      Upa Yoga, including yoga Namaskar, Nadi Shuddi (alternate nostril breathing), mantra&#xD;
      meditation, and breath watching. The intervention was developed in keeping with the ancient&#xD;
      principles of Hatha Yoga and delivered by a trained yoga facilitator from the Isha Yoga&#xD;
      Institute of Inner Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Yoga Namaskar activates the lumbar region of the spine and strengthens the core muscles.&#xD;
           This set of practices involves a series of 7 steps including stretching, squatting and&#xD;
           structured breathing sequences which will take 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nadi Shuddhi or alternate nostril breathing helps to bring balance between activity and&#xD;
           emotion. Participants will sit in a cross-legged posture with the spine comfortably&#xD;
           erect, eyes closed with the left hand laced in the middle of the lap, palm facing&#xD;
           upwards, and the ring and index finger will be used to block one nostril while inhaling&#xD;
           and exhaling through the other. This practice takes a minimum of 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mantra Meditation. In the yogic culture, the entire existence is seen as a web of sounds&#xD;
           or vibrations, for which the root sounds are &quot;Aa, Oo, and Mm&quot;. These three sounds are&#xD;
           referred to as universal sounds. This mantra, Aum, facilitates energy flow, and through&#xD;
           vibratory mechanisms, has been demonstrated to create peace and harmony. This will be&#xD;
           practiced for 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath Watching. The science of breath watching in the yogic literature, employs the&#xD;
           following principle: a certain thought, emotion or change in the physical body might&#xD;
           change the breath flow. Similarly, the converse of principle is true, in that breathing&#xD;
           in a structured manner can be used as a tool to bring positive changes to the&#xD;
           practioners' mind, body and emotions. The practioners will assume a specific&#xD;
           cross-legged physical posture, and practice breath watching as guided by the yoga&#xD;
           instructor for 3-5-minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Yoga program. Participants will be asked to practice the yoga program daily at home&#xD;
      and will be given access to the yoga videos hosted on the University of Calgary study&#xD;
      website, as well as written program instructions, and frequently answered questions (Appendix&#xD;
      A). A brief description of the video content will be provided to inform the participant of&#xD;
      its content and length. Additional website content will include study information, study&#xD;
      schedule, and contact information, as well as a pre-recorded educational session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the daily program describe above, the facilitator-led intervention will be&#xD;
      delivered online by a certified yoga facilitator using the Microsoft Teams platform.&#xD;
      Participants in group of 3 to 5 will be collated to enhance effectiveness of the study&#xD;
      processes. Our team has experience with this approach, as this strategy is currently used&#xD;
      with previous yoga study. Yoga classes will be held once per week for 8 weeks, with the first&#xD;
      session lasting approximately 1.5 hours and subsequent sessions up to 60 minutes. The total&#xD;
      allocated time for the introductory session will include the class set-up, introductions,&#xD;
      educational material (please see below), overview of practices, teaching of practices,&#xD;
      practice corrections/enhancements, modifications, and practice expectations. Each follow-up&#xD;
      class will include review from the previous week, questions and answers, individual&#xD;
      corrections and/or modifications. For individual corrections, the yoga facilitator will ask&#xD;
      the participant to do the practices and receive corrections, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2. Advice-only control group. This group will receive general education on IBS, the&#xD;
      mind and gut connection, and the role of mind-body therapies in the management of IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational Material. The intervention group will receive educational material consisting of&#xD;
      information on IBS, why yoga may improve IBS symptoms and quality of life, and&#xD;
      self-compassion (Appendix B) during their first online session delivered by the study&#xD;
      coordinator and yoga facilitator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will orient each participant to the study, guide group 1 participants&#xD;
      through expectations of the class, answer any study-related questions for the duration of the&#xD;
      study. A study schedule will be provided to participants at the start of the study (Appendix&#xD;
      C). The yoga facilitator will act as a point of contact to answer any questions related to&#xD;
      the yoga program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practice Modifications. Intervention participants will receive modifications from the yoga&#xD;
      facilitator for common challenges encountered by yoga practitioners to support optimal&#xD;
      practices. Modifications will be provided in the online sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up. Yoga practice maintenance will be evaluated long-term. Intervention&#xD;
      participants will be asked to report the average frequency (i.e., days per month) and length&#xD;
      (i.e., minutes) of their yoga practices over the last 7 days at 6 months post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility outcomes. To determine the feasibility of each intervention, the following&#xD;
      outcomes will be evaluated: recruitment and attrition rates, adherence, and satisfaction, and&#xD;
      adverse event outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. 25 participants per group (mean difference of at least 83 points on the&#xD;
      IBS-Symptom Severity Scale; ⍺=0.05, β=0.80, SD=103.8, ∆=83)35. Assuming a 20% attrition rate,&#xD;
      we will aim to recruit 30 individuals per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis. Descriptive analysis will summarize participant characteristics and&#xD;
      feasibility outcomes. Independent sample t-tests will examine baseline differences between&#xD;
      groups and chi-squared tests will examine proportion differences. Repeated measures ANOVA&#xD;
      will examine the main effect of treatment condition and interactions of group assignment by&#xD;
      time on effectiveness outcome measures. An alpha of 0.05 will be set a priori and used as a&#xD;
      threshold for determining statistical significance. Analysis will be conducted using SPSS&#xD;
      version 24.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For microbiome sequencing data quality control of raw FASTQ files will be performed, prior to&#xD;
      ML analysis, to obtain high-quality non-host (HQNH) reads. Reads of sufficient quality will&#xD;
      be mapped using MetaPhlAn2 and HUMAnN2 to obtain high-resolution taxonomic and functional&#xD;
      abundance profiles that include read counts. Unsupervised learning strategy based on robust&#xD;
      PCA will be used to explore the major variability in the data and to detect outliers. We will&#xD;
      also perform KEGG annotations and functional diversity profiling and will use web-based tools&#xD;
      to assign metagenomic results into different functional groups.&#xD;
