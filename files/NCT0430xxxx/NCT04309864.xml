  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For Veterans with spinal cord injury who use a wheelchair, pressure injuries related to&#xD;
      sitting are a significant daily threat to well-being. Pressure injuries are costly to treat,&#xD;
      negatively impact quality of life and community participation, and can be life threatening.&#xD;
      Moving or shifting at regular intervals in the wheelchair redistributes harmful pressure and&#xD;
      reduce risk for skin breakdown, yet these movements are a challenge to perform consistently.&#xD;
      The challenge exists due to lack of sensation to let the individual know they need to shift&#xD;
      their weight. Pressure mapping provides a detailed visual representation of pressure&#xD;
      distribution and can compensate for impaired sensation. Pressure mapping feedback delivered&#xD;
      on-demand on mobile platforms can potentially increase effectiveness in carrying out&#xD;
      behaviors to reduce risk for pressure injury when used during clinician-delivered education&#xD;
      to set goals and monitor progress and when used at home as a self-management strategy.&#xD;

      Objectives: The long-term goal of this project is to improve the effectiveness of pressure&#xD;
      injury prevention education by clinicians and self-management by Veterans with spinal cord&#xD;
      injury (SCI) through a methodical development and testing of a mobile platform based pressure&#xD;
      mapping system called &quot;Comprehensive Mobile Assessment of Pressure&quot; (CMAP). The targeted&#xD;
      risk-reduction behavior in this project is the effective use of weight shifts when sitting in&#xD;
      a wheelchair by improving consistency, frequency, duration, and quality of movements to&#xD;
      redistribute pressure. CMAP provides visual cues as well as individually customizable&#xD;
      reminders that are designed to compensate for the lack of sensation that prevents the use of&#xD;
      natural cues to redistribute pressure, by wheelchair users. An updated CMAP system will serve&#xD;
      two important objectives: 1) assist clinicians in assessment, individualized goal-setting,&#xD;
      and monitoring the Veteran with SCI's progress toward pressure injury prevention behavior&#xD;
      goals while in the hospital setting; and 2) assist clinicians with individualized setup and&#xD;
      education of the Veteran with SCI for using the CMAP system in the home setting as a&#xD;
      self-management strategy for pressure injury prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The specific aims of this study include: 1a) hardware expansion to improve&#xD;
      functionality of the CMAP system to add a docking and charging station and use of CMAP on a&#xD;
      smartwatch based on Veteran preferences and 1b) software expansion to enhance clinical&#xD;
      education for pressure injury prevention education, with requirements provided by clinicians;&#xD;
      2) determine usability of the refined CMAP system when it is integrated into patient&#xD;
      education for Veteran's with acute SCI during their inpatient rehabilitation stay, and 3) a&#xD;
      determine usability and efficacy of the refined CMAP system for clinician-delivered pressure&#xD;
      injury prevention education, followed by Veteran use of CMAP in their daily routines at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This four-year study will have multiple stages and will use a mixed methods&#xD;
      approach that includes iterative focus groups and interviews with Veterans who have SCI and&#xD;
      with clinicians who provide pressure injury prevention education to Veterans with SCI;&#xD;
      self-efficacy and usability surveys for both Veterans and clinicians; pilot testing of CMAP&#xD;
      during inpatient rehabilitation and testing during outpatient visits. Repeated measures will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate changes within subject for completion of weight shifts while using CMAP,&#xD;
      compared to periods when not using CMAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: During the first two years, improvements to CMAP hardware and software will be&#xD;
      guided by experience-based design guided requirements learned about through iterative focus&#xD;
      groups including Veterans with SCI/D (n=10) and clinicians (n=10). Usability will be measured&#xD;
      at each iteration of development using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the User&#xD;
      Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). The focus groups will be repeated to ensure alignment between&#xD;
      development progress and the requirements identified by the focus groups. During the&#xD;
      inpatient pilot test, clinician (n=3) and Veteran (n=6) self-efficacy will be measured.&#xD;
      Veterans will complete selected sub-scales from the Skin Care Belief Scale and clinicians&#xD;
      will answer survey questions developed specifically around providing education for performing&#xD;
      weight shifts effectively. Veteran progress toward weight shift goals will be measured&#xD;
      through performance monitoring within the CMAP app; Actual performance will be assessed&#xD;
      against the individualized goals set by the clinician. During the outpatient testing,&#xD;
      Veterans (n=20) will use CMAP at home for 2 weeks after receiving education and&#xD;
      individualized goals for weight shift performance by clinicians. While at home, trunk&#xD;
      movements will be monitored via actigraphy to monitor weight shift frequency to compare to&#xD;
      baseline trunk movement data, weight shift performance data within CMAP app, and finally,&#xD;
      compared with individualized goals for performing weight shifts. Self efficacy and usability&#xD;
      (SUS and UEQ) of the overall system in both settings will be measured.&#xD;
