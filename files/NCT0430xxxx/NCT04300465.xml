  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MySláinte is a 12-week community-based, multi-disciplinary preventive and lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention program to reduce CVD risk factors. It includes weekly exercise classes with&#xD;
      educational workshops on understanding lifestyle risk factors as well as optimisation of&#xD;
      cardiovascular medications. It will be delivered by a multidisciplinary team including: a&#xD;
      nurse, dietician, physiotherapist and physician and builds on the previously developed&#xD;
      protocols of the successful MyAction program. The MySlainte study aims to expand on the&#xD;
      MyAction program by looking at a broader range of patients with chronic disease who have&#xD;
      suboptimal lifestyle drivers for many preventable diseases. Importantly, MySlainte also aims&#xD;
      to assess if there is a difference in outcome between those who complete the program with&#xD;
      their partner compared to those who complete the program alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic diseases in Ireland is increasing and places significant burden&#xD;
      both on the individual and family unit, but also on an already overstretched healthcare&#xD;
      system. Many chronic diseases are preventable and frequently share common risk factor and&#xD;
      unhealthy lifestyle profiles; which offers a unique opportunity to intervene, address and&#xD;
      modify these common disease drivers, and potentially prevent disease complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MyAction program and previous similar programs have successfully been run by Croí/NIPC&#xD;
      (based in Galway, www.nipc.ie) in an effort to combat common cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
      These programs have demonstrated that addressing and modifying risk factors is both effective&#xD;
      and sustainable. Expanding programs like these to a broader group of chronic disease patients&#xD;
      with overlapping modifiable risks could lead to multi-factorial benefits: prevention is&#xD;
      better than cure. While cardiac and pulmonary rehab are well established programs, patients&#xD;
      with other chronic diseases do not currently have access to such focused interventions in&#xD;
      Galway. Chronic kidney disease and rheumatoid arthritis are two such chronic diseases that&#xD;
      have a particularly high cardiovascular risk burden, and so may benefit from a focused&#xD;
      intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem with an estimated prevalence of&#xD;
      11.8% in Ireland. With chronic kidney disease comes a myriad of other co-morbidities and&#xD;
      increased rate of all-cause mortality. Significantly, cardiovascular disease is the primary&#xD;
      contributor to increased morbidity and mortality in this patient cohort. In fact, in patients&#xD;
      with Stage 3 CKD, the incidence of cardiovascular mortality is higher than the incidence of&#xD;
      kidney failure. This makes prevention of drivers of cardiovascular disease a key component in&#xD;
      managing these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle and exercise programs may have an even broader range of benefit in this patient&#xD;
      group. Through inflammation, uremic toxins, and dysregulation of key proteins and hormones a&#xD;
      second major consequence of CKD is sarcopenia and skeletal muscle dysfunction. This is&#xD;
      compounded by the fact that physical activity in all stages of CKD are low, which leads to&#xD;
      decreased quality of life, increased falls risk and associated morbidity. Previous programs&#xD;
      have demonstrated the benefits of exercise in this group. The MySláinte program aims to build&#xD;
      on this by tackling a broader range of modifiable risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, patients with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease due to a complex interplay between systemic inflammation and a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      traditional CVD risk factors. Despite recommendations by European League against Rheumatism&#xD;
      (EULAR) of the importance of emphasising positive lifestyle choices, a recently published&#xD;
      article by Malm concluded that discussions regarding lifestyle improvements (including&#xD;
      exercise, smoking, drinking and diet) are suboptimal in these patients. Exercise programs&#xD;
      have also been shown to be of benefit in these patient groups in decreasing falls rates, as&#xD;
      well as improving health related quality of life measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has previously been described that a concordance of behavioural risk factors exists&#xD;
      between patients with coronary artery disease and their spouses. Similarly, spouses of&#xD;
      patients with hypertension have increased odds of hypertension themselves. The same is seen&#xD;
      in patients with type 2 diabetes, with spouses of patients with type 2 diabetes having a&#xD;
      higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In keeping with that, it has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that including both patients and their partners in lifestyle intervention programs improves&#xD;
      not only the patients risk factor profile, but also that of the partners. It has also been&#xD;
      suggested that couples who complete programs together may in fact do better than those who&#xD;
      enter as individuals. Interestingly, even when lifestyle interventions are aimed only at a&#xD;
      patient, spouses have shown to benefit indirectly from such programs in a knock on effect&#xD;
      termed the &quot;ripple effect&quot;. These concepts highlight the importance of considering a&#xD;
      patient's support network when undergoing a lifestyle intervention. They also highlight a&#xD;
      potentially unique opportunity to improve the lifestyles, and hence risk factor profiles, of&#xD;
      entire households. Previously, the MyAction program had invited participants to bring their&#xD;
      partners to the program. Unfortunately, due to funding issues, this part of the program was&#xD;
      gradually phased out. However, the impact of removing partners form the program was never&#xD;
      evaluated. The investigators of this study aim to evaluate this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, for the MYSLAINTE study, the investigators aim to include patients with stable&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis and stable 3 or 4 CKD with 2 or more defined uncontrolled cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors. In order to enter the study, each patient must also have a partner who is&#xD;
      willing to take part. Each partner/patient pair will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio into one of&#xD;
      two groups: with partner or without partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With partner: the patient and their partner will undergo an initial assessment (week 1),&#xD;
           a 10 week intervention program (weeks 2-11) and then an end of program assessment (week&#xD;
           12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Without partner: Both the patient and their partner will undergo an initial assessment&#xD;
           (week 1) and end of program assessment (week 12) However, only the patient will undergo&#xD;
           the 10 week intervention program. The patients partner will receive usual care from&#xD;
           their GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention phase is part of the MySláinte program and involves, a weekly 1 hour group&#xD;
      supervised exercise session, a weekly 1 hour group health promotion workshop, weekly&#xD;
      individualised goal setting, weekly individualised exercise prescription and optimisation of&#xD;
      cardioprotective medications. This is all run over a 10 week period and delivered in a&#xD;
      community setting by a multidisciplinary team including: a physiotherapist, a dietitian, a&#xD;
      nurse specialist and physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to assess if the 10 week intervention can improve modifiable&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors in these patients and their partners. A secondary aim of the&#xD;
      study is to assess the impact of simultaneously including a partner in this lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention program.&#xD;
