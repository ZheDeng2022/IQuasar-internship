  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: In people concerned by serious illness, how to anticipate the aggravation of the&#xD;
      disease according to the patient's preferences is a challenging clinical question and an&#xD;
      ethical key-issue to improve end-of-life care and quality of dying in France. When end of&#xD;
      life decision occurs, many patients can no longer express themselves and advance directives&#xD;
      do not seem to be appropriate for many patients despite the current strong incentives to&#xD;
      write them, reinforced by the 2016 Claeys Leonetti.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;End-of-Life Discussions&quot; and &quot;Advance care planning&quot; programs developed in the United&#xD;
      States have shown a positive impact on the aggressiveness of end-of-life care. The&#xD;
      implementation in France of these programs has not yet been consolidated despite a first&#xD;
      recommendation for &quot;Planification des soins futurs&quot;, published by the French Health&#xD;
      Authority(HAS). Inspired by the definition given in the later document, investigators propose&#xD;
      the acronym DDA, for the Discussions Dedicated to Anticipate wishes and preferences in the&#xD;
      event of Aggravation, defined as the dynamic and evolving process of reflection and&#xD;
      communication between the patient, his relatives and healthcare professionals, allowing him&#xD;
      to address his preferences and wishes regarding his care and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this observational study is to characterize, in a population of patients&#xD;
      with advanced cancer, the profile of those who take up a proposal for Dedicated Discussions&#xD;
      on Anticipating preferences of care in the event of Aggravation (DDA) and who engage in the&#xD;
      discussion process. Secondary objectives are to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. evaluate the aggressiveness of end-of-life care in the group of patients who died 1 year&#xD;
           after their inclusion, depending on their engagement in DDA occurs and whether or not&#xD;
           their preferences are formalized; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. evaluate the subjective effects of the DDA with the patient and the investigating&#xD;
           professionals, through qualitative approach by a clinical psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: investigators designed a mixed, quantitative and qualitative prospective, monocenter&#xD;
      methodology to evaluate how patients take up a proposal of DDA. This proposal consists in 2&#xD;
      interviews: the first one is dedicated to the assessment of the patient's wishes in terms of&#xD;
      information and participation in decision-making (API questionnaire) and to the assessment of&#xD;
      the degree of anxiety and depression (HADS questionnaire) (E1). The second one is conducted 1&#xD;
      to 4 weeks later and consists in offering and initiating DDA (E2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative outcome evaluated will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the documentation by a physician in the medical record, of patient's care&#xD;
           preferences/values&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the documentation by the patient of his care preference/values, either by designation of&#xD;
           surrogate or by writing advanced directives&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the usefulness and necessity of this approach, and the anxiety it generated, as&#xD;
           perceived by the patient The qualitative assessment will be based on data collected&#xD;
           during E1 and E2, and for 20 patients, during a clinical interview with a psychologist&#xD;
           dedicated to collecting the patient's impressions of previous interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to this study investigators expect to gather some data on the desire and feelings of&#xD;
      cancer patients to engage in a DDA process and possibly formalize their end-of-life&#xD;
      preferences, the impact of DDAs on care pathway indicators and the psychological effect for&#xD;
      the patient with severe disease to project himself in advance into aggravation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These expected results will provide a better understanding of the process of anticipating&#xD;
      end-of-life situations, which is needed to improve quality of care and end-of-life&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the United States, the respect of patient's autonomy was early considered in 1990 by the&#xD;
      Patient Self Determination Act, which stated that all persons entering a publicly funded&#xD;
      health care facility had to be informed of their rights to formulate living wills. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      tools have been developed to evaluate patients' expectations regarding information and&#xD;
      participation in medical decision-making, e.g. the Autonomy Preference Index (API), initially&#xD;
      conceived for general practice [Ende J 1989]. Since then, &quot;End-of-Life Discussions&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;Advance care planning&quot; programs have shown a positive impact on the aggressiveness of&#xD;
      end-of-life care [Wright 2008, Mack 2012, Dow 2009]. However, some other studies have also&#xD;
      suggested that patients in situations of real worsening would be less likely to seek&#xD;
      prognostic information and could be unsettled by these programs [Michael 2013; Maciejewski&#xD;
      2013].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, the right to designate a &quot;durable power of attorney for health care&quot; (fr.&#xD;
      &quot;Personne de Confiance&quot; (PC)) dates back to 2002, and the right to formulate &quot;living wills&quot;&#xD;
      (fr. &quot;Directives Anticipées&quot; (DA)) concerning end-of-life care was first introduced by law in&#xD;
      2005 and their importance was reinforced in 2016. Recently, investigators established the&#xD;
      validity and reliability of the French version of the API among patients with incurable&#xD;
      cancer and in primary care setting. They found high patient expectations for information on&#xD;
      their health status but a more variable desire to be involved in medical decisions. Three&#xD;
      supplementary items were added specifically to evaluate incurable cancer patients' attitude&#xD;
      towards anticipating their preference of care in the event of worsening health status. These&#xD;
      suggested that anticipating may be for patients a specific dimension, not correlated with&#xD;
      those of information and participation in decision making. Other French surveys show the low&#xD;
      appropriation of PC and DA and suggest that DAs are not necessarily appropriate for all&#xD;
      patients, despite the strong current incentives to write them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation in France of &quot;Advance care planning&quot; programs has not yet been&#xD;
      consolidated despite a first recommendation for &quot;Planification des soins futurs&quot;, published&#xD;
      by the HAS (French Health Authority). Inspired by the definition given in the later document,&#xD;
      we propose the acronym DDA, for the Discussions Dedicated to Anticipate wishes and&#xD;
      preferences in the event of Aggravation, defined as the dynamic and evolving process of&#xD;
      reflection and communication between the patient, his relatives and healthcare professionals,&#xD;
      allowing him to address his preferences and wishes regarding his care and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that the strictly numerical objective of writing living wills or designating a PC&#xD;
      is not a relevant indicator of quality of care, investigators rather aim to get a better&#xD;
      understanding of the process of DDA, assuming that this process would contribute to improve&#xD;
      quality of care at the end-of-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this observational study is to characterize, in a population of patients&#xD;
      with advanced cancer, the profile of those who take up a proposal for Dedicated Discussions&#xD;
      on Anticipating preferences of care in the event of Aggravation (DDA) and who engage in the&#xD;
      discussion process. Secondary objectives are to 1) evaluate the aggressiveness of end-of-life&#xD;
      care in the group of patients who died 1 year after their inclusion, depending on their&#xD;
      engagement in DDA occurs and whether or not their preferences are formalized; and 2) evaluate&#xD;
      the subjective effects of the DDA with the patient and the investigating professionals,&#xD;
      through qualitative approach by a clinical psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of 240 patients with advanced metastatic cancer recruited in the oncology department&#xD;
      of a university hospital, the mixed method of evaluation consists in :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collecting their preferences thanks to the API, along with their degree of&#xD;
           anxiety/depression (HADS scale) (interview E1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  initiating DDA (interview E2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collecting their evaluation of E2 by quantitative criteria (self-reported anxiety,&#xD;
           perceived usefulness,…) and their qualitative subjective impressions on E1 and E2 (by&#xD;
           clinical psychologist in a subgroup of 20 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  following up their engagement in the DDA process and its impact on healthcare resource&#xD;
           use in the last month of life (quantitative outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative outcomes evaluated were inspired by the results of the consensus work published&#xD;
      by Sudore and al, on outcomes design to evaluate success of Advance Care Planning. There will&#xD;
      be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the documentation by a physician in the medical record, of patient's care&#xD;
           preferences/values&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the documentation by the patient of his care preference/values, either by designation of&#xD;
           surrogate or by writing advanced directives&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the usefulness and necessity of this approach, and the anxiety it generated, as&#xD;
           perceived by the patient The qualitative assessment will be based on data collected&#xD;
           during E1 and E2, and for 20 patients, during a clinical interview with a psychologist&#xD;
           dedicated to collecting the patient's impressions of previous interviews.&#xD;
