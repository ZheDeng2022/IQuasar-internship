  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of food allergies has increased in recent decades, ranging from 1 to 3% of the&#xD;
      general population. According to international literature and French national surveys, nuts&#xD;
      today represent a group of allergens often associated with severe allergic reactions. They&#xD;
      are responsible for 18 to 40% of deaths from food-related anaphylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among all nuts, the prevalence of anacardiac allergies (mainly cashew and pistachio)&#xD;
      continues to increase and has become a growing public health problem. Today, global&#xD;
      production is estimated at 4.9 million tonnes of cashews and 1.1 million tonnes of&#xD;
      pistachios. The resulting increased exposure may explain the increased prevalence of allergic&#xD;
      reactions reported to these fruits. In addition, anaphylactic reactions to anacardiaceae are&#xD;
      reported to be even more severe than those occurring in subjects allergic to peanuts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cashews and pistachios are known to exhibit immunological cross-reactions with one another.&#xD;
      In fact, they have a strong sequential homology between their storage allergens Ana o 1 / Pis&#xD;
      v 3 (7S vicilin, 78% homology); Ana o 2 / Pis v 2 (legume 11S, 80% homology) and Ana o 3 /&#xD;
      Pis v 1 (albumin 2S, 70% homology). For this reason, some authors talk about the cashew /&#xD;
      pistachio syndrome and associate the two allergenic sources by considering them as one, in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of allergy to nuts, and therefore to anacardiaceae, is based on a compatible&#xD;
      clinical history, the presence of specific IgE (demonstrated by positivity to realistic skin&#xD;
      tests and serum IgE assay), and positivity on the oral food challenge test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, taking into account the cashew / pistachio syndrome, when the allergy&#xD;
      work-up for cashew is negative, allergists tend to advise to reintroduce pistachio at home,&#xD;
      considering the two allergens as sufficiently homologous to authorize such a practice. In&#xD;
      this context, the investigators decided to check whether this practice, which is based mainly&#xD;
      on in vitro homologies, is risk-free, based on the clinical experience of our center.&#xD;
