  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic constipation is a prevalent, multifactorial gastrointestinal disorder, and its&#xD;
      etiology and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. Recently studies using 16S rRNA-based&#xD;
      microbiota profiling have demonstrated dysbiosis of gut microbiota in chronic constipation.&#xD;
      In addition, alterations of fecal flora of the a group of severely constipated patients had&#xD;
      been reported. Constipation, an indicator of gut dysbiosis in dialysis patients, may also&#xD;
      pose a greater burden in dialysis patients. Some recent findings highlight the plausible link&#xD;
      between the gut and the kidneys and provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      kidney disease progression and development of cardiovascular disease. Yet, the constipation&#xD;
      in dialysis patients is usually ignored and not even draw the attention of dialysis physician&#xD;
      as an ominous risk factor of constipated dialysis patients. In view of multiple factors link&#xD;
      the gut and cardiorenal pathophysiology, and the scarcity of literature on this issue, the&#xD;
      aim of this study is want to know if constipation can result in any changes to the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota and is it associated with inflammation, atherogenic profile and levels of&#xD;
      microbial derived uremic toxins. Here, the investigators use both self-reported Bristol stool&#xD;
      form scale (BSFS) scores and Roman IV criteria to diagnose constipation and 16S rDNA Illumina&#xD;
      amplicon profiles of faecal samples of 90 dialysis patients to assess potential associations&#xD;
      between microbiota composition and constipation. The relationship between uremic toxins and&#xD;
      inflammation will also be explored in the dialysis suffering from constipation.&#xD;

      Study Design and Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 90 dialysis patients. Patients over age 20 years old and undergoing&#xD;
      HD for at least 6 months will be enrolled. Patients with inflammatory diseases, cancer, AIDS,&#xD;
      autoimmune disease, use of a central catheter for hemodialysis access, amputated limbs,&#xD;
      pregnancy, and patients using catabolic drugs, antioxidant vitamin supplements pre, pro and&#xD;
      symbiotic and antibiotics in the last 3 months before the start of this study were excluded.&#xD;
      Dialysis duration was 4 hours per session, three times per week, with a blood flow &gt;250&#xD;
      mL/min and a dialysate flow of 500 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic Procedures and Sample Processing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn from each subject in the morning, after overnight fasting (for HD&#xD;
      patients before a regular HD session). Plasma was separated (15 minutes, 30003 g, 4 C) and&#xD;
      stored in -80 C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total concentrations of uremic toxins indoxyl sulfate(IS), p-cresol sulfate(PCS), and&#xD;
      indoleacetic acid( IAA) are quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with&#xD;
      fluorescent detection.. Briefly, for binding competition, 200μl serum to which we added 20μl&#xD;
      0.50mM 1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (internal standard) was vortex-mixed with 250μl 0.24M&#xD;
      sodium octanoate (binding competitor).After incubation at room temperature for 5min, we added&#xD;
      2ml cold acetone to precipitate proteins. Following vortex-mixing and centrifuging at 4 ◦C,&#xD;
      1860×g for 20 min, the supernatant was transferred to 12mm×100mm, GL 14 glass test tubes and&#xD;
      2ml dichloromethane was added. After vortex-mixing and centrifuging at 4 ◦C, 1860×g for&#xD;
      10min, 200μl of the upper layer was transferred to glass autosampler vials, followed by&#xD;
      addition of 20μl 1M HCl and 15μl was injected onto the HPLC. The HPLC analysis was performed&#xD;
      on an Agilent 1100 series LC (Santa Clara, CA),and Agilent ChemStations software were used&#xD;
      for the chromatographic analysis. The separation was carried out on a ZORBAX SB-C18 Solv&#xD;
      Saver Plus HPLC column (5 μm, 3.0 mm×150 mm).at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Mobile phase A is&#xD;
      0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in Milli-Q water and mobile phase B is 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in&#xD;
      acetonitrile. The analytical method consists of an isocratic run with 92% mobile phase A for&#xD;
      23 min.. Each analytical run was followed by a 1.3 min washout gradient to 100% B. Column&#xD;
      temperature was 25 ◦C, and autosampler tray temperature was 6 ◦C. We quantified the analytes&#xD;
      by using the analyte to standard peak area ratio on a Agilent 1100 High Performance&#xD;
      Fluorescence detector G1321A and Agilent 1100 Series UV-Visible detectors G1314A. Detector&#xD;
      settings were λex 260 nm/λem288nm for p-cresyl sulfate and λex 280 nm/λem 390nm for indoxyl&#xD;
      sulfate and IAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total antioxidant activity (TAA) is measured in plasma using the Antioxidant Status Assay Kit&#xD;
      (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The assay is&#xD;
      defined as the ability of antioxidants in the plasma samples to prevent oxidation of&#xD;
      2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) by metmyoglobin. The amount of&#xD;
      ABTS+ produced is monitored by reading the absorbance at 600 nm. The inter- and intra-assay&#xD;
      coefficients of variation are 5.0% and 4.3%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-sensitivity protein C reactive (CRP), interleukin- 6 (IL-6), MCP-1, and Calprotectin&#xD;
      were analyzed by immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA; R&amp;D systems ). Routine laboratory parameters&#xD;
      were measured by standard techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) kits purchased from Randox Laboratories Ltd. (Crumlin, UK) are&#xD;
      applied for the assessment of the overall serum antioxidant capacity. It is based on the&#xD;
      suppression of the formation of 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate; ABTS*+),&#xD;
      mediated mainly by the subsequent antioxidants: uric acid, protein thiol groups, ascorbic&#xD;
      acid, and tocopherol. The plasma levels of MCP-1, IL-6, CRP, IL-17A and calprotectin are&#xD;
      tested by commercially available human ELISA kit respectively, according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool DNA Isolation and 16S rRNA Gene Amplicon Sequencing&#xD;
&#xD;
      QI Aamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (51504; Qiagen, Germantown, MD) is used to extract gDNA from&#xD;
      freshly collected feces samples from both mouse strains. The 16S rRNA gene variable regions&#xD;
      V3-V6 are amplified by PCR using fecal gDNA. PCR comprised two consecutive steps. Primers&#xD;
      targeting the 16S rRNA gene (italic) and specific primers carrying the 59M13/rM13 adapters&#xD;
      (bold) 338FM13 (GTAAACGACGGCCAGTGCTCCTACGGGWGGCAGCAGT) and 1044R-rM13&#xD;
      (GGAAACAGCTATGACCATGACTACGCGCTGACGACARCCATG) are used to amplify the V3-V6 region of the&#xD;
      bacterial 16S rRNA gene. After purification of PCR products using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR&#xD;
      Clean-Up Kit per the manufacturer's instructions, concentration and quality of the purified&#xD;
      PCR products are assessed. To barcode each PCR product with a specific MID sequence and add&#xD;
      the 454-specific Lib-L tag, a second PCR was performed using M13/rM13-specific primers&#xD;
      containing the 454-specific Lib-L primers (underlined) A-M13 (CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG&#xD;
      / MIDsequence/GTAAACGACGGCCAGG) and B-rM13 (CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGGGAAACAGCTATGA&#xD;
      CCATGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amplicons of the second PCR were pooled and purified by ethanol precipitation. Purified PCR&#xD;
      products are run on a 0.8% agarose gel, bands corresponding to the barcoded 16S rRNA gene&#xD;
      sequences are excised, and DNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-Up Kit.&#xD;
      DNA is eluted in ddH2O, further purified using AMPure Beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea,&#xD;
      CA), and finally, resuspended in ddH2O. Concentration and quality of the purified barcoded&#xD;
      sequences are assessed using a Nanodrop (Peqlab Biotechnology). Samples are stored at 220°C.&#xD;
      Amplicon sequencing is performed at Eurofins on a 454 GS FLX Titanium Platform from one side&#xD;
      (Lib-L-A) according to the recommended procedures for 454 Roche (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).&#xD;
