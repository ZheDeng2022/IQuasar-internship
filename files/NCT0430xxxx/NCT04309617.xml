    <textblock>
      This study aims at estimating the proportion of patients diagnosed with locoregional renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma who are at high risk for recurrence following nephrectomy, describe referral&#xD;
      patterns, and characterize treatment in this population. Outcomes including estimation of the&#xD;
      incidence of recurrence and disease-free interval following nephrectomy will be reported&#xD;
      overall and among the subgroup off patients receiving adjuvant systemic therapy with&#xD;
      sunitinib following nephrectomy.&#xD;

          <description>In this baseline measure, participants were classified according to their TNM stage. T = size and extent of the main tumor, N = number of nearby lymph nodes that have cancer and M = whether the cancer has metastasized. There are 4 TNM stages from 1 to 4, in which participants were distributed. Stage 1 to 3 refers to cancer is present; higher the stage larger the cancer tumor and more it has spread into nearby tissues. Stage 4 refers to the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.</description>
