  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) Score to encourage physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will utilize a wearable wrist device that will provide data pertaining to&#xD;
      physical activity, to include steps taken, miles walked, heart rate, calories burned, etc.&#xD;
      The intervention group devices will also provide a visible PAI score and will be given&#xD;
      information about a PAI app they can install on their smart phone to monitor their activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control participants will be encouraged to work up to at least 10,000 steps a day, higher if&#xD;
      possible and reasonable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with a device that displays a PAI score (study participants) will be encouraged to work&#xD;
      up to and maintain the highest PAI score possible, with 100 being the ideal.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine if utilizing the PAI score as a single measure for goal setting&#xD;
      is superior to monitoring steps / distance, calories burned, and / or time in aerobic&#xD;
      activity in achieving improvements in health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will have enrolled in Corporate Wellness Program at Memorial health System&#xD;
      (MHS), and have met the inclusion criteria and consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the groups. Members from the same household&#xD;
      will be assigned to the same group together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All devices will be linked, via smart phone, to a fitness tracker app that is imbedded in the&#xD;
      MHS medical record, and has a patient access portal accessible to the patient via website or&#xD;
      app on a smart phone or tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention device will also link to a smart phone app developed by PAI that displays&#xD;
      PAI score to the participant as well as other data, to allow tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to wear their devices on at least two nights during the first&#xD;
      week, and daily while awake, except when bathing for the next 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, having enrolled in the wellness program, will already, as a part of that study,&#xD;
      have agreed to have data collected at baseline and yearly thereafter, including BMI, blood&#xD;
      pressure, resting pulse, lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c, health risk assessment survey,&#xD;
      absenteeism and health claims data at baseline and yearly thereafter. If not collected within&#xD;
      60 days, a new set of data will be collected to serve as baseline for this study.&#xD;
      Specifically for this study this data collection (including lab analysis) will also be&#xD;
      repeated at 12 weeks and 6 months. All blood draws will be done at any MHS lab, by qualified&#xD;
      phlebotomists, according to standard hospital policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be asked to work toward a goal of at least 10,000 steps a day, which&#xD;
      can be seen on their device, as well as on the accompanying app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will be encouraged to work up to and maintain the highest PAI score&#xD;
      possible, with at least 100 being the ideal. PAI will provide weekly summary data on&#xD;
      participants that will allow additional evaluation correlating level of physical activity /&#xD;
      PAI score with participant results. This data will be reported with a participant code. PAI&#xD;
      will provide a master code linking the participant code to an email address for correlation&#xD;
      of all data for analysis. This master code will be maintained on an encrypted device.&#xD;
