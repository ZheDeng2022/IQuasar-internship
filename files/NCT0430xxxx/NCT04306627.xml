  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that additive effects of combined antihypertensive medications&#xD;
      and statin in a single pill combination may better reduce progression of vascular remodeling&#xD;
      and inhibit atherosclerosis progression. The fixed association of atorvastatin, perindopril&#xD;
      and amlodipine under the name of Lipertance is the first fixed combination of these three&#xD;
      groups to control the risk factors that are hypertension and dyslipidemia which can be used&#xD;
      both in primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention .&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants with appropriately signed informed consent will be randomized to either&#xD;
      the perindopril+amlodipin or perindopril+amlodipin+atorvastatin combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be preliminary screened before 7-10 days for clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      examination to meet eligibility criteria for inclusion in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perindopril+amlodipine combination doses will be up titrated over two weeks in case of need&#xD;
      to control adequate arterial blood pressure &lt; 140/90. The 4 doses combinations and their&#xD;
      adjustments will be made by investigating physician according to guideline based treatment of&#xD;
      arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects should not previously be on statin therapy and subjects who needs to be will start&#xD;
      atorvastatin in combination treatment pill . The investigators will study the effects of&#xD;
      6-month treatment with perindopril +amlodipin+atorvastatin combination on plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Liver enzyme markers will be&#xD;
      assessed in patients on additional statin treatment on day 90 for safety assessment. All&#xD;
      participants will be followed-up for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients aged between 45 and 85 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood pressure â‰¥ 140/90 mmHg with one antihypertensive drug or 150/100 mHg for untreated&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations &gt; 2,5mm/L (without concomitant hypolipidemic&#xD;
           drugs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor apart of arterial hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  minimal thickness of intima media complex at least 0,8 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  premenopausal females with potential for pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy in&#xD;
           the previous 3 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  initiation or change in dose of statin therapy within previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anticipated change in lipid lowering therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acute coronary or cerebrovascular event within 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  previous history of side effects to RAAS inhibitors and Ca channel blocking agents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inability to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inability to undergo carotid ultrasound examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the intention-to-treat the patient population, safety will be checked by recording&#xD;
      adverse effects throughout the study: severe AEs regardless as to whether or not there is&#xD;
      causal relationship between the AEs and the study; and relevant AEs such as myalgia, cough ,&#xD;
      palpitations, peripheric edemas, diziness symptoms. When the investigators confirm these AEs,&#xD;
      the grade of severity, procedures, outcomes, and relationship to the study drug will be&#xD;
      assessed and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse event (SAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase and at any dose of the&#xD;
      investigational product that fulfills one or more of the following criteria: results in&#xD;
      death, is immediately life-threatening, requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation&#xD;
      of existing hospitalization, is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or&#xD;
      may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator must inform the Sponsor of any SAE that occurs in the course of the study&#xD;
      within 48 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid Ultrasound An ultrasound linear probe with 5-10 MHz linear transducer will be used&#xD;
      for measuring the carotid artery intima media thickness ( IMT ). The carotid artery will be&#xD;
      scanned by 3 trained in vascular ultrasound and echocardiography physicians. All study&#xD;
      subjects will be examined in the supine position with the head tilted backward. Measurements&#xD;
      of the left and right IMT of the posterior wall of the common carotid, 1 cm distal to the&#xD;
      bulb bifurcation, by ultrasound 2D exam will be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure (BP) will be measured at the University Cardiology Clinic by a trained nurse&#xD;
      or physician using a calibrated and validated digital sphygmomanometer. BP measurements will&#xD;
      be taken with the patient in a seated position with the arm supported at heart level, after a&#xD;
      5 min rest and after abstaining from food, beverages containing caffeine, and smoking for at&#xD;
      least 2 h prior to BP measurement. BP will be recorded as three serial measurements at&#xD;
      intervals of 30 sec on both arms.&#xD;
