    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to explore the correlation between postoperative recovery of&#xD;
      liver function and gut microbiota in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver&#xD;
      resection patients were divided into the recovery group and the recovery delay group&#xD;
      according to the recovery level of liver function on the fifth day after the operation.&#xD;
      Benign liver disease was used as a control. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the&#xD;
      differences in gut microbiota between the three groups. Then, fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation was performed in a mouse hepatectomy model. Through this study, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to understand the relationship between gut microbiota and postoperative&#xD;
      recovery of liver function in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, so as to provide a new&#xD;
      therapeutic direction for patients in the aspect of perioperative liver function recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the&#xD;
      world. At present, surgery is the first choice and the most effective way to treat it. Based&#xD;
      on the case review, the investigators found that the recovery rate of perioperative liver&#xD;
      function was correlated with survival. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to&#xD;
      improve the recovery rate of postoperative liver function. Gut microbiota participate in many&#xD;
      physiological activities of human body, such as metabolic regulation, immune homeostasis and&#xD;
      hormone regulation. However, gut microbiota imbalance, excessive growth of pathogenic&#xD;
      microorganisms and changes in intestinal mucosal permeability lead to intestinal bacterial&#xD;
      ectopia and bacterial metabolites entering the liver through enterohepatic circulation. The&#xD;
      continuous inflammatory stimulation aggravate the progress of liver disease. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      helpful to explore the influence of gut microbiota on postoperative liver function recovery&#xD;
      and find out the different microbiota, in order to improve the postoperative liver function&#xD;
      recovery rate, shorten the perioperative hospital stay and prolong the survival of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the recovery level of liver function on the fifth day after the operation, liver&#xD;
      resection patients on HCC were divided into the recovery group and the recovery delay group&#xD;
      which comparing on the time point of before the surgery and five days after the surgery. The&#xD;
      patients on benign liver disease were used as a control. The investigators attempt to&#xD;
      identify the differential microbiota and validate this finding in a mouse hepatectomy model.&#xD;
