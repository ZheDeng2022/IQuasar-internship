  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase II, multi-center clinical trial. Thirty patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this trial to investigate the pathological complete response rate defined&#xD;
      as the absence of residual tumor in lung and lymph nodes treated by chemo-immunotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase II, multi-center clinical trial. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will receive Toripalimab 240mg + Albumin-bound paclitaxel 260mg/m2 + Carboplatin AUC5 for 3&#xD;
      cycles every 21 days (+/-3 days) as neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery 3-4 weeks after&#xD;
      the last dose of chemo-immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is major pathologic response (MPR), defined as less than 10% tumor&#xD;
      cells in the pathologically resected specimen. Patient accrual is expected to be completed&#xD;
      within 18 months excluding a run-in-phase of 3 months. Patients will be followed 3 years&#xD;
      after surgery. The study will end once survival follow-up has concluded.&#xD;

Surgery: Surgery must be done within the 3rd to 4th week (+7 days) from day 21 cycle 3 of neoadjuvant treatment.</description>
