      The study is a prospective, single arm phase I/II study. The primary aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of 111In-PSMA I&amp;T radio guided surgery in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      prostate cancer who are highly suspected of having one or more pelvic lymph node metastases&#xD;
      based on pre-operative imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with prostate cancer who have a high risk of lymph node metastases based on PSMA&#xD;
      PET/CT and scheduled for robot-assisted PLND (with or without prostatectomy) will be&#xD;
      recruited. Eligible patients will receive an additional ferumoxtran-10 enhanced MRI to&#xD;
      complement pre-operative imaging. Twenty-four hours before surgery, patients will receive the&#xD;
      radiolabelled PSMA tracer. Pelvic Lymph node dissections are carried out according to&#xD;
      standard of care procedures. During surgery, the surgeon will be provided with a gamma-probe&#xD;
      to detect PSMA expressing lymph nodes in vivo. Dissected samples will be systematically&#xD;
      assessed on tracer accumulation using the gamma-probe ex vivo. After surgery, the samples&#xD;
      will be scanned in the small animal SPECT/CT and 7T-MRI. After scanning, samples will be&#xD;
      presented to pathologists for pathological analysis according to standard of care including&#xD;
      staining for PSMA expression. At 3 months after surgery, patients will undergo a PSMA-PET/CT.&#xD;
      Up until one year after surgery patients will be followed according to standard of&#xD;
      care-guidelines by 3-monthly serum-PSA measurements.&#xD;

    <description>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of 111In-PSMA-I&amp;T radio guided surgery in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer who are highly suspected of having one or more pelvic lymph node metastasis/metastases based on pre-operative imaging. Feasibility will be defined as the ability to intra-operatively detect the lymph nodes (using a gamma probe) which were pre-operatively identified on PSMA-PET/CT</description>
