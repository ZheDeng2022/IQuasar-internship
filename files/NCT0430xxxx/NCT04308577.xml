  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approx. 100 patients with severe brain injury is admitted to the Clinic for&#xD;
      Neurorehabilitation/TBI Unit, Rigshospitalet. Severe brain injury results in local oxygen&#xD;
      deficiency and acid formation in the brain, which together destroys brain cells. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to investigate whether it is possible to carry out a ketogenic diet therapy&#xD;
      for patients with severe brain injury for six weeks. Ketosis has been shown to be&#xD;
      neuroprotective during and after severe brain injury.&#xD;

      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Department of Highly Specialized Neurorehabilitation/Traumatic Brain Injury,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet (satellite department at Hvidovre Hospital), approximately 100 patients (pt.)&#xD;
      are admitted with severe brain damage every year. From 2015 to 2017, 305 pt. were admitted.&#xD;
      Out of the 305 pt., 162pt. (53%) had traumatic brain injury (TBI), 48pt. (16%) had apoplexy,&#xD;
      35pt. (12%) had other diagnoses (infections, tumors and almost drowning, etc.), 20pt. (7%)&#xD;
      had spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and 24pt. (8%) had brain damage as a result of&#xD;
      cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TBI is a leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. According to the&#xD;
      Global Burden of Disease Study (2016), there were 27,08 million new cases of TBI globally in&#xD;
      2016. In Denmark, there were 17.302 new cases of TBI in 2016. Clinical studies have&#xD;
      repeatedly shown major changes in cerebral energy metabolism after TBI. The secondary brain&#xD;
      injury leads to metabolic cellular dysfunction, cerebral edema, and a complex injury cascade.&#xD;
      The injury spread includes processes such as inflammation, edema, free radical damage,&#xD;
      oxidative damage, ischemic injury, cerebral glucose metabolism disorder, and ion-mediated&#xD;
      cell damage. Much of the neurological dysfunction that occurs in acute TBI also occurs in&#xD;
      apoplexy, SAH and cerebral ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A very important adaptive metabolic response after brain injury is the utilization of&#xD;
      alternative cerebral energy substrates, including lactate, but also ketone bodies (KB) such&#xD;
      as β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc). In addition to having a central role in&#xD;
      the regulation of cerebral energy metabolism after brain injury, KB has other important&#xD;
      neuroprotective properties, including attenuation of oxidative stress, apoptotic cell death,&#xD;
      and microglial activation. Increasing KB metabolism through fasting or diet-induced ketosis&#xD;
      promotes brain resistance to stress and injury, and attenuates acute cerebral injury.&#xD;
      Therefore, supplementing with KB, e.g. through the use of a ketogenic diet (KD) with added&#xD;
      medium chain fatty acids (MCT), has emerged as a potential non-pharmacological&#xD;
      neuroprotective therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KD has been used for many years for the treatment of refractory epilepsy in children and&#xD;
      studies done on adults show promising results, but experience from several studies shows&#xD;
      major compliance issues. KD has been shown to reduce cerebral edema and apoptosis, as well as&#xD;
      improve cerebral metabolism and behavioral outcomes in TBI rodent models, but clinical human&#xD;
      trials on adults with TBI are lacking. Apoplexy animal models show positive effects on&#xD;
      pathological and functional outcomes of KD intervention or exogenous ketone administration.&#xD;
      The only human trial of KD and apoplexy shows that KD is safe and tolerated by patients with&#xD;
      acute apoplexy. Our hypothesis is that diet-induced ketosis will reduce the extent of&#xD;
      secondary brain damage. The purpose of the trial is to investigate whether an intervention&#xD;
      with a ketogenic diet supplemented with MCT is feasible for 6 weeks on hospitalized pt. with&#xD;
      severe brain damage. This is the pre-study for a controlled study.&#xD;
