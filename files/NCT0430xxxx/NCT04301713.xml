      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To study the relationship between living conditions and the incidence of risk of falls in&#xD;
      older adults in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the socio-characteristics of the elderly group in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the pathologies or health problems that they present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate their functional and dependency degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the risk of falls that each person may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the risk factors involved in falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze the prevalence of falls that they present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive and analytical-statistical study. Administration of the Barthel Index.&#xD;
      Administration of the Downton fall risk assessment scale and the Falls Efficacy&#xD;
      Scale-International (FES-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of the Tinetti assessment tool and the Short Physical Performance Battery&#xD;
      (SPPB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of socio-demographic characteristics, clinical and functional assessment,&#xD;
      consumption of drugs, as well as characteristics of the falls of each elderly person in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol has been authorized by the Ethics Committee of the Salamanca health area to make&#xD;
      the project possible.&#xD;

&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational, cross-sectional study. Administration of the Barthel Index. Administration of&#xD;
      the Downton fall risk assessment scale and the Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of the Tinetti assessment tool and the Short Physical Performance Battery&#xD;
      (SPPB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of socio-demographic characteristics, clinical and functional assessment,&#xD;
      consumption of drugs, as well as characteristics of the falls of each elderly person in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyze statistically the results obtained and interpret them. The study was carried out over&#xD;
      three years. This research study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the University of&#xD;
      Salamanca.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SITE - SAMPLE SELECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include men and women, aged 75 or older, citizens of Salamanca city, who&#xD;
      voluntarily participate in the study, during the years 2018-2020, and are attached to the&#xD;
      National Health System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of the study will be calculated through the estimate of the population of&#xD;
      inhabitants of the city of Salamanca in the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample technique is intentional. Participants who have met the previously established&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and who did not present any exclusion criteria are recruited, as long as&#xD;
      they expressed their consent in the participation of the study, voluntarily and&#xD;
      altruistically, when they are asked by the nurse. If so, they will be cited later to conduct&#xD;
      a separate personal interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDEPENDENT VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Demographic data of the subject: age, sex, marital status, profession, lifestyle (lives&#xD;
      alone: yes/no and housework help: yes/no), weight, height, body mass index, pathological&#xD;
      antecedents, pharmacological treatment and history of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEPENDENT VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Habitual physical activity, characteristics of falls, risk of falls and fear of falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION: Process description&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects interested in participating in the study will receive a Participant Information&#xD;
           Sheet, explaining the objectives and procedures of the research study. It also refers to&#xD;
           the principles of non-maleficence, autonomy and participation and voluntary withdrawal,&#xD;
           data protection and confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All the participants included in the study will be identified with a unique number (the&#xD;
           selection number) to guarantee anonymity. The code that identifies them will appear in&#xD;
           each source of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Socio-demographic data of the subjects, pathological history, falls and habitual&#xD;
           medication are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subjects are evaluated on the risk of falls, the basic activities of daily life and&#xD;
           walking and balance, fragility and fear of falling, through the administration of the&#xD;
           scales: the Barthel Index, the Downton fall risk assessment scale, the Falls Efficacy&#xD;
           Scale-International (FES-I) and the Tinetti assessment tool and the Short Physical&#xD;
           Performance Battery (SPPB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The final phase consists on analyze statistically the results obtained and interpret&#xD;
           them.&#xD;
