      This study was carried out to develop mobile application on the android platform for the&#xD;
      subcutaneous anti-TNF drug adherence of ankylosing spondylitis patients and to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of this application on drug compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The universe of this experimental designed posttest control group research is consisted of&#xD;
      patients prescribed subcutaneous anti-TNF drug due to ankylosing spondylitis in Eskişehir&#xD;
      Osmangazi University Health, Application and Research Hospital Rheumatology Polyclinic&#xD;
      between 15 December 2017 - 30 June 2019. The patients who constituted the sample of the study&#xD;
      were assigned by lot to mobile application and the education booklet groups. The mobile&#xD;
      application that includes follow-up and information related to disease information, anti-TNF&#xD;
      drug application and management was transferred to mobile phones of patients in mobile&#xD;
      application group via bluetooth technology and installed. The patients in the education&#xD;
      booklet group were given an education booklet on disease information, antiTNF drug&#xD;
      administration and management. In the study, patients were evaluated once before anti-TNF&#xD;
      drug treatment and every 6 weeks during 6 months (4 times) after treatment. The data of the&#xD;
      study were collected by means of an individual identification form, BASDAI, BASFI, ASQoL and&#xD;
      Subcutaneous Anti-TNF Treatment Adherence Questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic, inflammatory disease that affects the axial spine,&#xD;
      causing progressive limitation on the spine and leading to a decrease in quality of life.&#xD;
      Anti TNF drugs are frequently used in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and teaching&#xD;
      activities in improving patient compliance and patient compliance are very important in the&#xD;
      success of this treatment. This study was carried out to develop mobile application on the&#xD;
      android platform for the subcutaneous anti-TNF drug adherence of ankylosing spondylitis&#xD;
      patients and to evaluate the effect of this application on drug compliance.&#xD;

    <measure>subcutaneous anti TNF-α drug adherence was assesed by &quot;Subcutaneous Anti-TNF-α Treatment Adherence Questionnaire&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>4 times in 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>In this questionnaire, It is expected from patients to answer &quot;no&quot; to these questions: &quot;In the last 6 weeks, did you ever miss or forget your dose of medication?&quot; and &quot;Did you ever skip implementing your medication dose thinking that your illness is under control?&quot;&#xD;
The drug adherence of the patients who answered &quot;no&quot; to these questions is considered evaluated as good, and those who answered &quot;yes&quot; to these questions the drug compliance is considered as poor.</description>

    <description>Patients in the experimental group were able to install and set up mobile application on android phones via Bluetooth and were informed about the sick android application. Patients were reminded and guided by subcutaneous anti-TNF drug treatments from mobile application. Both groups of patients were then assessed using face-to-face interviews for 6 months, 6 weeks after using the Sub Cutan Anti-Tnf-α Therapy Questionnaire, BASDAI, ASQoL, BASFI scales.</description>

    <description>An anti-TNF drug administration training booklet were given to patients in the control group and were required to take advantage of the booklet on subcutaneous anti-TNF drug production. Both groups of patients were then assessed using face-to-face interviews for 6 months, 6 weeks after using the Sub Cutan Anti-Tnf-α Therapy Questionnaire, BASDAI, ASQoL, BASFI scales. At the end of the study (twenty forth week) was applied to all patients.</description>
