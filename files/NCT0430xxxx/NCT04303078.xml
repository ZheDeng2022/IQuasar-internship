  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the underlying mechanisms that contribute to high&#xD;
      energy costs for people with cerebral palsy (CP) as they walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will characterize the cost landscape of children with CP, quantifying the&#xD;
      magnitude of cost (net nondimensional oxygen consumption) associated with walking and common&#xD;
      sub-tasks of walking, such as supporting the body.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with CP use large amounts of energy to walk and move, leading to fatigue and&#xD;
      limiting participation. For people with CP the energetic cost of walking is on average over&#xD;
      two times higher than typically-developing (TD) peers. This means that for people with CP,&#xD;
      walking is as tiring as jogging or climbing stairs. An energetic cost of this magnitude&#xD;
      restricts activities of daily living (ADL) and causes exhaustion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the investigators and many others have sought to reduce these energetic costs through&#xD;
      surgical interventions, rehabilitation, orthotics, or other assistive devices, these&#xD;
      strategies have failed to result in meaningful reductions in energy. To design strategies&#xD;
      that successfully reduce walking costs, the investigators must first understand the&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms contributing to elevated cost in people with CP. This basic-science&#xD;
      research will provide the foundation to create evidence-based strategies to decrease energy&#xD;
      costs, minimize fatigue, and increase quality of life for people with CP and other neurologic&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
