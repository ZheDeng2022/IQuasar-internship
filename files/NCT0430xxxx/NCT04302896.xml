  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open label study to identify adherence levels of commonly prescribed&#xD;
      FDA-approved antiretroviral agents by tracking the decline of drug concentrations in plasma,&#xD;
      urine and saliva following abrupt drug cessation in HIV-negative adults. Results from this&#xD;
      study may provide support for development of a point of care urine testing device to monitor&#xD;
      drug adherence.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor adherence to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) incurs&#xD;
      costs for patients, health systems, and society. Non-adherence to ARV precedes viral&#xD;
      breakthrough and offers opportunities for health-care professionals to intervene. There is a&#xD;
      need for accurate, affordable, rapid, and objective monitoring of adherence to be deployed as&#xD;
      a companion diagnostic to ARV therapy. Self-reported questionnaires, physician and nurse&#xD;
      adherence consistently over-estimate adherence, and pill counts, and pharmacy returns do not&#xD;
      yield sufficient precision for individual patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has the&#xD;
      advantage tracking medication intake, but sample storage and processing requirements,&#xD;
      turnaround times and relatively high cost preclude their widespread deployment. There is a&#xD;
      real clinical need for point-of-care adherence testing, which will have high clinical utility&#xD;
      by allowing targeting of adherence support and monitoring, better medication review, and&#xD;
      integration with community support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the clinical utility of any point-of-care test (POCT) will be its negative predictive&#xD;
      value, this trial has been designed as a 'tail' study to track the decline of drug&#xD;
      concentrations in plasma, urine and saliva following abrupt drug cessation. Such a study will&#xD;
      require dosing to healthy participants who are dosed to steady-state prior to treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial measurement of drug concentrations in plasma, saliva and urine will be used to develop&#xD;
      population-based models which adequately describe the kinetics of elimination and population&#xD;
      variability in drug exposure. These models will be used to simulate population drug exposures&#xD;
      from which target cut-offs are derived for development of a POCT device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately thirty healthy, HIV-uninfected participants will be enrolled and equally&#xD;
      assigned to one of two ARV dosing arms using a permuted block design randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1: dolutegravir 50 mg + emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg once daily for&#xD;
      15 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: dolutegravir 50 mg + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg + lamivudine 300 mg once&#xD;
      daily for 15 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess ARV pharmacokinetics during dosing and over 14 days following ARV cessation, blood,&#xD;
      urine, and saliva samples will be collected at Days 1, 2, 8, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22 and 29.&#xD;
