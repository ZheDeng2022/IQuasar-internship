  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this research is to investigate the acute effects of resistance exercise&#xD;
      (REx) on the hormonal and behavioral indices of energy balance regulation in breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors. This pilot study is designed to provide preliminary data to support future&#xD;
      exercise interventions with more comprehensive energy balance profiling.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After screening, eligible and consented participants will complete baseline evaluations of&#xD;
      REE, body composition, and subjective questionnaires to assess energy balance. Eligible and&#xD;
      interested individuals will attend an exercise familiarization session in the two weeks&#xD;
      before the initial study visit. Individuals will then be randomized to either sedentary&#xD;
      control/REx or REx/sedentary control in a 1:1. A washout period of approximately 7-14 days&#xD;
      will separate testing sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized cross-over short-term study design was chosen to assessment to profile appetite,&#xD;
      energy intake, and physical activity in controlled and free-living settings while also&#xD;
      reducing participant burden (as opposed to a long-term intervention). Participants will serve&#xD;
      as their own controls, thereby circumventing inter-individual variation in physiology that&#xD;
      may confound results. It is anticipated that responses to acute exercise will be amplified in&#xD;
      chronic interventions and may therefore be used as a basis for generating hypotheses on the&#xD;
      regulation of certain energy balance components. The study will end after the completion of 3&#xD;
      days of dietary intake recall and physical activity measurement for the last participant.&#xD;

    <description>REx condition: Participants will complete a whole-body REx workout consisting of 1-set to failure (e.g. RPE of 9-10 on 10-point scale on final reps) on 12 exercises in the Exercise Research Laboratory (located in the CTRC), with a 3-minute rest between exercises. Participants will complete the following exercises: leg press; leg extension; leg curl; hip abduction; hip adduction; chest press; overhead press; seated row; overheard pulldowns and assisted triceps dips on Cybex resistance equipment; barbell calf raises on a Smith machine; and dumbbell biceps curls. Resistance for the REx trial will be determined based on the exercise familiarization session. Specifically, we will target a resistance level needed for each participant to complete ~12-15 repetitions per exercise, using proper form, with an RPE of 9-10 on a 10-point scale on final reps. This protocol eliminates the need for max testing in order to set an exercise protocol off of a specific intensity based on % of 1RM.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Female sex&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 18 - 45 years, since older age may impact appetite regulation45-47 and women &gt;45&#xD;
             are more likely to have begun the menopausal transition (estrogen relates to appetite&#xD;
             and eating behavior)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index [BMI]: 25 - 35 kg/m2. Since body composition and body mass relate to&#xD;
             appetite regulation and energy intake, a narrow BMI range should decrease&#xD;
             heterogeneity within the results. The BMI range was chosen to represent a population&#xD;
             at risk for developing obesity and associated comorbidities, while also excluding&#xD;
             individuals with severe obesity (which may plausibly significantly impact energy&#xD;

             participants seated quietly), untreated/uncontrolled thyroid disease, or any other&#xD;
             medical condition affecting weight or energy metabolism. Participants who are deemed&#xD;
             ineligible based upon uncontrolled hypertension criteria will be referred to their&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Corticosteroid use within the last two weeks&#xD;

             eating. Participants with a score &gt;20 on the EATS-26 will be referred to their primary&#xD;
             care physician for further evaluation.&#xD;
