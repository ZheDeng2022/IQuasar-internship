      Title: Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial comparing two dental implants with different neck&#xD;
      configurations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the changes in peri-implant soft tissues and marginal bone level when&#xD;
      using a one-piece implant with a widening transgingival machined collar and a one-piece&#xD;
      implant with a tapering transgingival machined collar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study will be a prospective parallel randomized clinical trial with a 12 month&#xD;
      follow up conducted in 5 private dental practices. A total of 50 patients meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be randomized in one of the two groups to receive 1 single implant&#xD;
      placed in healed ridges. Radiographic and clinical measurements will be taken post-insertion,&#xD;
      baseline (post-loading) 6 and 12 months after loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: The hypothesis of this study is that there will be no differences in the&#xD;
      preservation of the peri-implant marginal bone level and peri-implant soft tissues between&#xD;
      the two implant neck designs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective parallel randomized clinical trial (RCT) of approximately 20&#xD;
      months of duration, in which each patient will receive 1 implants placed in the posterior&#xD;
      mandible. If the patients fulfill the inclusion criteria after implant site preparation, they&#xD;
      will be randomized to either receive an implant with a one-piece tapering neck configuration&#xD;
      (P) or with a widening neck configuration (TL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      52 patients, male or female, aged 18 or older, who are missing one tooth in the posterior&#xD;
      mandible (positions 4-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization list will determine which implant type has to be inserted. This randomization&#xD;
      list will be generated by an independent investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited by the investigator consecutively. Prior to implant site&#xD;
      preparation, the clinician will determine if the patient still meets the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      at surgery in particular if the bone quantity is sufficient. Patients who do not meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be excluded from the study and will therefore not be randomized. The&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to receive P implant or TL implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, impression will be taken 8 weeks post insertion. Details with regard to the&#xD;
      prosthetic procedures and materials used for the restoration of the implants will be provided&#xD;
      in a separate section of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized peri-apical radiographs will be taken before and after prosthesis placement to&#xD;
      document the crestal bone level at the day of loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized photographs will be taken to measure the soft tissue at the time of loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thickness of the soft tissue will be measured 2 mm apical to the gingival margin with a&#xD;
      needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine controls are due at 6 and 12 months post loading. Peri-apical radiographs will be&#xD;
      taken after implant placement, before/after loading and at 12 months post loading. Final&#xD;
      impressions will be taken at 12 months post loading to evaluate volumetric changes.&#xD;
