        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult females, pre- and/or post-menopausal, and adult males. Pre-menopausal (and&#xD;
             peri-menopausal) women can be enrolled if amenable to treatment with an LHRH agonist.&#xD;
             Patients are to have commenced concomitant treatment with LHRH agonist prior to or on&#xD;
             Cycle 1, Day 1 and must be willing to continue on it for the duration of the study&#xD;

          3. Metastatic or locally advanced disease with radiological or objective evidence of&#xD;
             recurrence or progression (the cancer should have shown progression during or after&#xD;
             most recent therapy); locally advanced disease must not be amenable to resection with&#xD;
             curative intent (patients who are considered suitable for surgical or ablative&#xD;
             techniques following potential down-staging with study treatment are not eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG/WHO PS: 0-1&#xD;

               2. Radiological evidence of progression while on prior AI administered as a&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 and/or at least 1 lytic&#xD;
             or mixed (lytic + sclerotic) bone lesion that can be assessed by CT or MRI; patients&#xD;
