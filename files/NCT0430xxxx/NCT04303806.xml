      Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder that complicates 3-5% of pregnancies and remains a&#xD;
      major cause of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality.(1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preeclampsia is characterized by the development of new onset hypertension (HTN) and the&#xD;
      establishment of proteinuria. Other signs and symptoms that accompany the disease include:&#xD;
      headache, visual disturbances, epigastric or abdominal pain, weakness, altered mental status,&#xD;
      HELLP syndrome (2) dyspnea and edema (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and&#xD;
      Task Force on Hypertension in Pregnancy, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous preeclamptic pregnancy, family history of preeclampsia, late age of maternity (&gt;40&#xD;
      years), multiple gestation, obesity, diabetes mellitus and history of thrombophilia have been&#xD;
      identified as predisposing risk factors (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&#xD;
      and Task Force on Hypertension in Pregnancy, 2013). In particular, the presence of HTN and&#xD;
      chronic renal impairment before gestation has been strongly correlated to the development of&#xD;
      preeclampsia later during pregnancy (Foo et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preeclampsia can result in a great number of severe and, in some cases, fatal short- and&#xD;
      long-term consequences affecting both the mother and the fetus. Maternal complications&#xD;
      include cardiometabolic disorders (diabetes, ischemic heart disease, metabolic syndrome),&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease (stroke, intracranial bleeding), neurologic abnormalities (eclamptic&#xD;
      seizures) and renal impairment (Ramsay et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2003; Haukkamaa et al.,&#xD;
      2004; Funai et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal outcomes include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity and higher risk of&#xD;
      developing HTN, obesity, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemias, and cardiovascular disease (Lo et&#xD;
      al., 2013; Nice guidelines, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence from several studies that preeclampsia is accompanied by endothelial&#xD;
      injury. This injury results in abnormal vascular relaxation and platelet activation and is&#xD;
      associated with inflammation and oxidative imbalance. (5) The activation of the inflammatory&#xD;
      cascade that occurs in normal pregnancy is further exaggerated in preeclampsia. Markers of&#xD;
      inflammation, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), are elevated in patients&#xD;
      who later develop preeclampsia. In addition, preeclampsia is associated with elevated&#xD;
      cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-12. These activate&#xD;
      the inflammatory cascade and increase free radical generation and oxidative stress, thus&#xD;
      contributing to endothelial injury. (6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of the fetus is the only efficient therapy (Everett et al., 2012; Gangooly et al.,&#xD;
      2014; Nice guidelines, 2016(10. Nice guidelines (2016). Hypertension in Pregnancy: Diagnosis&#xD;
      and Management |&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-Guidance | Guidance and guidelines | NICE. [cited 2016 May 27]. Available at:&#xD;
      https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg107/chapter/1-guidance ) ). If the gestational age is less&#xD;
      than 34 weeks and the BP can be sufficiently controlled with the absence of other symptoms,&#xD;
      pregnancy can be prolonged in order to avoid prematurity complications for the fetus. The&#xD;
      main therapeutic goal in preeclampsia is the management of HTN, aiming for SBP of 140-150&#xD;
      mmHg and DBP of 80-100 mmHg (Nice guidelines, 2016 10. Nice guidelines (2016). Hypertension&#xD;
      in Pregnancy: Diagnosis and Management |&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-Guidance | Guidance and guidelines | NICE. [cited 2016 May 27]. Available at:&#xD;
      https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg107/chapter/1-guidance). Oral antihypertensive therapy&#xD;
      including a-methyldopa, calcium channel blockers, b-blockers and labetalol, coupled with&#xD;
      antiplatelet agents and magnesium sulfate are considered as a therapy in hypertensive&#xD;
      disorders in order to limit maternal and fetal complications (Sandrim et al., 2008; Nice&#xD;
      guidelines, 2016 12. Sandrim, V. C., Palei, A. C., Metzger, I. F., Gomes, V. A., Cavalli, R.&#xD;
      C., and Tanus-Santos, J. E. (2008). Nitric oxide formation is inversely related to serum&#xD;
      levels of antiangiogenic factors soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and soluble endogline in&#xD;
      preeclampsia. Hypertension 52, 402-407. doi: 10.1161/ HYPERTENSIONAHA.108.115006&#xD;
&#xD;
      ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors that are&#xD;
      effective in the reduction of total and LDL cholesterol.3 They prevent initial cardiovascular&#xD;
      and subsequent cardiovascular events in ischemic heart disease patients, irrespective of the&#xD;
      cholesterol concentration.5,6&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been recent interest in the use of statins to treat preeclampsia. Notably, evidence&#xD;
      has emerged that statins have vasoprotective properties independent of their effects in&#xD;
      lowering serum cholesterol.8,9 ) Statins also correct the imbalance in the Th1/Th2 cytokine&#xD;
      responses observed in preeclampsia (statins decrease Th1 proinflammatory cytokines, such as&#xD;
      TNF-α, IL-1, IL-2, IFN-γ, and increase Th2 antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL 10).&#xD;
      (23) Cudmore et al10 showed that simvastatin significantly reduced sFlt-1 secretion from&#xD;
      placenta and endothelial cells. Unfortunately, simvastatin may not be acceptable for use&#xD;
      during pregnancy. It has a category X rating in light of observational studies, demonstrating&#xD;
      an association with fetal malformations if administered during the first trimester.11,12 Some&#xD;
      have proposed that rosuvastatin may be a more promising therapeutic candidate given its&#xD;
      safety profile could be better than simvastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike simvastatin, which is hydrophobic, rouvastatin is hydrophilic, meaning it may less&#xD;
      readily cross through the placenta to the fetus.11,13 Transplacental transfer of statins&#xD;
      depends on their plasma concentration; their binding to plasma proteins; their molecular&#xD;
      weight, lipophilicity and ionization state; and their capacity to bind to placental transport&#xD;
      proteins. Pravastatin and rosuvastatin are relatively hydrophilic (which, in theory, reduces&#xD;
      their transplacental passage) and not significantly metabolized by CYP enzymes.[20] Cohort&#xD;
      studies have shown that administration of lipophilic statins have increased fetal&#xD;
      malformation risk; however, hydrophilic statins, including rosuvastatin, have not been&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk.11&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rosuvastatin is a fully synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. It belongs to a new generation&#xD;
      of methane-sulphonamide pyrimidine and N-methane sulfonyl pyrrole-substituted 3, 5-&#xD;
      dihydroxy-heptenoates. Although the characteristic statin pharmacophore remains similar to&#xD;
      other statins, the addition of a stable polar methane-sulphonamide group provides low&#xD;
      lipophilicity and enhanced ionic interaction with HMG-CoA reductase enzyme thus improving its&#xD;
      binding affinity to this enzyme.16-18((16. White CM. A review of the pharmacologic and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic aspects of rosuvastatin. J Clin Pharmacol. 2002; 42: 963-70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18. McTaggart F. Comparative pharmacology of rosuvastatin. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 4:9-14))&#xD;
&#xD;
      As observed with other statins, rosuvastatin has pleiotropic effects independent of HMG-CoA&#xD;
      reductase inhibition. These include improvements in endothelial function, anti-inflammatory,&#xD;
      antithrombotic and anti-oxidant effects.27((27. Grosser N, Erdmann K, Hemmerle A, et al.&#xD;
      Rosuvastatin upregulates the antioxidant defense protein heme oxygenase-1. Biochem Biophys&#xD;
      Res Commun. 2004; 325: 871-6)) Statins improve endothelial function by increasing the&#xD;
      production of endothelial nitric oxide and reducing the production of oxygen derived free&#xD;
      radicals. Rosuvastatin reduces high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) which is a marker&#xD;
      of inflammation and an independent cardiovascular risk predictor and other inflammatory&#xD;
      markers.28(28. Mayer C, Gruber HJ, Landl EM, et al. Rosuvastatin reduces interleukin-&#xD;
      6-induced expression of C-reactive protein in human hepatocytes in a STAT3- and&#xD;
      C/EBP-dependent fashion. Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2007; 45: 319-27)) It inhibits platelet&#xD;
      aggregation to leukocytes which inhibit formation of clots in injured endothelium.29 (29.&#xD;
      Laumen H, Skurk T, Hauner H, et al. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin inhibits&#xD;
      plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression and secretion in human adipocytes.&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis. 2008;196: 565-73)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 90% of rosuvastatin is protein bound mainly to albumin. It is less lipophilic&#xD;
      than other statins and has a plasma half life of 19 hours which is longer than atorvastatin&#xD;
      (15 hours) and simvastatin (2-3 hours). It is primarily eliminated in the faeces (90%)&#xD;
      compared with 10% renal excretion. Approximately 72% of absorbed rosuvastatin is eliminated&#xD;
      in bile and 28% via renal excretion.33(33. Martin PD, Warwick MJ, Dane AL, et al. Metabolism,&#xD;
      excretion, and pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin in healthy adult male volunteers. Clin Ther.&#xD;
      2003;25:2822-35.) As the circulating half life is 19 hrs it can be taken once daily at any&#xD;
      time of the day regardless of meals.&#xD;
