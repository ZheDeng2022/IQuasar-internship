  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidences showed that patients with chronic constipation accompanied with intestinal&#xD;
      dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis is a harbinger of chronic inflammation, yet the underlying basis is&#xD;
      unclear. Plasma level of microbial translocation is a marker of mucosal permeability.&#xD;
      Increased mucosal permeability ignites elevated microbial translocation and is a source of&#xD;
      systemic immune activation in CKD patients. The passage of microbial components from the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract into the systemic circulation may be an important contributor to the&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory process and subsequent atherosclerosis development. We plan to determine&#xD;
      the association constipation with biomarkers of inflammation such monocyte activation and&#xD;
      associated cytokines as well as markers of microbial translocation including endotoxin and&#xD;
      its antibodies, intestinal barrier proteins of 200 hemodialysis patients.&#xD;

      Study Design and Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods 2.1. Patient selection Two hundred hemodialysis patients are recruited.&#xD;
      Functional constipation will be diagnosed according to the Rome IV criteria. Organic lesions&#xD;
      of the abdominal cavity and the pelvic floor are excluded in all patients by endoscopic&#xD;
      (sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, gastroduodenoscopy), radiologic and ultrasonographic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in&#xD;
      2008. All patients will give written informed consent to participate in the study. All&#xD;
      patients in the renal division of Tungs Taichung Metroharbour Hospital were prospectively and&#xD;
      consecutively included. The inclusion criteria are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hemodialysis for more than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age older than 20 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria are a history of chronic inflammatory disease, the presence of current&#xD;
      infection, collagen vascular disease or immuno-modulatory or immuno-suppressive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of inflammatory cytokines, etotaxin-1, and amyloid A&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma levels of MCP-1, IL-6, CRP, IL-17A and calprotectin are tested by commercially&#xD;
      available human ELISA kit respectively, according to the manufacturer's instruction. Human&#xD;
      serum eotaxin1 levels are determined using a commercial ELISA kit (R&amp;D systems, Minneapolis,&#xD;
      MN, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The commercially available ELISA procedure&#xD;
      is used to measure serum amyloid A concentration in serum,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endotoxin and Endotoxin Ig M as well as IgG core antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endotoxin is measured in serum by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate QCL-1000 from Lonza (catalogue #&#xD;
      50-647U)(EU/ml). Serum or plasma samples are diluted at 1âˆ¶5 ratio with LAL reagent water.&#xD;
      Endotoxin IgG core antibodies are measured in plasma using an ELISA kit from Cell Sciences&#xD;
      Inc (catalogue # HK504). Units are expressed as GMU/ml which are IgG standard median units&#xD;
      based on medians of ranges of 1000 healthy adults by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of CD14 and CD16 Mononuclear Phenotype&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood will be collected by venipuncture using ethylenedi- aminetetraacetic acid&#xD;
      (EDTA) as an anticoagulant. For cytometric analysis, monoclonal antibodies against CD14&#xD;
      (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated; clone RMO52; Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA),&#xD;
      CD16 (phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated; clone 3G8; Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA), CD45&#xD;
      (phycoerythrin cyanin-5 (PC5); clone J33; Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA), and CD56 (clone&#xD;
      IM2073; Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA) are used. Briefly, 100 l of the whole blood is&#xD;
      stained with saturating amounts of the above mentioned monoclonal antibodies and&#xD;
      corresponding isotype controls. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature in the dark&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer's recommendations, OptiLyse C (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL) is&#xD;
      added to lyse RBC and the samples are fixed. Fixed cells are analyzed by flow cytometry&#xD;
      within 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of leukocyte and monocyte subset distribution is performed using a&#xD;
      FC500-Cytometer (Beckman Coulter), and CXP analysis software (version 2.2) is used (Schroers&#xD;
      et al., 2005). Monocytes are identified as CD45 positive and CD56 negative cells exhibiting a&#xD;
      specific forward and sideward scatter profile. Monocytes are then gated in an SSC/CD dot&#xD;
      plot, identifying monocytes as CD86 cells with monocyte scatter properties. Subsets of CD14&#xD;
      monocytes with and without CD16 are defined according to the surface expression pattern of&#xD;
      the lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14 and the CD16 (Fcgamma receptor III). One million cells&#xD;
      are analyzed from each sample, and the percentage of CD16 positive mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (CD14+/CD16+ and CD14++/CD16+) and the number of cells out of the total monocytes are&#xD;
      compared using fluorescent microbeads (Flow-Count, Beckman Coulter). The CD86 antibody (clone&#xD;
      HA5.2B7; Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA) is used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sCD14, LBP, zonulin and I-FABP assays&#xD;
&#xD;
      LBP and sCD14 markers are used to monitor the microbial translocation while Zonulin and&#xD;
      I-FABP are measured to explore intestinal permeability: LBP plasma levels are measured using&#xD;
      Enzyme Immunoassay for Quantification of free human LBP ELISA kit, according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's recommendations. Dilution factor is 1:800. Plasma level of sCD14 is measured&#xD;
      using Human sCD14 kit, according to the manufacturer's specifications. Dilution factor is&#xD;
      1:200. Zonulin serum levels are measured using Human zonulin ELISA kit. I-FABP plasma levels&#xD;
      are measured by ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations.&#xD;
