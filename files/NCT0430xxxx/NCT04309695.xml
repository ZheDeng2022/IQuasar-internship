  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the trial are to demonstrate the safety and performance of the Zenflow&#xD;
      Spring System in relieving the symptoms of obstructive Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Zenflow Study (ZEST CAN) is to evaluate the safety, performance and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Zenflow Spring System for the treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms&#xD;
      (LUTS) that arise due to bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), secondary to the presence of&#xD;
      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). It is intended that the features of the Zenflow Spring&#xD;
      will provide an effective office-based treatment and management therapy for BPH with little&#xD;
      or no side effects.&#xD;
