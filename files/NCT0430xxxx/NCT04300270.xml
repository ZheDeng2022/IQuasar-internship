  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder with increased risk of stroke, heart failure,&#xD;
      dementia and death. The severity of symptoms in atrial fibrillation varies markedly, ranging&#xD;
      from no symptoms to those with disabling symptoms. An ECG recording is currently mandatory&#xD;
      for diagnosing atrial fibrillation. A portable method for heart rhythm diagnostics that is&#xD;
      readily available is currently missing in clinical practice. If a standard smartphone could&#xD;
      be used for heart rhythm diagnostics, the availability could improve greatly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with direct current cardioversion is a procedure in which the heart rhythm is&#xD;
      normalized by an electrical shock through the chest. Patients with atrial fibrillation are in&#xD;
      some cases recommended treatment with direct current cardioversion but the procedure is&#xD;
      costly, has a high recurrence rate and includes an increased risk for stroke. In this study&#xD;
      we will validate the use of a novel smartphone-based method for heart rhythm diagnostics when&#xD;
      used by patients in their home environment. The novel method is using the smartphone camera&#xD;
      as a sensor. Patients will be doing heart rhythm measurements with the novel smartphone-based&#xD;
      method in their home environment for 30 days after successfully receiving treatment of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation with direct current cardioversion. The novel smartphone-based method will be&#xD;
      validated against simultaneous recordings with mobile ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also study the feasibility in using smartphone recordings and mobile ECG in the home&#xD;
      environment the weeks before receiving treatment with direct current cardioversion, to study&#xD;
      the possible benefit of detecting spontaneous conversions to normal heart rhythm and missed&#xD;
      doses of treatment with blood thinning medication, both of which will lead to cancellation or&#xD;
      detention of the cardioversion procedure.&#xD;

      Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder with increased risk of stroke, heart failure,&#xD;
      dementia and death. The severity of symptoms in atrial fibrillation varies markedly, ranging&#xD;
      from no symptoms to those with disabling symptoms. An ECG recording is currently mandatory&#xD;
      for diagnosing atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The availability of long-term ECG and portable ECG registration for heart rhythm diagnostics&#xD;
      within the healthcare sector is severely limited by waiting time both for ECG recording and&#xD;
      for analysis and reporting. A method for heart rhythm diagnostics that is readily available&#xD;
      is currently lacking in clinical practice, except for hospitalization, which is very costly&#xD;
      and has low availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of a method for diagnosis of heart rhythm disorders and atrial fibrillation that is&#xD;
      readily available, cost-effective and simple to use is a problem for both the patients and&#xD;
      for the healthcare system as a whole. The limited availability of patient-related diagnostics&#xD;
      thus means that many patients, even those with symptoms, remain undiagnosed and thus&#xD;
      untreated, which in turn means that the missing diagnosis gives an increased risk of stroke.&#xD;
      If a standard smartphone could be used for reliable heart rhythm diagnostics, the&#xD;
      availability could improve greatly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with direct current cardioversion is a procedure in which the heart rhythm is&#xD;
      normalized by an electrical shock through the chest. Patients with atrial fibrillation could&#xD;
      in some cases be treated with cardioversion but the procedure is costly, has a high&#xD;
      recurrence rate and includes an increased risk for thromboembolism and stroke. The benefit of&#xD;
      the treatment is mainly symptomatic, with no proven long-term effects of mortality or&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will validate the use of a novel smartphone-based method for heart rhythm&#xD;
      diagnostics when used by patients in their home environment after receiving treatment with&#xD;
      direct current cardioversion. The novel method is using the smartphone camera as a sensor and&#xD;
      records photoplethysmographic (PPG) measurements. We will also study the feasibility in using&#xD;
      smartphone and mobile ECG recordings peri-cardioversion, to study the possible benefit of&#xD;
      detecting pre-cardioversion spontaneous conversions to sinus rhythm and non-adherence to&#xD;
      treatment with oral anticoagulants, both of which will lead to cancellation or detention of&#xD;
      the cardioversion procedure. We will also detect the timing of post-cardioversion early&#xD;
      recurrences into atrial fibrillation, as well as the heart rate and symptoms associated to&#xD;
      recurrence, if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Validate heart rhythm measurements registered with a novel smartphone-based method using&#xD;
           PPG-measurement technology compared to mobile ECG technology in patients with atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation. The validation involves evaluating whether PPG-measurement technology&#xD;
           using a novel smartphone-based method provides sufficient diagnostic performance in the&#xD;
           home environment / outpatient environment compared to outpatient mobile ECG&#xD;
           measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study if pre-cardioversion heart rhythm recordings will reduce the number of same day&#xD;
           cancellations of treatment of atrial fibrillation with planned direct current&#xD;
           cardioversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the validation part, patients who visit the cardiac day care department at the department&#xD;
      of Cardiology, Danderyd University Hospital, for treatment with outpatient direct current&#xD;
      cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter are asked about participating by&#xD;
      physicians or research nurses. Each patient will prior to inclusion in the study be given&#xD;
      full and adequate verbal and written information regarding the objective and procedures of&#xD;
      the study and possible risks involved. Written consent is obtained from the physician or&#xD;
      research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 60-second heart rhythm measurement using a smartphone is recorded before the patient&#xD;
      receives treatment with direct current cardioversion. The smartphone used is the same device&#xD;
      that the patient will be using in their home for 30 days after the treatment. The measurement&#xD;
      includes PPG-measurement from the camera of the smartphone as well as a simultaneous one lead&#xD;
      ECG-registration done with a small ECG-device attached to the back of the smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is interviewed about their medical history and their current symptoms. If the&#xD;
      treatment is successful and the patient's heart rhythm is converted back to normal sinus&#xD;
      rhythm, the patient is included in the study. The patient's heart rhythm is verified with an&#xD;
      ECG measurement recorded approximately one hour after the cardioversion treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patients are discharged from the hospital they are given a smartphone that they will&#xD;
      be recording simultaneous PPG- and ECG-recordings with, at least twice daily for a period of&#xD;
      30 days post-cardioversion in their home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the clinical implementation part, patients scheduled for direct current cardioversion at&#xD;
      Danderyd University Hospital will be included at least 2 weeks prior to the scheduled&#xD;
      treatment. Information regarding co-morbidities, echocardiographic parameters and current&#xD;
      medication will be collected from interviews and medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals scheduled for direct current cardioversion will be invited to a screening&#xD;
      visit and asked to sign a written consent form. After consent, their heart rhythm will be&#xD;
      recorded and those with sinus rhythm will be excluded. Participants with atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      or atrial flutter will be randomized 1:1 to pre-cardioversion heart rhythm monitoring, or no&#xD;
      monitoring pre-cardioversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to active pre-cardioversion rhythm monitoring (intervention group)&#xD;
      will be instructed in the use of smartphone rhythm recordings (using simultaneous PPG and&#xD;
      mobile ECG). They will be recording both their heart rhythm and oral anticoagulant treatment&#xD;
      adherence with the same smartphone application. This information will give the investigators&#xD;
      the possibility to cancel or postpone the scheduled cardioversion visit in advance for those&#xD;
      with spontaneous rhythm conversion to sinus rhythm and for those with non-adherence to oral&#xD;
      anticoagulant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to passive pre-cardioversion rhythm monitoring (control group) will&#xD;
      be instructed in the use of smartphone rhythm recordings (using simultaneous PPG and mobile&#xD;
      ECG). The control group will be recording only heart rhythm and not treatment adherence. The&#xD;
      heart rhythm recordings made in the control group will be reviewed after the participants&#xD;
      treatment with direct current cardioversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the treatment with direct current cardioversion, all participants are followed up in&#xD;
      one common cohort.&#xD;
