    <textblock>
      The presence of myocardial ischemia is the most important prognostic indicator in patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease. Therefore, the purpose of percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI) is to relieve myocardial ischemia caused by the target stenosis. Fractional flow&#xD;
      reserve (FFR) is an invasive physiologic index used to define functionally significant&#xD;
      coronary stenosis, and its prognostic implications are supported by numerous studies.&#xD;
      Contrary to the clear cutoff value and the benefit of FFR in pre-PCI evaluation, there have&#xD;
      been various results regarding optimal cut-off values for post-PCI FFR. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      positive association between post-PCI FFR and the risk of future events has been reproduced&#xD;
      by several studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCI with stent implantation is basically a local treatment and post-PCI FFR reflects both&#xD;
      residual stenosis in the stented segment and remaining disease beyond the stented segment in&#xD;
      the target vessel(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, post-PCI FFR alone cannot fully discriminate the degree of contribution of each&#xD;
      component. The relative increase of FFR with PCI is determined by the interaction of baseline&#xD;
      severity of a target lesion, baseline disease burden of a target vessel, adequacy of PCI and&#xD;
      residual disease burden in a target vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the most important problem in stratifying patients with better expected post-PCI&#xD;
      physiologic results and following clinical outcome would be that there has been no clear&#xD;
      method to identify these patients in pre-PCI phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, we hypothesized that the amount of FFR step-up in pre-PCI pullback recording&#xD;
      would determine the physiologic nature of target stenosis. For example, stenosis with&#xD;
      sufficient step-up of FFR would deserve local treatment with PCI and these lesions would&#xD;
      result in higher percent FFR increase, post-PCI FFR, and better clinical outcome than those&#xD;
      without sufficient amount of FFR step-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, we sought to develop automated algorithm to define physiologic major stenosis&#xD;
      versus minor stenosis using pre-PCI pullback recording.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study cohort consisted with 3 cohort. In order to derive and validate the optimal&#xD;
      cut-off values of FFR step-up amount for physiologic major vs minor stenosis and for&#xD;
      physiologic minor stenosis vs. signal noise, the below 3 cohorts will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Derivation cohort of defining the optimal cut off value of FFR step-up amount for&#xD;
           physiologic major vs minor stenosis and for physiologic minor stenosis vs. signal noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The cohort of no coronary atherosclerosis confirmed by both angiography and&#xD;
           intravascular ultrasound will be derived from patients with heart transplantation&#xD;
           (NCT02798731).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The cohort of significant focal or diffuse obstructive coronary artery disease with&#xD;
           functional significance defined by FFR&lt;=0.80 will be derived from post-PCI registry of&#xD;
           Samsung Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Internal validation cohort will be post-PCI registry of Samsung Medical Center which&#xD;
           enrolled 236 patients who underwent both pre- and post-PCI physiologic assessment after&#xD;
           angiographically successful PCI using 2nd generation drug-eluting stent. Among this&#xD;
           cohort, 234 patients with available pre-PCI pullback recording will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. External validation cohort will be COE-PERSPECTIVE registry (NCT01873560) which enrolled&#xD;
           patients who underwent PCI for lesions with FFR&lt;=0.80 and underwent post-PCI physiologic&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the 835 patients, 252 patients with available pre-PCI pullback recording will be&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the association between physiologic major, minor, or mixed stenosis classified using the&#xD;
      optimal cut-off values of FFR step-up amount for physiologic major vs minor stenosis and for&#xD;
      physiologic minor stenosis vs. signal noise, the patient level pooled data of both Samsung&#xD;
      Medical Center registry and COE-PERSPECTIVE registry will be used.&#xD;
