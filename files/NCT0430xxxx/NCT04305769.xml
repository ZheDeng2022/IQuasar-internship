  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the optimal dose&#xD;
      and safety of oral alanyl-glutamine between 4, 24, and 44 g doses administered for 10 days&#xD;
      with standard therapy among first time incident cases of uncomplicated C. difficile infection&#xD;
      (CDI) in hospitalized persons aged 65 or older. Our hypothesis is that alanyl-glutamine&#xD;
      supplementation will decrease recurrence and mortality from CDI and these outcomes will be&#xD;
      associated with improvement of inflammatory markers and restoration of intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, dose-ranging study to&#xD;
      determine optimal effective dose and safety of AQ between 0, 4, 24, and 44 g doses&#xD;
      administered orally for ten days concurrent with standard treatment (oral vancomycin at UVa)&#xD;
      among first time incident cases of uncomplicated CDI in hospitalized persons age 50 and&#xD;
      older. Our hypothesis is that AQ will reduce recurrence (primary outcome) and mortality&#xD;
      (secondary outcome) at 60 days post-treatment. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that alanyl-glutamine supplementation will be associated with decreased intestinal and&#xD;
      systemic inflammation and improvement of intestinal microbial and metabolic profiles. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to enroll 260 patients, equally divided into 4 arms. Upon enrollment,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to either receive AQ at 4, 24, or 44 g or placebo (water).&#xD;
      Study agent is administered once a day, orally or enterally, if feeding tube is present.&#xD;
      Because the investigators are enrolling subjects over a longer period of time, block&#xD;
      randomization will be used to ensure that relative temporal balance is maintained throughout&#xD;
      the trial. Participants will be followed up daily during treatment for adverse event&#xD;
      monitoring and weekly for 60 days post-treatment for recurrences and survival. Blood, urine&#xD;
      and stool specimens will be collected at days 0, 10 and 70 to assay for markers of&#xD;
      inflammation and microbial and metabolic profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data set utilized for all initial baseline feature and demographic reporting will be the&#xD;
      Intention to Treat Analysis Dataset, which will be comprised of all randomized participants.&#xD;
      The primary dataset will be a Modified Intention to Treat Analysis Dataset for all endpoints,&#xD;
      comprised of all participants who took at least one dose of study intervention (placebo or&#xD;
      treatment), regardless of completeness of follow-up outcome data. The Safety Analysis Dataset&#xD;
      will be all participants who took at least one dose of study intervention. The Per Protocol&#xD;
      Analysis Dataset will be those patients who took at least 9 doses of study intervention for 9&#xD;
      days of the treatment period (10 days). Analysis will utilize ANOVA unless statistically&#xD;
      significant differences in the distribution of baseline characteristics or features of&#xD;
      non-normality are detected and relevant, at which point contingency utilization of ANCOVA,&#xD;
      logistic regression, or other approaches as appropriate will be implemented. Treatment group&#xD;
      level rates will be presented as incidence risk ratios relative to the control (placebo)&#xD;
      group with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints will be evaluated on an individual AE by AE event via the DSMB and utilizing&#xD;
      summary statistics during treatment and through duration of follow up. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      presented by System Organ Class and will include information on start and stop date,&#xD;
      severity, projected relationship, expectedness, and outcome and duration (the latter two&#xD;
      after the event is considered to have concluded).&#xD;
