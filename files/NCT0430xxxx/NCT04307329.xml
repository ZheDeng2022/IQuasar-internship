    <textblock>
      In this phase II clinical trial with an explorative nature, the efficacy of the combination&#xD;
      of monalizumab and trastuzumab is assessed in patients with metastatic or locally incurable&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer. Clinical efficacy will be assessed in patients with high stromal&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) or low sTILs in two separate cohorts (higher or equal&#xD;
      to 5% versus lower than 5%). Since the combination of monalizumab and trastuzumab has not&#xD;
      been administered before, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be monitored throughout the&#xD;
      trial using the Pocock-type boundary rules for continuous monitoring of toxicity in phase II&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, 11 patients will be accrued per cohort. If there are 1 or fewer responses&#xD;
      in these 11 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 8 additional patients will be&#xD;
      accrued for a total of 19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start with two cohorts (sTILs high and sTILs low), a total of 22 (2x11)&#xD;
      patients will be included in the first stage. Dependent on the interim analysis (continuation&#xD;
      of no cohorts, 1 or 2 cohorts), a maximum of 38 patients will be included.&#xD;
