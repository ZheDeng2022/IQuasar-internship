  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP0598 Otic&#xD;
      Solution. This study will also evaluate the efficacy of ASP0598 otic solution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study will consist of a dose escalation (single ascending dose - SAD and multiple&#xD;
      ascending dose- MAD) and dose expansion (single dose expansion and/or multiple dose&#xD;
      expansion). Dose escalation will consist of up to 4 cohorts for single ascending dose (SAD)&#xD;
      and up to 2 cohorts for multiple ascending dose (MAD) with different dose levels. For SAD,&#xD;
      after randomization on Day 1, participants will receive ASP0598 Otic Solution or placebo&#xD;
      administration into the affected ear. Participants will return to the site on days 2, 3, 8,&#xD;
      15, 29, and 57 [end of study (EOS)]. Day 3 evaluations will only be performed for cohorts 1,&#xD;
      2 and 3. For MAD, after randomization on Day 1, participants will receive ASP0598 Otic&#xD;
      Solution or placebo administration into the affected ear and will receive additional&#xD;
      treatments into the same ear on Days 15 and 29. Participants will return to the investigative&#xD;
      site on Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 57, and 85 (EOS). Dose expansion will be based on the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy results from an interim analysis. An interim analysis will be conducted after&#xD;
      completion of SAD and again after completion of MAD. If dose expansion is opened, 2 or 3&#xD;
      treatment groups will be selected. If 3 groups are selected, participants will be randomized&#xD;
      in a 1:1:1 ratio of high dose ASP0598 Otic Solution, low dose ASP0598 Otic Solution, and&#xD;
      Placebo. If 2 groups are selected, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio of high&#xD;
      dose ASP0598 Otic Solution and Placebo. For single dose expansion, after randomization on Day&#xD;
      1, participants will receive ASP0598 otic solution or placebo administration into the&#xD;
      affected ear. Participants will return to the investigative site on days 15, 29, 57, and 85&#xD;
      (EOS). For multiple dose expansion, after randomization on Day 1, participants will receive&#xD;
      ASP0598 Otic Solution or placebo administration into the affected ear. Participants will&#xD;
      receive additional treatment in the same ear on Days 15 and 29. In cases where complete&#xD;
      closure is confirmed on either Day 15 or Day 29, no additional treatment is required at those&#xD;
      visit(s). Participants will return to the investigative site on Days 15, 29, 43, 57, 85 and&#xD;
      113 (EOS).&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an IP, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product (IP) whether or not considered related to the IP. A TEAE is defined as an AE observed after starting administration of the study drug through end of study visit. A drug-related TEAE is defined as any TEAE with a causal relationship assessed as &quot;yes&quot; by the investigator.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in bone conduction hearing at 1 kHz by pure tone audiometry (PTA) in SAD</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>PTA is a behavioral test and generally the 1st quantitative hearing test done to assess the nature and degree of hearing loss in adults and in children. This measure involves the peripheral and central auditory systems. Pure tone air conduction and bone conduction tests determine whether or not there is any hearing loss; what type of hearing loss it is (conductive, sensorineural or mixed hearing loss); the frequencies that are affected (configuration); magnitude of hearing loss (intensity) and whether hearing loss is unilateral or bilateral. The result is plotted on an audiogram, which is a graph displaying intensity as a function of frequency.</description>
