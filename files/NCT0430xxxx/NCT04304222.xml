  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth loss is a major dental problem worldwide. A recent study in Singapore found that&#xD;
      approximately one third of adults aged over 65 are living without any natural teeth.&#xD;
      Prevalence of loss of some teeth, or partial edentulism, in this population is estimated to&#xD;
      be even higher. Tooth loss has a series of deleterious consequences for oral and general&#xD;
      health. The high prevalence of tooth loss has resulted in great needs and demands of&#xD;
      prosthetic replacements, posing challenges to the public dental care system in Singapore.&#xD;
      Removable dentures are the most widely and commonly used device to replace missing teeth and&#xD;
      restore oral functions. The removable denture possesses a metal framework that connects other&#xD;
      components of the denture, to ensure rigidity and stability while in function. However, the&#xD;
      current method of fabricating denture frameworks is a complex, error-prone, time-consuming,&#xD;
      and expensive process. Due to the inherent inaccuracies in the materials and technique, fit&#xD;
      of the framework is compromised and undesirable to meet patients' satisfaction. With the new&#xD;
      development of computer aided design and 3D printing metal techniques, it is now possible to&#xD;
      apply digital design and manufacturing for the fabrication of dentures. This proposal aims to&#xD;
      compare the precision and fit, and patient satisfaction, of 3D printed and conventional&#xD;
      casted removable denture frameworks in preclinical and clinical settings.&#xD;

      Tooth loss or edentulism is a major dental problem worldwide, particularly among the senior&#xD;
      population. A recent study in Singapore found that approximately one third of adults aged&#xD;
      over 60 are living with complete edentulism. Prevalence of partial edentulism in this&#xD;
      population is estimated to be even higher. The high prevalence of tooth loss has resulted in&#xD;
      great needs and demands of prosthetic replacements, posing challenges to the public dental&#xD;
      care system in Singapore. Removable denture prosthesis is the most commonly used device to&#xD;
      replace missing teeth and restore oral functions. The removable denture prosthesis possesses&#xD;
      a metal framework that connects the clasps, retainers, base and acrylic teeth, to ensure&#xD;
      rigidity and stability while in function. However, the current way of fabricating denture&#xD;
      frameworks using casting method is a time consuming, complex, error-prone, and expensive&#xD;
      process. Due to the inherent inaccuracies in the materials and technique, the fit of the&#xD;
      framework is compromised and undesirable to meet patients' satisfaction. With recent&#xD;
      developments in computer aided design and additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D&#xD;
      printing or rapid prototyping, the techniques allow for printing of complex metal structures&#xD;
      of high strength, stiffness and chemical resistance. This proposal aims to compare the&#xD;
      precision and fit, and patient's satisfaction, of 3D printed denture frameworks and&#xD;
      eventually translate this to a more efficient denture fabricating process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The removable denture prosthesis is the most commonly used device to replace missing teeth&#xD;
      and restore oral functions in patients with partial and complete edentulism. The fabrication&#xD;
      of framework using conventional methods is time consuming and inaccurate. Thus the ultimate&#xD;
      goal of this study is to enhance the workflow efficiency, improve the fabrication precision&#xD;
      of the device, reduce treatment cost and time, and promote oral function and overall quality&#xD;
      of life of patients. At the same time, the research methods developed from this study is a&#xD;
      platform for the study of new dental devices, with potential applications for new digital&#xD;
      dental practices. Thus, if successful, the deliverables from this research will both advance&#xD;
      dental research, and extend applicable knowledge to the clinic.&#xD;
