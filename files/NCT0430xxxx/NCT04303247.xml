  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapies have gained significant results in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies. There are patients who resisted&#xD;
      anti-CD19 CAR-T cells or with CD19 negative relapse. To make further improvement, combining&#xD;
      CD19 and CD22 as dual-targets for CAR-T cells, which adapt the FasT CAR-T cells manufacture&#xD;
      technology to shorten the manufacture time and maintain the stemness of CAR-T cells. We&#xD;
      launch such a clinical trial using CD19 and CD22 targeted CAR-T cells for patients with&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory B-cell NHL to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD19 and CD22&#xD;
      targeted CAR-T cell therapy.&#xD;
