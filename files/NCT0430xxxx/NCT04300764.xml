  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low mobility is a mediator for poor outcomes of hospital care. Wearable devices will be used&#xD;
      and 2-way texting via patient smartphones to monitor patients' physical activity during&#xD;
      hospitalization with and without gamification to improve patient adherence to existing&#xD;
      guidance on recommended activity. After discharge, investigators will assess patient care&#xD;
      utilization (SNF, inpatient vs home rehab, ED visits, readmission) and conduct validated&#xD;
      surveys on patient function at 30 days after discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization is a common occurrence for older adults; approximately 6.8 million Medicare&#xD;
      seniors experience an admission for acute care in any given year. This is often a sentinel&#xD;
      event in the overall health trajectory of older adults that is complicated by functional&#xD;
      impairment, Skilled Nursing Facility placement, and reduced mobility after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current paradigm, low mobility during hospitalization is largely viewed as a temporary&#xD;
      inconvenience that should not affect overall functional ability or outcomes such nursing home&#xD;
      placement and that patients should return to their previous activity level soon after they&#xD;
      return home without lingering mobility changes. Recent research, however, suggests&#xD;
      disruptions of basic activities of daily life such as mobility (getting out of bed and&#xD;
      walking) may be &quot;traumatic&quot; or &quot;toxic&quot; to older adults with long-term post-hospital effects.&#xD;
      What is lacked is precise data on how much immobility is noxious and how much mobility is&#xD;
      needed to protect against adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of a gamification intervention to&#xD;
      increase physical activity before hospital discharge. Investigators will explore patients'&#xD;
      physical activity while in the hospital and if that differs across floors that have already&#xD;
      deployed a nursing mobility protocol (Founders 10, 11, 12, 14). Investigators will also&#xD;
      explore changes in patient functional status, SNF placement, and 30-day hospital readmission.&#xD;
