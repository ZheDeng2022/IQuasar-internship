      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare and serious blood disorder. It causes the immune&#xD;
      system to turn against bone marrow cells. Standard treatment for SSA is a combination of 3&#xD;
      drugs (Cyclosporine [CsA], Eltrombopag [EPAG], and horse anti-thymocyte globulin [h-ATG]).&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if starting people at a lower dose of CsA with EPAG before giving&#xD;
      them h-ATG is helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if early initiation of oral therapy with CsA and EPAG is safe and effective in&#xD;
      people who have SAA and have not been treated with a course of immunosuppressive therapy and&#xD;
      EPAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 3 and older with SAA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      family history&#xD;
&#xD;
      bone marrow biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      current medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be screened remotely via telephone conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take a lower oral dose of CsA and EPAG. They will take CsA twice a day for&#xD;
      6 months. They will take EPAG for 6 months. Those who cannot visit the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
      within 72 hours will start taking the drugs at home. They will have weekly telephone calls&#xD;
      with NIH staff until they visit the Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may get h-ATG at the Clinical Center for 4 days. For this, they will have a&#xD;
      central line placed. It is a plastic tube inserted into a neck, chest, or arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat most screening tests throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits at the Clinical Center at 3 months, 6 months, and&#xD;
      annually for 5 years after the start of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a life-threatening bone marrow failure characterized by&#xD;
      pancytopenia and a hypocellular marrow. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is curative in&#xD;
      younger patients, but older age and/or lack of a suitable donor have limited application of&#xD;
      this procedure. As an alternative to transplant, immunosuppressive treatment (IST) has&#xD;
      provided durable remissions and similar long term survival [1]. Approximately 2/3 of patients&#xD;
      who receive IST with horse anti-thymocyte globulin (h-ATG) and cyclosporine (CsA) have blood&#xD;
      count recovery, but 25-30% do not respond and 30-40% will relapse. A likely explanation for&#xD;
      partial recovery and relapse is incomplete elimination of auto-reactive T cells and&#xD;
      insufficient stem cell reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a key regulator of hematopoietic stem cell renewal and survival. To&#xD;
      improve the hematologic response rate, our group assessed the addition of eltrombopag (EPAG),&#xD;
      a synthetic mimetic of TPO, to IST in treatment na(SqrRoot) ve SAA. This combination achieved&#xD;
      a higher complete response rate to about 50% and an overall response rate to 80%, both&#xD;
      superior to historic controls [2]. This regimen received FDA approval in November 2018.&#xD;
      Combined therapy is now being tested in a European randomized study. Furthermore, protocols&#xD;
      have been developed internationally to determine whether EPAG and CsA, without ATG, are&#xD;
      sufficient to improve blood counts, in countries where ATG is not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term complications, relapse and clonal evolution, were no worse with the addition of&#xD;
      EPAG than in our historical cohort, but still remain a problem. Clonal evolution occurs in&#xD;
      10-15% of patients and is defined as development of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia with characteristic cytogenetic abnormalities of aneuploidy, especially monosomy 7&#xD;
      or deletion 7q. There are no predictive tools to identify patients at higher risk for either&#xD;
      of these two long term events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because SAA is a rare disease, treatment has been recommended to take place at a specialized&#xD;
      center. However, delays in reaching such centers and initiating therapy are common. From&#xD;
      current understanding of the disease, immune destruction of cells is ongoing during this&#xD;
      period, likely impacting on both short and long term outcomes. We propose early initiation of&#xD;
      lower dose CsA (2mg/kg/day) and EPAG to decrease ongoing immune destruction and stimulate&#xD;
      HSPC while awaiting full work up and transfer to the Clinical Center (CC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test feasibility and safety of initiating oral therapy before&#xD;
      arriving to the NIH, based on diagnostic tests performed by local physicians and&#xD;
      interpretation from experts here. Treatment will be initiated remotely but under complete&#xD;
      guidance and supervision of the research team at the Hematology Branch. All patients except&#xD;
      the ones who achieve complete response will receive standard three drug regimen upon&#xD;
      completion of work up here at the CC. Primary endpoint of the study will be to assess&#xD;
      feasibility and safety as a composite measure of misdiagnosis, non-compliance with the&#xD;
      regimen or failure to establish care at the Clinical Center within 8 weeks of initiating&#xD;
      treatment, and TRSAE (treatment related serious adverse events). Secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      response rates at landmark time points, relapse, overall survival, and clonal evolution.&#xD;

                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for&#xD;

             drug during treatment, and for 7 days after stopping treatment (and for an additional&#xD;
             12 weeks [for genotoxic compounds]) and should not father a child in this period. A&#xD;
             condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as well as during intercourse&#xD;
             with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the drug via semen.&#xD;
