  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stomach cancer is the fifth most common digestive cancer and third main cause of death from&#xD;
      cancer in the world. Modern management of Gastric cancer involves a multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      approach involving surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, gastroenterologists and&#xD;
      oncological radiologists. The most common clinical approach to Gastric adenocarcinoma is to&#xD;
      begin with staging, which usually involves CT scan/ MRI combined with endoscopic US for more&#xD;
      accurate T, N staging. Once the patient is deemed to have locally advanced gastric cancer&#xD;
      (T3/T4,N0/+), a staging laparoscopy is recommended to rule out obvious or microscopic&#xD;
      peritoneal metastatic disease. Additionally, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is initiated and&#xD;
      followed by surgery +/- adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy.This protocol involves the&#xD;
      addition of neoadjuvant HIPEC at the time of diagnostic laparoscopy as well as neoadjuvant&#xD;
      radiation therapy for improved local and systemic control. The goal of this phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-modality approach to treating patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced Gastric cancer by incorporating diagnostic laparoscopy with HIPEC,&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy, followed by surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
      The trial aims to assess this multi-modality approach in inducing pathological complete&#xD;
      response; decreased rates of disease progression during neoadjuvant therapy; and increased&#xD;
      overall, disease-free, and peritoneal disease-free survival.&#xD;
