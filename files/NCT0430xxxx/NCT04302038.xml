    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of potato protein on muscle protein synthesis over a&#xD;
      short-term (a few hours after eating) and longer term (after two weeks of unilateral&#xD;
      resistance exercise). Young women will be randomized to received potato protein&#xD;
      supplementation or placebo in addition to their usual diet. Muscle biopsies will be taken and&#xD;
      the participants will drink doubly labelled water to allow for the measurement of protein&#xD;
      synthesis over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with advancing age, collectively termed&#xD;
      sarcopenia, is a primary risk factor for disability, frailty, and premature mortality. This&#xD;
      is especially true in women, where rapid rates of decline in muscle mass and greater anabolic&#xD;
      resistance (blunting of muscle protein synthesis [MPS] despite availability of amino acids)&#xD;
      are experienced around the time of menopause2. Previous evidence has demonstrated that&#xD;
      resistance exercise is an effective strategy to mitigate muscle loss in older adults,&#xD;
      particularly in conjunction with protein supplementation. Typically, animal-based proteins&#xD;
      are utilized in research studies; however, they may be inaccessible for older women with&#xD;
      limited financial income or simply unattractive to the growing number of women consuming more&#xD;
      plant-based diets. While potatoes contain lower amounts of protein compared to animal&#xD;
      sources, the high biological value (BV~90-100) of potato protein and high consumption rates,&#xD;
      make this food an ideal source of protein in North American diets. In fact, potatoes&#xD;
      contribute roughly 3%-3.5% of the total daily protein intake for adults and plant-based&#xD;
      proteins contribute 60% of dietary protein worldwide. When compared to animal sourced&#xD;
      protein, potatoes are readily available and are a highly sustainable food source.&#xD;
      Consequently, potatoes represent an accessible, cost-effective protein source for the growing&#xD;
      aging population. However, the efficacy of a diet rich in potato protein to stimulate an&#xD;
      increase in integrated rates of MPS, which are the basis for muscle growth, in women has not&#xD;
      been investigated. Therefore, while the eventual target consumer will be all women, young and&#xD;
      old, firstly we will demonstrate the effectiveness of potato based protein to stimulate MPS&#xD;
      in young women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four healthy young women (18-29 yrs) will be recruited to participate in this parallel&#xD;
      group, double blind, randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to either&#xD;
      supplementary isolated potato protein and unilateral resistance training, or unilateral&#xD;
      resistance training alone as placebo (with usual dietary practices, protein clamped at 0.8&#xD;
      g/kg/day). Participants will engage in unilateral resistance training 3 times per wk for 2&#xD;
      wk. To assess the anabolic properties of potato protein, the women in the potato protein&#xD;
      group will ingest 25 g of isolated potato protein 2 times a day. On the day of resistance&#xD;
      exercise one serving will be provided immediately after the cessation of training. The&#xD;
      placebo group will follow the same supplement schedule, but with a placebo. Integrated rates&#xD;
      of myofibrillar MPS will be assessed with the precursor-product method using deuterium&#xD;
      labeled water (70% D2O).&#xD;
