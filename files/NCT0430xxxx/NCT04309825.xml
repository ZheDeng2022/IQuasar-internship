    <textblock>
      Upper GI endoscopies are commonly done by inserting the endoscope through the patient's&#xD;
      mouth. When a patient has a gastrostomy feeding tube, the endoscope can be inserted through&#xD;
      the stomach port opening. The aim is to prove this modification would lead to various health&#xD;
      benefits, including need for lighter anesthesia, rapid recovery time and fewer anesthesia&#xD;
      related adverse reactions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pediatric esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) are commonly used for diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      various GI conditions. Appropriate sedation or anesthesia and analgesia is critical for&#xD;
      enhancing the effectiveness and feasibility of EGD. General anesthesia or deep sedation are&#xD;
      commonly used for this procedure. Midazolam is the most common intravenous sedative in use,&#xD;
      often in combination with ketamine, propofol, meperidine or fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite technical advances in patient monitoring and the safety of anesthesia and sedation&#xD;
      drugs, procedural anesthesia or sedation adverse events may occur. Desaturation during the&#xD;
      procedure is the most common adverse event, followed by vomiting, excessive secretion and&#xD;
      unexpected apnea. Children with aero-digestive pathologies and feeding disorders often carry&#xD;
      significant underlying co-morbidities, increasing their anesthesia risk. Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that caution must be exercised in children with potential airway problems or&#xD;
      uncorrected cardiopulmonary anomalies such as laryngomalacia, chromosomal abnormalities,&#xD;
      tetralogy of fallot and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In addition, this population is often at&#xD;
      increased risk for concurrent respiratory conditions, which may increase the risk for&#xD;
      laryngospasm during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the endoscope is inserted transorally, it may also be an important trigger for&#xD;
      laryngospasm. Alternatives to oral insertion of the endoscope have been described and shown&#xD;
      to be more beneficial than the oral route in some patients. For example, previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that transnasal endoscopies are known to be less of a burden to patients, and have&#xD;
      benefits including fewer effects on respiratory and cardiovascular status and reduced&#xD;
      recovery time after procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, insertion of the endoscope through the gastrocutaneous tract is possible among&#xD;
      patients with a percutaneous gastrostomy feeding tube. This technique has been well described&#xD;
      in the adult population for observation, diagnosis and treatment of various digestive&#xD;
      diseases. As children with aero-digestive and feeding disorders often have a percutaneous&#xD;
      gastrostomy feeding tube, and are at increased risk for anesthesia adverse events,&#xD;
      transgastrostomal endoscopies me be beneficial in this patient population. To date, this&#xD;
      method has not been reported and examined in children undergoing EGDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the feasibility of transgastrostomal EGDs in children Assess the ability to&#xD;
           explore the upper GI tract from proximal esophagus to the second part of the duodenum&#xD;
           and obtain adequate tissue biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the need for anesthesia and sedation In the adult population transgastrostomal&#xD;
           endoscopies are done with no anesthesia or sedation. Previous studies on adult&#xD;
           population have shown that even with lack of sedation, this procedure was not associated&#xD;
           with any decrease of oxygen saturation nor a significant difference in fluctuations of&#xD;
           blood pressures and heart rate in comparison to oral EGDs. As for children, a &quot;lighter&quot;&#xD;
           anesthesia with inhalation with a face mask or sedation with intranasal application of&#xD;
           dexmedetomidine hydrochloride may provide adequate anesthesia or sedation for this&#xD;
           procedure. However, the decision regarding the type of anesthesia used during endoscopy&#xD;
           remains per anesthesiologist discretion and is not part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the benefits of this procedure in comparison to oral EGD Specifically, will&#xD;
           examine the rate of procedural sedation or anesthesia adverse events and patients'&#xD;
           recovery time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will take place at the children's operating room of Yale New Haven Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment to the study will take place on the day of the endoscopy during the pre-procedural&#xD;
      assessment. Eligible patients will be offered to have a transgastrostomal endoscopy instead&#xD;
      of a transoral one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to a transoral EGD, on the patient's arrival to the operating room (OR) the&#xD;
      anesthesia team will obtain vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and&#xD;
      oxygen saturation). Those would be monitored continuously during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the preprocedural assessment is completed, the anesthesiologist will determine the type&#xD;
      of anesthesia: intravenous drugs, gas inhalation or intranasal dexmedetomidine hydrochloride&#xD;
      at a standard dosage of 2 mcg/kg. As &quot;lighter&quot; anesthesia may be used in this study (compared&#xD;
      to transoral EGDs), the depth of anesthesia will be continuously monitored. The patients will&#xD;
      be connected to a bispectral index (BIS) monitor, which identifies changes in&#xD;
      electrophysiologic brain activity during general anesthesia. The BIS monitor, derived from&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) data, has been shown to be a useful cerebral monitor of anesthesia&#xD;
      depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is laid in the supine position, the gastrostomy tube is removed. After&#xD;
      applying a lubricant around the endoscope, it is inserted through the fistural tract and&#xD;
      advanced into the gastric lumen. At this point a standard endoscopy will be conducted (with&#xD;
      no significant changes compared to a transoral EGD). The endoscope is directed to the oral&#xD;
      side and advanced to the esophagogastric junction. The endoscope is retrogradely inserted&#xD;
      through the esophagus, and proximal and distal esophageal biopsies are obtained. The&#xD;
      endoscope is then withdrawn to the stomach and directed to the anal side. The endoscope is&#xD;
      inserted up to the second part of the duodenum from the stoma. Duodenal biopsies are obtained&#xD;
      from the 2nd duodenal part and the duodenal bulb. The endoscope is pulled back to the stomach&#xD;
      and turned back to look around the stoma. Gastric biopsies are obtained from the body of the&#xD;
      stomach and the pre-pyloric region. After observation of the upper gastrointestinal tract,&#xD;
      air is suctioned and the endoscope is withdrawn from the stoma. The gastrostomy tube is&#xD;
      placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure length is estimated at 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main differences between a standard transoral endoscopy and a trandgastrotsotmal one are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Insertion of the endoscope through the G-tube port and not the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The need to remove the existing G-tube and replace it once the endoscopy is done&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Potential use of &quot;lighter&quot; sedation. In this study the depth of anesthesia will be&#xD;
           monitored with a BIS monitor. This monitor is not used during a standard EGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure's efficacy, length and adverse reaction will be compared to the standard&#xD;
      transoral endoscopy.&#xD;
