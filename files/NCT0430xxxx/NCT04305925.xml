      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      Magnetic-Resonance(MR)-ultrasound image fusion-guided transrectal-based focal laser ablation&#xD;
      (FLA) of prostate cancer using the Orion System, an investigational laser-based interstitial&#xD;
      irradiation/thermal soft-tissue ablation system. Safety and feasibility will be determined by&#xD;
      analyzing the number, type, and severity of adverse events.&#xD;

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of MR-ultrasound image&#xD;
      fusion-guided transrectal-based focal laser ablation (FLA) of prostate cancer using the Orion&#xD;
      System, an investigational laser-based interstitial irradiation/thermal soft-tissue ablation&#xD;
      system. Safety and feasibility will be determined by analyzing the number, type, and severity&#xD;
      of adverse events. In addition, changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be&#xD;
      evaluated using Expanded Prostate Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP), Memorial&#xD;
      Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC), and Decision Regret Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label early feasibility/pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      the Orion System. In this study, the investigators intend to use the investigational Orion&#xD;
      system to deploy and monitor thermal energy in cancerous regions of the prostate, identified&#xD;
      by MRI and confirmed by targeted biopsy. MRI guidance will be achieved by MRI/ultrasound&#xD;
      fusion, overlaying stored MRI images upon real-time ultrasound images. Interstitial laser&#xD;
      treatments would be achieved by inserting the fiber into the cancerous regions guided by the&#xD;
      Artemis image-fusion device. Applications of laser energy up to 15 watts of power will be&#xD;
      used to treat the target region. Subjects will return to clinic 1 week, 1 month, and every 3&#xD;
      months until one year post-FLA to be monitored for adverse events and complete Health Related&#xD;
      Quality of Life (HRQOL) questionnaires. Biomarker (PSA) kinetics will also be monitored.&#xD;
