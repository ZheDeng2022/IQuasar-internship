  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to determine if face masks that can warm and humidify air&#xD;
      can improve overall asthma control and markers of airway health during exercise in cold dry&#xD;
      environments. We will investigate the potential protective benefits of the face masks against&#xD;
      exercise induced asthma during 1) a &quot;one-off&quot; bout of exercise in a cold dry environment and&#xD;
      2) over the course of a four week period, exercising three times per week in a cold dry&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is recognised as a trigger for individuals with asthma, however regular&#xD;
      physical activity is considered to be important in the overall management of the condition.&#xD;
      There is clear evidence that demonstrates if individuals with asthma engage with regular&#xD;
      physical activity they will improve their physical fitness and breathing control, whilst at&#xD;
      the same time experiencing reductions in asthma severity, symptoms, and medication use. In&#xD;
      addition undertaking regular exercise reduces the risk of developing other diseases such as&#xD;
      heart disease or type 2 diabetes. Despite the clear health benefits of engaging in regular&#xD;
      physical activity there is evidence that some people with asthma avoid physical activity due&#xD;
      to shortness of breath, worsening asthma symptoms during physical activity or fear of&#xD;
      experiencing such symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity in cold dry environments exacerbates symptoms for many individuals with&#xD;
      asthma resulting in greater avoidance of physical activity during the winter months. The&#xD;
      increased risk of asthma from exercising in cold environments has led to Asthma UK advising&#xD;
      susceptible individuals to avoid exercise outside in cold environments&#xD;
      (http://www.asthma.org.uk/advice-exercise). This places obvious constraints and limitations&#xD;
      on individuals with asthma for whom the aim of optimum treatment is to allow them to follow a&#xD;
      &quot;normal&quot; lifestyle. Indeed, exposure to cold air on exertion is relevant to a significant&#xD;
      proportion of individuals with asthma who engage with outdoor physical activity as part of&#xD;
      their daily routine; e.g. cycle-commuting to work, outdoor construction workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mask that is able to warm and humidify the air during exercise may provide a solution for&#xD;
      asthmatic individuals susceptible to cold dry environments. There are a limited number of&#xD;
      small studies that provide tentative evidence suggesting masks which warm and humidify air&#xD;
      can protect against reductions in lung function during and following physical activity.&#xD;
      However, it is unknown whether the use of these masks provides protection against the&#xD;
      mechanisms that drive asthmatic symptoms. It is also unclear whether using the masks over a&#xD;
      prolonged period of time significantly reduces asthma severity, inhaler use, or presence of&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to determine if face masks that can warm and humidify air&#xD;
      can improve overall asthma control and markers of airway health during exercise in cold dry&#xD;
      environments. We will investigate the potential protective benefits of the face masks against&#xD;
      exercise induced asthma during 1) a &quot;one-off&quot; bout of exercise in a cold dry environment and&#xD;
      2) over the course of a four week period, exercising three times per week in a cold dry&#xD;
