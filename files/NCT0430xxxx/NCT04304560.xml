  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a well-recognized independent risk factor for heart&#xD;
      failure (HF). Whereas the prevalence of HF in the general population is 1-4%, it reaches&#xD;
      approximately 12% in T2DM patients. In 1972, Rubler reported a specific diabetes-associated&#xD;
      cardiac injury called diabetic cardiomyopathy. This cardiomyopathy is defined by ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction occurring without coronary disease or hypertension. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is&#xD;
      also characterized by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and myocardial&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large body of work indicates that diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with altered&#xD;
      cardiac energy metabolism. Indeed, in obese T2DM patients, heart lipid uptake is increased.&#xD;
      Several studies support that free fatty acid (FFA) accumulation leads to the increased&#xD;
      production of diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramides and reactive oxygen species (ROS), affecting&#xD;
      cardiac insulin sensitivity and cardiac contractility. On the other hand, hyperglycemia and&#xD;
      glucose overload have been involved in cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in the context of&#xD;
      T2DM and obesity. The diabetic heart is simultaneously characterized by impaired&#xD;
      insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and obvious signs of glucose overload, such as ROS and&#xD;
      advanced glycation end-product (AGE) production as well as hexosamine pathway chronic&#xD;
      activation. Interestingly, when comparing diabetic and nondiabetic obese patients, we&#xD;
      previously demonstrated that hyperglycemia per se plays a central role in the impaired&#xD;
      cardiac mitochondrial activity associated with myocardial contractile dysfunction.&#xD;

        4. 60 participants who are Type 2 Diabetes and HFrEF Patients will be recruited from the&#xD;
           Elmenoufia Hospital, Cardiology department, Elmenoufia University,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The 60 participants will be randomly assigned into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control groups: receives the standard therapy for DM &amp;HFrEF.&#xD;

&#xD;
        6. All patients will be submitted to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Full patient history and clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine follow up before and after each visit. (complete blood picture, liver&#xD;
                function tests, renal function tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Echocardiography before the start and after completion of the study which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Conventional echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All Study participants underwent standard echocardiography with Doppler studies,&#xD;
                using a GE vivid 9 machine all subjects were examined in the left lateral Decubitus&#xD;
                position according to the recommendations of the American Society of&#xD;
                Echocardiography (24).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1) Assessment of LV dimensions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  M-mode measurements were obtained from left parasternal with special Attention was&#xD;
                given not to include overlying trabeculations in the ventricular septum or&#xD;
                posterior wall measurements, which may overestimate thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measurements were taken at the end diastole -defined as the beginning of the QRS&#xD;
                complex -but preferably using the widest LV cavity diameter, and at the end systole&#xD;
                -using the narrowest LV cavity diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The diastolic measurements obtained were the interventricular septal wall&#xD;
                thickness, the LV internal diameter at end diastole and posterior wall thickness.&#xD;
                In systole, the LV systolic diameter was measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2-Systolic function assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The measurement of LV ejection fraction (%) and LV fractional shortening (%) were&#xD;
                performed to evaluate the systolic function using M mode tracing. Ejection fraction&#xD;
                (EF %) was calculated as percentage change of LV chamber volumes between diastole&#xD;
                and systole from apical four and two chamber views using modified biplane Simpson's&#xD;
                rule. (25)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NB: Ejection fraction ≥ 55 % indicated a normal systolic function and &lt;55 % is&#xD;
                considered systolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3-Diastolic Function assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pulsed - wave Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate diastolic LV function;&#xD;
                Doppler studies were recorded from the apical 4- chamber view, with a sample volume&#xD;
                positioned with in the inflow portion of the LV, midway between the annular margins&#xD;
                of mitral valve. Mitral velocity profiles were digitized from velocity of the&#xD;
                Doppler tracings.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Waves measured by pulsed conventional Doppler:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The peak E (early rapid ventricular filling) wave velocity: It is an early filling&#xD;
                wave occurs in the early diastole as the pressure in the left ventricle falls below&#xD;
                that in the left atrium (N = 50 - 85 cm / sec).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Peak A (late ventricular filling) wave velocity: It is a late filling wave&#xD;
                occurs as the left atrial contraction causes acceleration of the flow from the left&#xD;
                atrium to the left ventricle (N = 35 - 5 0 cm/sec). (26)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  E / A ratio: The ratio between the early filling and the late filling wave (N = 1 -&#xD;
                2).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  N.B Diastolic dysfunction is considered if DT &gt; 220 ms and E / A ratio &lt; 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tissue Doppler Imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  By using GE Vivid 9 echocardiography machine programmed with tissue Doppler&#xD;
                options, tissue Doppler imaging was performed in the apical views (4- chamber, and&#xD;
                long axis), continuous wave Doppler tissue imagining was obtained by positioning a&#xD;
                sample volume at the basal septal and lateral mitral annuli. Myocardial velocity&#xD;
                was detected throughout each cardiac cycle and the average value was recorde&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Three major velocities were recorded at the annular sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The peak major positive systolic velocity when the annulus moved towards the apex&#xD;
                (Sm) (N = 9.1 ± 1.2 cm/sec).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Two peaks of major negative velocities when the annulus moved back towards the base&#xD;
                during early (Em) (N = 14.7 ± 314 cm/sec) and late (Am) phase of diastole (N = 11.0&#xD;
                s ± 2.3 cm/sec).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  E/Em ratio was also calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) is measured from the end of the systolic velocity&#xD;
                to the beginning of the early diastolic velocity (N = 59 ± 22 cm/sec).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic dysfunction if peak systolic velocity &lt; 8 cm / sec.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diastolic dysfunction is considered if IVRT &gt; 90 ms or E/A&lt;1 or E/Em&gt;10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parasternal basal and apical short-axis views, as well as three standard apical views,&#xD;
           were acquired. All grey scale images were obtained at a frame rate of 77 ± 6 frame/s&#xD;
           (range: 63-99 frames/s) using second harmonic imaging. While acquiring images, the LV&#xD;
           basal short-axis view was identified by the presence of mitral leaflets, while excluding&#xD;
           the mitral annulus and the apical view was identified by the presence of a LV cavity in&#xD;
           the absence of papillary muscles. We made every effort to obtain the LV cross-section as&#xD;
           circular as possible. For each view, three consecutive cardiac cycles were acquired&#xD;
           during a breath hold and digitally stored on a magneto-optical disc for offline&#xD;
           analysis. Measurement of strain and rotational parameters was performed offline using&#xD;
           dedicated software (Echo-Pac PC, version 10.0; GE Medical systems)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A region of interest was manually adjusted to include the entire myocardial thickness;&#xD;
           care was taken to avoid including the pericardium in the region of interest. The&#xD;
           software then selected stable speckles within the myocardium and tracked these speckles&#xD;
           frame-by-frame throughout the cardiac cycle. Counterclockwise rotation was marked as a&#xD;
           positive value and clockwise rotation as a negative value when viewed from the LV apex.&#xD;
           LV twist was defined as the net difference (in degrees) of apical and basal rotations at&#xD;
           isochronal time points and was auto computed by the software from the values of the&#xD;
           basal and apical rotation. LV torsion was then calculated as the ratio between LV twist&#xD;
           (in degrees) and the LV diastolic longitudinal length (in cm) between the LV apex and&#xD;
           the mitral plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pulse wave Doppler tracing obtained from the LV outflow tract was used to identify the&#xD;
           timing of aortic valve opening and closure.&#xD;
