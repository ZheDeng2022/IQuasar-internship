  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies on single-use ancillaries are still few; medico-economic benefits have to be&#xD;
      assessed regarding their design and use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A foreseeable increase in the number of surgeries in the future, tends to change the&#xD;
      techniques and consequently to question the medico-economic context. Single-use ancillaries&#xD;
      attempt to provide solutions to today's imperatives and could be relevant from a global&#xD;
      medico-economic point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the moment, the conventional ancillaries for TKA are reused after sterilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to improve the fluidity of the intervention process with cost&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After validation of the inclusion criteria, the surgeon will perform the randomization (1:1):&#xD;
      single-use ancillary group or conventional ancillary group. Only the medical team and the&#xD;
      block staff will be informed about the ancillary group, not the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the single-use ancillary does not induce any modification of the surgical&#xD;
      technique for fitting a TKA. The surgical approach is unchanged and is specific to the&#xD;
      surgeon. The appearance and use of the single-use ancillary are similar to the conventional&#xD;
      ancillary except for the materials used for their design. Please note that a preliminary&#xD;
      training at the beginning of the study will be carried out with the different investigators&#xD;
      so that they can handle the different medical devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 48 participants will be randomized. The medico-economics assessments will be&#xD;
      performed for 20 patients (10 per group) by micro-costing to evaluate the preoperative,&#xD;
      intraoperative and post-operative costs : reconditioning time, sterilization and transport&#xD;
      time, preparation time and duration of intervention. The qualitative score of subjective&#xD;
      assessment of the operator's perception of the ancillary measured during the intervention.&#xD;
      The participants will evaluate their QOL by completing a questionnaire 3 month and 12 month&#xD;
      postoperative. The safety parameters will also be collected.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean production cost of the surgical intervention (total knee arthroplasty) each arm, from an hospital perspective, using a micro-costing approach with items reported in a eCRF</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Mean production cost of the surgical intervention in each arm is calculated thanks to 2 steps : 1) Quantification of health resources consumed during the surgical intervention (transport, cleaning, reconditionning sterilization of ancillaries, time spent by medical staff, nurses and materials used. (These data will be collected on a paper sheet and reported in a eCRF for 20 patients (10 per group)) ; 2) Valuation of health resources consumed with hospital cost accounting, mean wages, and purchase prices of materials.</description>
