  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, pain management during childbirth has been a primary concern in the obstetric&#xD;
      community. In recent decades, childbirth care providers have been witnessing, especially in&#xD;
      developed countries, a real revolution in terms of approaches around this unique moment of&#xD;
      birth. This is how perinatal professionals are no longer concerned only with medical&#xD;
      follow-up and the smooth running of pregnancy or the well-being of the newborn, but also with&#xD;
      overall support for women by promoting their active participation in the childbirth process.&#xD;
      To this end, several methods of pain management are offered to women during labor. The more&#xD;
      documented are: locoregional (epidural) anesthesia and acupuncture. These two methods are&#xD;
      rarely available in Tunisian public maternity hospitals where 80% of deliveries are managed.&#xD;
      In addition, Childbirth training workshops, psychoeducation and psychosocial couple-based&#xD;
      programs are not available in tunisian public maternities. For example, only one public&#xD;
      structure offers a painless delivery program at Farhat Hached Sousse hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In consequence, women arriving at the labor room, are largely unaware of the basic principles&#xD;
      of childbirth process. They do not know how to manage their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the application of the GUILLARME® method during labor is based on the use of a flow&#xD;
      regulating device (Winner Flow + URO-MG®). By regulating the flow of breath during a uterine&#xD;
      contraction, it allows better pain management. Despite a positive feedback not only from&#xD;
      parturients but also from midwives who practiced this method, actually investigators have&#xD;
      only subjective evaluation with no real measurable and objective impact on pain levels during&#xD;
      childbirth process. Consequently, investigators are conducting this scientific study whose&#xD;
      main objective is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate changes in pain level with the use of regulated expiratory method during&#xD;
      childbirth process.&#xD;

      of childbirth process. They do not know how to manage their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to overcome this situation, we introduced the GUILLARME® method to the obstetric&#xD;
      care unit at Mongi Slim la Marsa hospital in January 2018. This method was originally a&#xD;
      postpartum abdomino-perineal rehabilitation technique. It allows a functional abdominal&#xD;
      rehabilitation by combining a regulated breath in a specific mouthpiece and an abdominal&#xD;
      stimulation triggered by this same breath. The use of this method was extended to labor and&#xD;
      childbirth. In fact, the application of the GUILLARME® method during labor is based on the&#xD;
      use of a flow regulating device (Winner Flow + URO-MG®). By regulating the flow of breath&#xD;
      during a uterine contraction, it allows better pain management. Despite a positive feedback&#xD;
      not only from parturients but also from midwives who practiced this method, actually&#xD;
      investigators have only subjective evaluation with no real measurable and objective impact on&#xD;
      pain levels during childbirth process. Consequently, investigators are conducting this&#xD;
      scientific study whose main objective is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate changes in pain level with the use of regulated expiratory method during&#xD;
      childbirth process.&#xD;

An index value close to 100 corresponds to a prominent parasympathetic tone (low stress level, analgesia) and a value close to 0 corresponds to a prominent sympathetic tone (high stress level, nociception). In parturients during labor or postoperative awake patients in the recovery room, a negative linear relationship between analgesia nociception index and pain scores is documented.</description>
