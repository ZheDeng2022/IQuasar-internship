  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
      Exercise is suggested as a way to improve fatigue, but it is not clear what the effects of&#xD;
      exercise are on fatigue - especially in people with progressive MS. Therefore, this study&#xD;
      aims to test the feasibility of a tailored exercise programme to help improve fatigue in&#xD;
      people with progressive MS. To do this people with progressive MS who are experiencing&#xD;
      fatigue will be randomly allocated to receive either a tailored exercise programme, a&#xD;
      standard exercise programme, or their usual care. Both exercise programmes will be 8 weeks&#xD;
      long and require participants to attend Falkirk Community Hospital twice a week. The standard&#xD;
      exercise programme involves a moderate intensity interval training session using a stationary&#xD;
      exercise bike. The tailored exercise programme is similar to the standard exercise programme,&#xD;
      as participants will be prescribed the same type and duration of exercise; however, the&#xD;
      difference between the 2 programmes is that the intensity of exercise performed during each&#xD;
      session of the tailored exercise programme is dictated by the participant's level of fatigue.&#xD;
      Participants will complete an exercise test, walking test, and questionnaires relating to&#xD;
      fatigue, quality of life, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, and cognition before and 1&#xD;
      week after completing the exercise programme.&#xD;

      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of delivering a tailored exercise intervention to&#xD;
      manage fatigue in people with progressive forms of MS. To do this, a randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial design will be used to assess the feasibility of delivering a tailored exercise&#xD;
      intervention to manage fatigue in people with progressive forms of MS in comparison to a&#xD;
      standard (untailored) exercise group and usual care control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to recruit up to 45 people with progressive MS who are experiencing&#xD;
      moderate-severe levels of fatigue from MS clinics and outpatient physiotherapy services&#xD;
      within NHS Forth Valley. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either the&#xD;
      tailored exercise programme, the standard exercise programme, or their usual care. All&#xD;
      outcome measures will be recorded at baseline and post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both exercise programmes will require participants to attend Falkirk Community Hospital twice&#xD;
      a week for 8 weeks - therefore, participants will receive 16 exercise sessions in total. All&#xD;
      exercise sessions will be supervised by a physiotherapist and they will provide participants&#xD;
      with any support that is required. The standard exercise programme involves aerobic-based&#xD;
      interval training delivered on a bicycle ergometer. Each exercise session will be 30 minutes&#xD;
      in duration, and will be broken down into a 3 minute warm-up, 24 minutes of interval&#xD;
      training, and a 3 minute cool-down. During the interval training component, participants will&#xD;
      be asked to perform 6 intervals that require them to exercise at a moderate intensity (&gt;70%&#xD;
      heart rate reserve) for 2 minutes followed by 2 minutes of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tailored exercise programme is similar to the standard exercise programme - participants&#xD;
      will still be required to attend Falkirk Community Hospital twice a week for 8 weeks, and&#xD;
      they will perform the same type and duration of exercise as the standard exercise programme.&#xD;
      However in order to tailor exercise to fatigue, participants will be asked to rate their&#xD;
      current levels of fatigue before exercising - this rating will then be compared to the&#xD;
      baseline score. If the participant's fatigue is worse, they will be offered the option of&#xD;
      performing a lower intensity of exercise for that specific session (&gt;50% heart rate reserve).&#xD;
      In addition, participants will also be asked to monitor their fatigue in a symptom diary for&#xD;
      2 days following each exercise session. If fatigue is worsened by exercise and remains&#xD;
      elevated for 2 days after 2 consecutive exercise sessions, then they will also be offered the&#xD;
      option of performing the lower intensity exercise prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the usual care control group will continue to receive their standard care&#xD;
      independent of this study. Participants will also receive an information booklet about&#xD;
      fatigue that is freely available from the UK MS Society. This booklet provides general&#xD;
      information about MS-related fatigue, strategies to self-monitor and self-manage symptoms,&#xD;
      and directs them to contact health professionals involved in their care for support if&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
