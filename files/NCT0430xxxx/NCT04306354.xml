      Primary Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Withdrawal symptoms Change from baseline withdrawal symptoms (hospital admission) at the&#xD;
           end of detoxification treatment (21 days) assessed by Cocaine Selective Severity&#xD;
           Assessment (CSSA, minimum and maximum scores: 0 - 112). After treatment, the&#xD;
           oxytocin-treated group is expected to have significantly lower withdrawal scores (better&#xD;
           outcome) than the other groups (30%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anxiety symptoms Change from baseline anxiety symptoms (hospital admission) at the end&#xD;
           of detoxification treatment (21 days) assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes&#xD;
           Measurement Information System Short Form scale (PROMIS, minimum and maximum raw scores:&#xD;
           8 - 40). After treatment, the oxytocin-treated group is expected to show lower anxiety&#xD;
           scores (better outcome) compared to the other groups (30%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Depression symptoms Change from baseline depressive symptoms (hospital admission) at the&#xD;
           end of detoxification treatment (21 days) assessed by the Quick Inventory of Depressive&#xD;
           Symptomatology Self-Report scale (QIDS-SR, minimum and maximum scores: 0 - 27). After&#xD;
           treatment, the oxytocin-treated group is expected to show lower depressive scores&#xD;
           (better outcome) compared to the other groups (30%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neuroleptic Dose Change Dose change of neuroleptic medications used during&#xD;
           hospitalization for agitation or irritability (expected 25% lower).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adherence of outpatient treatment Rate of adherence of outpatient treatment six months&#xD;
           after discharge (expected to be 20% higher) assessed by reviewing the medical records of&#xD;
           each patient within the outpatient program. If patient would be enrolled in the&#xD;
           outpatient program after six months from detoxification she will be considered adhered&#xD;
           to the program (higher rates means better outcome).&#xD;

    <masking_description>On the eve of the eighth day of hospitalization, a person in charge of the research team performed a randomization of the participants exchanged in blocks, according to the methods of Schulz and collaborators (SCHULZ; GRIMES, 2002). The responsible person did not have contact with the participants. The blocks were made up of 12 participants each, and the ratio was maintained at 4: 4: 4, in order to reduce the chances of the groups getting mixed amounts. The members of the research team responsible for data collection, the technical team of the inpatient unit and the participants did not know to what condition each patient had been allocated.&#xD;
These procedures guaranteed the randomization and double blinding of the study.</masking_description>
