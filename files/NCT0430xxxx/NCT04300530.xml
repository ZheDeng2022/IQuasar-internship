  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections are an important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Infections vary&#xD;
      greatly in severity and can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa. The rapid&#xD;
      assessment of a patient to determine whether they have an infection and whether to treat with&#xD;
      antibiotics is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW) is a (CE marked) new biomarker that has recently been&#xD;
      studied in the emergency department (ED). This novel biomarker, which is currently available&#xD;
      as a part of the panel of results from full blood count, holds the promise of reducing&#xD;
      unnecessary antibiotic use and improving the outcome of patient's infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis (blood poisoning) is a life-threatening condition that affects millions of people&#xD;
      worldwide. The chance of dying from sepsis increases if there is a delay in treatment with&#xD;
      the right antibiotics, but also using antibiotics incorrectly might lead to antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance, which is dangerous for patients in the long term, as treatments might no longer&#xD;
      work for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An antibiotic is a substance produced naturally by microorganisms or synthetically by&#xD;
      chemists in a laboratory. Antibiotics are capable of inhibiting the growth of or killing&#xD;
      bacteria but are not effective against the viruses that cause many illnesses. The&#xD;
      inappropriate use of antibiotics for these types of non-bacterial infections as well as the&#xD;
      more frequent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has caused the emergence of newer strains of&#xD;
      bacteria that are resistant to many antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid diagnostics are essential to accurately identify cases of sepsis that require&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy; particularly since clinical criteria alone is often insufficient to avoid&#xD;
      misclassifying patients with sepsis who require antibiotics. However, the high costs of&#xD;
      current laboratory markers, along with the variable level of evidence supporting their use in&#xD;
      sepsis and respiratory infections means that these are not in routine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to make use of data collected routinely at St. George's University&#xD;
      Hospital to evaluate the accuracy of MDW as a marker for sepsis in adult patients admitted to&#xD;
      the ED, as well as to explore its usefulness in supporting clinical decisions related to the&#xD;
      discontinuation of antibiotic treatment in hospitalised adult patients. This observational&#xD;
      study will not involve changes in patient management as all the data would be analysed&#xD;
      retrospectively.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an observational, cross-sectional (single-gate) study comparing the results of the&#xD;
      index test (MDW) against different reference standards (operational definitions). One of&#xD;
      these references identifies a situation when IV antibiotics need to start (i.e. sepsis&#xD;
      diagnosis) and the other, a situation when they need to be discontinued (i.e. clinical&#xD;
      improvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One reference standard will be Sepsis 3 definition and will be operationalised in ED using&#xD;
      qSOFA ≥ 2. This is used in ED as a bedside score to identify patients with suspected sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the exploratory objectives for this ED dataset, sepsis will be operationalised&#xD;
      using other common scores (SOFA, NEWS2, REDS, and Simplified-MISSED scores), and also against&#xD;
      the reference standard for confirming septicaemia (blood culture results).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second reference standard will be expert clinical criteria. Antimicrobial stewardship&#xD;
      groups and care team review antibiotic treatments for all inpatients at regular intervals.&#xD;
      Decisions on whether discontinuation (due to clinical improvement) is indicated is ultimately&#xD;
      based on clinical criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the exploratory objectives for the dataset of in-patients, sepsis will be&#xD;
      operationalised using the results of blood cultures. Also, different subpopulations will be&#xD;
      described on the basis of MDW levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalised patients admitted through ED but not in the sepsis pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI), surgical operations, and IV antibiotic treatment&#xD;
           modification due to lack of clinical improvement and/or antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-bacterial causes of septic syndrome (i.e. surgical tissue injury, myocardial&#xD;
           infraction, pancreatitis, pulmonary-thromboembolism, influenza, RSV, autoimmune and&#xD;
           neoplastic processes).&#xD;
