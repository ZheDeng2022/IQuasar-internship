             in situ of the cervix) unless in complete remission with no therapy for a minimum of&#xD;
             three years or have received an autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active bacterial or fungal infection or a detectable viral infection (for&#xD;
