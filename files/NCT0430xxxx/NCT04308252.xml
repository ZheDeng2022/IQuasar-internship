  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine stool microbiome composition and biomarkers that&#xD;
      are differentially abundant and those that are associated with response to treatment (eg,&#xD;
      anticonvulsant drugs).&#xD;

      Recent research suggests that the intestinal microbiota plays a central role in human health,&#xD;
      and may play a role in a variety of central nervous system disorders, including seizure&#xD;
      susceptibility. The microbiota has been shown to be associated with changes in factors&#xD;
      relevant to neurotransmission, including neurotransmitter signaling, synaptic protein&#xD;
      expression, long-term potentiation, and myelination. In addition to the microbiota's&#xD;
      potential role in general neurotransmission, research suggests that the gut microbiome may&#xD;
      differ between patients with pharmaco resistant and pharmaco-sensitive epilepsies. In support&#xD;
      of this idea, ketogenic diet has been used as an alternative treatment for those with&#xD;
      pharmaco-resistant epilepsy and there are indications of possible direct interactions of&#xD;
      anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) with the intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
