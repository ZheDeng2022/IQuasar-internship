  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A selective neural stimulation as the investigators propose allows to stimulate several&#xD;
      muscles via a single electrode. Neural stimulation requires less energy for muscle&#xD;
      activation. In our approach, 2 electrodes will be implanted above the elbow on the median and&#xD;
      radial nerves. This considerably reduces the number of implanted elements and therefore i)&#xD;
      the risk of infection, ii) the risk of failure, iii) the surgical risk through minimally&#xD;
      invasive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main hypothesis is that multipolar neural electrical stimulation of the median nerve&#xD;
      (flexion) and the radial nerve (extension) allows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on the one hand, a selective, individualized motor activation (muscle by muscle)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on the other hand, a synergistic motor activation (association of several muscles) for&#xD;
           the purpose of production of functional movements.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electrical stimulation of the muscles has been used for decades in rehabilitation units&#xD;
      specializing in the treatment of spinal cord injuries. It has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      building muscle and preventing muscle atrophy following spinal cord injury (SCI) or stroke.&#xD;
      It can also be used to reduce spasticity and above all to promote functionally useful motor&#xD;
      control. It is then a Functional Electric Stimulation (FES). In the quadriplegic person&#xD;
      marked by a severe motor deficiency of the upper limbs, FES is today the only technique&#xD;
      allowing to restore a functional gripping movements in the case where the active muscular&#xD;
      resources below the elbows are missing or too weak to allow tendon transfer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like &quot;Freehand&quot;, all the devices using FES directly stimulate the muscles (surface,&#xD;
      intramuscular or epimysial electrodes) and therefore require a high number of internal&#xD;
      components with a theoretical risk of infection and greater rejection. since each muscle must&#xD;
      be activated via an electrode (up to 12 in the case of &quot;FreeHand&quot;). The investigators propose&#xD;
      instead selective neural stimulation as it allows stimulating several muscles via a single&#xD;
      electrode. Neural stimulation requires less energy for muscle activation. In our approach, 2&#xD;
      electrodes will be implanted above the elbow on the median and radial nerves. This&#xD;
      considerably reduces the number of implanted elements and therefore i) the risk of infection,&#xD;
      ii) the risk of failure, iii) the surgical risk thanks to minimally invasive surgery. The&#xD;
      procedure consisted of placing a multi-contact cuff electrode around the radial or median&#xD;
      nerves and observing the effects of electrical neural stimulation in terms of muscle&#xD;
      selectivity, force produced and movement induced. In a previous study, the investigators&#xD;
      already proved through acute intra operative testing (under Ethics Committee approval,&#xD;
      #NCT03721861) that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No failure of the electrodes or of the stimulator was noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For all of the 8 subjects, it was possible to selectively stimulate muscle groups to&#xD;
           obtain the opening of the thumb and fingers, or the flexion of the thumb, fingers and&#xD;
           obtaining possibly functional grip like the forceps with opposition of the thumb or&#xD;
           palmar grip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second feasibility study (Ethics committee registration #2016-A00711-50) with 17&#xD;
      quadriplegic patients assessed the subject's ability to use voluntary contractions of sus&#xD;
      lesional muscles (EMG recordings in 8 subjects) or voluntary movements of shoulders (inertial&#xD;
      recordings in 9 subjects) to control the movements of a robotic hand or the triggering of an&#xD;
      electrical surface stimulation of the muscles of the forearm. All of the patients managed to&#xD;
      master the proposed interface after a short familiarization period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the results of these two studies, the investigator wish to take an additional&#xD;
      step in the development of a gripping assistance device for patients with spinal cord injury:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - by proposing the implantation of two cuff electrodes with percutaneous connection on the&#xD;
      arm of quadriplegic people. The electrodes will be kept in place for a period of 1 month&#xD;
      before being definitively explanted. An implanted cable will connect the electrodes to an&#xD;
      external connector.&#xD;
