      The objective of the study is to induce a meaningful progression-free survival benefit in&#xD;
      patients with Malign Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) after progression on first line standard&#xD;
      platinum doublet chemotherapy, by treating with nivolumab and ipilimumab with or without UV1&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have investigated the use of checkpoint inhibition in Malign Pleural&#xD;
      Mesothelioma (MPM). Most of them are small studies investigating the efficacy of single-agent&#xD;
      immunotherapy in few patients. Given that the combination of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy&#xD;
      with CTLA-4 has been shown in other cancers to enhance treatment effect, combined checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor treatment has also been investigated in patients with MPM. Although these results&#xD;
      are encouraging, the response rates seen are moderate compared to what has been documented&#xD;
      for the combination of checkpoint inhibitors in other cancer indications. An approach to&#xD;
      further enhance the PFS and response rate in MPM may be to use a vaccine aiming to activate&#xD;
      an immune response directed against tumor-related antigens, and to combine the vaccine with&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors. The proposed study will evaluate the use of the therapeutic cancer&#xD;
      vaccine UV1 in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab after progression on standard&#xD;
      first-line chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to induce a meaningful progression-free survival benefit in&#xD;
      patients with MPM after progression on first line standard platinum doublet chemotherapy, by&#xD;
      treating with nivolumab and ipilimumab with or without UV1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point (PFS) is expected to be analyzed in 2022.&#xD;

    <description>The mode of action of UV1 is to activate the immune system to induce T cells directed against telomerase (hTERT). UV1 vaccination amplifies the pool of hTERT specific tumor-reactive T cells from the naive repertoire and has the potential to increase the breadth and diversity of the tumor-reactive T cell response (epitope spreading). Vaccination with UV1 can thus provide the basis for increased efficacy of checkpoint inhibition therapy, by augmenting the pool of tumor specific T cells in patients with limited or insufficient numbers of T cell clones spontaneously primed by tumor antigens. Reciprocally, the efficacy of UV1 vaccination may be enhanced in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, since the clonal expansion and effector activity of UV1 induced T cells will otherwise be restricted by intrinsic immune regulatory and tumor induced suppressor mechanisms.</description>
