      This is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, two cohorts, Simon's two-stage design,&#xD;
      phase II clinical trial in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer brain metastases&#xD;
      patients. Subjects will be divided into two cohorts by hormone receptor status and HER2&#xD;
      status. HER2+/HR- subjects will enter Cohort A to receive pyrotinib plus temozolomide;&#xD;
      HER2-/HR- subjects will enter Cohort B to receive bevacizumab, SHR1316 combined with&#xD;
      cisplatin/carboplatin. Subjects in both cohorts will be treated until disease progression,&#xD;
      toxicity is intolerable, informed consent is withdrawn, and investigators determine that&#xD;
      medication must be discontinued. Drug efficacy and safety data will be collected.&#xD;
