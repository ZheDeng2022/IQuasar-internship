  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a mixed methods longitudinal observational study to assess patient and provider&#xD;
      perspectives on pain and pain management among pregnant women with opiate use disorder (OUD).&#xD;
      The findings from this study will inform patient-centered approaches to pain management.&#xD;
      Themes surrounding mothers' pain/recovery experiences that correlate with quantified pain and&#xD;
      analgesia endpoints will be identified. Findings will also shape an appropriate&#xD;
      patient-centered research agenda for obstetric pain management in patients with OUD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A fine understanding of the attitudes and beliefs about pain and its management for patients&#xD;
      with opioid use disorder is currently lacking. These psychological aspects of pain and&#xD;
      analgesia are expected to have significant effects on nociception, pain experience, analgesic&#xD;
      efficacy, and opioid requirements and its subsequent risks for relapse/treatment&#xD;
      noncompliance. There is also have little understanding of provider-held attitudes and beliefs&#xD;
      which can influence pain and its treatment for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this study will inform patient-centered approaches to pain management for&#xD;
      obstetric patients with OUD. They will also shape an appropriate patient-centered research&#xD;
      agenda for obstetric pain management in patients with OUD. This work will find new&#xD;
      patient-centered endpoints for this special population that may be currently overlooked with&#xD;
      existing standard pain assessments.&#xD;
