  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is the most common form of diabetes among children and youth,&#xD;
      and it is increasing around the world, particularly among children under 5 years. This is&#xD;
      worrisome given the chronic nature of the disease and its strong association with an&#xD;
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence suggests that markers of CVD are&#xD;
      already present in children with T1D, making prevention a clinical and public health priority&#xD;
      in this high-risk population. Despite this, a good understanding of what factors predispose&#xD;
      children with T1D to CVD is still lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to better understand in this population what individual, familial and&#xD;
      environmental characteristics increase the risk for heart disease, how to best measure it&#xD;
      early on and what are the potential mechanisms underlying the heightened risk for heart&#xD;
      disease in youth with T1D. Specifically, we aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. compare established risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension) with novel early markers&#xD;
           for CVD (cardiac phenotype, arterial stiffness, endothelial function) in adolescents&#xD;
           with T1D and healthy controls;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. examine the associations between these novel early markers with: i) lifestyle habits;&#xD;
           ii) measures of inflammation; and iii) markers of oxidative stress among adolescents&#xD;
           with T1D and healthy controls, and determine group differences in these associations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. explore, across both groups, the associations between these established and novel early&#xD;
           markers of CVD with neighborhood features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these objectives, we will compare 100 participants aged 14-18 years with T1D to&#xD;
      100 healthy controls. Lifestyle habits include assessments of physical activity, sleep,&#xD;
      sedentary behavior, fitness and dietary intake. Blood pressure and lipid profiles will be&#xD;
      measured. Cardiac structure/function will be evaluated by non-contrast cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (CMR). Aortic distensibility will be determined by pulse wave velocity.&#xD;
      Endothelial function will be determined by flow-mediated dilation. Inflammatory markers and&#xD;
      endogenous antioxidants will be measured in blood. Neighbourhood features include built and&#xD;
      social environment indicators and air quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study provides an exceptional opportunity to increase our knowledge on what factors&#xD;
      predispose children with T1D to cardiovascular disease. Understanding the interplay between&#xD;
      T1D, lifestyle habits and metabolic markers and CVD is critical to developing effective&#xD;
      prevention strategies for these vulnerable children.&#xD;
