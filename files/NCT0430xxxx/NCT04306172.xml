    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to externally validate the EPIC's Readmission Risk&#xD;
      model and to compare it with the LACE+ index and the SQLape Readmission model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objective, the EPIC's Readmission Risk model will be adjusted based on the&#xD;
      validation sample, and finally, it´s performance will be compared with machine learning&#xD;
      algorithms.&#xD;

      Introduction: Readmissions after an acute care hospitalization are relatively common, costly&#xD;
      to the health care system and are associated with significant burden for patients. As one way&#xD;
      to reduce costs and simultaneously improve quality of care, hospital readmissions receive&#xD;
      increasing interest from policy makers. It is only relatively recently that strategies were&#xD;
      developed with the specific aim of reducing unplanned readmissions by applying prediction&#xD;
      models. EPIC's Readmission Risk model, developed in 2015 for the U.S. acute care hospital&#xD;
      setting, promises superior calibration and discriminatory abilities. However, its routine&#xD;
      application in the Swiss hospital setting requires external validation first. Therefore, the&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to externally validate the EPIC's Readmission Risk model&#xD;
      and to compare it with the LACE+ index (Length of stay, Acuity, Comorbidities, Emergency Room&#xD;
      visits index) and the SQLape (Striving for Quality Level and analysing of patient&#xD;
      expenditures) Readmission model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: For this reason, a monocentric, retrospective, diagnostic cohort study will be&#xD;
      conducted. The study will include all inpatients, who were hospitalized between the 1st&#xD;
      January 2018 and the 31st of January 2019 in the Lucerne Cantonal hospital in Switzerland.&#xD;
      Cases will be inpatients that experienced an unplanned (all-cause) readmission within 18 or&#xD;
      30 days after the index discharge. The control group will consist of individuals who had no&#xD;
      unscheduled readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For external validation, discrimination of the scores under investigation will be assessed by&#xD;
      calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC). For&#xD;
      calibration, the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test will be graphically illustrated by&#xD;
      plotting the predicted outcomes by decile against the observations. Other performance&#xD;
      measures to be estimated will include the Brier Score, Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI)&#xD;
      and the Net Benefit (NB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient data will be retrieved from clinical data warehouses.&#xD;
