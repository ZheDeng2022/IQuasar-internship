  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In brief, this K76 study consists of a small open trial to refine the study protocol and&#xD;
      train study personnel on study procedures (Aim 1.b.). In Aim 2, we will recruit older adults&#xD;
      into a multidisciplinary fall prevention pilot study. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to usual care with a traditional fall evaluation by an ED clinician (i.e., ED medical staff&#xD;
      member) or an intervention. In the intervention, participants will receive an in-ED&#xD;
      consultation by a physical therapist and pharmacist to determine reasons for the fall and&#xD;
      offer additional education and training. Participants will be provided an Apple Watch to&#xD;
      record measures of fitness and falls, if possible, in the following 12 months. Recurrent&#xD;
      falls will be measured in twelve-month follow-up.&#xD;

      In order to determine whether a multifactorial fall prevention intervention is feasible,&#xD;
      acceptable and may reduce recurrent falls in older adults presenting to the ED after a fall,&#xD;
      we will randomize patients to usual care with a traditional fall evaluation by an ED&#xD;
      clinician or an intervention. Patients in the intervention arm receive a fall risk assessment&#xD;
      and recommendations by a physical therapist. They are also evaluated by a pharmacist and&#xD;
      participate in a medication therapy management session with the aim to reduce fall risk&#xD;
      increasing medication.&#xD;

    <description>In addition to the usual care arm, the Intervention arm will receive a physical therapy and pharmacy consultation in the ED. PTs will perform a fall risk assessment and provide recommendations on the safety of discharge. Pharmacists will perform medication review, recommend cessation or tapering of medication that increase fall risk using motivational interviewing (MTM) techniques.&#xD;
The participants will also receive Apple Watch training and an Apple Watch to perform tasks that test their memory and mobility during their ED visit and during our home visits at 1,3, 6, and 12 month after enrollment.</description>
