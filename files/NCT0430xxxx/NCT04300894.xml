  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out about ways to enhance well-being during&#xD;
      pregnancy and the postpartum period (after the baby is born). The &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; program and/or&#xD;
      guided support from study staff (&quot;Mamma Mia Plus&quot;) may be helpful because the app provides&#xD;
      skills and information related to many important topics during and after pregnancy. This&#xD;
      study will allow us to learn more about whether and how the program is helpful to women.&#xD;

      This study will compare findings in women who do not use the program (&quot;usual care group&quot;)&#xD;
      versus women who use the program (&quot;Mamma Mia group&quot;) versus women who use the program and&#xD;
      receive regular contact from study staff (&quot;Mamma Mia Plus&quot;). The study will assess&#xD;
      well-being, depression, stress, and anxiety as well as whether certain factors (for example,&#xD;
      women's age, type of healthcare provider, amount of social support) are related to the&#xD;
      effects of the program. For women randomized to use the program, the study will also collect&#xD;
      information about the time spent using it and the modules completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual prenatal and postpartum care involves regular visits with participant's women's health&#xD;
      care provider while pregnant and after the baby is born. In this study, participants will&#xD;
      receive continue receiving usual care. In addition, participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (like the flip of a coin) to participate in one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The &quot;usual care group&quot;, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The &quot;Mamma Mia group&quot; (which is to use the &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; program regularly), or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The &quot;Mamma Mia Plus group&quot; (which is to use the program regularly plus receive regular&#xD;
           contact with study staff).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a 1 chance in 3 of being assigned to each of the three groups. participants have an&#xD;
      equal chance of being assigned to any one of the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the &quot;usual care group&quot; will be asked to do the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete survey questions at entrance into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complete survey questions every few months (see schedule below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the &quot;Mamma Mia group&quot; will be asked to do the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete survey questions at entrance into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use the &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; program on a regular basis (on average: weekly for about 10 minutes)&#xD;
           from entering study until six months postpartum; participants will receive an email&#xD;
           reminder to complete modules when they should be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Complete survey questions every few months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the &quot;Mamma Mia Plus group&quot; will be asked to do the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete survey questions at entrance into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use the &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; program on a regular basis (on average: weekly for about 10 minutes)&#xD;
           from entrance into the study until six months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Complete survey questions every few months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants will receive phone calls or emails or texts (depending upon participant&#xD;
           preference) from study staff every few months.&#xD;
