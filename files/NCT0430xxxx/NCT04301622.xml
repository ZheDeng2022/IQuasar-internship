    <textblock>
      MicroPort (MPO) is conducting this PMCF study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of its&#xD;
      EVOLUTION® BIOFOAM® Tibia and EVOLUTION® Cruciate Sacrificing/Cruciate Retaining (CS/CR)&#xD;
      Porous Femur components, including EVOLUTION® CS tibial inserts. This type of study is&#xD;
      required by regulatory authorities for all devices that have been approved in Europe to&#xD;
      evaluate the medium and long-term clinical evidence.&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate the individual component survivorship of EVOLUTION® BIOFOAM® Tibia and&#xD;
           EVOLUTION® CS/CR Porous Femur components, including EVOLUTION® CS tibial inserts&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To find out the cumulative incidence of component revision of each component in this&#xD;
           combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To find out the functional outcome scores at early, midterm, and long term follow-up.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Has previously undergone or currently has determined to undergo a primary TKA with the&#xD;
             specified combination of components: EVOLUTION® CS/CR Porous Femur, EVOLUTION® CS&#xD;
             Tibial Insert, and EVOLUTION® BIOFOAM® Tibia and modular keel&#xD;

          2. Has previously undergone or currently has determined to undergo a primary TKA for any&#xD;
             of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis, traumatic&#xD;
                  arthritis, or avascular necrosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  inflammatory degenerative joint disease including rheumatoid arthritis;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  correction of functional deformity;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  willing and able to complete required study visits and assessments through the 10&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Previously implanted subjects must be enrolled within 3 years (+6 months) of their&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Skeletally immature (less than 21 years of age) at time of implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has or had an overt infection at the time of implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has or had a distant foci of infections (which may cause hematogenous spread to the&#xD;
             implant site) at the time of implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has or had a rapid disease progression as manifested by joint destruction or bone&#xD;
             absorption apparent on roentgenogram at the time of implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has or had inadequate neuromuscular status (e.g., prior paralysis, fusion, and/or&#xD;
             inadequate abductor strength), poor bone stock, poor skin coverage around the joint&#xD;
             which would make the procedure unjustifiable&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has had a revision procedure(s) where other treatments or devices have failed; and&#xD;
             treatment of fractures that are unmanageable using other techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Currently enrolled in another clinical investigation which could affect the endpoints&#xD;
             of this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Unwilling or unable to sign the Informed Consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has documented substance abuse issues&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has an emotional or neurological condition that would pre-empt their ability or&#xD;
             willingness to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Currently incarcerated or has impending incarceration&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has a medical condition, as judged by the Investigator, that would interfere with the&#xD;
             subject's ability to comply with the requirements of the protocol&#xD;
