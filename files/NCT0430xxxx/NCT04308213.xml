  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of isolated osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint at the initial stages involves&#xD;
      the use of numerous conservative or arthroscopic treatments with uncertain results and, upon&#xD;
      their failure, the current solution for the resolution of symptoms is shoulder arthroplasty,&#xD;
      an effective procedure but with significant costs and rates of morbidity, especially in young&#xD;
      patients. Since the use of intra-articular injections of mesenchymal cells obtained from the&#xD;
      bone marrow has proved effective in the treatment of gonarthrosis, our goal is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the same therapy in the treatment of glenohumeral arthritis isolated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glenohumeral arthritis is one of the main reasons for persistent shoulder pain and reduced&#xD;
      movement (range of motion, ROM) as it can compromise the work activity and also the normal&#xD;
      daily activities, leading to the development of depressive syndromes. The final treatment is&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty, which is effective but is associated with significant costs and&#xD;
      morbidity rates. In addition, arthro-prosthesis is avoided in young patients due to longevity&#xD;
      concerns and is not indicated in the early stages of arthritis. Currently, conservative&#xD;
      treatments for patients with mild or moderate glenohumeral arthritis include non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroid injections, with low efficacy and a&#xD;
      significant adverse effect profile, hyaluronic acid infiltrations, with good efficacy in&#xD;
      initial treatment, and infiltrations of platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), which have shown&#xD;
      beneficial effects in knee arthritis. However, evidence for the glenohumeral joint are&#xD;
      limited. In cases not responsive to conservative therapy, and especially in young patients, a&#xD;
      valid alternative to the prosthesis is the arthroscopic treatment, with good results in the&#xD;
      short term, but with relatively high failure rates that increase over time. Other types of&#xD;
      nonprosthetic surgical treatment for chondral-humeral defects have low scientific evidence,&#xD;
      with variable and uncertain results. In recent years, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), derived&#xD;
      from bone marrow or adipose tissue, due to the ability to differentiate into chondrogenic&#xD;
      line cells, have emerged as cells with great therapeutic potential in patients with&#xD;
      degenerative joint disorders. Since the knee joint is the most susceptible to pathology&#xD;
      because of its mechanical load, most studies based on stem cell therapy regard the knee&#xD;
      joint, reporting promising results in treatment in the treatment of early stages of&#xD;
      arthritis. As regards the glenohumeral joint, since the most frequent pathology affects the&#xD;
      tendons of the rotator cuff, almost all studies investigate the effect of MSC in the&#xD;
      treatment of rotator cuff disorders with or without associated surgical repair techniques.&#xD;
      Only a prospective study analyzed the effect of intra-articular MSC injection derived from&#xD;
      bone marrow in 34 patients with isolated glenohumeral arthritis, reporting a significant&#xD;
      decrease in pain and an improvement in shoulder function measured by the Disabilities of the&#xD;
      Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scale at about 1 year, although study quality is very low.&#xD;
      Since the use of intra-articular injections of mesenchymal cells obtained from the bone&#xD;
      marrow has proved effective in the treatment of gonarthrosis, our study proposes to evaluate&#xD;
      the long-term efficacy of this type of therapy in the treatment of the isolated glenohumeral&#xD;
      arthritis.&#xD;
