      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaposi sarcoma (KS) tumors grow on the skin, lymph nodes, lungs, bone, and gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract. KS often affects people with immune deficiencies, such as among people living with HIV&#xD;
      or those with prior history of transplant. Researchers want to see if 2 non-chemotherapy&#xD;
      drugs can help people with KS. NHS-IL12 triggers the immune system to fight tumors. M7824&#xD;
      blocks the pathways that cancer cells use to stop the immune system from fighting tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if giving NHS-IL12 alone or with M7824 could help the immune system fight KS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 and older with KS that has been treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with some or all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
      computed tomography scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      skin KS lesion biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      lung exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      gastrointestinal exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will get NHS-IL12 every 4 weeks for up to 96 weeks (or 24cycles). It is&#xD;
      injected under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will also get M7824 every 2 weeks for up to 96 weeks (or 24cycles). It is&#xD;
      given through a plastic tube that is put in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete questionnaires about how KS affects their quality of life. Their&#xD;
      KS lesions will be measured and photographed. They will repeat some of the screening tests.&#xD;
      They will give saliva samples or additional tissue samples. They will have a lung function&#xD;
      test. Their ability to perform their normal activities will be assessed. The treatment&#xD;
      duration is up to 96 weeks (or 24cycles) with an option to take NHS-IL12 and/or M7824 until&#xD;
      the KS tumors are not responding, or you develop unacceptable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits 7 and 30 days after treatment ends, then every 3 to 6&#xD;
      months for the next 18 months, then once a year for 3 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is a multicentric angioproliferative tumor, caused by Kaposi&#xD;
           sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, that most frequently involves the skin, but may also&#xD;
           involve lymph nodes, lungs, bone and gastrointestinal tract. It is most common in people&#xD;
           with HIV but may also occur in patients without a diagnosis of HIV. Patients with&#xD;
           HIVassociated KS have worse survival than HIV-infected patients without KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As it is a relapsing and remitting condition, patients with KS often require prolonged&#xD;
           courses of cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KS is an immune responsive tumor as interferon-alpha, pomalidomide, and restoring Tcell&#xD;
           function in HIV + patients treated with antiretroviral drugs can result in clinical&#xD;
           benefit and remission of KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Published Phase I/II studies by our group demonstrated that IL-12 alone and in&#xD;
           combination with liposomal doxorubicin led to clinical responses in patients with&#xD;
           advanced KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NHS-IL12 (M9241) is an immunocytokine with affinity to both single and double stranded&#xD;
           DNA allowing for targeting of exposed DNA, which is commonly seen in necrotic tumors.&#xD;
           This agent is able to deliver IL-12 to the tumor microenvironment promoting local&#xD;
           immunomodulation, that results in less systemic toxicity than IL-12 systemic&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M7824 is a novel bifunctional fusion protein composed of a monoclonal antibody against&#xD;
           human PD-L1 (avelumab) fused with the extracellular domain of human TGF-beta receptor II&#xD;
           (TGF- RII), which functions as a TGF-beta trap .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 agents have been found to be active in certain virus-induced&#xD;
           cancers, including Kaposi sarcoma, and to be safe and active in patients with HIV&#xD;
           infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, no clinical data exists for the combination of NHS-IL12 and M7824.&#xD;
           Preclinical data suggest synergy between these agents from existing ongoing studies and&#xD;
           the available clinical data both in KS and other tumor subtypes suggest that the&#xD;
           combination of NHSIL12 with M7824 is likely to be well-tolerated and has scientific&#xD;
           rationale. This combination offers a new treatment approach for patients with advanced&#xD;
           KS who have received prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Evaluate the safety and tolerability of single agent NHS-IL12 and the combination of NHSIL12&#xD;
      with M7824 in patients with advanced KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed Kaposi sarcoma (KS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KS requiring systemic therapy, with a history of prior systemic therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2 weeks from last chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  4 weeks from last immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least five measurable cutaneous KS lesions with no previous local radiation, surgical&#xD;
           or intralesional cytotoxic therapy to these measurable lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG Performance Status (PS) less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient must be willing to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients can be HIV positive or negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV+ patients for 8 or more weeks prior to entry with&#xD;
           an HIV viral load of &lt;400 copies/ml and CD4+ T-cell count &gt;50 cells/microliter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with bleeding from visceral sites of KS or requiring blood transfusions in the&#xD;
           2 weeks prior to study entry will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Phase I/II study assessing the safety and efficacy of NHS-IL12 alone or in&#xD;
           combination with M7824 in patients with advanced KS. Patients will receive therapy until&#xD;
           optimal tumor response, unacceptable toxicity, the patient s request to discontinue&#xD;
           therapy, PI decision, up to a total of 96 weeks, or 24 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monotherapy: Patients will receive NHS-IL12 alone with a 3+3 design applicable to the&#xD;
           first 3-6 patients at a starting dose of 16.8 microgram/kg on day 1 of a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
           Two dose de-escalation levels (Dose Level -1: 12 microgram/kg or Dose Level -2: 8&#xD;
           microgram/kg) will be permitted if there is evidence of 2 or more dose limiting&#xD;
           toxicities within the first 6 weeks of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination Therapy: The combination arm will open following accrual and completion of&#xD;
           the the DLT period for patients in the monotherapy arm. Up to 28 patients will be&#xD;
           treated with M7824 (1200 mg IV, every 2 weeks) and NHS-IL12 (MTD dose from the&#xD;
           monotherapy arm). The DLT period for this arm will be 6 weeks.&#xD;
