  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness of transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) at home to reduce seizures and EEG spikes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electrical stimulation is a promising new therapy to reduce seizures, but current methods&#xD;
      require inserting wires under the skull or into brain. This project will use direct-current&#xD;
      electrical stimulation pulses delivered from scalp electrodes to provide stimulation. The&#xD;
      goal is to reduce seizures without the need for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Baseline: Upon signing of consent, subjects will have an initial screening clinic visit&#xD;
      with a neurological history and examination. You will record a seizure diary for one month&#xD;
      prior to start of stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Baseline EEGs: A 2-hour recording will be done with the 256 channel hydrogel electrocap&#xD;
      (currently used for clinical studies). Subjects will be maintained awake for consistency,&#xD;
      since sleep affects EEG activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Seizure Diary: The subject (and/or family) will maintain a seizure diary during the&#xD;
      baseline, treatment, and for one month after their final stimulation treatment. The seizure&#xD;
      diary will be reviewed by the study coordinator in a phone contact once per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. Baseline antiepileptic drug levels for patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital,&#xD;
      carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine or levetiracetam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. Baseline neuropsychological testing: Subjects will take baseline neuropsychological&#xD;
      tests, consisting of Beck Depression Index, the National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale, the&#xD;
      Personal Impact of Epilepsy (PIES) scale and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment basic scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Treatment Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. tDCS: The direct current stimulus will be delivered via a commercially-available&#xD;
      ActivaDose transcranial direct current stimulator (or if it becomes unavailable, a&#xD;
      commercially available Soterix Medical device) through a saline-moistened pad placed over the&#xD;
      region of the seizure focus. Cathodal (negative) DC current will be delivered to the seizure&#xD;
      focus and anodal (positive) current over the oppositel forehead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Ensuring comfort: Direct current stimulation will be at an intensity of 2 mA for 30&#xD;
      minutes per session, with slow ramp-up and ramp down of the current. This level of&#xD;
      stimulation is usually comfortable to most subjects. If the sensation is significantly&#xD;
      uncomfortable, the stimulation will be reduced to 1 mA, and if that is uncomfortable, you&#xD;
      will be discontinued from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Except for initial, mid-study and final EEG recording and the device use training&#xD;
      session, this study will take place in your home. During a training session for home use you&#xD;
      will be made familiar with the ActivaDose operation by study staff. Features to be learned&#xD;
      will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Turning on the device b. Setting the stimulation to 2 mA c. Setting the stimulation&#xD;
      duration to 1 minute or 30 minutes. Attachment of the 2 pads (cathode and anode). e. Proper&#xD;
      placement of pads, careful explanation of cathode to go over the seizure zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f. Pad removal, disposal and device storage g. Schedule for treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4. Placebo: It is not yet clear whether short stimulation of 1 minute (SHORT) is less&#xD;
      effective than is longer stimulation of 30 minutes (LONG). A balanced deck of randomized&#xD;
      cards setting the initial treatment arm as SHORT in 15 cases and LONG in 15 cases. However,&#xD;
      you will receive both treatments in different months, and afterwards will have the option of&#xD;
      continuing with the one that works best for you (assuming that one of the treatments helps).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5. Schedule: After signing consent, the study will begin with one month of baseline while&#xD;
      keeping a daily seizure diary. During this baseline month, you will have baseline EEG&#xD;
      recorded and training on device use. There will then be one month of treatment SHORT or LONG,&#xD;
      one month no treatment &quot;wash-out,&quot; then one-month of treatment LONG or SHORT, including the&#xD;
      treatment not given in the first round. Diary will be kept for one month after the second&#xD;
      treatment. You will be given a printed schedule of dates and the device settings to use for&#xD;
      each date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6. Medications: During the baseline, treatment months, washout month and one month of&#xD;
      follow-up after treatment, efforts will be made to keep your seizure medicines constant.&#xD;
      However, medicines can be changed if the treating physician believes it is necessary for your&#xD;
      welfare&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7 Visits: Phone visits will be made and logged one week (Â± 3 days) after initiating&#xD;
      treatment SHORT or treatment LONG. Three in-person visits will be performed: at baseline and&#xD;
      after completion of the two treatment months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8. Follow-up testing: A 1-hour EEG will be performed during the wash-out month and after&#xD;
      completion of both treatment arms. The final EEG will record 2 hours of spontaneous activity,&#xD;
      followed by 30 minutes of Active tDCS at 2 mA, and then 30 min of subsequent recording. This&#xD;
      will be done to evaluate any acute EEG changes produced by tDCS. Together with the baseline&#xD;
      study, this will total 3 EEGs. Neuropsychological tests will be administered twice: at&#xD;
      baseline and after completion of all treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.9. Escape Criteria: For individual subjects, the study will be terminated for any of the&#xD;
      following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unacceptable discomfort or pain in response to the tDCS treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A tonic-clonic seizure occurring during a stimulation session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Emergence of a first-in-life tonic-clonic seizure at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Generalized status epilepticus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Tripling or more of the baseline seizure frequency.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Since the subject sets the stimulation settings for each day of treatment, it is not possible to employ a full placebo with this device. We will inform the subjects that we are uncertain whether short stimulation of 1 minute is less effective than is longer stimulation of 30 minutes, which is a true statement according to our current state of knowledge. We will use a balanced deck of randomized cards setting the initial treatment arm as SHORT in 15 cases and LONG in 15 cases.</masking_description>
