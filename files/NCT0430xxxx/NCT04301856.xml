  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CFTR modulators should improve the prognosis of Cystic Fibrosis. Identifying patients under&#xD;
      the age of 18 responding to CFTR modulators as well as detecting possible toxicity is an&#xD;
      important medical objective given the potential side effects and the high cost of these&#xD;
      molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational follow-up cohort study is carried out as part of routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the evolution of pulmonary structural impairment by low-dose&#xD;
      CF scan at the end of the first year of CFTR modulator therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate structural impairment at low dose scan at 3 years&#xD;
      and 5 years of CFTR modulator treatment, the evolution of respiratory functional parameters,&#xD;
      growth, puberty, lung infection, sweat test, quality of life and pancreatic function, as well&#xD;
      as tolerance of modulators including liver toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a deadly disease. This is due to overinfected chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease that progresses to end-stage respiratory failure. CFTR modulators should&#xD;
      improve the prognosis of CF, as they may slow the progression of patients' lung disease.&#xD;
      Assessing their impact in the paediatric population is becoming a major issue. Children and&#xD;
      adolescents under the age of 18 are a target cohort because they have a lung disease that is&#xD;
      still poorly developed. Early prescription of CFTR modulators is therefore a priority but&#xD;
      requires evidence of absence of toxicity. Identifying patients under the age of 18 responding&#xD;
      to CFTR modulators as well as detecting possible toxicity, is an important medical objective&#xD;
      given the potential side effects and the high cost of these molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes previously used in Phase III studies (FEV1, frequency of exacerbations,&#xD;
      nutritional status) are insufficiently sensitive in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other criteria need to be analyzed to identify the response to CFTR modulators in the short&#xD;
      and medium term. The investigators hypothesize that the assessment of pulmonary structural&#xD;
      impairment by low-dose lung CT-scan as part of routine care could be a much more sensitive&#xD;
      criterion for the development of lung disease under CFTR modulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational follow-up cohort study is carried out as part of routine care. It does not&#xD;
      involve a specific collection for research. Excess bronchial secretions and blood will be&#xD;
      kept instead of being discarded in the event of a possible requalification for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the evolution of pulmonary structural impairment by low-dose&#xD;
      CF scan at the end of the first year of CFTR modulator therapy The secondary objectives are&#xD;
      to assess following criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tolerance of modulators in this age group, including screening for bronchial reactivity&#xD;
           at treatment, early liver toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Longitudinal evolution of pulmonary structural impairment by low dose scan at 3 years&#xD;
           and 5 years of CFTR modulator treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolution of respiratory functional parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement by spirometry and plethysmography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung clearance index (if possible)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Longitudinal evolution of bacterial colonization, compared to the year prior to&#xD;
           modulating treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exacerbations: number, duration, days of antibiotics, hospitalizations, return to stable&#xD;
           condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colonization of bronchial secretions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolution of the sweat test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Longitudinal evaluation of pancreatic function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Longitudinal evaluation of growth and puberty compared to the year prior to CFTR&#xD;
           modulator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Growth speed, and bone age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone mineralization, body composition (if possible)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pubertal markers from 9 years in girls and 10 years in boys&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of glycemic dysregulation if present&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preservation of samples taken as part of routine care (serum, bronchial secretions) for&#xD;
           possible research use&#xD;
