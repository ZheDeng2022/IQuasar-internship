      Auxiliary drugs augment the effect of local anesthetic in intravenous regional anesthesia&#xD;
      (IVRA). The purpose of our study was to estimate the median effective dose (ED50) of&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine in elective upper limb Lidocaine 0.5% IVRA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since its innovation in 1908 by Dr August Bier of Germany, Intravenous regional anesthesia&#xD;
      (IVRA) has stood the test of time as simple, safe and effective technique of regional&#xD;
      anesthesia. 1 The technique entails insertion of intravenous catheter into a surgical limb&#xD;
      before isolating it from the general circulation by tourniquet then inject local anesthetic&#xD;
      (LA) into this isolated limb. 2 IVRA block is preferably used with short surgical procedures&#xD;
      or maneuvers of the upper or lower extremity. Nevertheless, the technique has gained&#xD;
      popularity for procedures of the upper extremity because of tourniquet issues like tourniquet&#xD;
      pain, and other safety concerns that arise more often with lower extremity IVRA, essentially&#xD;
      leakage of the of LA.3 Unfortunately, using LA solely for IVRA has not achieved optimum&#xD;
      intraoperative analgesia or overcome the frequently reported tourniquet pain.4 A long list of&#xD;
      adjuvants, to mention few: morphine, muscle relaxant and clonidine, have been used to augment&#xD;
      LA action and ameliorate tourniquet pain. 5 Dexmedetomidine (DEX) a potent α 2 agonist that&#xD;
      have unique analgesic, anxiolytic and sedative profile has been called upon as attractive&#xD;
      adjunct in general as well as regional anesthesia with enticing results. Several studies have&#xD;
      pursued DEX median effective dose (ED50) in different settings e.g., co induction agent with&#xD;
      Propofol, in laryngeal muscle insertion and with local anesthetic to enhance the quality of&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia. 6 However, DEX effective median dose ED50 with IVRA for upper limb has not&#xD;
      been investigated elsewhere, so far. The up and down sequential method of Dixon and Mood is a&#xD;
      common sequential design method used in anesthesia research to detect the ED50. It is a&#xD;
      sequence of experiments performed under the assumption that &quot;satisfactory response&quot; is&#xD;
      followed by decrease in test dose for the next patient in the series, and &quot;non- satisfactory&#xD;
      response&quot; is followed by increase in test dose for the next patient in the series. 7 The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to estimate the median effective dose of Dexmedetomidine (DEX) with&#xD;
      Lidocaine 0.5% IVRA in upper limb elective surgeries, using modified Dixon's up and down&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
