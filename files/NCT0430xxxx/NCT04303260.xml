    <textblock>
      A randomized-controlled-double blinded pilot study. Twenty Inflammatory Bowel Disease&#xD;
      patients, suffering from mild disease will be randomized to undergo either a set of specific&#xD;
      physical exercises for Inflammatory Bowel Disease or a control set of unrelated exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either interventional or control groups by a computer&#xD;
      automatized randomization program. Patients will be sent an email with the link to an&#xD;
      internet site where they will be able to watch the exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventional exercise regimen will include specific exercises postulated to increase&#xD;
      blood flow to the intestine and colon and thereby promote normal peristaltic and decrease&#xD;
      inflammation. The control arm will practice generally recommended exercises, without&#xD;
      particular attention to the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videos of sets of exercise will be available online which patients will be able to watch and&#xD;
      follow from their home computer. The exercise regimens (both interventional and controls)&#xD;
      will be sequenced and performed by a trained and experienced instructor, which will provide&#xD;
      these to the PI. Each video will include explicit instructions and examples for each of the&#xD;
      exercises. Patients will be asked to watch the videos and preform the exercises individually&#xD;
      every day. Patients in the interventional arm will be asked to complete 3 different videos&#xD;
      repeatedly, as many days a week sets as possible. This repetition is to be maintained even if&#xD;
      a patient missed one day of training to perform sets of 15 minutes/ day, 6 times a week.;&#xD;
      Compliance will be documented by patients through emails to the study coordinator. Patients&#xD;
      in the controled arm will also be asked to practice generally recommended exercises in 3&#xD;
      different videos repeatedly, as many sets as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will answer questionnaires once every two weeks(week 0, 2, 4). Patients will answer&#xD;
      QOL(quality of life), PROMs(Patient Reported Outcome Measures),disease activity , Sleep&#xD;
      questionnaire and Morningness eveningness questionnaire. Also, before and after the&#xD;
      intervention (week 0 and week 4) patients will visit the clinic for anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements and to give serum, stool and urine sample which will be analyzed for&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, microbial composition and function.&#xD;
