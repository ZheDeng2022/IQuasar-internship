  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, malaria prevalence in 2016 was reported to have increased with 445,000 deaths, 91%&#xD;
      of which occurred in sub-Sahara Africa with more than 75% being children. Individuals who&#xD;
      carry the malaria parasite can either be symptomatic (showing signs and symptoms) or&#xD;
      asymptomatic (without signs and symptoms). Asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia pose a very&#xD;
      serious threat to malaria control efforts as they serve as reservoirs that fuel the&#xD;
      transmission process. Therefore, interventions that target community-wide clearance of&#xD;
      asymptomatic parasitaemia can drastically reduce malaria prevalence in the population and&#xD;
      lead to elimination especially in endemic areas. Mass parasite clearance can deplete the&#xD;
      parasite reservoirs and lower the transmission potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts are ongoing to scale-up interventions that work such as use of Long Lasting&#xD;
      Insecticidal Nets (LLIN), Intermittent Preventive Treatment in children (IPTc), and test,&#xD;
      treat and track (TTT). However, there is need for mass testing, treatment and tracking (MTTT)&#xD;
      of the whole population to reduce the parasite load before implementing the aforementioned&#xD;
      interventions. Though, Seasonal Malaria Chemoprophylaxis (SMC) is adopted for selected&#xD;
      localities in Ghana, the impact of such interventions could be enhanced, if combined with&#xD;
      MTTT at baseline to reduce the parasite load. IPT of children in Ghana has demonstrated a&#xD;
      parasite load reduction from 25% to 1%. However, unanswered questions include - could this be&#xD;
      scaled up? What can be the coverage? What is needed for MTTT scale -up? In a pilot in Ghana,&#xD;
      a coverage of more than 75% was achieved in target communities and reduced asymptomatic&#xD;
      parasitaemia by 24% from July 2017 to July 2018. It is important to generate time series data&#xD;
      to better analyse and understand the prevalence trends as well as the bottlenecks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In designing interventions that aim at reducing the burden of malaria in children under five,&#xD;
      for example, MTTT has largely been left out. This study explores the scale-up of&#xD;
      interventions that work using community volunteers, hypothesising that implementing MTTT&#xD;
      complemented by community-based management can reduce the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria&#xD;
      parasite carriage in endemic communities. The effect of the interventions will be observed by&#xD;
      comparing baseline data to evaluation data. This study will document the challenges and&#xD;
      bottlenecks associated with scaling-up of MTTT to inform future efforts to scale-up the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Malaria continues to pose a serious burden to the local populations in sub-Sahara&#xD;
      Africa. Several efforts have been made to scale up interventions that work such as preventing&#xD;
      man-vector contact, intermittent preventive therapy, seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis as&#xD;
      well as TTT for febrile patients. However, much still has to be done to target the mass&#xD;
      testing, treatment and tracking of whole populations in order to reduce the parasite load&#xD;
      before implementing the above mentioned interventions. Though SMC is adopted for selected&#xD;
      localities in Ghana, MTTT could be used to drastically bring down the parasite load in a&#xD;
      given population before the implementation of interventions such as SMC. Elsewhere, it has&#xD;
      been demonstrated that incorporating the antimalarials in vaccination programmes could delay&#xD;
      the first malaria episode in children under five. Furthermore, IPT of children in a community&#xD;
      in Ghana has been reported to reduce the parasite load in a given community from 25% to 1%.&#xD;
      The questions that remain are - could this be scaled up? What proportion of the community&#xD;
      could be covered over a given time? What is needed to accomplish MTTT in large scale? In an&#xD;
      ongoing pilot study in Ghana, a coverage of more than 75% was achieved in the target&#xD;
      communities and a reduction of 24% in asymptomatic parasitaemia prevalence from July 2017 to&#xD;
      July 2018. This proposal is intended to validate the findings of the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In designing interventions that aim at reducing the burden of malaria in children under five,&#xD;
      e.g, MTTT could be used to clear parasites from the general population before the&#xD;
      interventions are implemented. This is because the adults who are not often included in the&#xD;
      interventions that target children under 5 years old tend to act as reservoirs that fuel the&#xD;
      transmission. To solve the problem of personnel who are limited at the level of the health&#xD;
      service and coverage, this study will be making use of the existing network of community&#xD;
      health workers (CHWs) that are used during vaccination programmes. The CHWs who reside in the&#xD;
      communities, will carry out interventions in their communities and conduct the home-based&#xD;
      management of malaria to reduce cost. To solve the problem of stock-outs of RDTs and ACTs,&#xD;
      mobile phones SMS will be used. Monthly monitoring and of the volunteers. The volunteers will&#xD;
      be trained based on the 2014 Ghana National Malaria Treatment Guidelines for managing&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses that in the Pakro sub district, there are more asymptomatic malaria&#xD;
      cases than the symptomatic cases reported by hospital records and that if MTTT is carried out&#xD;
      in combination with home-based management of malaria in specific communities over two years,&#xD;
      a large proportion of the parasite reservoir will be cleared and consequently open up&#xD;
      possibilities for pre-elimination of malaria in the area. It is also intended that the&#xD;
      bottlenecks involved in scaling up mass testing, treatment and tracking will be documented in&#xD;
      order to facilitate the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decade, the number of recorded malaria cases has steadily dropped from 247&#xD;
      million cases with 881,000 deaths reported in 2006 to 216 million with 445,000 deaths in 2016&#xD;
      (WHO, 2009, 2010, 2016). This has largely been due to the introduction of ACTs following the&#xD;
      resistance witnessed against chloroquine as well as an increase in the number of control&#xD;
      measures such as the use of long lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and intermittent preventive&#xD;
      treatment in pregnancy and children. Despite the reported decrease, sub Saharan Africa still&#xD;
      bears the greatest burden of the disease where 90% of the deaths are reported with more than&#xD;
      75% of the mortalities in children under five.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the recommendation of the WHO, Ghana changed its malaria treatment guidelines&#xD;
      adopting artesunate and amodiaquine as first line for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria&#xD;
      to replace chloroquine. By 2012, hospital statistics across the country revealed that malaria&#xD;
      was responsible for 38.93% of the outpatient consultations and 38.80% of admissions. Studies&#xD;
      in Ghana have demonstrated that artesunate and amodiaquine combinations are not only&#xD;
      efficacious in clearing the malaria parasites from patients but if used for intermittent&#xD;
      preventive treatment for children under five could effectively clear more than 90% of the&#xD;
      parasite in this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different studies have demonstrated very high level of asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia in&#xD;
      both less than 5 years old and school age children who have a higher risk of coming down with&#xD;
      clinical malaria. The high incidence of asymptomatic parasitaemia serves as a reservoir that&#xD;
      fuels the malaria transmission cycle. If the parasite is cleared from the blood of&#xD;
      asymptomatic individuals as well as the sick patients with the very efficacious&#xD;
      Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT), then, even the most effective mosquito vector&#xD;
      would have nothing to transmit following a blood meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As children grow beyond age 5 years, the prevalence of malaria or parasitaemia in this group&#xD;
      begins to decrease following the development of immunity to the parasite. A study of trends&#xD;
      in malaria admission in Cameroon has demonstrated that the variation in the prevalence of&#xD;
      malaria effectively reflected a variation in children age 1 to15 years. While enormous effort&#xD;
      is being made to prevent man-vector contact through the use of treated nets, the benefits&#xD;
      from using these nets could be amplified if such programmes integrate mass parasite clearance&#xD;
      as part of their agenda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been concerted effort in the past decade to evaluate the possible effects of&#xD;
      malaria mass treatment using intermittent preventive treatment in under 5 children in&#xD;
      different part of Africa. A longitudinal study in Ghana demonstrated that associating IPTc&#xD;
      with home based management of malaria by community workers could clear more than 90% of the&#xD;
      parasite pool in children using artesunate and amodiaquine. This low level of parasitaemia in&#xD;
      the study population was found to persist over a period of two years. Though, this&#xD;
      intervention had targeted only under 5 years children, it revealed the potential role&#xD;
      intermittent preventive treatment of the population could play in reducing malaria prevalence&#xD;
      and consequently paving the way for malaria elimination. Given that old members of the&#xD;
      household are likely to have some immunity to the malaria parasite, they however, represent&#xD;
      the reservoir that refuels the parasite pool whenever it is reduced by IPTc. Therefore, for&#xD;
      intermittent preventive treatment to be sustainable all members of each household should be&#xD;
      targeted for mass testing, treatment and tracking and consequent prompt home-based treatment&#xD;
      for confirmed cases. Bearing in mind that huge resources are required for IPT of whole&#xD;
      communities, it has been suggested that mass screening of whole communities be carried out&#xD;
      once a year while IPTc be conducted regularly in combination with the home based management.&#xD;
      This could further enhance the efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of rapid scale-up preventive interventions in the past decade has led to a&#xD;
      reasonable decrease in the burden of malaria. The challenges involved with translating&#xD;
      research scenarios into implementation are enormous. In an era with a decreased funding for&#xD;
      the health system, it is important to understand the bottlenecks that can hinder the scale-up&#xD;
      of mass testing and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed at reducing the asymptomatic parasitaemia in the Pakro sub district of&#xD;
      Ghana by conducting MTTT for malaria among household members of age 2 months and older and&#xD;
      carrying out targeted treatment of all cases with confirmed asymptomatic parasitaemia or&#xD;
      clinical malaria. The interventions intend to follow-up an entire population in 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the impact of scaling up mass testing, treatment and tracking on malaria&#xD;
      prevalence among children under fifteen years of age in the Pakro sub district of Ghana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of scaling-up targeted MTTT/home-based treatment on malaria parasitaemia&#xD;
      prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitaemia among afebrile participants &lt;15&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To document challenges which hinder the scale up of mass testing, treatment and tracking of&#xD;
      malaria in Ghana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the cost benefit analysis of MTTT to the community&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical intervention study to be undertaken within a 36 month frame work in 9&#xD;
      communities in the Pakro sub district. The interventions are designed to compare the baseline&#xD;
      to evaluation findings following the pilot study. Interventions are determined at the&#xD;
      community level. An intervention in this study involves testing the participants with RDTs,&#xD;
      the treatment of those who test positive with ACTs and follow up. The study team will&#xD;
      undertake 6 household interventions and household surveys over a two-year surveillance period&#xD;
      (one intervention/survey every four months). The study will be conducted in two arms - Arm 1&#xD;
      will constitute the intervention communities while Arm 2 will constitute Control Arm&#xD;
      communities (standard of care) (Fig 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 (Intervention arm) will involve seven communities: 4-monthly mass screening, and&#xD;
      treatment of those who test positive by CHWs. Febrile cases will be tested and treated by&#xD;
      CHWs any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 (Control arm) will involve 2 communities: mass screening and treatment only done at&#xD;
      baseline and at evaluation. Febrile cases will be tested and treated by CHWs any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will allow for the evaluation of the impact of the MTTT without bias in the control Arm.&#xD;
      The results from Arm 1 will be compared to Arm 2. Participants in Arm 1 will be tested every&#xD;
      four months and treated if positive, while for those in Arm 2, the MTTT exercise will be&#xD;
      conducted only at baseline and at evaluation (Fig 1). To avoid the bias that could be&#xD;
      introduced by frequent surveys in the control communities with the obligation to treat those&#xD;
      that are positive, the number of surveys in Arm 2 are reduced to two - one at baseline and&#xD;
      one at evaluation. Those confirmed positive in Arm 2 will be treated and it is believed that&#xD;
      this will not affect the study since the baseline and evaluation prevalence data are&#xD;
      collected 20 months apart (Fig 2). However, participants in both arms will be monitored by&#xD;
      the CHWs - if they become febrile at any time, they will be tested and treated if confirmed&#xD;
      positive for malaria. The first intervention is scheduled for month 6 of the grant.&#xD;
      Subsequent interventions are scheduled for month 10, 14, 18, 22 and the final intervention is&#xD;
      estimated to take place at month 26. CHWs will continue community management of malaria till&#xD;
      the 30th month (total study period: 24 months) when the final hospital data will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study a household survey consists of i) measuring the temperature and testing of all&#xD;
      participants with RDTs, those who test positive will be treated with ACTs, ii) administration&#xD;
      of questionnaires to caregivers to assess the frequency of febrile illnesses and use of&#xD;
      mosquito nets in all households and iii) take Hb readings for children &lt;15 years old selected&#xD;
      into the study subgroup (see section on participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be monthly CHW monitoring visits to ensure proper implementation. During each&#xD;
      monthly monitoring visit, RDT and ACT stocks will be replenished, and the PI will have a&#xD;
      meeting with the CHWs, review what was done and document challenges as well as ensure&#xD;
      adherence to SOPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the study will use RDT for testing, it is known that RDTs do not detect low density&#xD;
      infections. This means that there is possibility for transmission to be re-ignited due to low&#xD;
      density parasitaemia missed by RDTs (Vásquez, Medina et al. 2018). Despite this flaw, RDTs&#xD;
      remain the method of choice to handle large population in a cost effective manner. The&#xD;
      challenges faced during implementation will be documented during monitoring. Focus group&#xD;
      discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews will be organised to obtain additional information&#xD;
      from the community and stakeholders such as the NMCP, Regional and District units of the&#xD;
      Ghana Health Service and the community. The FGDs and in-depth interviews will be audio taped&#xD;
      and the tapes will be store for two years before discarding. Each FDG will last for one hour&#xD;
      and involving between 7-15 participants (both men and women). A social scientist and the PI&#xD;
      will conducted FDGs and IDI at chosen locations in the communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pakro is one of five sub-districts in the Akwapim south district health directorate (DHD) in&#xD;
      the Eastern region of Ghana. The Akwapim south district lies within the semi-equatorial&#xD;
      climatic region, and experiences two rainfall seasons in a year, with an average rainfall of&#xD;
      125cm to 200cm. The first rainy season begins from May to June with the heaviest rainfall in&#xD;
      June, whilst the second rainy season begins from September to October. According to the Ghana&#xD;
      Statistical Service (GSS), the average household size in the Akwapim South district is&#xD;
      estimated to be 4.0 whilst the average number of households per house or compound is&#xD;
      estimated to be 1.6. The Pakro sub-district has an estimated population of 7,889, and is&#xD;
      bounded to the east by Akwapim North district; to the north by Ayensuano district; and to the&#xD;
      west by Nsawam Adoagyiri Municipality. The sub-district is made up of 22 communities, and has&#xD;
      3 health care facilities (1 Health Centre and 2 Community-Based Health Planning Service&#xD;
      (CHPS) compounds). Due to limited resources, only seven intervention communities will be&#xD;
      selected for this study and include Abeasi Newsite, Fante Town, Zongo (Adjenase/Kweitey),&#xD;
      Piem/odumsisi, Adesa Latebibio, Sacchi/Tabankro and Odum Tokuro. In consultation with the&#xD;
      district health service, all 7 intervention communities which were located within a 5km&#xD;
      radius from the health facility were selected. The two control communities (Obosono and&#xD;
      Ankwenso) are located out of this zone but are served by two other nearby health facilities.&#xD;
      Malaria parasite positivity rate was estimated to be 39.6% in 2014. In the 2014, anaemia&#xD;
      among pregnant women at 36 weeks of gestation was 21%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community entry activities to sensitise the chiefs and the general population will be&#xD;
      conducted at the beginning of the study through meetings. Households will be given unique&#xD;
      identification codes. Each individual within the household will be assigned a code that links&#xD;
      them to a particular household and community. The intervention will target all the household&#xD;
      members. The primary outcome will be based on data from all enrolled under 15 children.The&#xD;
      effect of the interventions on secondary outcome 1 will be observed in a subgroup of children&#xD;
      aged 2 months to 14 years randomly selected from all the communities in each arm - 460&#xD;
      children in Arm 1 and 395 children in Arm 2. The children in the subgroup will have in&#xD;
      addition to the other data, their Hb readings taken to assess the level of Anaemia. The&#xD;
      effect of the interventions on secondary outcome 2 will be observed in all under 15 children.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes 3 and 4 will be observed in&#xD;
      all participants. It is hypothesized that within the study population, the prevalence of&#xD;
      asymptomatic parasitaemia should drop by 20% by the end of the first year and by 10% by the&#xD;
      end of the second year. In the same light it is expected that anaemia should drop by the same&#xD;
      proportion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to enrol an entire population estimated at 4500 participants from the 7&#xD;
      selected communities (intervention arm) and the 1500 from two control communities in Pakro&#xD;
      sub district. However, to measure the effect of the intervention on secondary outcome such as&#xD;
      anaemia in children &lt; 15 years, a sample of 368 children (without correction for loss to&#xD;
      follow up) will be needed to determine the malaria prevalence projected at 50% in the study&#xD;
      population. This has been determined using the formula of Yamane where n = N/(1+N(e^2))&#xD;
      considering a 95% confident level (CI) and ±5% precision (e). Assuming a loss to follow up of&#xD;
      10% and a non-response rate of 10%, the sample size is readjusted to 460 children calculated&#xD;
      from (368/1-0.2) for the community survey. In the control arm, 395 children (316/1-0.2) will&#xD;
      be recruited. Questionnaires will be administered to the caregivers of children in the&#xD;
      subgroup study. Following a census of the households, children from 2 months to 14 years old&#xD;
      will be divided into the various age groups 2 months to 11 months, 1-4 years, 5 -10 years and&#xD;
      11-14 years. From each age group 115 and 99 children will randomly be selected in the&#xD;
      intervention and control arms respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent preventive treatment for the household members. The research team will conduct&#xD;
      mass testing (using RDTs) of all children (from 2 months old) and adults residing in the&#xD;
      selected communities for the presence of malaria parasites. For this study, the Ag P.f RDT&#xD;
      (SD Bioline) which detects histidinie-rich proteins II antigens (HRP-2 Ag) specific to&#xD;
      P.falciparum in human blood will be used. The RDTs will be obtained from the Ghana Health&#xD;
      service through the NMCP which uses the services of WHO-FIND Lot Testing Programme. To enable&#xD;
      follow up studies in a case where treatment failure is reported, 200ul (two drops) of blood&#xD;
      will be collected on filter paper. This will be used to determine immunological parameters&#xD;
      such as antibody levels to specific antigens using PCR and ELISA. This is however, not part&#xD;
      of this study. All participants confirmed for malaria will be treated using ACTs following&#xD;
      Guidelines. If a participant vomits within 30 minutes following treatment, it will be&#xD;
      repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treated cases will be followed-up by CHW on days 1, 2, 3 and 7 post-treatment to ensure&#xD;
      the participants take the drugs on time, document and report adverse events. Since it is&#xD;
      required that patients eat before taking the drug, and house hold members may not have food&#xD;
      when they are tested, some will have to take the medicine later after eating. This means that&#xD;
      some of the treatment will be unobserved. However, the research team will pass round to cross&#xD;
      check whether participants are adhering to treatment as prescribed. They will ask to see the&#xD;
      drug package as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will include questions about malaria treatment, prevention and control&#xD;
      measures practiced by the household members as well as the cost of seeking for treatment. In&#xD;
      order to determine the perceived benefit of MTTT, data will be collected on the cost of&#xD;
      accessing treatment from community members through in-depth interviews and FGDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training of data collectors Two Community Health Workers (CHWs) will be selected from each&#xD;
      community and trained. training will focus on national malaria treatment guidelines - testing&#xD;
      using RDTs, treatment with ACTs and follow up as well as home-based management of malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timely treatment of suspected febrile malaria cases in the community:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between one MTTT intervention and the next, the trained community members will provide prompt&#xD;
      home-based treatment for children and adults reporting signs and symptoms of malaria and&#xD;
      confirmed to be carrying the parasite using RDTs. There is a need to visit the health&#xD;
      facilities that service the community to enable tracking and linking of medical records with&#xD;
      study participants. Hypothesis: a reduction in parasite load in the community could lead to a&#xD;
      reduction in the number of malaria related consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent, blood will be drawn from a finger prick by trained CHW. All participants&#xD;
      will be tested for the presence of malaria parasites using RDTs and positive cases will be&#xD;
      treated. All samples will be stored at NMIMR. To test for anaemia in children in the subgroup&#xD;
      a portable automated Hemocue photometer will be used to determine the concentration of&#xD;
      Haemoglobin. Anaemia in this study is defined as Hb levels less than 10g/dl. Children with&#xD;
      severe anaemia (Hb less than 7g/dl) will be referred to the health facility. To determine the&#xD;
      cost benefit of the project, data will be collected on the benefits of the project to the&#xD;
      community at the level of the household over the project period. This will include the cost&#xD;
      saved through averted cases of malaria at the level of the household plus the cost saved from&#xD;
      time lost to providing care when a family member is sick of malaria. A household will be said&#xD;
      to have benefited from MTTT if it perceives that by participating in the project, a number of&#xD;
      malaria cases were adverted for that year. To place value on each malaria case a household&#xD;
      perceives to have adverted, cost of accessing treatment will be determined. Data will be&#xD;
      collected on cost the family would have incur in managing each malaria case - transportation&#xD;
      (C1), consultation (C2), laboratory (C3) and treatment cost (C4) as well as total indirect&#xD;
      cost estimated as lost in activity time as a result of caregiving to the malaria patients&#xD;
      (C5). The time lost in caregiving will be estimated using the method of Hutton and Haller,&#xD;
      2004. The benefit will be calculated with a 5% interest rate per year for 2 years after&#xD;
      project is completes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A database will be created to manage the data. Data will be entered into Epi-info and&#xD;
      analysed using SPSS. The unit of enrolment will be the household. The data will be collected&#xD;
      first on paper based case report forms (CRF) before being entered into the database. As a&#xD;
      quality control measure, every day, all data collected will be cross checked by the research&#xD;
      assistant and validated. If data is not validated due to errors or poor recording, a data&#xD;
      query sheet is completed and returned to the person involved to rectify the error before work&#xD;
      continues the next day. Once the error is rectified the responsible team members signs and&#xD;
      forwards the data to the research assistant who validates it. Once validated the data is&#xD;
      moved to the statistic unit of NMIMR. The statistician receives the data and cross checks. In&#xD;
      case of any queries the data is returned to the field coordinator for rectification. To&#xD;
      assure quality, the process will be closely monitored following a monthly schedule. The data&#xD;
      is owned by the NMIMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethical clearance for this study will be sought from the NMIMR IBR and GHS-ERC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy and confidentiality All information/samples obtained from participants will be kept&#xD;
      confidential and will not be released to a third party. This information will be stored in a&#xD;
      secure location at the Epidemiology Department of NMIMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no health threatening risk involved in this study. The table below describes the&#xD;
      potential risk and how it will be mitigated within the framework of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of results and Publication The study results will be discussed at every stage&#xD;
      with stakeholders (Communities, sub district, district and regional offices of GHS, NMCP, WHO&#xD;
      country office) and published in open access peer reviewed journals. Data generated from this&#xD;
      study will be stored in two secure databases. A database created for this project in the&#xD;
      information technology (IT) unit of NMIMR whose password will be known only to the head of&#xD;
      the IT unit and the PI. Data resulting from this work will be used in informing the NMCP&#xD;
      decision to develop guidelines for implementing MTTT. The impact of this study will be&#xD;
      communicated to the public through durbars with the local communities and chiefs, radio/TV&#xD;
      talk shows and appropriate use of social media through blogs and twitter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Baseline Comparison of Patients: Summary statistics (proportions for&#xD;
      categorical variables, and means or medians with variances or IQRs for continuous variables)&#xD;
      and graphs will be used to detect presence of outliers or unusual observations, and to assess&#xD;
      validity of assumptions for statistical tests. Participants will be compared between the two&#xD;
      study arms (Intervention communities and control communities) with respect to baseline&#xD;
      demographic, clinical and parasitological characteristics. Statistical analysis of the above&#xD;
      comparisons for continuous variables will be based on graphs, t-test (or Wilcoxon test), and&#xD;
      ANOVA (or Kruskal-Wallis test). Categorical variables will be compared using chi-square&#xD;
      tests. All analyses will be performed for the whole population in each arm Primary objective:&#xD;
      outcomes of primary objective asymptomatic parasitaemia will be compared over time and&#xD;
      between intervention arms using chi-square tests (or fisher exact tests) and logistic&#xD;
      regression (or conditional logistic regression). Adjustments for potential confounders&#xD;
      including patient's age and use of ITN and baseline temperature will be considered. In&#xD;
      addition, these outcomes will also be compared over time using Cochrane Armitage test of&#xD;
      trends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: symptomatic parasitaemia at the hospitals and symptomatic parasitaemia&#xD;
      picked up at the community compared over time and between intervention arms using chi-square&#xD;
      tests (or fisher exact tests) and logistic regression (or conditional logistic regression).&#xD;
      Comparisons of anaemia in children &lt;15 years across time and study arms will be assessed&#xD;
      through Cochrane Armitage test of trends and using chi-square tests (or fisher exact tests)&#xD;
      respectively. A binomial logistic regression will be used to test impact of intervention on&#xD;
      febrile illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from FGDs and IDI will be analysed using INVIVO ver 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost benefit analysis will be calculated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Net Present Value (NPV) = ∑PV of all the Expected Benefits - ∑PV of all the MTTT Associated&#xD;
      Costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated impact of proposed work&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides an implementation research, this is also a capacity-development project. The&#xD;
      overarching goal of this project is to develop the skills of a multidisciplinary team of&#xD;
      researchers and community health workers to improve research through assessing the impact of&#xD;
      scaling up MTTT to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended that this project serve as a bench mark for the development of evidence based&#xD;
      guidelines for the scale-up of mass testing, treatment and tracking of malaria in sub-Sahara&#xD;
      Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure the quality of data collected, 20 community health workers will be trained&#xD;
      and 14 will be selected for the project. The questionnaires will be pretested and corrections&#xD;
      effected. All data collected will be cross checked by two persons in the fields. To avoid&#xD;
      loss of data, all data from the field will be record in the data transfer sheet be transfer&#xD;
      to the data management unit. All ACTs (AL) and RDTs will be procured from the NMCP through&#xD;
      the Eastern Region medical store. The expiry dates for all procurements made will be&#xD;
      verified.&#xD;
