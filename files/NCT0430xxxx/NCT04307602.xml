      The vision of the Long-term Exercise Effects from Robotic Walking (LEER) research program is&#xD;
      to develop optimal, individualized exercise strategies that would in turn enhance the health&#xD;
      and well-being of non-ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, it has not been possible to study exercise among non-ambulatory children with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy in a structured and standardized manner. Improved possibilities to carry out&#xD;
      such studies are now offered by the robotic medical device Innowalk, which allows various&#xD;
      training options in an upright weight-bearing position. In order to design optimal exercise&#xD;
      strategies for children with cerebral palsy, the investigators will examine the effects of&#xD;
      two tailored training programs, using Innowalk. Changes in cardiopulmonary and metabolic&#xD;
      parameters, and in the levels of brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor&#xD;
      (NGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the acute (1 day), adaptive (16 weeks), and long-term (1 year)&#xD;
      effects of the exercise programs through indirect calorimetry and blood samples at multiple&#xD;
      time points. The investigators will also study the environmental and behavioral factors&#xD;
      facilitating and hindering participation in exercise, by semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to design improved individualized exercise programs that will increase health and&#xD;
      well-being in the children and their families, thereby decreasing the use of medications and&#xD;
      healthcare.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled intervention trial with a crossover design with a one-year follow-up&#xD;
      will be performed to explore the differential acute and long-term effects of A) high&#xD;
      intensity interval training (HIIT) and of B) steady state training (SST) among non-ambulatory&#xD;
      children with CP, ambulatory children with CP and non-disabled children. Non-ambulatory&#xD;
      children with CP will walk in the robotic medical device Innowalk. Ambulatory children with&#xD;
      CP and non-disabled children will cycle on a cycle ergometer. As the numbers of eligible&#xD;
      children in Skåne County, Sweden, are low and due to heterogeneity among the children with&#xD;
      CP, a crossover design is chosen to maximize statistical power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Acute response to exercise Objectives: The aim is to elucidate the acute effects form&#xD;
      one bout of SST and one bout of HIIT in the three groups of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: Are there differences in the physiological responses in BDNF, NGF, VEGF&#xD;
      and metabolic bio-markers from one acute bout of HIIT and one acute bout of SST exercise&#xD;
      among non-ambulatory children with CP, ambulatory children with CP and non-disabled children?&#xD;
      Methodology: Indirect calorimetry will be used during one acute bout of HIIT exercise and SST&#xD;
      exercise to assess markers of ventilation, circulation, fat versus carbohydrate oxidation,&#xD;
      and energy expenditure during exercise. Blood will be collected before and after the exercise&#xD;
      testing to assess differences in BDNF, NGF, VEGF and metabolic bio-markers. Temperature at&#xD;
      the feet will be assessed to analyze vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverables: To demonstrate biomarkers of cardiopulmonary and metabolic function and BDNF,&#xD;
      NGF, VEGF, that are the most effected by one bout of HIIT and one bout of SST among&#xD;
      non-ambulatory children with CP, ambulatory children with CP and non-disabled children and to&#xD;
      elucidate if there are differences between the three groups of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Adaptation to exercise Objectives: The aim is to elucidate the adaptation to 16 weeks&#xD;
      of two types of structured training regimes (HIIT vs. SST) on cardiopulmonary and metabolic&#xD;
      parameters and BDNF, NGF, VEGF, in the three groups of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: Are there differences in the physiological adaptation to HIIT exercise and&#xD;
      SST exercise among non-ambulatory children with CP, ambulatory children with CP and&#xD;
      non-disabled children? Methodology: We will use supervised exercise training of 16 weeks with&#xD;
      HIIT -16 weeks Washout -16 weeks with SST, starting and ending with the exercise testing&#xD;
      described in Aim 1 to evaluate adaptation to HIIT and SST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverables: To demonstrate changes in cardiopulmonary and metabolic parameters and BDNF,&#xD;
      NGF, VEGF in adaptation to HIIT and SST and to elucidate whether there are differences&#xD;
      between HIIT and SST among the three groups of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Adherence to physical activity and exercise; child-family perspective Objectives: The&#xD;
      aim is to study the adherence to the two exercise regimes among non-ambulatory children with&#xD;
      CP, ambulatory children with CP and non-disabled children and to elucidate health and&#xD;
      well-being factors for the child and their family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: Which are the facilitating and hindering factors to participate in&#xD;
      structured and standardized exercise regimes and which factors are affecting health and&#xD;
      well-being within a child-family perspective, professional caregivers and the child-family&#xD;
      perspective and the within the healthcare system? Methodology: The methods used will be a&#xD;
      combination of questionnaires and semi-structured interviews individually and in focus&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverables: Description of facilitating and hindering factors for adherence in the exercise&#xD;
      regimes among the three groups of children, and furthermore a description of factors&#xD;
      facilitating and hindering health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Long-term effects from exercise Objectives: The aim is to study the physiological&#xD;
      long-term effects of the exercise intervention programs at a one-year follow-up and the&#xD;
      adherence to exercise among non-ambulatory children with CP, ambulatory children with CP and&#xD;
      non-disabled children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: Which are the physiological adaptations to exercise and which are the&#xD;
      facilitating and hindering factors to long-term participation in exercise regimes?&#xD;
      Methodology: The methods in Aim 1 and Aim 3 will be used to answer the research question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverables: Description of long-term physiological effects from exercise and facilitating&#xD;
      and hindering factors for adherence long-term to exercise among non-ambulatory children with&#xD;
      CP, ambulatory children with CP and non-disabled children, and furthermore a description of&#xD;
      factors facilitating and hindering health and well-being.&#xD;
