  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several randomized, controlled trials, mostly involving women undergoing cesarean delivery,&#xD;
      have shown that the prophylactic intravenous administration of 1 g of tranexamic acid after&#xD;
      childbirth reduced blood loss. Most were small, single-centre trials with considerable&#xD;
      methodologic limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to emphasize that none of these RCTs has included women at increased risk of&#xD;
      PPH such as placenta previa, a context in which the prevalence of moderate and severe blood&#xD;
      loss is significantly higher and where the magnitude of the effect of TXA may highly differ&#xD;
      compared to low risk women&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TXA is a promising candidate drug, inexpensive and easy to administer, that can be easily&#xD;
      added to the delivery management of women worldwide. Strong evidence that TXA reduces blood&#xD;
      transfusion in elective and emergency surgery, outside obstetrics, has been available for&#xD;
      many years, whatever the type of surgery (ie cardiac, orthopaedic, hepatic, urological, and&#xD;
      vascular surgery). Tranexamic acid was recently shown to reduce bleeding-related mortality&#xD;
      among women with postpartum hemorrhage, especially when the drug was administered shortly&#xD;
      after delivery. A meta-analysis of data from individual patients including data from patients&#xD;
      with trauma and women with postpartum hemorrhage suggested the importance of early treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), involving women undergoing cesarean delivery,&#xD;
      as well have meta-analyses, have shown that the prophylactic intravenous administration of 1&#xD;
      g of tranexamic acid after childbirth reduced blood loss. Most of them were small, single-&#xD;
      center trials with considerable methodologic limitations. Thus, no guidelines advocate the&#xD;
      use of tranexamic acid to prevent blood loss after cesarean delivery. Moreover, it is&#xD;
      important to emphasize that none of these RCTs has included women at increased risk of PPH&#xD;
      such as placenta previa, a context in which the prevalence of moderate and severe blood loss&#xD;
      is significantly higher and where the magnitude of the effect of TXA may highly differ&#xD;
      compared to low risk women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to conduct a large multicentre randomised, double blind placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial to adequately assess the impact of TXA for preventing PPH following a&#xD;
      cesarean delivery in women with placenta previa.&#xD;
