      To determine the specific population of critically ill septic patients who benefit most from&#xD;
      cytokine adsorption therapy with the HA-380 cartridge. Benefit of the treatment will be&#xD;
      assessed on the basis of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The scope of the effect of cytokine adsorption therapy in this specific population of&#xD;
           critically ill patients expressed by cytokine variability within the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The scope of cytokine changes in passing the adsorption cartridge my measuring cytokine&#xD;
           levels in the patient's blood directly before passing through the cartridge and directly&#xD;
           after having passed through the cartridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The scope of changes in organ dysfunction expressed by SOFA scores that are repeatedly&#xD;
           calculated during the treatment with cytokine adsorption and then daily until day 7 of&#xD;
           the ICU treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The scope of changes on cellular function on immune cells in serum samples taken before&#xD;
           and after cytokine adsorption therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The scope of removal of anti-infective drugs from the blood in passing through the&#xD;
           cytokine adsorption cartridge by measuring antibiotic drug levels in the patients blood&#xD;
           during the cytokine adsorption therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 day and 90 day mortality and location status in survivors&#xD;

      1. Medical Problem Sepsis, a syndrome of physiologic, pathologic, and biochemical&#xD;
           abnormalities induced by infection. It is a major public health concern, accounting for&#xD;
           more than $20 billion (5.2%) of total US hospital costs in 2011. Sepsis has shown an&#xD;
           increase in incidence most likely due to a combination of aging patient populations with&#xD;
           more comorbidities and greater recognition. Sepsis is by conservative estimates a&#xD;
           leading cause of mortality and morbidity in critical illness with long term sequelae for&#xD;
           survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Underlying to sepsis is a multifaceted host response to an infecting pathogen that may&#xD;
           be significantly amplified by endogenous factors and is defined by a nonhomeostatic,&#xD;
           dysregulated host response to the infection with a potential lethality that is&#xD;
           considerably in excess of that straightforward infection. In the early phases, an&#xD;
           overshoot of pro-inflammatory mediators is often observed, caused by pathogen-associated&#xD;
           molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). High levels&#xD;
           of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are both associated with increased mortality.&#xD;
           Blocking of overproduction of these cytokines using monoclonal anti- bodies targeting&#xD;
           specific cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) have not demonstrated&#xD;
           mortality benefits in larger trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, an approach to decrease cytokine overproduction by using extracorporeal blood&#xD;
           purification has previously been examined. Initial trials using Polymyxin B showed&#xD;
           favorable results for markers of critical care treatment with a reduction of vasopressor&#xD;
           dosage and higher ratios oxygen partial pressure to inspired oxygen. A larger randomized&#xD;
           trial by Payenne however did not show any improvement of organ dysfunction or reduction&#xD;
           in mortality by using Polymycin B hemoperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A recent trial on the effect of the CytoSorb adsorption device using Interleucin-6&#xD;
           (IL-6) levels as marker of efficacy did also not find an effect of mortality, improved&#xD;
           organ dysfunction or in fact a reduction of circulating IL-6 levels. However, in this&#xD;
           trial the baseline cytokine levels were only moderately increased to begin with&#xD;
           suggesting use of a device within a suboptimal patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As no more approved specific therapies to treat sepsis, exist following the withdrawal&#xD;
           of recombinant activated protein C (Xigris; Eli Lilly, USA) from the market in 2011&#xD;
           following the results of the PROWESS-SHOCK trial and the pathophysiologic basis for&#xD;
           mechanisms in sepsis due to an excess cytokine release are sound, the extracorporeal&#xD;
           removal of cytokines remains a promising therapeutic target given the correct patient&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Principal research question and novel aspects Within the trials addressing removal of&#xD;
           excess cytokines, the selection of patients and timing of the intervention has been&#xD;
           difficult, and results have not been conclusive. Data on the patient population which&#xD;
           might benefit most in regard to the aspects of cytokine levels removed and organ failure&#xD;
           or progressive organ dysfunction averted are sparse or non-existent. Even the largest&#xD;
           randomised trial so far was active for 3 years in recruiting 100 patients out of 580&#xD;
           patients screened. This trial failed to show a positive effect on the primary endpoint&#xD;
           of IL-6 removal as well as on secondary endpoints of morbidity or 30 day mortality.&#xD;
           However, in this small trial there was a very low median cytokine level measured at&#xD;
           baseline and randomisation which might be associated with the consecutive failure to&#xD;
           detect a reduction in circulating cytokines. The question remains, whether this trial&#xD;
           identified a patient population that was going to benefit from such a therapy to begin&#xD;
           with. Post-hoc analyses of another trial, the Euphrates trial showed that there might be&#xD;
           positive signal for reduced mortality in patients with an endotoxin activity that was in&#xD;
           a mid-range and not at the highest end of the spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We therefore aim to undertake an observational trial to examine the effect of treating&#xD;
           sepsis according to the surviving sepsis campaign guidelines and using extracorporeal&#xD;
           cytokine removal looking at circulating cytokine levels and development of new or&#xD;
           worsening organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis or septic shock who show highly&#xD;
           increased IL-6 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. HA 330 and HA 380 Hemoperfusion Cartridge The HA type resin cartridge (Jafron&#xD;
           Industries, China) is an extracorporeal hemoperfusion device that uses neutral&#xD;
           microporous resin, and it has been proven to specifically absorb different media- tors&#xD;
           such as bilirubin and cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HA380 HA 330 and HA 380 resin cartridges haves the ability to absorb various medium-sized&#xD;
      factors, including most inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-a) and haves&#xD;
      therefore lately been used in the treatment of patients with sepsis in China with several&#xD;
      case reports demonstrating promising results on the clinical course of treated patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, there pooled there is emerging data that this therapeutic concept is efficienct&#xD;
      and helpful in adequately selected patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HA 380 cartridge is the CE-labeled updated version of the HA-330 cartridge which features&#xD;
      a larger surface area of the resin beads increasing the overall capacity and thus potential&#xD;
      efficacy of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HA 380 Hemoperfusion Cartridge works using Van der Waals interaction between resin&#xD;
      molecular groups and adsorbed substances. Unlike the CytoSorb device, these are incorporated&#xD;
      into the resin molecule by a molecular sieve effect of the 3D network structure and the&#xD;
      lipophilic hydrophobicity of the molecular group. Therefore, the pass-through effect in&#xD;
      removing cytokines is expected to be larger and more sustained, as previously adsorbed&#xD;
      cytokines will not again be released by continued blood flow or movement of the device. The&#xD;
      range of adsorption is shown in figure 1. The device described has a CE label and is approved&#xD;
      for treatment in a variety of clinically situations including but not limited to&#xD;
      intra-operative use in cardiac surgery, intoxication, liver failure and sepsis. Compared to&#xD;
      other available devices which could be used in the same settings this cartridge offers&#xD;
      superior flow characteristics, less flow resistance and a higher capacity of cytokine&#xD;
      removal. The effect of combining a standard treatment course of sepsis according to the&#xD;
      Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines with extracorporeal cytokine removal however is not well&#xD;
      examined overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigator center, the investigators have therefore undertaken a retrospective pilot&#xD;
      observational trial of 15 patients in which the using the HA 380 330 device was used as a&#xD;
      rescue therapy in therapy in 15 patients with septic shock and multi-organ failure refractory&#xD;
      to conventional treatment. In this trial of extremely ill patients the investigators found a&#xD;
      significant difference between hospital survivors and non-survivors in circulating IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-10 and TNF-alpha levels after 8 hours of treatment with the HLA 3380 cartridge. However,&#xD;
      the overall variation of cytokine levels at baseline and the variation of changes from&#xD;
      baseline during therapy were rather large. The sample size was too small to infer any&#xD;
      causality or undertake multi-variate analysis.&#xD;

        We will perform an observational trial in a large cohort of patients with sepsis and septic&#xD;
        shock who are treated with cytokine adsorption by hemoperfusion with a HA-380 cartridge.&#xD;
        Sepsis will be defined as done in the Sepsis-3 definition. In addition to sepsis or septic&#xD;
        shock patients must have a confirmed excess of IL-6, IL-10 or TNF-alpha or a combination of&#xD;
        these with IL-6 levels &gt; 1000 pg/l, IL-10 levels &gt;250 pg/l or TNF-alpha levels &gt; 100 ng/l.&#xD;
        Patients must be in need of CRRT or ECMO therapy to perform the HA-380 therapy. Stand-alone&#xD;
        hemoperfusion will not be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be included within 24 hrs of diagnosing sepsis. The IL-6 measurement for&#xD;
        inclusion must be from within 24 hrs, IL-10 or TNF-alpha measurements for inclusion can be&#xD;
        from within 36 hrs before inclusion.&#xD;
