  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of disability and diminished quality of living that frequently&#xD;
      includes impairments of postural control and upper extremity (UE) function. The interaction&#xD;
      of posture and UE coupling in terms of movement planning, initiation, and execution is not&#xD;
      well understood. StartReact responses triggered by a loud acoustic stimulus (LAS) during the&#xD;
      planning and preparation of goal intended actions has been used to probe the state of&#xD;
      brainstem neuronal excitability related to posture and movement sequencing. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to examine posture and goal-directed movement planning and execution using&#xD;
      startReact responses and to evaluate posture and UE movement sequence during reaching while&#xD;
      standing in individuals with chronic hemiparesis and healthy controls. Secondly, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine the modulatory role of the cortical premotor areas (PMAs) in&#xD;
      startReact responses in healthy controls and in persons with stroke by using transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) to up- or down-regulate PMAs excitability.&#xD;
