  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      4-Demethyl-4-cholesteryloxycarbonylpenclomedine (DM-CHOC-PEN) is a polychlorinated pyridyl&#xD;
      cholesterol carbonate that is lipophilic, electrically neural, crosses the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier (BBB), ability to localize in intracranial tumor tissue, lacks neurotoxicity and not&#xD;
      transported out of the brain via Pgp (p-glycoprotein) (1). DM-CHOC-PEN has completed Phase&#xD;
      I/II trials in humans with primary and secondary tumors involving the brain with success.&#xD;
      Complete remissions in both primary (astrocytomas, GBM) and metastatic lung cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is open for adolescent and young adults (AYA) subjects with advanced cancer -&#xD;
      brain involvement is not required.&#xD;

      The primary goal of this Phase I pediatric oncology clinical trial will be to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and use of 4-demethyl-4-cholesteryloxycarbonylpenclomedine (DM-CHOC-PEN), as&#xD;
      anticancer therapy for AYA with advanced cancer +/- central nervous system (CNS) involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DM-CHOC-PEN is a polychlorinated pyridine cholesteryloxycarbonate that crosses the blood&#xD;
      brain barrier (BBB), accumulates in CNS tumor tissue in humans and has produced objective&#xD;
      responses, with acceptable/reversible hepatic toxicities (in patients with prior liver&#xD;
      disease) and no evidence of hematological, renal, neuro-toxicities with improved quality of&#xD;
      life and overall survival in adult Phase I/II clinical trials - IND - 68,876 (1-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA supports the proposed Phase I clinical trial designed to identify safety, toxicities&#xD;
      and an acceptable MTD in AYA cancers subjects now that the adult Phase I trial has been&#xD;
      completed with acceptable toxicity and MTDs identified (2, 3, 5, 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost 700,000 people in the US are living with tumors involving the CNS or spinal nervous&#xD;
      system (SNS) tumors (6). Nearly 15% of these tumors involve the adolescent/young adult (AYA)&#xD;
      population, aged 15-39 years of age (6). It is predicted that 10,617 AYA individuals will be&#xD;
      diagnosed with brain or CNS tumors resulting in 434 deaths this year in the US (6). Trends in&#xD;
      CNS tumors have sharply increased since 1989 for AYA individuals with a history of cancer,&#xD;
      who appeared to have 'beaten the odds', only to have a reoccurrence from cancer involving the&#xD;
      CNS after years of remission; the most common types of cancer in AYA individuals are -&#xD;
      melanoma, leukemia and sarcomas (7). This group of individuals deserve special care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For males and female individuals &lt;20 years of age, primary brain and secondary cancers of the&#xD;
      CNS and spinal nervous system (SNS) are the most common causes of death from cancer and in&#xD;
      the 20-39 year age group the first cause of cancer-related deaths in males and the fifth&#xD;
      cause of cancer-related deaths in females. The incidence and histology of cancer types does&#xD;
      vary according to subject age ( ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A critical component in designing an agent that will cross the protective blood brain barrier&#xD;
      (BBB) is that the agent must be readily transported intracerebrally, does not produce local&#xD;
      irritation/neurotoxicity and is not recycled back into the general circulation. After IV&#xD;
      administration DM-CHOC-PEN readily penetrates the BBB, is not a substrate for the transporter&#xD;
      protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and has shown anticancer activity in CNS tumors (4). The&#xD;
      effective transport of DM-CHOC-PEN into CNS tumors in adults without neurotoxic behavioral&#xD;
      alterations and associated events supports the drug's use in children with CNS tumors at an&#xD;
      age in which brain development and maturation is still very active with cognitive lability.&#xD;
      The observed responses noted in adults with metastatic cancers involving the CNS and&#xD;
      cerebellum treated with DM-CHOC-PEN (Table 1) may also occur in medulloblastoma in AYA (7,&#xD;
      9). Thus, the drug's unique properties and lack of toxicities noted in the adult studies&#xD;
      merits the Phase I trial proposed here in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of this Phase I study will be to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct a Phase I clinical trial with DM-CHOC-PEN in AYA that have advanced cancers with&#xD;
           +/- the central nervous system to document toxicities, define an acceptable maximum&#xD;
           tolerated dose (MTD), and identify anticancer activity for the drug. All data will be&#xD;
           communicated through an e-RAP program. This will be accomplished through IND - 68.876.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Studying the pharmacokinetic/dynamic profiles of DM-CHOC-PEN and metabolites in AYAs&#xD;
           with advanced cancers involving the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analyze data and prepare a Phase II clinical trial in AYA subjects for FDA review.&#xD;
