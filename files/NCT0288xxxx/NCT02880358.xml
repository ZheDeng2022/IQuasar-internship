    <textblock>
      EPICAL 2 (Epidemiology and prognostic of the Acute Heart Failure) is an epidemiological,&#xD;
      observational, prospective and multicenter study. This study includes at first an exhaustive&#xD;
      recording of the cases on a geographic area at East of France, then the recorded patients are&#xD;
      followed up in a cohort at least 3 years. This study follows the experiences of the EPICAL&#xD;
      study led by our team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To describe the characteristics of the patients affected by acute heart&#xD;
      failure and to identify prognostic factors, in particular related to care. More exactly :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the sociodemographic, clinical, biological and therapeutic characteristics&#xD;
           of the patients presenting an acute heart failure during hospitalisation and living at&#xD;
           East of France ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the short and medium-term morbi-mortality of these patients, and identify the&#xD;
           main factors determining the prognosis for survival ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the prognostic impact of the intra and extra-hospital care ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the evolution of the care's practices of the decompensated heart failure&#xD;
           since the EPICAL study (15 years) and their influence on the prognosis of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: to constitute a biological collection of serum, plasma and urine of&#xD;
      patients' sample presenting an acute heart failure.&#xD;

      Criteria of inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients hospitalized for acute heart failure or developing an acute heart failure&#xD;
           during the hospitalisation in the intensive care, cardiology or geriatrics departments&#xD;
           of the hospitals of Northeast of France during one year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients died in emergencies or during the transfer, with a diagnosis of acute heart&#xD;
           failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute heart failure includes decompensation of chronic heart failure, advanced stage of the&#xD;
      heart failure, acute oedema of the lung and cardiogenic shock. According to the data of&#xD;
      registers, the incidence of the acute heart failure in approximately 2,5 cases per 1000&#xD;
      adults per year, the expected sample size amounts to 2500 eligible patients over 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: the doctors declare the Acute Heart Failure of their departments. The&#xD;
      technicians of clinical research collect the data concerning the sociodemographic, clinical,&#xD;
      biological and therapeutic characteristics of the inclusive patients on arrival at the&#xD;
      hospital, during the hospitalisation and at the exit. The biological takings are made for the&#xD;
      patients having given their consent before the exit of the hospitalization. The patients are&#xD;
      followed up during 3 years.&#xD;
