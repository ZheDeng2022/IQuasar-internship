  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether patients receiving human albumin for plasma&#xD;
      volume replacement during cardiac surgery have improved postoperative endothelial function&#xD;
      compared to patients receiving 6% hydroxyethyl starch solutions. The postoperative&#xD;
      endothelial function, measured with peripheral arterial tonometry as reactive hyperemia index&#xD;
      (RHI) within 2 hours following surgery, will be compared in cardiac surgical patients&#xD;
      randomized to receive human albumin or 6% HES solutions for intraoperative volume&#xD;
      replacement. Within two hours of arrival to the ICU peripheral arterial tonometry using&#xD;
      EndoPAT will be performed. In a subset of 40 consecutive patients the investigators will&#xD;
      perform additional EndoPAT measurements to describe the expected changes that occur in&#xD;
      endothelial function during the perioperative period (baseline, early postoperative and 24&#xD;
      hours postoperative) using RHI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also determine whether human albumin 5% reduces plasma biomarkers of&#xD;
      endothelial and glycocalyceal damage by measuring plasma concentrations of syndecan 1 and&#xD;
      endocan at baseline (before surgery), and 1 and 24 hours following surgery. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken on the morning of the surgery, within one hour of arrival to the intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU), and 24 hours after surgery or within 2 hours before discharge from the ICU (three&#xD;
      times altogether). These samples will be used to measure the plasma concentrations of two&#xD;
      biomarkers that measure endothelial injury.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgical patients enrolled in the SHARP study will be randomized to 5% human albumin&#xD;
      or 6% HES on entrance to the operating room. Anesthetic and Surgical management will follow&#xD;
      protocol established by SHARP study including administration of a blinded study solution&#xD;
      which contains 5% human albumin or 6% HES following separation from cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
      Blood will collected for measurement of baseline syndecan 1 and endocan following arterial&#xD;
      line and urinary catheter placement before surgical incision. At 1 and 24 hrs following&#xD;
      surgery completion, blood will be collected for measurement of syndecan 1 and endocan. Within&#xD;
      two hours of ICU arrival, assessment of endothelial function will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subset of patients (patients who consent for multiple measurements), assessment of&#xD;
      endothelial function will be performed preoperatively (baseline) and 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasoactive substances may influence EndoPAT measurement. Thus the investigators will collect&#xD;
      data on use of preoperative antihypertensive medications that have direct or indirect effect&#xD;
      on arterial smooth muscle relaxation. Use of epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin,&#xD;
      milrinone, nitroglycerine, nitroprusside, and sedatives such as propofol, dexmedetomidine and&#xD;
      others will be recorded and adjusted for in the analysis. Data on packed red blood cells&#xD;
      (PRBC) and blood component transfusion will be collected from Anesthesia Record Keeping&#xD;
      System. Indications for PRBC transfusion include hematocrit (HCT) &lt;22% on cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass and &lt;24% off cardiopulmonary bypass, and hypovolemia with anemia (HCT&lt;25% with mean&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure &lt;60 mmHg or heart rate &gt;100 bpm). Blood component transfusion&#xD;
      (platelets, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate) may be administered as necessary following&#xD;
      institutional standard of care. Imbalances in blood product transfusion between study groups&#xD;
      will be adjusted for in the analysis.&#xD;
