  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a symptom based disorder with a prevalence of 15% in the adult population and&#xD;
      its management remains challenging. Although not life threatening, constipation is associated&#xD;
      with impaired quality of life, increased healthcare costs and excess work absenteeism.&#xD;
      Constipation represents a heterogeneous disorder with a multifactorial pathogenesis. Several&#xD;
      risk factors have been suggested to lead to the condition and are divided in 3 main&#xD;
      categories: a) physiological, b) environmental and c) demographic. To date, there is lack of&#xD;
      large epidemiological studies on proposed aetiological factors of constipation, especially&#xD;
      studies assessing all proposed risk factors of constipation together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate the multidimensional (physiological,&#xD;
      environmental and demographic) predictors of constipation with the use of a multivariate&#xD;
      analysis statistical model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a large single centre case control study comparing constipated adults with healthy&#xD;
      individuals matched for age, gender and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study is 2 weeks in total and includes a screening visit, a 2 week run-in&#xD;
      period and a baseline visit at the end of the run-in period. Transit time between constipated&#xD;
      and healthy individuals is assessed at baseline visit. Differences in gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms, dietary intake as well as differences in stool output (e.g. stool frequency and&#xD;
      consistency) between constipated and healthy individuals are assessed over the baseline&#xD;
      period (the week before the baseline visit). Differences in female sex hormone levels as well&#xD;
      as stool markers and markers of fermentation (e.g. fecal water, stool pH, short chain fatty&#xD;
      acids) between constipated and healthy individuals are assessed at baseline visit.&#xD;
      Furthermore, differences in environmental measures (physical activity, anxiety, smoking) and&#xD;
      differences in demographic measures (age, gender, body mass index) between patients suffering&#xD;
      from constipation and healthy individuals are also assessed at baseline visit.&#xD;
