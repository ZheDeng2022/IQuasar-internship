  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) patients have significant clinical symptoms,&#xD;
      including progressively increasing fatigue, angina, exertional dyspnea, and syncope.&#xD;
      Conservative medications are used to treat the vast majority of patients. Invasive therapy,&#xD;
      which includes surgical myectomy, septal ethanol ablation and dual-chamber pacing is&#xD;
      introduced to patients with refractory symptoms or drug resistance. Considering the&#xD;
      sternotomy and relatively high patients' tolerance required in myectomy, the potentially&#xD;
      risky misplacement of ethanol and the anatomic variability of the vascularised hypertrophic&#xD;
      septum, and the potential risk of conduction block after these two treatments, the&#xD;
      development of new minimally invasive approach is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous researches have illustrated the effectiveness and feasibility of transcatheter radio&#xD;
      frequency ablation for HOCM patients. By far, there has been no report on transthoracic&#xD;
      laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) for human treatment. Since 2004, our&#xD;
      department has adopted High Intensity Focused Ultrasound, radio frequency and laser in solid&#xD;
      tumors treatment, including liver tumors and fibroid. Also our center has conducted several&#xD;
      animal experiments to verify the feasibility of radio frequency/laser in septal myocardium&#xD;
      ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to lead echocardiography-guided transthoracic radio&#xD;
      frequency/laser ablation for HOCM ventricular septum, make minimally invasive treatment plans&#xD;
      for HOCM patients, and verify the safety and validity of intervention treatment in long term.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators use pressure gradient of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) to quantify obstructive severity. If the pressure gradient increases, the symptom gets deteriorated; if the pressure gradient decreases, the symptom gets relieved.</description>

    <measure>Quantification of cardiac function</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators use ejection function (EF) to quantify the systolic function. If EF is higher after the operation, the systolic function gets improved; if EF lower after the operation, the systolic function gets deteriorate. Investigators use diastolic degree to evaluate the diastolic function. If diastolic degree is lower after the operation, the diastolic function gets improved; If diastolic degree is higher after the operation, the diastolic function gets deteriorated.</description>
