      Aim: Hypothesis of this study was that WBV activates different receptors or reflex pathways&#xD;
      depend on vibration intensity. Aim of this study was to test this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study was conducted on 11 healthy adults. WBV was applied at various&#xD;
      frequencies and amplitudes. The right soleus T-reflex latency was determined before and&#xD;
      during WBV. WBV-IMR latency of the right soleus was determined using two different vibration&#xD;
      intensity: weak vibration and powerful vibration. T-reflex latency and WBV-IMR latency were&#xD;
      determined by using cumulated average method.&#xD;

      Aim: Whole-body vibration (WBV) induces a reflex response in muscles. The physiological&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying this reflex have been explained by activating muscle spindles&#xD;
      (stretch-induced reflex) or osteocytes (bone myoregulation reflex). WBV-induced muscular&#xD;
      reflex (WBV-IMR) latency was reported to be significantly longer than latency of T-reflex as&#xD;
      a stretch-induced reflex or nearly equal to T-reflex latency in the literatures. Hypothesis&#xD;
      of this study was that WBV activates different receptors or reflex pathways depend on&#xD;
      vibration intensity. Aim of this study was to test this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 2.1. Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eleven young, healthy and right hand dominant male adult volunteers were included in this&#xD;
      study. The mean age of the participants was 25.4 ± 4.7 years, mean body height was 176.5 ±&#xD;
      6.7 cm and mean body weight was 77.8 ± 13.8 kg. All volunteers gave written informed consent&#xD;
      to the experimental procedures, which were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and&#xD;
      were approved by the local ethics committee (Yeditepe University Medical Faculty Clinical&#xD;
      Research Evaluation Committee, Istanbul; 2016/564 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Procedure Prior to the induction of WBV, control T-reflex recordings were elicited and&#xD;
      then the participants completed a 15-s trial WBV protocol to familiarize themselves with the&#xD;
      procedure. Following the control T-reflex recordings, the trial protocol and a 15-s rest, the&#xD;
      participants received three set of WBV and T-reflex stimuli during WBV. A weak vibration was&#xD;
      applied in the first set. In next sets, a moderate and strong vibration were applied,&#xD;
      respectively. Vibration characteristics of three sets was given in Table 1. A WBV set&#xD;
      consisted of four vibration periods, each lasting for 60 s, with 5-s rest intervals between&#xD;
      periods. Within each set, WBV frequencies of 25, 29, 33, and 37 Hz were delivered The surface&#xD;
      electromyography (SEMG) and accelerometer data were obtained while the participants stood&#xD;
      upright on the vibration platform with the knees in extension. The participants were&#xD;
      barefooted and stood directly on the vibration platform. The whole plate oscillated with a&#xD;
      linear movement upward and downward. Two WBV devices (Power-Plate®Pro5, PowerPlate®&#xD;
      International, Ltd. London, UK) were used in the present study. One of them was used for&#xD;
      applying the moderate and strong vibration. The other WBV device was modified to attenuate&#xD;
      vibration intensity and used for applying the weak vibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Data Recordings The recordings of both T-reflex and WBV-IMR were acquired using SEMG.&#xD;
      The Ag/AgCl electrodes (KENDALL®Covidien) with a disc radius of 10 mm were placed 20 mm apart&#xD;
      on the right soleus muscle belly on shaved skin that had been cleaned with alcohol in&#xD;
      accordance with the recommendations of the Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive&#xD;
      Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM) project (Hermens et al., 2000). The ground electrode was&#xD;
      placed on the lateral malleolus. The sampling frequency was selected as 10 kHz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A very light (2.9 g) triaxial MEMS piezoaccelerometer (LIS344ALH, full-scale of ± 6 g, linear&#xD;
      accelerometer, ECOPACK®) was taped to the participant's right Achilles tendon to determine&#xD;
      the timing of the onset of the mechanical stimulus for the T-reflex and to measure stroke&#xD;
      intensity of reflex hammer to Achilles tendon (Achilles accelerometer). Similar&#xD;
      accelerometers fixed to the WBV platforms to determine the timing of the onset of the&#xD;
      mechanical stimulus for the WBV-IMR (platform accelerometers). Acceleration unit used in this&#xD;
      study was m/s2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A custom-made reflex hammer tapped the right Achilles tendon just caudal to the accelerometer&#xD;
      with a force of about 19.6 N. Before vibration and in each vibration session, the Achilles&#xD;
      tendon was tapped ten times with approximately 3-s intervals between taps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4.Data processing SEMG and accelerometer data were recorded using a PowerLAB® data&#xD;
      acquisition system (ADInstruments, Oxford, United Kingdom) and the data were analyzed offline&#xD;
      using the LabChart7® (ver 7.3.7, ADInstruments, Oxford, United Kingdom) software. A sampling&#xD;
      frequency of 10 kHz was used. All accelerometer recordings were filtered with high-pass&#xD;
      filter set at 5 Hz. All EMG recordings were filtered using a band pass filter from 60 to 500&#xD;
      Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum peak-to-peak (PPmax) amplitudes of T-reflex were determined for each vibration&#xD;
      session. The amplitude of WBV-IMR was expressed as the Root Mean Square (RMS). The PPmax&#xD;
      amplitude of T-reflex and RMS amplitude of WBV-IMR recorded during the strong WBV were used&#xD;
      to normalize of the PPmax amplitude of T-reflex and RMS amplitude of WBV-IMR recorded before&#xD;
      WBV or during weak and moderate WBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, reflex latency was defined as the time between the onset of the&#xD;
      mechanical stimulus and the onset of the EMG spike on the cumulated average trace, both of&#xD;
      which were determined using the cumulative average method, as previously described (Karacan&#xD;
      et al). The positive peaks of the rectified EMG data were used as a trigger to average the&#xD;
      accelerometer data and the rectified EMG data. The point on the cumulative average trace of&#xD;
      the platform accelerometer data where the standard error (SE) was the lowest was considered&#xD;
      the stimulus onset point. The point on the cumulative average trace of the rectified EMG data&#xD;
      where the SE was lowest was considered the point of onset for the EMG spike. The mean height&#xD;
      of young adult males in country (175 cm) was used to normalize of the T-reflex and WBV-IMR&#xD;
      latencies (Cidem et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. Precautions for voluntary muscle contractions and motion artifacts Five measures were&#xD;
      taken: 1) the participants were asked to use the handles of the WBV device to secure their&#xD;
      balance. The sense of balance may impair during WBV. Therefore muscles may be activated to&#xD;
      restore balance during WBV, 2) Before WBV trials, participants were asked to relax and not to&#xD;
      make voluntary contractions in their lower extremity muscles. This instruction was provided&#xD;
      with verbal feedback given by the researcher who monitored the SEMG recordings from the&#xD;
      screen. If the RMS amplitude of EMG was lower than five microvolts during this intruction, it&#xD;
      was accepted that muscle relaxation was accomplished by participant, 3) a trial protocol was&#xD;
      applied to familiarize vibration, 4) all cables were carefully taped to the skin to minimize&#xD;
      motion artifacts, 5) all EMG recordings were filtered to avoid WBV induced movement artifacts&#xD;
      (Sebik et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6. Statistical analysis The normal distribution of the data was confirmed using the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous variables were summarized as arithmetic mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paired sample t-test was used to analyze the statistical difference in the amplitude of&#xD;
      WBV-IMR between weak and moderate WBV. General linear model repeated measures test was used&#xD;
      to compare in the T-reflex latencies, WBV-IMR latencies or PPmax amplitude of T-reflex among&#xD;
      the sessions. The alpha (α) threshold was chosen as 0.05. The Bonferroni test was applied for&#xD;
      pair-wise comparisons (PostHoc analyses). Using a Bonferroni (a significance level for each&#xD;
      pair-wise comparisons is α/m, m is the number of pair-wise comparisons), results with a p&#xD;
      value ≤ 0.017 were considered significant. Confidence interval (CI), mean, and standard error&#xD;
      (SE) were calculated for all data. When comparing means of two data sets, if ±95% CI of one&#xD;
      data set included the mean of another data set, it was established that there is no&#xD;
      statistical difference between the means of two data sets. The data management software&#xD;
      package used was PASW statistics (formerly SPSS Statistics) for Windows.&#xD;
