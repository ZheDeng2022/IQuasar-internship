      selection criteria without any exclusions as outlined in the Clinical Investigation Plan&#xD;
      (CIP).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Device Placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ease of placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placement success&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding and spotting patterns&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discontinuation rate and reasons for discontinuation&#xD;
