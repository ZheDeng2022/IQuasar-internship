      This study aims to examine the effect of ginger beverage consumption on platelets activity in&#xD;
      apparently healthy Saudi adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for the Saudi population, consumption of powdered ginger dissolved in hot water is a&#xD;
      common practice. Accordingly, in this study, it is tempting to speculate the effect of this&#xD;
      form of ginger consumption, given in separate time points per day, on platelet aggregation&#xD;
      profile by using platelet aggregation analogues. If positive results were obtained, the herb&#xD;
      could provide natural protection against the development of platelet aggregation&#xD;
      complications and could be a potential alternative to aspirin, used for improving blood&#xD;
      circulation and hematological pathophysiologies in diseased individuals.&#xD;

      Herbal medicine products are dietary supplements that people take to improve their health.&#xD;
      Many herbs have been used for a long time for claimed health benefits. They are sold as&#xD;
      tablets, capsules, powders, beverages, extracts and fresh or dried plants. Herbal medicines&#xD;
      have been associated with treatment of several physiological disorders of which&#xD;
      hematological, mainly clotting disorders. Those include garlic, onion, and ginger in addition&#xD;
      to pharmacological reagents such as aspirin, warfarin, heparin, and others. One of the herbal&#xD;
      medications affecting hematological profile is ginger which has gained focus throughout&#xD;
      studies conducted in previous years in the field of inhibiting platelet aggregation, taking&#xD;
      benefit from some undesirable side effects arising from the use of other anti-platelet&#xD;
      aggregation agents, especially aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a well known spice and flavoring agent used in traditional&#xD;
      medicine in many countries. It is a source of valuable phytonutrients characterized by having&#xD;
      aromatic odor and pungent taste. The ginger rhizome contains 60% starch, 10%proteins, 10%&#xD;
      fats, 5% fibers, 6% inorganic material, 10% residual moisture, 1-4% essential oils including&#xD;
      gingerol and zingiberene, in addition to pungent principles such as zingerone, gingerol and&#xD;
      shogaol. Shogaols are produced by heating gingerols. It has been speculated that ginger can&#xD;
      eliminate symptoms associated with a variety of illnesses since there are a variety of&#xD;
      chemical classes that these compounds belong to. Ginger has been used in the management of&#xD;
      headache, nervous diseases, nausea, and vomiting. It has also been used to treat migraine&#xD;
      headaches without side-effects. In addition, it is recommended in the management of rheumatic&#xD;
      disorders and muscular pain. Ginger also acts as a metabolic enhancer where acetone extracts&#xD;
      of ginger have stimulated bile secretion and excretion of gallstones. Although ginger is&#xD;
      considered a safe herbal medicine with only few and insignificant adverse side effects, few&#xD;
      undesirable effects like heartburn were noticed. In quantities higher than 6 g ginger may act&#xD;
      as a gastric irritant and inhalation of dust from ginger may produce immunoglobulin E&#xD;
      (IGE)-mediated allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for ginger toxicity, an acute overdose of ginger is usually in excess of about 2g of&#xD;
      ginger per kilogram of body mass depending on the ginger tolerance level and can result in a&#xD;
      state of central nervous system over-stimulation called &quot;ginger gitters&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental data reveals that ginger may be a dual inhibitor of eicosanoid synthesis,&#xD;
      inhibiting the synthesis of both prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators produced from arachidonic acid. With reference to the fact that normal platelet&#xD;
      functioning is linked to an interplay between those substances, ginger consumption appears to&#xD;
      be linked with reducing platelet aggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets have traditionally been linked with concepts of hemostasis and hemorrhagic&#xD;
      disorders. However, with increasing incidence of atherosclerosis and hematologic disorders,&#xD;
      the critical role played by platelets is more evident. Platelets are no longer viewed as&#xD;
      &quot;scaffolding&quot; for the events of the coagulation cascade but rather as important catalysts in&#xD;
      hemostasis, thrombosis, and fibrinolysis. Improved understanding of platelet physiology has&#xD;
      led to developments of pharmacologic adjuncts resulting in improved patency rates and&#xD;
      improved patient outcomes. Platelets are the smallest components in the blood stream, where&#xD;
      they exist as a-nucleate disc-shaped cells in their resting state and travel singly as&#xD;
      discoidal particles. In the presence of stimuli such as arachidonic acid, activated platelets&#xD;
      change shape into spiny spheres. They bind to fibrinogen, aggregate and release the contents&#xD;
      of their intracellular granules, including adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and serotonin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADP and an arachidonic acid (AA) metabolite acting an endogenous platelet activator,&#xD;
      thromboxane A2 (TxA2), intensify the extent of platelet aggregation. ADP, arachidonic acid,&#xD;
      epinephrine, and collagen act as agonists for platelet aggregation and clumping. These&#xD;
      substances act in positive feedback loops, making platelet aggregation an autocatalytic&#xD;
      rather than equilibrium response. Under pathophysiological conditions, platelet activation&#xD;
      may result in peripheral, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular thrombosis with serious&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin has been the main anti-platelet therapeutic agent. Inhibition of platelet aggregation&#xD;
      by aspirin significantly reduces the incidence of first myocardial infarction, recurrent&#xD;
      infarction and vascular death among patients with cardiovascular disease. Aspirin also&#xD;
      reduces the risk of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction and vascular death in&#xD;
      patients with possible risk factors. However, aspirin ingestion, is mainly associated with&#xD;
      gastric ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. Thus, the use of aspirin may be confined to&#xD;
      elderly patients whose benefits outweigh increased risks of gastrointestinal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingerols and their derivatives, especially [8]-paradol, have been reported to be more potent&#xD;
      anti-platelet and cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitors than aspirin, when tested in vitro by&#xD;
      the Chrono Log whole blood platelet aggregometer. Note that COX-1 is the enzyme responsible&#xD;
      for the conversion of arachidonic acid into important biological mediators including&#xD;
      prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes. These authors proposed that the carbonyl&#xD;
      functional group at C3 found in paradol and in the diarylheptanoid series may contribute to&#xD;
      their potent anti-platelet activity and inhibition of COX-1. Inhibition of the arachidonic&#xD;
      acid (AA) metabolism cascade via the COX-1/thromboxane synthase system by these phenolic&#xD;
      compounds may underline the mechanism of their action. In 2001 Koo et al. compared the&#xD;
      ability of gingerols and related analogs to that of aspirin in inhibiting AA-induced human&#xD;
      platelet serotonin release in vitro. Using the same dose range, it has been found that&#xD;
      gingerols and related analogs were approximately two- to three-fold less potent than aspirin&#xD;
      against the platelet release reaction initiated by AA, and two- to four-fold less potent than&#xD;
      aspirin at inhibiting AA-induced platelet aggregation. Gingerols inhibited COX activity,&#xD;
      assessed by measuring prostaglandin D2, a product of AA metabolism by COX. These results&#xD;
      suggest that inhibition of COX activity by gingerols and related analogs may be the&#xD;
      underlying mechanism for their effect on AA-induced platelet activation. 6-gingerol inhibits&#xD;
      arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and formation of thromboxane B2 and&#xD;
      prostaglandin D2. Gingerol, shogaol and other structurally related substances in ginger&#xD;
      inhibit prostaglandin and leukotriene biosynthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the earlier studies conducted on ginger was that of Srivastava et al. in 1986 where they&#xD;
      found that 5g of fresh, raw ginger has inhibited thromboxane B2 formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a study done on 20 healthy male individuals that were given 50 g of butter and&#xD;
      5g of ginger a day for seven days showed that addition of ginger with a fatty meal inhibited&#xD;
      the platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine greatly. Ginger has&#xD;
      been reported to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Dietary fat content affects&#xD;
      platelet aggregation by modifying prostaglandin metabolism. Administration of ginger in a&#xD;
      fatty diet inhibits the transformation of arachidonic acid to thromboxane and decreases the&#xD;
      sensitivity of platelets to many aggregating agents. In 1994, Lumb et al., have shown in a&#xD;
      cross over study conducted on 8 subjects that 2g of powdered ginger (prepared as medication)&#xD;
      had no effect on bleeding time and whole blood platelet aggregation. Similarly, 15g and 40g&#xD;
      of fresh or cooked raw ginger did not induce platelet aggregation in a cross over study&#xD;
      conducted by Janssen et al. in 1996. Moreover, in 1997, Boardia et al. found that 4g of&#xD;
      ginger powder was ineffective, where as 10g reduced platelet aggregation. Tested via addition&#xD;
      of platelet aggregation agonists collagen, ADP, and epinephrine, platelet aggregation was&#xD;
      inhibited by 35.3%, 37.8%, and 35.9% respectively upon administration of 1g dry ginger for a&#xD;
      week. A combination of 1 g ginger with 10 mg nifedipine per day could be valuable for&#xD;
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complication due to platelet aggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, studies conducted to study the effect of ginger on bleeding risk have found no&#xD;
      effect up to 15g raw ginger, 40g cooked ginger, or 4g dried ginger daily on platelet&#xD;
      aggregation whereas 10g of dried ginger decreased platelet aggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout previous years, several studies have been designed to study the effect of&#xD;
      different doses of different ginger forms (fresh, dry, extract, capsules) on platelet&#xD;
      aggregation profile. Although most of them have made the suspect true, still others possess&#xD;
      controversial results. In view of what literature has offered, it is most probable that&#xD;
      ginger anti-platelet effect could be dose dependent, form dependent, and probably population&#xD;
      or individual dependent as postulated by Helgason et al. in 1993 in their analysis of aspirin&#xD;
      and warfarin platelet aggregation effect. Previous studies might have also employed old,&#xD;
      non-reliable techniques in studying platelet aggregation profiles. As for the Saudi&#xD;
      population, consumption of powdered ginger dissolved in hot water is a common practice.&#xD;
      Accordingly, in this study, it is tempting to speculate the effect of this form of ginger&#xD;
      consumption, given in separate time points per day, on platelet aggregation profile by using&#xD;
      platelet aggregation analogues. If positive results were obtained, the herb could provide&#xD;
      natural protection against the development of platelet aggregation complications and could be&#xD;
      a potential alternative to aspirin, used for improving blood circulation and hematological&#xD;
      pathophysiologies in diseased individuals.&#xD;
