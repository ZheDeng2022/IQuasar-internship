  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a regulatory requirement to evaluate the extent of reduction (if any) of growth&#xD;
      velocity associated with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) containing products that are to be&#xD;
      administered to children, and to this end there is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      regulatory guidance. This is a randomised, single-blind (run-in period)/double-blind&#xD;
      (treatment period), parallel group, placebo controlled, multicentre study to assess the&#xD;
      effect of once daily (OD) inhaled fluticasone furoate (FF) 50 microgram (mcg) on growth&#xD;
      velocity in prepubertal asthmatic children on a background therapy of open-label montelukast.&#xD;
      This study will be conducted over a total duration of approximately 76 weeks: 16-week run-in&#xD;
      period (single-blind placebo inhaler), 52-week double-blind treatment period (inhaled FF 50&#xD;
      mcg /placebo administered OD in the morning for 52 weeks) and 8-week follow-up period. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to evaluate the magnitude of effect (with a level of precision) on&#xD;
      growth velocity of prepubertal asthmatic paediatric subjects (aged 5 to &lt;9 years) following&#xD;
      administration of OD inhaled FF 50 mcg for one year. This study fulfills European Union (EU)&#xD;
      and United States (US) regulatory requirements for the evaluation of potential growth&#xD;
      suppression in children.&#xD;
