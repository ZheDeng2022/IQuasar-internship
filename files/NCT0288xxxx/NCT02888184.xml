      The aim of the study is to identify prognostication predictors of 6-months neurological&#xD;
      outcome in survivors at day 3 after cardiac arrest (CA) treated with therapeutic hypothermia&#xD;
      (TH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest (CA) management remains challenging. As fewer than 20% of patients survive to&#xD;
      discharge, early prognostication of functional outcome needs accurate prediction.Survivors&#xD;
      outcome depends on initial CA conditions (cause, duration and severity of ischemic injury)&#xD;
      that may lead to the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, associated with high mortality.&#xD;
      Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is the second cause of poor outcome after CA. Indeed, most&#xD;
      survivors remain comatose or in a vegetative state leading to decisions to withdraw life&#xD;
      support. Thus, the American Academy of Neurology had proposed a decision algorithm for use in&#xD;
      prognostication of comatose survivors published in 2006.Before the widespread use of&#xD;
      therapeutic hypothermia (TH), predictor factors of neurological outcome were: serum&#xD;
      neuron-specific enolase (NSE), N20 somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP), status&#xD;
      epilepticus, pupil and corneal reflexes and Glasgow coma score motor response (GCS-M).&#xD;
      Therapeutic hypothermia is recommended in the management of CA.It has been associated with&#xD;
      improved outcome after ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).&#xD;
      However, TH may interfere with clinical examination and electrophysiological predictors (EEG,&#xD;
      SSEP) making prognostication of functional outcome hardiest.The use of sedative drugs and&#xD;
      muscle paralysis during TH is another cause of delayed neurological assessment and&#xD;
      prognostication.The NSE cutoff values to predict poor neurological outcome are not well&#xD;
      defined and can be influenced by TH either.The present study aims at identifying clinical,&#xD;
      electrophysiological and biological prognostication predictors of 6-month neurological&#xD;
      outcome in survivors at day 3 after CA treated by TH. Neurological functional status was&#xD;
      assessed using the 5-item scale Cerebral Performance Category (CPC). Neurological status was&#xD;
      retrospectively assessed at 6 months: CPC of 1 or 2 was defined as good neurological outcome&#xD;
      and CPC of 3 to 5 were defined as poor neurological outcome. Deaths in the first 3 days and&#xD;
      decisions to withdraw or to withhold life support were also collected. The following&#xD;
      prognostication factors were tested: neurological examination at day 3 and 7 including&#xD;
      corneal and pupillary reflexes, GCS-M, status epilepticus, electro-encephalogram (EEG), SSEPs&#xD;
      and NSE levels between day 2 and day 3.&#xD;
