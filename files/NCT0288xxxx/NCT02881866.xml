  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of inhaled furosemide on different types of breathlessness&#xD;
      relief in healthy volunteers. Each volunteer inhaled mists of either furosemide or a control&#xD;
      substance on 3 occasions per day on 2 separate days. On one day they performed one&#xD;
      breathlessness test which creates an 'urge to breathe' known as air hunger (AH) and the other&#xD;
      day they performed a breathlessness test which increases the sense of work/effort (WE) of&#xD;
      breathing. The study is double blinded so neither the volunteer or the research knows which&#xD;
      mist is being inhaled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 16 healthy volunteers will attend 4&#xD;
      sessions. After 2 practice sessions subjects will undergo 2 test days where they will be made&#xD;
      to feel 'air hunger' (hypercapnia with constrained ventilation) before and after mist&#xD;
      inhalations on one day and sense of breathing 'effort' (raised ventilation with external&#xD;
      resistive load) before and after mist inhalations on the second test day. The mist will&#xD;
      either be furosemide or a placebo (saline) mist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urge to urinate from systemic absorption from the lungs will be accounted for by a&#xD;
      concomitant administration of intravenous furosemide when saline is inhaled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furosemide is a prescription drug which makes kidneys produce more urine. When administered&#xD;
      by inhalation as an aerosol it has direct action in the lungs which sensitises slowly&#xD;
      adapting stretch receptors which is believed to account for the relief of dyspnoea previously&#xD;
      reported with inhaled furosemide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vagal afferents from the pulmonary stretch receptors are known to be involved in relief of&#xD;
      air hunger but it is not known if they will also relieve the sense of breathing effort.&#xD;
      Relief of breathlessness will be measured and compared between the two trial days to see if&#xD;
      furosemide specifically relieves the 'air hunger' type of breathlessness and not the 'effort'&#xD;
      type of breathlessness.&#xD;

    <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is from 0 (no breathlessness) to 100 (maximal breathlessness willing to tolerate). The VAS is measure every 15-20 seconds during each experimentally induced breathing test. Each breathing test is performed before and after each mist inhalation. Total of 6 breathing tests. The final minute of a 4 minute steady state breathing test is analysed.</description>

    <description>Previous studies have shown that inhaled furosemide relieves 'air hunger'.&#xD;
Each volunteer has 3 mists per visit. The mists are either in the order of Furosemide-Saline-Furosemide or Saline-Furosemide-Saline. The furosemide mist is 40mg (10mg/ml) nebulised and the saline mist is 4ml nebulised.&#xD;
Induced air hunger (hypercapnia with constrained ventilation) is the active comparator and will be the type of breathlessness induced, before and after each mist inhalation on one day. .</description>
