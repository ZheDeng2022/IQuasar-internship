    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare patient tumor tissue before and after treatment with&#xD;
      chemotherapy plus celecoxib. Investigators will look at gene expression, to see what effect&#xD;
      celecoxib may have on tumor cells.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects or their legally authorized representative must be informed of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study, and must sign and give written informed consent&#xD;
             in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically proven urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Those&#xD;
             with mixed histology, including a component of urothelial carcinoma, are eligible.&#xD;
             Pure small cell carcinoma, pure adenocarcinoma, and pure squamous cell carcinoma are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have Stage cT2-T4a N0 M0 disease. Clinical T stage is based on the TURBT&#xD;
             sample, exam under anesthesia and cross-sectional imaging studies. Patients must&#xD;
             undergo cystoscopy and TURBT as part of the staging procedure within 120 days prior to&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To exclude non-bulky/low-risk tumors, subjects must have documented muscle invasion with at&#xD;
        least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i. Disease measuring at least 10 mm on cross-sectional imaging. Bladder thickening on&#xD;
        imaging, by itself, is not adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. The presence of tumor-associated hydronephrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have staging scans with abdominal/pelvic CT or MRI scan, and CT scan or&#xD;
             x-ray of the chest within 56 days prior to registration. If the alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
             is &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), there is a presence of suspicious bone pain,&#xD;
             or if there is other clinical suspicion of bone metastases, a whole body bone scan is&#xD;
             required within 56 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;

             clearance ≥ 50 mL/min. The serum creatinine value used in the calculation must have&#xD;
             been obtained within 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic function (within 28 days prior to registration),&#xD;
             defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (or ≤ 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
             with Gilbert's disease); and ii. SGOT (AST) ≤ 2 x institutional ULN; and iii. SGPT&#xD;
             (ALT) ≤ 2 x institutional ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate hematologic function (within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             registration), defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/μL; and ii. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL; and iii.&#xD;
             Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have tumor tissues from transurethral resection of the bladder tumor&#xD;
             (TURBT) that is within 120 days of registration and available for submission. Tissue&#xD;
             sample must be sufficient for IHC testing; that is,it must be sufficient tumor tissues&#xD;
             for correlative science after pathologic diagnosis [i.e., enough tumor tissue to pass&#xD;
             the staging criteria in 4c].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must consent to the submission of FFPE blocks and/or unstained slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have presence of Class III or IV heart failure, according to New&#xD;
             York Heart Association Classifications, or a known left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;

             scan (MUGA) is not required prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a significant history of bleeding events. Patients with a&#xD;
             history of a significant bleeding episode (e.g. hemoptysis, upper or lower GI&#xD;

             resection of the bladder tumor) within 6 months of registration are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No arterial thrombotic events within 6 months of registration, including transient&#xD;
             ischemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), peripheral arterial thrombus,&#xD;

             celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have any incidence of or uncontrolled medical illness (e.g. active&#xD;
             cardiac symptoms, active systemic infection, etc.) that would limit the patient's&#xD;
             ability to participate in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential teratogenic side effects&#xD;
             of the protocol treatment. Women/men of reproductive potential must agree to use an&#xD;
             effective contraceptive method during and for 6 months after completing protocol&#xD;
             treatment. A negative pregnancy test is required within 7 days prior to registration&#xD;
             for women of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are ineligible if they plan on regular use of NSAIDs at any dose more than 2&#xD;
             times per week (on average) or aspirin at more than 325 mg at least three times per&#xD;
             week, on average. Low-dose aspirin not exceeding 100 mg/day is permitted. Patients who&#xD;
             agree to stop regular NSAIDs or higher dose aspirin are eligible and no wash out&#xD;
             period is required.&#xD;
