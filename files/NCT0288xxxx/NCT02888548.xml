  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper limb spasticity is currently mainly managed with local toxin treatments. Recent studies&#xD;
      suggested combining botulinum toxin injections with splinting to optimise rehabilitation in&#xD;
      spastic patients. However, one study focused exclusively on lower limb spasticity, the second&#xD;
      on elbow flexor hypertonia, and the last on wrist and finger spasticity in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study was performed in adult patients with upper limb spasticity treated with botulinum&#xD;
      toxin injections used as primary objective the tolerance for dynamic splinting. The authors&#xD;
      noted that the need for botulinum toxin was reduced in 2 patients out of 6. No study has been&#xD;
      conducted to date on the splinting + toxin combination in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study showed that stretching sessions over 2 weeks of a muscle just given botulinum&#xD;
      toxin helped improve the toxin's efficacy 2, 6 and 12 weeks after the injection. For this&#xD;
      reason, rehabilitation teams routinely prescribe 10 sessions of physiotherapy for 15 days&#xD;
      after botulinum treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this principle, we hypothesise that dynamic night splinting applied just after&#xD;
      botulinum toxin treatment may also increase the toxin's efficacy. We chose a dynamic splint&#xD;
      providing continuous stretching of the wrist and fingers in extension whilst allowing active&#xD;
      flexion. Night splinting is thought to promote optimal functional use of the paretic upper&#xD;
      limb during the day and thus prevent learned non-use, which could worsen the spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive treatment cycles, whose results will be compared, so that each&#xD;
      patient will act as his/her own control. The evaluation will be based on the Tardieu scale&#xD;
      chosen for its greater inter-individual reproducibility and greater reliability to measure&#xD;
      spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of extension of wrist and fingers provided by the splint will be adjusted to the&#xD;
      patient's clinical condition with the elastic tensioners. The purpose of the splint is to&#xD;
      maintain the stretch beyond the Tardieu spasticity angle at fast speed (V3) without reaching&#xD;
      maximum extension, which could be harmful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is designed to determine whether dynamic night hand splinting combined with&#xD;
      botulinum toxin injections will improve botulinum antispastic efficacy in adults with brain&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicentre, randomised, evaluation-blinded, crossover, pilot study, will&#xD;
      include different treatment cycles: a control cycle (toxin alone) and a study cycle (toxin +&#xD;
      splinting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be conducted in two sites: CHU de Reims and UGECAM de Charleville Mézières.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include patients with upper limb spasticity associated with&#xD;
      functional impairment and/or pain. To be included, the patients must be non-naïve to&#xD;
      botulinum toxin, with a period of at least 4 months since the last toxin injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be given botulinum toxin injections in the hypertonic muscles of his/her&#xD;
      upper limb at the beginning of each cycle, i.e. on D0 Phase 1 (D0P1) and D0 Phase 2 (D0P2).&#xD;
      This means each patient will receive two sets of injections at 5-month interval for the whole&#xD;
      duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the effect of the toxin is still present at 5 months (W20), the visit for the&#xD;
           following cycle may be delayed to ensure that both cycles are comparable (as per routine&#xD;
           practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the effect is still present at the end of the second cycle, the patient follow-up&#xD;
           will be extended until the end of the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is the first study of its type, the required number of subjects cannot be calculated&#xD;
      and the decision was taken to conduct a pilot study. The required number of patients has been&#xD;
      set at 30 for reasons of clinical relevance and study site capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomised centrally into two arms of 15 patients each:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: control cycle (toxin alone) followed by study cycle (toxin + splinting)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: study cycle (toxin + splinting) followed by control cycle (toxin alone) The&#xD;
           second set of toxin injections will be performed 5 months after the first set. As the&#xD;
           effect of the toxin lasts 12 to 20 weeks maximum, this interval ensures that the effect&#xD;
           of the first injections will have worn off before the second set of injections is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin will be administered under electrical stimulation guidance to improve the&#xD;
      accuracy of the injections in the muscles. Dysport® doses will be adjusted to the muscle&#xD;
      group being treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-injection rehabilitation protocol will be identical for both cycles, and include 10&#xD;
      sessions of physiotherapy to stretch the injected muscles (as per routine practice). The&#xD;
      prescription of these sessions will be standardised. These daily sessions will start the day&#xD;
      following the botulinum injections, and continue 5 times a week for 2 weeks for both&#xD;
      treatment phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study cycle, the splint will be worn only at night (8.00 pm to 8.00 am) for 4 weeks,&#xD;
      starting on the first evening after the toxin injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any previous and on-going drug treatment will also be recorded. Concomitant oral antispastic&#xD;
      treatments will be authorised provided they were initiated prior to the patient's inclusion&#xD;
      in the study, and that dosage regimens remain unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator performing the evaluations will be blinded to the treatment cycle, i.e.&#xD;
      he/she will not know which treatment cycle the patient is currently in. Therefore, the&#xD;
      evaluating, injecting and splint-referring physicians will be three different people. To&#xD;
      limit potential biases, these 3 persons will remain the same during all the study for all the&#xD;
      patients included.&#xD;
