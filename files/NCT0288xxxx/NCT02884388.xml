  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate the hypothesis that a combined nerve block produces&#xD;
      better outcomes including intraoperative stress, hemorrheological indexes, postoperative&#xD;
      immune function, and incidence of postoperative complications than general anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The elderly patients have poor tolerance to anesthesia and total hip replacement because of&#xD;
      severe surgical trauma and much blood loss. General anesthesia is a primary anesthesia method&#xD;
      used previously for total hip replacement in the elderly and it has many limitations, for&#xD;
      example, it can interfere with the physiological function in the elderly patients. The&#xD;
      organic function and compensative ability of the elderly are often weakened to varying&#xD;
      degrees because of cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease or diabetes mellitus, thus&#xD;
      nociceptive stimuli such as anesthesia and surgery greatly influence the stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress refers to an organism's non-specific reactions to various nociceptive stimuli, i.e.,&#xD;
      stressors, in which many factors are involved. It can stimulate sympathetic nerves,&#xD;
      strengthen the function of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and cause changes in various&#xD;
      metabolisms, thereby playing an important role in maintaining intraoperative vital signs and&#xD;
      recovering postoperative immune function. Different anesthesia methods produce different&#xD;
      effects on organism's immune function. Effects of anesthesia on immune function are closely&#xD;
      related to the complications, such as postoperative infection. In addition, the immunity in&#xD;
      the elderly is relatively poorer than that in the normal healthy population. Therefore, a&#xD;
      rational anesthesia method is of important clinical significance for safe surgery and&#xD;
      postoperative recovery in the elderly. A combined nerve block has been reportedly to be more&#xD;
      suitable for total hip replacement in the elderly because of its safety and reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous related studies focused primarily on onset time of anesthesia and postoperative&#xD;
      complications. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported on the effect of a&#xD;
      combined nerve block on intraoperative stress and postoperative immune function in the&#xD;
      elderly patients subjected to total hip replacement. Therefore, this study is innovative in&#xD;
      our mind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      If severe adverse events including any expected or unexpected symptoms occur, information&#xD;
      including the data of occurrence, type of adverse events, measures taken related to the&#xD;
      treatment of the adverse events will be reported to the project manager and the institutional&#xD;
      review board within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, management, analysis and open access&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: according to trial design type and requirement, a table will be developed to&#xD;
      record trial data. The recorded data will be input into an electronic database using a&#xD;
      double-data entry strategy by trained professional staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: information accuracy will be checked when all recruited patients are&#xD;
      followed up. The database will be locked by the researcher in charge and will not be altered.&#xD;
      All information relating to this trial will be preserved by Qinghai University Affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The electronic database will be made available to a professional statistician&#xD;
      for statistical analysis. An outcome analysis report will be made by the statistician and&#xD;
      submitted to the lead researchers. An independent data monitoring committee will supervise&#xD;
      and manage the trial data with the goal of ensuring a scientific and stringent trial process,&#xD;
      resulting in accurate and complete data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data open access: Anonymized trial data will be published at http://www.figshare.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed by a statistician using SPSS 19.0 software and will&#xD;
      follow the intention-to-treat principle. Normally distributed measurement data will be&#xD;
      expressed as a mean, standard deviation, min, and max. Non-normally distributed measurement&#xD;
      data will be expressed as a lower quartile (q1), median, and upper quartile (q3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare fasting blood glucose level, serum cortisol&#xD;
      concentration, hemorrheological indexes and immune function-related indices between&#xD;
      experimental and control groups. The Mcnemar χ2 test will be used to compare the incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events between experimental and control groups, with an accepted significance level&#xD;
      of α = 0.05.&#xD;
