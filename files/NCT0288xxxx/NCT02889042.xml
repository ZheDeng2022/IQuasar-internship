    <textblock>
      France is one of the European countries with the highest rate of death by suicide, more than&#xD;
      10 400 deaths each year, about 16 people out of 100 000. Although suicide mortality rate&#xD;
      tends to fall between 1987 and 2008 the number of suicide attempts (TS) against observed by&#xD;
      an upward trend between 2005 and 2010. However, the most important predictor of death by&#xD;
      suicide remains the TS. Now these are primarily TS Poisoning Drug-Volunteer (IMV), especially&#xD;
      benzodiazepines. These IMV, there have been 16% recurrence in the past year and 21% at 4&#xD;
      years among hospitalized patients. Or a Health Barometer 2005 survey showed that 58% of&#xD;
      respondents with a TS over the last 12 months had not been hospitalized. This type of acting&#xD;
      out, especially the repeated IMV (IMVr) is underestimated epidemiologically because it is an&#xD;
      unknown phenomenon and too little screened by health professionals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IMVr constitute severe behavior disorder, chronic and costly given the multiple&#xD;
      prescriptions, hospital admissions, including emergencies, and repeated treatment failures,&#xD;
      in the absence of specific treatment of psychopathological problematic background. Indeed&#xD;
      many arguments lead to evoke the existence of a functioning underlying addictive type, rather&#xD;
      than a problem of suicide, especially from the second recurrence (often characterized by low&#xD;
      lethality and suicidal intentionality). This impulsive behavior and / or compulsive&#xD;
      repeatedly would not simply the consequence of a pharmacological benzodiazepine dependence&#xD;
      (it is also not systematic), but would demonstrate a similar operation to that of behavioral&#xD;
      addictions. Furthermore, a preliminary study has shown that this type of behavior was not&#xD;
      limited to a BPD personality type, since it is mainly found pathological personalities&#xD;
      depressive and avoidant types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context it is urgent to make an accurate characterization of these patients IMVr&#xD;
      because the integration of the addictive dimension in their care will adapt strategies&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic, pharmacological, and the terms of issue of psychotropic and especially&#xD;
      benzodiazepines .&#xD;
