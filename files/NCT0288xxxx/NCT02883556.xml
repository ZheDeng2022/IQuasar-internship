  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patient&#xD;
      with locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Agents blocking the Programmed Cell Death 1(PD1)/Programmed Cell Death 1-Ligand 1 (PD-L1)&#xD;
      pathway have demonstrated objective, durable tumor regressions in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid malignancies and efficacy has been linked to PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression by&#xD;
      tumour cells is the strongest single predictor of response to anti-PD1 therapy (J Taube, R&#xD;
      Anders et al, Clin Cancer Res 2014). Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a high-affinity humanized&#xD;
      monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody. It leads to dual PD1-ligand blockade of PD-L1 and PD-L2 that&#xD;
      may reactivate the immune surveillance and elicit anti-tumour response. It has antitumor&#xD;
      activity in melanoma and NSCLC (phase III trials). Pembrolizumab might be of interest in&#xD;
      unresectable squamous cell carcinomas of the skin (SCCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 20% to 30% of non-melanoma skin cancers are SCCS. Most patients with primary&#xD;
      SCCS have an excellent prognosis, but SCCS can progress to advanced stages that are&#xD;
      impossible to treat by surgical excision or radiotherapy. Few therapeutic options are&#xD;
      available for these tumors. Conventional chemotherapy, such as cisplatin-based combinations,&#xD;
      has some efficacy, but the toxic effects of these combinations often prohibit their use in&#xD;
      elderly patients. Epidermal Growth Factor (EGFR) signaling antagonists have activity only in&#xD;
      a subset of patients. New therapeutic options are needed for patients with advanced SCCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No trial evaluating pembrolizumab in human SCCS is ongoing. Investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) PD-L1 is expressed in SCCS as in HNSCC ii) pembrolizumab may be effective as a single&#xD;
      agent in patients with unresectable SCCS iii) Efficacy of pembrolizumab is correlated to&#xD;
      PD-L1 expression in SCCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators therefore intend to determine the efficacy and safety of single agent&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in all patients and in patients with PD-L1-positive unresectable SCCS naïve of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and of EGFR inhibitors.&#xD;

             have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for&#xD;
             at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
