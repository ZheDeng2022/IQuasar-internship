      For twenty years, as for other surgical disciplines, new minimally invasive techniques have&#xD;
      been developed with the main goal the reduction of muscle trauma associated with the&#xD;
      surrounding roads &quot;classic&quot; and reduce morbidity linked to this one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, minimally invasive methods dedicated to spinal surgery were established, for&#xD;
      the treatment of herniated discs initially, then for narrow lumbar canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The canal release on minimally invasive fusion, using a tubular system for muscle retraction&#xD;
      is a new technique that has proven effective: post operative pain reduction of hospital stay&#xD;
      and blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to investigate the quality of ductal release in these minimally&#xD;
      invasive fusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective of the study: Evaluation of the quality of the release of post scanners&#xD;
      operative minimally invasive arthrodesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: Assessment rates/types of early complications of technical Minimally&#xD;
      invasive - early postoperative results (postoperative pain, analgesic consumption, length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, blood loss) - in clinical outcomes in the short and medium term decompression&#xD;
      after minimally invasive fusion.&#xD;

      I. Background / Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      For twenty years, as for other surgical disciplines, new minimally invasive techniques have&#xD;
      been developed with the main goal the reduction of muscle trauma associated with the&#xD;
      surrounding roads &quot;classic&quot; and reduce morbidity linked to this one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, minimally invasive methods dedicated to spinal surgery were established, for&#xD;
      the treatment of herniated discs initially, then for narrow lumbar canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The canal release on minimally invasive fusion, using a tubular system for muscle retraction&#xD;
      is a new technique that has proven effective: post operative pain reduction of hospital stay&#xD;
      and blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to investigate the quality of ductal release in these minimally&#xD;
      invasive fusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      at. primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the quality of discharge on postoperative scanners minimally invasive fusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Evaluation of the rate and type of early complications in the minimally invasive technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Evaluation of early postoperative results (postoperative pain, analgesic consumption,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, blood loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Evaluation of clinical outcomes in the short and medium term decompression after&#xD;
      minimally invasive fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Methodology and duration of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective single-center consecutive series multi-operator regarding the&#xD;
      evaluation of surgical practice cited in goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data were collected prospectively by KEOPS database (SAMIO). All patients included&#xD;
      in our study have spinal MRI scanners and pre-operative and post-operative scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N = (number of patients and over what period) / Time Study?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The series of patients will be classified into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Foraminal stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the primary objective criterion is comparing the height of the foramen&#xD;
      measured on CT pre- and post-operative between the lower edge of the overlying pedicle and&#xD;
      the top edge of the pedicle underlying the sagittal sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For central stenosis, Postoperative MRI will be performed and the volume of the dural sac&#xD;
      will be compared to preoperative MRI on axial images.&#xD;
