      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk profile of&#xD;
      ResQFoam for the inhospital treatment of exsanguinating, intraabdominal haemorrhage due to&#xD;
      trauma in patients where emergent laparotomy is required.&#xD;

          2. Emergent, exsanguinating hemorrhage, from abdominal source as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Class III or IV hemorrhagic shock or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) score â‰¥ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Confirmation of abdominal hemorrhage by:&#xD;

               -  Diagnostic Peritoneal Aspiration (DPA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No other known, uncontrolled active sources of hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is intubated and sedated per local guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Decision to administer foam is made within 30 minutes of admission to the emergency&#xD;
             department.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Decision made to proceed to emergent laparotomy made within 30 minutes of admission to&#xD;
             the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Definitive surgical care is expected to occur within three hours of foam deployment&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject must also be receiving concurrent transfusion of fluids or blood products.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Known or suspected major diaphragm injury&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Known or suspected blunt or penetrating cardiac or thoracic aortic trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Traumatic brain injury resulting in decapitation, visible brain matter or considered&#xD;
             non- survivable based on initial physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Received greater than five consecutive minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the&#xD;
             pre-emergency department setting&#xD;

         19. History of prior abdominal surgery or evidence of abdominal surgery (scars)&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Disrupted abdominal wall that, in the opinion of the investigator would preclude&#xD;
             ResQFoam from being adequately contained within the abdominal cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subject in whom the abdominal aortic junctional tourniquet (AAJT) or Resuscitative&#xD;
             Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) techniques have been used&#xD;
