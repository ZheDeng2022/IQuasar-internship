      The surgical and local ablation strategy for the treatment of resectable synchronous and&#xD;
      metachronous colorectal liver metastases(CRLM) has not still been defined. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to compare two treatment strategies in which simultaneous resection of both&#xD;
      primary and secondary tumor of synchronous CRLM(SCRLM) and resection of metachronous&#xD;
      CRLM(MCRLM) is compared with resection of primary tumor and ablation of secondary tumor in&#xD;
      SCRLM and ablation of MCRLM. Endpoints include the rate of severe complications and survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer(CRC) kills more than 700,000 patients every year, which is nowadays the&#xD;
      world's 3rd common and the 4th deadly tumor. About 50% CRC patients will finally develop&#xD;
      colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). Among the CRLM patients, 20-25% of CRC are found with&#xD;
      synchronous colorectal liver metastases (SCRLM) at the first visit. Meanwhile, about 20-30%&#xD;
      CRC patients suffer by metachronous colorectal liver metastasis (MCRLM) even after radical&#xD;
      resection of primary tumor. It is nowadays admitted that the R0 resection of both primary and&#xD;
      secondary tumors in SCRLM and R0 resection of MCRLM represents a feasible and potential&#xD;
      curative treatment in patients with resectable CRLM(RCRLM). However, the treatment strategy&#xD;
      for some RCRLM (tumor number≤3 and tumor size≤3.0cm), such as whether to choose hepatectomy&#xD;
      or local ablation, still remains in debate. In primary hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), local&#xD;
      ablation has been proved to has similar curative effect to that of hepatectomy. Compared to&#xD;
      hepatectomy, local ablation has less trauma and more rapid recovery and possible lower&#xD;
      hospitalization cost. The curative effect of local ablation is mainly influenced by tumor&#xD;
      site and tumor size. On the other side, some RCRLM might develop repeat recurrences even&#xD;
      after &quot;R0&quot; resection due to the imaging undetectable micro metastasis. Thus, local ablation&#xD;
      might be more suitable for some repeat recurrent CRLM. The aim of this study is to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy/safety of local ablation with hepatectomy for RCRLM (tumor number≤3, tumor&#xD;
      size≤3.0cm), including both SCRLM and MCRLM. Patients are randomized to CRLM resection group&#xD;
      and local ablation group. The primary endpoint is overall survival. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      evaluate the rate of patients with at least one severe complication within 30 days after&#xD;
      surgery/ablation and long-term clinical outcomes, in particular disease-free survival.&#xD;
