  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical Site Complications (SSC's) are responsible for increased morbidity in patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery resulting in prolonged length of stay in the hospital while increasing&#xD;
      treatment and hospital costs dramatically. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) use on&#xD;
      closed incisions has been reported in the literature to reduce SSC's including Surgical Site&#xD;
      Infections (SSI's), with many promising studies in general surgery, including some studies&#xD;
      using single use NPWT. However, to date, there are very few randomised controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCT's) using this intervention. When using PICOTM (NPWT) for this indication, patients may&#xD;
      be discharged from hospital earlier, with the negative pressure incision management in place.&#xD;
      This has implications in terms of cost savings for the health care system and enables the&#xD;
      patient to be able to return to their normal daily routine more quickly. The hypothesis of&#xD;
      this study is that PICO NPWT will reduce frequency of SSC's, in a 30 day follow up period, as&#xD;
      compared to standard care in patients undergoing colorectal procedures.&#xD;

    <description>PICO is a Single-Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) System consisting of a small portable pump, 2 lithium batteries, 2 dressings and fixation strips. The system is capable of delivering up to 80 mm Hg negative pressure to a wound or surgical incision site and managing low to moderate levels of exudate or fluid generated by the wound or incision. The therapy may be administered for up to 2 weeks.</description>
