    <textblock>
      Health risk screening in adolescent primary care is infrequently performed and results are&#xD;
      rarely followed by targeted intervention. In response to the need for screening-linked&#xD;
      interventions, the study team has developed and optimized a web-based, electronic&#xD;
      Personalized Motivational Feedback tool referred to as &quot;Check Yourself v2.0&quot; Based on&#xD;
      motivational interviewing, a technique to mobilize personal change, Check Yourself is&#xD;
      designed to promote healthy choices for the multiple behaviors relevant to adolescents.&#xD;

      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of Check&#xD;
      Yourself v2.0 to usual care. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of Check&#xD;
      Yourself on reducing health risk behaviors and improving quality of care among adolescents&#xD;
      receiving primary health care services relative to usual care.&#xD;
