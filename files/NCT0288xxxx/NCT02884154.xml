  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exact incidence of subepithelial tumors (SETs) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is&#xD;
      unknown, but the prevalence of gastric SETs detected during routine&#xD;
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy is 0.36%. GI SETs may include leiomyoma, GI stromal tumor (GIST),&#xD;
      schwannoma, lipoma, cyst, or ectopic pancreas. Surgical resection is the principal diagnostic&#xD;
      and therapeutic method for SETs, especially for large and symptomatic ones. Preoperative&#xD;
      pathological diagnosis of SETs may facilitate clinical decision making, but conventional&#xD;
      endoscopic forceps biopsy does not yield adequate amounts of subepithelial tissue for&#xD;
      definitive diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the best imaging modality for the evaluation of&#xD;
      SETs, it cannot substitute histopathological diagnosis. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration&#xD;
      (EUS-FNA) may provide adequate amounts of tissue for the diagnosis of SETs, but it does not&#xD;
      always afford adequate samples for immunohistochemical analysis because of the often small&#xD;
      number of cells obtained by aspiration. Since some SETs, especially GI mesenchymal tumors&#xD;
      such as GIST or schwannoma, have varied morphologic appearances, and diagnosis using a small&#xD;
      biopsy is not straightforward, immunohistochemical analysis is strongly advisable, if not&#xD;
      essential. EUS-guided Trucut biopsy (EUS-TNB) may overcome the limitations of EUS-FNA in&#xD;
      procuring sufficient core tissue specimens. Although EUS-TNB is more accurate than EUS-FNA&#xD;
      for diagnosing GI mesenchymal tumors, the rigidity of its 19-gauge (G) caliber and the&#xD;
      mechanical friction of the firing mechanism produced by the torqued echoendoscope limit its&#xD;
      use for SETs located in the gastric antrum and duodenum. Therefore, a needle facilitating&#xD;
      adequate histological core sampling with easy maneuverability needs to be established. A 19G&#xD;
      EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) device with ProCore reverse-bevel technology was&#xD;
      recently introduced. A multicenter study revealed that histological samples could be&#xD;
      successfully obtained using this needle in most patients having GI SETs, with a diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of &gt;80%.10 However, because of technical difficulties with this needle in the&#xD;
      gastric antrum and duodenum, the same FNB device was recently developed in a 20 G platform&#xD;
      with coiled sheath. This prospective, multicenter study aimed to evaluate feasibility, yield,&#xD;
      and diagnostic accuracy of a newly developed 20 G ProCore needle with coiled sheath in&#xD;
      patients with GI SETs.&#xD;

      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with newly diagnosed GI SETs will be prospectively enrolled at 8 university&#xD;
      hospitals in Korea between May and December 2016, if they met the following criteria: having&#xD;
      a hypoechoic mass in the submucosal and/or proper muscle layers on the basis of EUS and tumor&#xD;
      &gt;2 cm in size. Exclusion criteria are: SETs were not located in the submucosal and/or proper&#xD;
      muscle layers on EUS; EUS revealed the characteristic findings of lipoma, cyst, vessel or&#xD;
      extraluminal lesions; the platelet count was &lt;50,000/mm3 and prothrombin time was &lt;50%; or&#xD;
      the patient did not provide consent to undergo the study. This study is approved by the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board of each hospital and conducted in accordance with the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki and its amendments and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All enrolled&#xD;
      patients provide written informed consents to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique for EUS-FNB&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures are performed by using a linear array echoendoscope (Olympus UCT-140, UCT-240;&#xD;
      Olympus, Tokyo, Japan or PentaxEG-3870UTK; Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) with the patients placed in&#xD;
      the left lateral decubitus position under conscious sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study commenced, all participating endosonographers discuss the procedural steps&#xD;
      in detail. Technical details of the standard tissue-acquisition protocol are as follows.&#xD;
      After the target lesion is endosonographically visualized and the region scanned for SETs&#xD;
      using color or pulsed Doppler, FNB is performed at the esophagus, stomach, duodenum or&#xD;
      rectum, depending on the lesion location. The needle is advanced into the target tissue under&#xD;
      endosonographic guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After penetrating the lesion, the endosonographer moves the needle to-and-fro for more than&#xD;
      10 to 15 times within the lesion while an assistant simultaneously pulled out the stylet&#xD;
      slowly and continuously over 20 s to achieve minimal negative pressure within the needle&#xD;
      (slow-pull technique). Finally, the needle is withdrawn from the lesion. At least three&#xD;
      needle passes are performed using the designated needle, and if a diagnostic or technical&#xD;
      failure is encountered, the patient is switched to the alternative needle according to the&#xD;
      judgment of the endosonographers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation for histological analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because pathologists are absent during endoscopy, FNB samples are recovered and stored for&#xD;
      subsequent processing by the endosonographers. The specimens are then expressed onto slides&#xD;
      by using a stylet or by flushing with air into the needle assembly, to harvest the core&#xD;
      samples from the needle. The endosonographers then carefully inspect the material on the&#xD;
      slides for the presence of tissue cores defined as whitish pieces of tissue with apparent&#xD;
      bulk, which are measured and then lifted off the slides and placed into a formalin bottle.&#xD;
      The core samples are macroscopically assessed as a definite tissue core; suspicious tissue&#xD;
      core mixed with blood clots; or only blood or scarce sample without any tissue core. The&#xD;
      former two sample types are considered macroscopically optimal core samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If tissue cores are obtained, they are fixed in formalin and stained in hematoxylin and eosin&#xD;
      for evaluation by pathologists. Samples with tissue cores are graded as optimal or&#xD;
      suboptimal: optimal, if the material allows satisfactory assessment of histologic&#xD;
      architecture and immunohistochemical evaluation, such as c-kit, CD34, S-100, or smooth muscle&#xD;
      actin, if indicated, and suboptimal, if the histological core is inadequate for the&#xD;
      abovementioned assessments. Because the morphological characteristics of mesenchymal tumors&#xD;
      are nonspecific, a positive diagnosis by EUS-FNB is only considered true positive when&#xD;
      immunohistochemical analysis is conclusive. Conventional cytological analysis is additionally&#xD;
      performed in most cases or if a core sample is unavailable. Cytological material is sent to&#xD;
      the cytologists as a fixed or an air-dried slide. The gold standard is the histopathological&#xD;
      assessment of the resected specimens for patients who underwent endoscopic resection or&#xD;
      surgery, and the assessment of the FNB samples for those who did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome parameter is diagnostic sufficiency. Diagnostic sufficiency is defined as&#xD;
      the proportion of patients in whom the histopathological diagnosis could be established&#xD;
      within three needle passes. The percentage of cases in which the pathologist classified the&#xD;
      quality of the sample as optimal for histological evaluation is also evaluated. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures are rates of diagnostic failure, technical failure, and complications.&#xD;
      Diagnostic failure is defined as failure to obtain sufficient core samples even after three&#xD;
      passes, and technical failure is defined as malfunction of the needle before three needle&#xD;
      passes. Complications are defined as any deviation from the clinical course after EUS-guided&#xD;
      sampling, as observed by the endosonographers or recovery suite nurses, or as reported by&#xD;
      patients. Excessive bleeding at the site of puncture, perforation, hypotension, and need for&#xD;
      reversal medication are documented.&#xD;
