  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III study of regorafenib 160 mg once daily on&#xD;
      intermittent dosing schedule of 3 weeks on treatment followed by 1 weeks off demonstrated the&#xD;
      significant benefit of regorafenib in terms of PFS in patients with GISTs who had failed to&#xD;
      both imatinib and sunitinib. However, there are concerns that tumors and tumor-related&#xD;
      symptoms may be progressed during off treatment period. Investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      continuous dosing schedule of regorafenib might be feasible and effective to prevent disease&#xD;
      flare on off-treatment period. Based on the results of previous dose escalation study for&#xD;
      continuous regorafenib dosing, we investigate the 100 mg daily dose of regorafenib in&#xD;
      patients with TKI-refractory GISTs.&#xD;
