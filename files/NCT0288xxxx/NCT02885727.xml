      This clinical trial will use the combination of ionizing radiation and immunotherapy&#xD;
      durvalumab (MEDI4736). It is the investigators hypothesis that this combination of ionizing&#xD;
      radiation and immunotherapy is well tolerated and stimulates a clinically significant&#xD;
      pancreas-cancer specific immune response. This trial's primary objective will be to evaluate&#xD;
      whether the combination of RT and durvalumab can improve median PFS compared to chemotherapy&#xD;
      historical control data in metastatic pancreas cancer patients who have progressed through&#xD;
      first-line chemotherapy. The study population includes the metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma patients who have progressed through first-line chemotherapy. The number of&#xD;
      subjects proposed to complete this study is 55.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective will be to evaluate whether the combination of RT and durvalumab improves median PFS compared to historical control in metastatic pancreas cancer patients who have progressed through first-line chemotherapy. PFS is defined as the time from the date of durvalumab initiation to the date of pancreatic cancer progression or death, whichever occurs first. This is a clinically relevant and appropriate endpoint for a phase II trial and since there are no prior studies using immune checkpoint blockade with concurrent RT for metastatic pancreatic cancer will allow for historical comparison to PFS using second-line chemotherapy.</description>
