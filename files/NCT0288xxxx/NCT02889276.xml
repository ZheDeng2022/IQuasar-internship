  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to examine the effects of a functional resistance exercise&#xD;
      programme that closely replicates daily activities and their effects on quality of life, body&#xD;
      composition and functional fitness in cancer survivors. This study will also use a supervised&#xD;
      and group based exercise setting to help with socialisation and confidence with an aim to&#xD;
      improve the exercise experience. Eligible participants should be 18-90 years old, been&#xD;
      treated for colorectal cancer (stages I-IV) in the previous 3 months to five years and with&#xD;
      no limitations to exercise. The study will include a 12-week exercise period where&#xD;
      participants will be randomly allocated to the control group or to take part in 32 supervised&#xD;
      one-hour group exercise sessions involving exercises to target the whole body at a moderate&#xD;
      intensity which will take place in the Mountbatten Centre, Pyramids Centre, Fareham Leisure&#xD;
      Centre or Horizons Leisure Centres. Depending on participants' membership status those in the&#xD;
      control group could use the centre's exercise referral programme, which has a cost attached,&#xD;
      or they will be encouraged to meet national physical activity recommendations by walking 30&#xD;
      minutes per day on most days of the week. The only difference between the two groups will be&#xD;
      the supervised group functional resistance training. At the beginning and end of the 12-week&#xD;
      study period a number of health-related fitness tests will be performed to assess health&#xD;
      outcomes, such as resting blood pressure &amp; heart rate, respiratory function, body fat&#xD;
      measures (body mass index, waist circumference and body fat %), functional performance&#xD;
      measurements, handgrip strength, a 6 minute walk test and self-efficacy to regulate exercise&#xD;
      and measures of quality of life questionnaires. Participants will be provided with their own&#xD;
      results and an overview of the whole study data.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Potential volunteers will be identified by the clinical care team and asked to contact the&#xD;
      research team if they are interested in participating. The participants will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to either a control group or an exercise group and participate in the study. The&#xD;
      control group will be asked to perform 150 minutes of moderate activity a week, such as 30&#xD;
      minutes of brisk walking on 5 days a week. The exercise group will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      the FRT exercise sessions over 12-weeks. The exercise sessions will be performed with a&#xD;
      frequency of 2 times a week (for weeks 1-4) and three times a week (for weeks 5-12). The&#xD;
      exercise programme will include 10 muscle-strengthening exercises and 5 recovery exercises&#xD;
      (for example walking for one minute). All the exercises will be performed in a circuit&#xD;
      fashion and the circuit will be performed 1 time (for weeks 1-2), for 2 times (for weeks 3-6)&#xD;
      and finally for 3 times during the last six weeks of the study (for weeks 7-12). During the&#xD;
      main part of the workout participants will have to perform 10 repetitions at a moderate to&#xD;
      vigorous intensity (for weeks 1-12) for each resistance exercise and they will alternate&#xD;
      every two resistance exercises with one active recovery exercise (e.g. walking). They will&#xD;
      continue this pattern until they complete the circuit. Each circuit will last approximately&#xD;
      15 minutes (1 minute for each of the 10 resistance exercise stations and 1 minute for each of&#xD;
      the 5 active recovery stations)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both before and after their participation in the study, the researcher will take&#xD;
      anthropometric (body weight, height, waist and hip circumference, body fat % and lean body&#xD;
      mass) measurements and the participants will perform four physical fitness tests (6 minutes&#xD;
      walking test, hand grip strength, lift and carry test, chair stand test) in order to assess&#xD;
      the effects of exercise on their physical fitness and to answer the quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire. At least 12 hours before it is important for them to abstain from&#xD;
      participating in any strenuous physical activity and alcohol/caffeine consumption. In&#xD;
      addition, their last meal should be consumed 4 hours before testing. In addition, they will&#xD;
      be given a physical activity diary and during the 12-week study period they will have to&#xD;
      record their daily activity. Participants of the exercise group will also receive a&#xD;
      weight-training diary, where they will record their progress in the FRT stations (i.e. the&#xD;
      increase in resistance load for each FRT exercise).&#xD;
