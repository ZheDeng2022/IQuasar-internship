    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the common malignant tumors in China, with relatively high incident&#xD;
      rate and mortality among the population. Surgery is the conventional treatment option for&#xD;
      early and intermediate-stage stage gastric cancer, but postoperative relapse is the major&#xD;
      issue. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is tumor-derived fragmented DNA with an average size of&#xD;
      166 bp, mixed with cell free DNA (cfDNA) of other sources in blood circulation.ctDNA is&#xD;
      reflecting the most up-to-date status of tumor genome. Hence, it is considered as a new&#xD;
      biomarker for tumor, which can be qualitative, quantitative and used for disease monitoring.&#xD;
      The present clinical trial aims to elucidate the correlation between the serum ctDNA status&#xD;
      and the prognosis of patients with early and intermediate-stage gastric cancer upon surgical&#xD;
      treatment, and explore the possibility of clinical utility of serum ctDNA as a clinical index&#xD;
      to predict postoperative relapse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the common malignant tumors in China, withrelatively high incident&#xD;
      rate and mortality among the population. 95% of the gastric cancer is adenocarcinoma. 70% of&#xD;
      the patients at the early stage show no obvious symptom, and only small number of them has&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, or symptoms that are similar to the of peptic ulcer disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is the conventional treatment option for early and middle stage gastric cancer, but&#xD;
      postoperative relapse is the major issue. Currently, the only proven effective chemotherapies&#xD;
      for gastric cancer are the taxane and platinum-based combination therapies. Also due to its&#xD;
      molecular heterogeneity, the prognosis of gastric caner is highly varied among the patients.&#xD;
      Therefore,there are not many effective targeting therapies available for the treatment of&#xD;
      gastric cancer; and currently, trastuzumab and apatinib are the only two targeting drugs that&#xD;
      have been clinically approved by CFDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is tumor-derived fragmented DNA with an average size of 166 bp,&#xD;
      mixed with cell free DNA (cfDNA) of other sources in blood circulation (2, 3). Although the&#xD;
      mechanisms of its release have not been fully addressed, most reports considered apoptosis&#xD;
      and/or necrosis of tumor cells as its main sources, which makes it a genomic reservoir of&#xD;
      different tumor clones (4). Also, as its half-life is up to hours, ctDNA is reflecting the&#xD;
      most up-to-date status of tumor genome(5). Hence, it is considered as a new biomarker for&#xD;
      tumor, which can be qualitative, quantitative and used for disease monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By monitoring the serum ctDNA mutational profile using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), the&#xD;
      present clinical trial aims to elucidate the correlation between the serum ctDNA status and&#xD;
      the prognosis of patients with early and intermediate-stage gastric cancer upon surgical&#xD;
      treatment, and explore the possibility of clinical utility of serum ctDNA as a clinical index&#xD;
      to predict postoperative relapse. Moreover, by comparing the molecular profiles of patients&#xD;
      with different prognosis, we may also screen out the molecular markers related to the&#xD;
      prognosis of gastric cancer.&#xD;

        This is a prospective clinical study collaborated with Geneseeq Technology Inc.200 of&#xD;
        patients are planned. Total duration of the study is expected to be 2 years. The fresh&#xD;
        tumor tissues/biopsies of each patient will be collected during the surgical treatment. The&#xD;
        peripheral blood samples of each patient will be collected at the following time points: 1)&#xD;
        prior to the surgical treatment; 2) 1 week after the surgical treatment; 3)every three&#xD;
        months until disease progression or the end of the study. The collected fresh tumor&#xD;
        tissues/biopsies or formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks/sections, and peripheral&#xD;
        blood samples will be further subjected for NGS analysis and NGS-based ctDNA mutation&#xD;
        profiling, respectively.&#xD;
