  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present proof-of-concept Phase IIa study aims to confirm, in patients, the observed&#xD;
      activity of MMV390048 against P. falciparum in pre-clinical models and the human Induced&#xD;
      Blood-Stage Malaria (IBSM) challenge model, and to determine the activity against P. vivax&#xD;
      malaria in patients, both over 14 and 28 days. Additional aims are to characterise the safety&#xD;
      of MMV390048 in patients. Patient safety will be monitored for up to 35 days post-dose&#xD;
      including pharmacokinetic assessments. The study will investigate descending single doses of&#xD;
      MMV390048 in response to results obtained in the first cohort/dose in each malaria sub-type.&#xD;
      The results of this trial will identify active, well-tolerated doses for investigation in&#xD;
      combination with a partner drug within a Phase IIb clinical trial.&#xD;

      The present Phase IIa study aims to confirm, in patients, the observed activity of MMV390048&#xD;
      against P. falciparum in pre-clinical models and the human IBSM human challenge model, and to&#xD;
      determine the activity against P. vivax malaria in patients, both over 14 and 28 days.&#xD;
      Additional aims are to characterise the safety of MMV390048 in patients. Patient safety will&#xD;
      be monitored for up to 35 days post-dose including pharmacokinetic assessments. The study&#xD;
      will investigate descending single doses of MMV390048 in response to results obtained in the&#xD;
      first cohort/dose in each malaria sub type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this trial will identify active, well tolerated doses for investigation in&#xD;
      combination with a partner drug within a Phase IIb clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies using SCID mice inoculated with P. falciparum-infected red blood cells&#xD;
      link doses and exposures to the efficacy of MMV390048.38 The active dose in the SCID model&#xD;
      causing maximum effect (ED90) against the parasites is 1 mg/kg/day. The MPC derived from the&#xD;
      SCID data was 39 ng/ml.39 A human dose for the treatment of P. falciparum was sought that&#xD;
      could maintain blood concentrations above 39 ng/ml (100 nM) for 8 days. Assuming linear&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and based on observed data from the Phase I exploratory formulation study in&#xD;
      human volunteers, a dose of approximately 20 mg would be estimated to achieve the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic target drug concentration in humans based on the preclinical efficacy data&#xD;
      generated in the SCID mice model. For new antimalarial drugs the translation of a predicted&#xD;
      efficacious dose from the SCID mouse to the human challenge model and in turn to the&#xD;
      treatment of acute, uncomplicated P. vivax or P. falciparum is unknown. To minimise the risk&#xD;
      to patients and to ensure the highest probability of success, the maximum safe dose (as&#xD;
      determined in healthy volunteers) that maintains a toxicokinetic safety margin to the repeat&#xD;
      dose studies was selected for the first cohort in this study. This dose is expected to exceed&#xD;
      the predicted MPC on Day 8 and provide significant target coverage at the site of action.&#xD;

             count/µL blood&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent provided by the patient in accordance with local practice. If&#xD;
             the patient is unable to write, witnessed consent is permitted according to local&#xD;
             ethical considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to swallow oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions&#xD;
             and protocol-stated restrictions and is likely to complete the study as planned&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to be hospitalized for at least 72 hours or until malarial parasites are not&#xD;
             detected by microscopy on 2 consecutive occasions whichever comes later and return to&#xD;
             clinic for all follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must be of non-childbearing potential (WNCBP) as per one of the following&#xD;
             definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  postmenopausal defined as having age-appropriate, natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea for&#xD;
             at least 12 months prior to screening in the absence of an alternative medical cause&#xD;
             for the amenorrhea, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  premenopausal with irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy and/or&#xD;
