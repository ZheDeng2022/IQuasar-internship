  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The surgical management of spinal deformities especially in adults is complex. The&#xD;
      conventional surgical treatment of these deformations is a scope arthrodesis of the spine.&#xD;
      The quality of the result depends on many variables such as the choice of the vertebrae to&#xD;
      fuse, location and the number of implants, the type of material used or the type of&#xD;
      correction maneuver used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these variables affect the surgical outcome and may be involved as a modifiable risk&#xD;
      factor for possible postoperative complications. The study proposes to focus on the&#xD;
      junctional kyphosis postoperative proximal (CJP or Proximal Junctional Kyphosis: PJK). Their&#xD;
      prevalence in adults ranges from 20% to 43% depending on the series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiographic definition of CJP's kyphosis with an angle&gt; 10 Â° measured from the lower&#xD;
      plate of the proximal instrumented vertebra to the upper plate of the adjacent vertebra&#xD;
      proximal not instrumented; this measure is being compared to the pre operative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Either the CJP are asymptomatic and do not require revision surgery either they are and&#xD;
      thereby generate a revision surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors may potentially influence the development of the CJP. Among them, age,&#xD;
      preoperative comorbidities, obesity, osteoporosis, lesions of the posterior elements, hybrid&#xD;
      instrumentation, correction forces applied during surgery, sagittal balance pre and post&#xD;
      operative degeneration joint capsules, etc. There are few studies on the identification and&#xD;
      analysis of these risk factors; literature gives only single-center studies on small samples&#xD;
      with a single surgical procedure. Review articles describe the incidence and risk factors of&#xD;
      the CJP. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of the CJP are still controversial to&#xD;
      this day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of occurrence of postoperative kyphosis&#xD;
      proximal junctional and identify risk factors for developing this major complication of a&#xD;
      multicenter population of scoliosis operated an extensive fusion.&#xD;

      objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine on a homogenous population of scoliosis operated for an extended fusion of 4 or&#xD;
      more vertebrae:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the incidence of proximal junctional kyphosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modifiable risk factors and non modifiable of occurrence of CJP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rate of CJP leading to revision surgery and the surgical recovery factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter retrospective cohort enrolling in Chapter X of the Data Protection Act&#xD;
      and provides, as part of this research, the collection of individual data for evaluation of&#xD;
      care and prevention practices with authorization request to the CNIL; the opinion of CCTIRS&#xD;
      is not required in this case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study concerns the data of patients operated with the techniques mentioned in addition&#xD;
      with more than 6 months back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are aware of the potential use of their data in their files for medical research&#xD;
      through oral information provided by the doctor at the signing by the patient's consent&#xD;
      related to the surgery and most recently contained in the Home booklet setting for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time study: 8 months Acquisition of data: KEOPS Database (declared to CNIL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      List of data to collect:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidemiological data and conventional clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires and functional scores when available. (Some patients filled out&#xD;
           questionnaires in the prospective follow-up of results and signed an agreement on their&#xD;
           inclusion in the Keops database.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operating data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-rays of the entire spine from the front and side: pre-operative, post-operative and at&#xD;
           last follow.&#xD;
