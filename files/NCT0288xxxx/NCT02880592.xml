  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the use of fresh&#xD;
      hypothermically stored human amniotic membrane (Affinity; fHSAM) to determine if addition of&#xD;
      fHSAM to standard of care (SOC) results in faster healing of Wagner grade 1 and 2 DFUs&#xD;
      compared to SOC alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, controlled open-label study designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and effectiveness of Affinity fresh amniotic membrane plus standard of care&#xD;
      therapy (SOC) versus SOC in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU, appropriate sharp or&#xD;
      surgical debridement, and aggressive infection management. A number of offloading systems are&#xD;
      commercially available. The choice of offloading will be at the discretion of the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator but should be total contact casting, fixed ankle walker boot, or equivalent&#xD;
      device to the fixed ankle walker boot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have two phases: Screening and Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening Phase (1 -14 days) is designed to determine whether subjects are eligible to&#xD;
      proceed to the Treatment Phase of the study and consists of a series of screening assessments&#xD;
      designed to determine eligibility. At the first Screening Phase Visit, the Investigator will&#xD;
      select the study (target) ulcer. Each subject will have only one DFU selected as the study&#xD;
      (target) ulcer. In the situation in which a subject has more than one DFU at the S1 visit,&#xD;
      the Investigator will select the largest DFU that meets the eligibility criteria of the&#xD;
      protocol as the study (target) ulcer. Subjects whose target ulcer has been treated with SOC&#xD;
      for 2 weeks are eligible to enter the treatment phase immediately once all of the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria are met. If the ulcer has not received SOC, the subject should be&#xD;
      placed into SOC and enrolled in the study after 14 days of offloading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment Phase (12 weeks) begins with a series of assessments designed to confirm the&#xD;
      subjects' continued eligibility. Investigators will debride the ulcer, if required. Subjects&#xD;
      whose ulcers continue to meet eligibility criteria will then be randomized to 1 of 2 groups:&#xD;
      (1) standard of care plus weekly application of fHSAM for up to 4 weeks and thereafter per&#xD;
      treatment guidelines (2) standard of care. During the Treatment Phase, subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated on a weekly basis. Efficacy evaluations each week will include Investigator&#xD;
      assessment of ulcer healing and measurements of ulcer size using digital photos. Safety&#xD;
      evaluations during the Treatment Phase will consist of adverse event assessments at each&#xD;
      visit. Subject will be seen weekly (± 3 days) until the ulcer is healed or study exit if the&#xD;
      study ulcer area has not been reduced by at least 40% within 6 weeks, or 1 week after last&#xD;
      application treatment week 12.&#xD;

             of the foot provided it is below the medial aspect of the malleolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The index ulcer will be the largest ulcer if 2 or more DFUs are present with the same&#xD;
