  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how well Humacyte's Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) works when&#xD;
      surgically implanted into a leg to improve blood flow in patients with peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease (PAD). This study will also evaluate how safe it is to use the HAV in this manner.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, single treatment arm, multicenter phase 2 study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the HAV in patients with PAD undergoing femoro-popliteal&#xD;
      bypass surgery. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the HAV in these patients and to determine the patency of the Humacyte HAV at&#xD;
      12 months post-implantation. The secondary objectives of this study are to further assess&#xD;
      safety in terms of PRA response, and to determine the rates of HAV interventions required to&#xD;
      keep the HAV patent. There is no formal hypothesis testing planned; the study involves only a&#xD;
      single, open-label treatment group.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with disabling symptomatic peripheral arterial disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Rutherford stage 4 or 5 who require femoro-popliteal bypass surgery or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Rutherford stage 3 with severe claudication (less than 50 yards AND causing&#xD;
                  severe impairment of ability to work or undertake social activities)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ankle - brachial index ≤ 0.6 in the study leg&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has failed adequate medical therapy which included&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Exercise program&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Smoking cessation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Control of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemias&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Antiplatelet therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Preoperative angiography or CT angiography shows superficial femoral artery occlusion&#xD;
             AND required Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) length of ≤ 38cm. This imaging may&#xD;
             have been conducted up to 6 months prior to study entry provided that the patient's&#xD;
             symptoms have remained stable since that time&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Preoperative imaging shows at least one below knee vessel patent to the ankle with&#xD;
             good runoff&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Proximal HAV anastomosis is expected to be to the common femoral artery below the&#xD;
             inguinal ligament or to the superficial femoral artery&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Distal anastomosis is expected to be to the popliteal artery above the knee&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Femoral artery occlusion is not considered suitable for endovascular treatment; e.g.&#xD;
             long segment chronic total occlusion, previous failed stent or stent graft in the&#xD;
             superficial femoral artery, previous failed endovascular treatment where the lesion&#xD;
             could not be crossed&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Autologous vein graft is not feasible in the judgment of the treating surgeon; e.g.&#xD;
             because all suitable veins have been used previously for coronary or peripheral&#xD;
             bypass, or pre-operative vein mapping shows inadequate length or quality of vein to&#xD;
             complete the planned bypass&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Aged 18 to 85 years old, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Other hematological and biochemical parameters within a range considered acceptable&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Adequate liver function, defined as serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL; and INR ≤ 1.5 at&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Able to communicate meaningfully with investigative staff, competent to give written&#xD;
             informed consent, and able to comply with entire study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Life expectancy of at least 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Leg at high risk of amputation (SVS WIfI stage 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Recent clinically significant trauma to the leg receiving the HAV&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe active infection (SVS foot infection grade 3) in the leg receiving the HAV&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Distal anastomosis planned to a below knee artery&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History or evidence of severe cardiac disease (NYHA Functional Class III or IV),&#xD;
             myocardial infarction within six months prior to study entry (Day 1), ventricular&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c &gt;10% at screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Treatment with any investigational drug or device within 60 days prior to study entry&#xD;
             (Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Cancer that is being actively treated with a cytotoxic agent&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. AIDS / HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Documented hypercoagulable state or history as defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. a biochemical diagnosis (e.g. Factor V Leiden, Protein C deficiency, etc.) - OR -&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. a clinical history of thrombophilia as diagnosed by 2 or more spontaneous&#xD;
                  intravascular thrombotic events (e.g. DVT, PE, etc.) within the previous 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Spontaneous or unexplained bleeding diathesis clinically documented within the last 5&#xD;
             years or a biochemical diagnosis (e.g. von Willebrand disease, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Ongoing treatment with vitamin K antagonists or oral direct thrombin inhibitors or&#xD;

             leg&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Stenosis of &gt;50% of the inflow aortoiliac system ipsilateral to the index leg. Any&#xD;
             such stenosis must be corrected with angioplasty with or without stenting prior to, or&#xD;
             at the time of, HAV implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Active autoimmune disease - symptomatic or requiring ongoing drug therapy&#xD;
&#xD;

         19. Known serious allergy to aspirin&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Any other condition which in the judgment of the investigator would preclude adequate&#xD;
             evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel (HAV)&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Previous exposure to HAV&#xD;
