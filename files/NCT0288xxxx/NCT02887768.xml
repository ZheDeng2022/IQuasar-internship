      Epicardial Infarct Repair with CorMatrix-Extracellular Matrix (ECM) is an open-label,&#xD;
      non-randomized, feasibility pilot study. Following ischemic injury the ECM of the heart&#xD;
      adversely remodels leading to cardiac fibrosis, left ventricular (LV) dilatation and&#xD;
      subsequent heart failure. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that epicardial infarct repair&#xD;
      with CorMatrix-ECM restores the damaged ECM, prevents LV dilatation and improves myocardial&#xD;
      performance. This study will interrogate epicardial infarct repair in patients undergoing&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery within 6 weeks following acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction as an adjunct to surgical revascularization. Patients will be evaluated for&#xD;
      markers of cardiac function and left ventricular remodelling using cardiac magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI). Adverse events will be monitored to ensure safety.&#xD;

      RATIONALE: Following ischemic injury the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the heart adversely&#xD;
      remodels leading to cardiac fibrosis, left ventricular (LV) dilatation and subsequent heart&#xD;
      failure. Preclinical evidence suggests that the epicardial application of a healthy biologic&#xD;
      ECM may reverse the adverse ECM remodeling that takes place following ischemic injury&#xD;
      preventing LV dilatation and subsequent heart failure. The investigators have demonstrated&#xD;
      that epicardial infarct repair with CorMatrix-ECM restores the damaged ECM, prevents LV&#xD;
      dilatation and improves myocardial performance. The investigators believe that epicardial&#xD;
      infarct repair may not only restrain the infarcted myocardium to prevent infarct expansion&#xD;
      and LV dilatation, but owing to it's biologic nature, help to provide a healthy ECM&#xD;
      environment restoring ECM homeostasis and architecture. The investigators therefore propose&#xD;
      clinical investigation epicardial infarct repair in patients undergoing coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass grafting (CABG) surgery within 6 weeks following acute myocardial infarction as an&#xD;
      adjunct to surgical revascularization. This is a patient population commonly referred for&#xD;
      CABG surgery. While complete surgical revascularization can prevent further ischemic insult&#xD;
      and salvage stunned or hibernating myocardium, it does not restore function to the infarcted&#xD;
      myocardium resulting from the acute ischemic injury. The investigator's previous studies&#xD;
      suggest that epicardial infarct repair as an adjunct to CABG surgery in this patient&#xD;
      population may help improve myocardial function in this previously untreatable territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This is an open-label, non-randomized, feasibility pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the feasibility of epicardial infarct repair performed with CorMatrix-ECM as an&#xD;
      adjunct to CABG surgery in patients undergoing surgery during the subacute period following&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (MI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility of identifying the infarct area to be treated by epicardial&#xD;
           infarct repair and measure regional function and tissue characteristics within the&#xD;
           treated area using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of epicardial infarct repair performed with CorMatrix-ECM as an&#xD;
           adjunct to CABG surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: Eight&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEST PRODUCT, DOSE, AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION: CorMatrix-ECM will be surgically applied to&#xD;
      the epicardial surface of the anterior LV wall at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL PRODUCT, DOSE AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION: No control group will be performed in this&#xD;
      pilot trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF SUBJECT PARTICIPATION AND DURATION OF STUDY: Subjects will be involved in the&#xD;
      study for up to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Enrollment: 0-6 weeks between acute coronary syndrome presentation and CABG&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Day of CABG surgery. Follow-up: 6 months postoperatively. Total duration of the&#xD;
      study is expected to be 9 months. Three months for subject enrollment and 6 months for final&#xD;
      subject follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCOMMITANT MEDICATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prohibited: Immunosuppressive medications (including steroids). Allowed: Any other&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FEASIBILITY EVALUATIONS: Feasibility will be accessed through qualitative evaluation by the&#xD;
      performing surgeon and successful measurement of cardiac function and tissue characterization&#xD;
      by CMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Feasibility of epicardial infarct repair performed with CorMatrix-ECM as an adjunct to CABG&#xD;
      surgery in patients undergoing surgery during the subacute period following myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI) evaluated by the performing surgeon though qualitative observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility of measuring regional myocardial function and tissue characteristics within&#xD;
           the treated area using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The safety of epicardial infarct repair performed with CorMatrix-ECM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY EVALUATIONS :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events including: all cause mortality; cardiovascular mortality; MACCE; major&#xD;
      bleeding events; primary surgical site infection; and myocardial constriction will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR NUMBER OF STUDY SUBJECTS: This is a pilot study designed to access the&#xD;
      feasibility of performing epicardial infarct repair with CorMatrix-ECM in subacute MI&#xD;
      patients going for CABG surgery, the feasibility of measuring cardiac function and various&#xD;
      tissue characteristics within the treated myocardium by CMR in this patient population, and&#xD;
      the safety of epicardial infarct repair performed at the time of CABG surgery. Given the&#xD;
      preliminary nature of this study 8 subjects will be tested to confirm feasibility and inform&#xD;
      future randomized control trial study design.&#xD;
