  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronically photodamaged skin is visually characterized by dryness, wrinkles, brown spots,&#xD;
      leathery appearance, etc. This happens as a result of excessive exposure to UV light from the&#xD;
      sun. While the sun's exposure leaves the skin's surface visibly changed, the skin's unseen&#xD;
      immune system may also be permanently altered as a result of the exposure, making it more&#xD;
      likely to develop a variety of skin cancers and infections. This study will examine the&#xD;
      lasting changes in the immune system of the skin caused by UV exposure. Investigators will&#xD;
      stimulate different aspects of the skin's immune system by giving an injection of Candida&#xD;
      Albicans (CANDIN®) and histamine phosphate (HISTATROL®), topical applications of imiquimod 5%&#xD;
      cream (ALDARA®) and performing a tape stripping procedure with adhesive tape. The use of&#xD;
      Candida Albicans (CANDIN®), histamine phosphate (HISTATROL®), and tape stripping are common&#xD;
      procedures in clinical settings to stimulate skin desired skin responses. Imiquimod 5% cream&#xD;
      (ALDARA®) is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of basal cell carcinomas, actinic&#xD;
      keratoses and genital warts. Investigators will compare the reaction of the skin's immune&#xD;
      system on a cellular level from skin normally exposed to the sun exposure to an area normally&#xD;
      hidden from sun exposure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronically photodamaged skin is visually characterized by dryness, wrinkles, brown spots,&#xD;
      leathery appearance, etc. While photodamage leaves the skin's surface visibly changed, the&#xD;
      skin's unseen immune system may also be permanently altered as a result of the exposure,&#xD;
      making it more likely to develop a variety of skin cancers and infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will aim to evaluate the lasting changes that lifetime UV exposure causes to the&#xD;
      different components of the skin's immune system in chronically sun damaged skin (forearms)&#xD;
      compared to sun-protected skin (buttocks). Investigators will compare the cellular responses&#xD;
      to stimulation of the skin's innate immune system, the skin's adaptive immune system, and the&#xD;
      skin's hypersensitivity responses between these two sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to stimulate the different arms of the immune system, investigators will be using&#xD;
      the following interventions: an intradermal injection of Candida Albicans antigen, an&#xD;
      intradermal injection of histamine phosphate, a topical application of imiquimod 5% cream,&#xD;
      and a tape stripping procedure with adhesive tape. Skin testing with the C. albicans antigen&#xD;
      is a useful procedure for measuring the capacity of a person to manifest a delayed-type&#xD;
      hypersensitivity response and is commonly used in clinical settings to evaluate cellular&#xD;
      immunity. Similarly, histamine phosphate is frequently used as a positive control in clinical&#xD;
      tests to assess type I Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. Imiquimod&#xD;
      5% cream is a direct stimulator of toll-like receptor (TLR) 7, a key component of the innate&#xD;
      immune response with downstream signaling effects involving the adaptive immune response. It&#xD;
      is FDA-approved for the treatment superficial basal cell carcinomas, actinic keratoses, and&#xD;
      genital warts. Finally, tape stripping is a validated procedure used to remove superficial&#xD;
      layers of the epidermis in clinical study environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This is a mechanism of action pilot study designed to characterize the molecular&#xD;
      nature of the local innate and adaptive immune response in chronically photodamaged skin&#xD;
      (forearm) as compared to photoprotected skin (buttocks) using non-photodamaged individuals&#xD;
      (forearms and buttocks) as a control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Adult subjects with or without photodamage will be entered into the study at the&#xD;
      University of Michigan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: study interventions (tape stripping, candida albicans and histamine phosphate&#xD;
      injections, imiquimod 5% cream application), photography, Chroma Meter reading, biopsies,&#xD;
      skin assessment&#xD;
