      The primary goal of this case control study is to investigate the effect of implementation of&#xD;
      motivational interviewing with focus on diet and weight gain in addition to the routine&#xD;
      treatment on prevention of excessive gestational weight gain and fetal growth in pregnant&#xD;
      women with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective cohort study where an unselected cohort of all pregnant women with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes are offered intervention with motivational interviewing in addition to routine&#xD;
      treatment in the period 2015-2017. For comparison a historical cohort (2013-2015) treated&#xD;
      with routine treatment only will be studied. With an inclusion period of 2 years, each cohort&#xD;
      is expected to include 150 participants. The women in the study group will receive one-to-one&#xD;
      coaching based on the principles of motivational interviewing, every second week throughout&#xD;
      the pregnancy. Both cohorts receive the same routine care for pregnant women with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. An appropriate GWG is targeted. Primary outcome measures are maternal gestational&#xD;
      weight gain and the infants Large for Gestational Age.&#xD;

      The Aims: First, to investigate the effect of implementation of motivational interviewing&#xD;
      focusing on diet adherence in addition to routine treatment on prevention of excessive&#xD;
      gestational weight gain and fetal overgrowth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, to investigate the impact of quantity and quality of carbohydrate consumption on&#xD;
      HbA1c, gestational weight gain and fetal overgrowth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, to explore the occurence of anxiety and depression and relation to pregnancy&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will get a life-style intervention with motivational interviewing focusing on&#xD;
      following the recommended diabetes diet and gestational weight gain recommendations in&#xD;
      addition to routine care - as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group was given the same routine care with the same treatment goals, but without&#xD;
      motivational interviewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle intervention with motivational interviewing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual sessions with a lifestyle coach will be scheduled for each participant and&#xD;
      tailored to suite in the routine clinical visits of the patients. The women will follow&#xD;
      routine visits and the lifestyle coaching is sought implemented in the routine clinical&#xD;
      setting without excess use of one-to one contacts with a caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lifestyle coaching is built op on principles of patient empowerment and cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral techniques, inspired by motivational interviewing. In the program, one-to-one&#xD;
      contact will be offered. The aim is to provide a one-to-one contact every second week of&#xD;
      approximately 10 minutes duration. Women living in a long distance form the clinic may&#xD;
      convert some of the one-to-one contact to telephone calls. The timing of these contacts and&#xD;
      the time between these contacts are dependent on the preference of the participant and the&#xD;
      availability of the lifestyle coach in order to deliver the intervention with the most&#xD;
      appropriate timing and to optimize changes of the uptake of behavior change. However it is&#xD;
      stressed that the one-to-one coaching sessions should be initiated within 14 days after first&#xD;
      visit at the clinic and occurs before gestational week 20. The first phase of behavioral&#xD;
      change is centered on intention formation (motivation). Current behavior will be assessed and&#xD;
      motivation for change will be established. When the woman is ready to make the change,&#xD;
      personal goals will be set. An action plan for improving dietary behavior will be made during&#xD;
      the first session and evaluated in subsequent sessions. The following dietary objectives will&#xD;
      be set for each participant to achieve or to maintain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Watch portion size - to be conscious about the amount of carbohydrates in each meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Eat mainly carbohydrates of low glycaemic index (i.e. vegetables and rye bread).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduce the intake of carbohydrate of high glycaemic index (i.e. white bread, cakes,&#xD;
           candy, snacks, chips, ice cream)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Watch daily weight changes - aim for the recommended weekly changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lifestyle coaches have received a special training program containing motivational&#xD;
      interviewing techniques. The doctors, dieticians and nurses taking care of the routine&#xD;
      clinical visits will continue their usual care without focus on motivational interviewing.&#xD;
      The lifestyle coaches are educated midwives, nurses or doctors and will also be trained in&#xD;
      performing the routine clinical diabetes visits at the same visit as the coaching visit if&#xD;
      possible, in order avoid excess expense of one-to-one contacts with a caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the motivational intervention the women are given unchanged routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The routine care includes the following goals for both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim for glycaemic control is according to the Danish National guidelines in essence&#xD;
      aiming for preprandial plasma glucose values between 4-6 mmol/l and postprandial values&#xD;
      between 4 and 8 mmol/l. Due to changes in measuring HbA1c in mmol/mol the goal for HbA1c is&#xD;
      slightly modified to below 40 mmol/mol during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals for gestational weight gain follow the Copenhagen guidelines for pregnant diabetic&#xD;
      women:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-pregnancy BMI &lt;25 kg/m2: 10-15 kg in total with 100 g/week in first half of pregnancy and&#xD;
      thereafter 400 g/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-pregnancy BMI: 25-30 kg/m2: 5-8 kg in total with 100 gram per week in first half of&#xD;
      pregnancy and thereafter 300g/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-pregnancy BMI &gt;30 kg/m2: 5 kg in total with 0 g/week in first half of pregnancy and&#xD;
      thereafter 200 g/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations regarding diet and physical activity - in brief&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women will get a one-to-one consultation with certified dietitian once during pregnancy.&#xD;
      The women will get information about recommended diabetes diet, education in carbohydrate&#xD;
      counting and how to read a food label. Information about dietary apps is given to aid&#xD;
      learning. The goals are as follows: A) Adequate nutrient intake to support a healthy&#xD;
      pregnancy. B) Adequate but not excessive gestational weight gain within the Copenhagen&#xD;
      guidelines for pregnant diabetic women according to pre-pregnancy BMI as stated above. C)&#xD;
      Eating a total of approximately 175 grams of carbohydrate daily which is regarded to&#xD;
      correspond to around150 g of the main sources of carbohydrates as bread, potatoes, rise,&#xD;
      pasta, fruits, and dairy products. D) Diet mainly containing low GI carbohydrates. E) Aim for&#xD;
      approximately 20-40-40 grams of carbohydrates at each main meal and 10-20 grams at 2-3 snacks&#xD;
      daily from the main sources of carbohydrates. F) Consistent timing of three meals and 2-4&#xD;
      snacks daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women without contraindications will be encouraged to be physical active for at least 30&#xD;
      min/day: mainly walking, cycling or swimming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments will be made by a member of the research team at three time points: at&#xD;
      baseline, 20-24 weeks and 35-37 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first visit the following will be noted: the women´s self-reported weight before&#xD;
      pregnancy. Height, current weight, waist, neck and ankle circumference and subcutaneous&#xD;
      skinfolds will be measured. Consultations blood pressure but also a home blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring for 3 days will be registered. HbA1c concentration and plasma lipids&#xD;
      (triglycerides, free fatty acids, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol) will&#xD;
      be measured the same day. A dipstick of sterile urine will be screened for&#xD;
      proteinuria/ketonuria. All medications including vitamins and total daily dose of insulin&#xD;
      will be noted together with diabetes related complications (nephropathy or retinopathy). An&#xD;
      ophthalmologist evaluates the presence or absence of diabetic retinopathy at first visit.&#xD;
      Occurrence of mild and severe hypoglycaemia will be reported as well as the degree of nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting. Women will be asked into the number of episodes of symptomatic mild&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia the last week and in case of severe hypoglycaemia, details about the event will&#xD;
      be documented in a structured way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women´s age, duration of diabetes, gestational age at first visit, parity, marital&#xD;
      status, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol, sleeping pattern and social status (degree of education&#xD;
      as well as current employment and shift work) will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women will record 3 days of food diary with focus on content of carbohydrate from the&#xD;
      main carbohydrate sources. These diaries will be used to evaluate the amount of carbohydrates&#xD;
      and the amount of high/low glycemic index food with focus on the average daily total&#xD;
      carbohydrate intake as well as the day-to-day variation. The degrees of leisure time physical&#xD;
      activity will be sought evaluated by pregnancy physical activity questionnaire (PPAQ).&#xD;
      Besides this, the women will complete a 6 item food frequency list, a Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS) and a EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each clinical visit current weight and consultations blood pressure will be registered.&#xD;
      HbA1c will be measured and a dipstick of sterile urine screened for ketone bodies and&#xD;
      protein. All medications incl. total daily insulin dose will be noted together with&#xD;
      information about the number of mild hypoglycaemic episodes the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally at study visits (20-24 weeks and 35-37 weeks) the women will complete a food&#xD;
      diary for 3 days, 6 item food frequency list, PPAQ, HADS and EQ-5D. Information about smoking&#xD;
      and sleeping patterns, nausea and vomiting will be noted. Bodyweight and waist, neck and&#xD;
      ankle circumference and subcutaneous skinfolds will be measured. Consultations blood pressure&#xD;
      as well as home blood pressure monitoring will be registered, presence of severe&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia within the last year will be noted and detailed information about the episodes&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One year postpartum, the women will be contacted by telephone and asked for their current&#xD;
      weight and in which degree the lifestyle-changes initiated during pregnancy are still&#xD;
      followed according to their own judgment (licker scale). Information about duration of&#xD;
      exclusive and total breastfeeding will be registered. Regarding the child, actual health,&#xD;
      current weight as well as hospital admissions and presence of malformations will be obtained.&#xD;
