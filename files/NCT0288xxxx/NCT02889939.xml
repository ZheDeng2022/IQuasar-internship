      We designed an explorative clinical study to assess the effectiveness of an enriched intense&#xD;
      and task-oriented therapy program in enhancing motor recovery in patients with moderate to&#xD;
      moderately severe hemiplegia after stroke. This enriched comprehensive task-specific therapy&#xD;
      (ETT) program combines intensive and task-specific therapy with the sensory-motor, social,&#xD;
      and cognitive stimulation inherent to environmental enrichment. We also investigated whether&#xD;
      ETT improves gait, balance, upper and lower limb function, and confidence in task&#xD;
      performance, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and reduces fatigue and depression.&#xD;

      Background The brain has a limited ability for repair. However, in recent years it became&#xD;
      evident that a remarkable, yet restricted ability for regeneration of neuronal connections&#xD;
      exists, with positive implications for the rehabilitation of individuals with stroke. Several&#xD;
      studies have shown that stroke-lesioned animals, which are exposed to a so called enriched&#xD;
      environment (large cages, group housing of animals, equipped with toys and with possibilities&#xD;
      for physical activity and social interactions) show signs of tissue regeneration/plasticity&#xD;
      in the brain. Research has shown that rats exposed to this enriched environment are&#xD;
      recovering significantly faster from stroke than rats in standard cages, despite the fact&#xD;
      that the total tissue loss between the rats did not differ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery and improvement of motor functions and skills after stroke depend on spontaneous&#xD;
      repair processes but also on the reorganization of neural mechanisms by stimuli and demands&#xD;
      that are placed on the motor control system. In spite of numerous research studies showing&#xD;
      that functional recovery after stroke is possible even many years after the stroke onset, it&#xD;
      is unusual for stroke victims to be offered any kind of rehabilitation during later stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of modalities in multimodal interventions is thus expected to have a&#xD;
      synergistic effect on neuroplasticity in rehabilitation after stroke in humans. In a recent&#xD;
      clinical trial, multimodal interventions based on rhythm and music or therapeutic horseback&#xD;
      riding improved recovery in the late phase after stroke Nevertheless, novel combinational&#xD;
      treatment approaches are needed to promote neuroplasticity and motor recovery after stroke. A&#xD;
      priority is to translate promising basic research to clinical settings and to evaluate&#xD;
      enriched combinational therapy programs that appear to be more effective than single&#xD;
      interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. What is the impact of high intensity task specific goal-directed training combined with&#xD;
      environmental enrichment for individuals in a late phase of stroke? B. What are the subjects'&#xD;
      experiences of the rehabilitation program? C. What are the biomarkers of successful stroke&#xD;
      recovery? D. How does the intervention effect the subjects' walking ability on a detailed&#xD;
      level? The study is a within-subject, repeated-measures design with pretest-posttest study,&#xD;
      to assess outcomes after ETT. The intervention was preceded by a baseline period of usual&#xD;
      care (UC) for 3 weeks, which also served as a control. The trial enrolled Swedish or&#xD;
      Norwegian stroke survivors who had applied to a Swedish rehabilitation agency that provides&#xD;
      rehabilitation services in Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical evaluation was performed in Sweden prior to and after the intervention and 6&#xD;
      months after completion of the intervention / control period. In addition, a three-month&#xD;
      follow-up in form of questionnaires was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures were:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Motor Assessment Scale according to Uppsala University Hospital (M-MAS UAS)&#xD;
      (measuring motor function), measures of walking ability, speed and endurance, dynamic and&#xD;
      static balance, fine motor speed and dexterity in the upper limb, motor speed and gross&#xD;
      manual dexterity, hand strength, satisfaction with life as a whole, perceived confidence in&#xD;
      task performance, health-related quality of life and degree of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group interviews and individual interviews will be conducted with a subgroup of the&#xD;
      participants (non aphasic participants) and the statements will be analyzed qualitative using&#xD;
      content analyses as the method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken for the analysis of biomarkers, growth factors and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced analyses of gait patterns and components will be performed in a motor laboratory,&#xD;
      including a subgroup of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In rehabilitation medicine, the general belief has been that treatment of individuals in the&#xD;
      late phase of stroke has no functional impact. The present research program will test against&#xD;
      this hypothesis into a clinical trial for patients at more than 6 months after stroke. The&#xD;
      biochemical analysis of blood samples and additional preclinical studies will directly to the&#xD;
      knowledge about possibilities to enhance brain plasticity also in later phases of stroke. The&#xD;
      research will contribute to strengthening the evidence for a promising rehabilitation&#xD;
      approach combining elements of focused high-intensity training with environmental enrichment&#xD;
      for which there are strong empirical support.&#xD;

    <description>UC: A 3-week UC period, where the participants were not offered any new rehabilitation activities but were allowed to continue their regular treatment for a maximum of 3 hours per week.&#xD;
ETT: The rehabilitation facilities were located in a climate that allowed and encouraged both indoor and outdoor activities. The ETT was individually tailored. Participants exercised in the same room/place as the other participants in groups of 4-9. Physical exercise was scheduled 3.5-6 hours per day, 5½ days per week for 3 weeks. The training was characterized by repetitive mass practice of gradually increasing difficulty and noncompensatory strategies, such as enforcing use of the affected side.&#xD;
Beyond scheduled activities, participants were encouraged to physically engage themselves in a challenging outdoor environment.</description>
