      This study evaluates the safety of Tetravalent recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine&#xD;
      (6,11,16,18 type) (Hansenula polymorpha) in women of 9 to 30 years old and men of 9 to 17&#xD;
      years old and preliminarily explore the immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      135 people are enrolled in total, including 45 women of 18 to 30 years old and 90 people of 9&#xD;
      to 17 years old. Among the first group, 30 women will be inoculated studied vaccine and 15&#xD;
      women will be inoculated placebo. Among the second group, there are 45 women and 45 men, 30&#xD;
      women and 30 men in vaccine group and 15 women and 15 men in placebo group.&#xD;
