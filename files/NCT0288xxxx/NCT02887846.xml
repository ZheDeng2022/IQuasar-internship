      Purpose is to show that HHHFNC method is as effective and safe as nCPAPand even more&#xD;
      comfortable than it as non-invasive respiratory support for the prevention of extubation&#xD;
      failure in preterm with gestational age of 26-32 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients requiring mechanical ventilation for at least 6 hours on the first 7 postnatal days&#xD;
      will be included in the study.When patients were Fi O2 &lt; 0,40, Pa CO2 &lt; 65 mmHg, pH&gt; 7.20,&#xD;
      MAP (mean airway pressure) &lt;7 cm H2O, they will be extubated if statistically&#xD;
      stable.Oxygen-air mixture of 4-6 l / min flow rate will be set in HHHFNC group, and pressure&#xD;
      will be set to 5-8 cm H2O in NCPAP group. When flow is 2 l / min, FiO2 is&lt;0.30 at 24 hours&#xD;
      and above, free oxygen will be introduced. In NCPAP group, when pressure is 5 cm H2O and FiO2&#xD;
      &lt; 0.30 at 24 hours and above, free oxygen will be introduced.&#xD;

      failure in preterm with gestational age of 26-32 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of HHHFNC and nCPAP techniques for the prevention of extubation failure&#xD;
      within 7 days following the first extubation in preterms in need of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      within the first 7 postnatal days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the total duration of invasive and non-invasive respiratory support and the duration of&#xD;
           free oxygen demand of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Premature morbidities such as PDA, NEC, ROP, IVH, BPDand sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The degree of nasal trauma score and the degree of nasal mucosal injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FiO2 levels first before extubation and 6 hours after extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The causes of reintubation such as apnea, acidosis, and increased need of FiO2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The reintubation predisposing factors such as pneumothorax, atelectasis, PDA after&#xD;
           extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The weight change in the first 7-day period after extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The two groups in terms of neurodevelopmental changes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Patients requiring mechanical ventilation for at least 6 hours on the first 7&#xD;
      postnatal days will be included in the study. When patients were Fi O2 &lt; 0,40, Pa CO2 &lt; 65&#xD;
      mmHg, pH&gt; 7.20, MAP (mean airway pressure) &lt;7 cm H2O, they will be extubated if statistically&#xD;
      stable. Oxygen-air mixture of 4-6 l / min flow rate will be set in HHHFNC group, and pressure&#xD;
      will be set to 5-8 cm H2O in NCPAP group. When flow is 2 l / min, FiO2 is&lt;0.30 at 24 hours&#xD;
      and above, free oxygen will be introduced. In NCPAP group, when pressure is 5 cm H2O and FiO2&#xD;
      &lt; 0.30 at 24 hours and above, free oxygen will be introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reintubation criteria is set as;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FiO2 of â‰¥ 0.50 in order to keep oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry above 90 %&#xD;
           and higher,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apnea requiring more than 6 alerts in a 24 -hour period in 6 consecutive hours or more&#xD;
           than 1 apnea requiring positive pressure ventilation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent acidosis; presence of pH &lt; 7.20 and PCO2 &gt; 65 mmHg in two different blood&#xD;
           gases drawn with an interval of at least 30 minutes or treatment-resistant metabolic&#xD;
           acidosis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe respiratory distress,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary haemorrhage and cardiopulmonary arrest.&#xD;
