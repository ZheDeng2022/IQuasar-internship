    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects of durvalumab and tremelimumab and to&#xD;
      see how well they work with or without high or low-dose radiation therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the&#xD;
      body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with durvalumab and tremelimumab, may induce changes in&#xD;
      body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving&#xD;
      durvalumab and tremelimumab with radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety and tolerability of combined checkpoint blockade with MEDI4736&#xD;
      (durvalumab) and tremelimumab alone or with high or low-dose radiation in non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC). (NSCLC Cohort) II. To compare the overall response (excluding the irradiated&#xD;
      lesion[s]) between combined checkpoint blockade with MEDI4736 and tremelimumab alone or&#xD;
      combined checkpoint blockade with low or high dose radiation. (NSCLC Cohort) III. To assess&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of combined checkpoint blockade with MEDI4736 and tremelimumab with&#xD;
      high or low-dose radiation. (Colorectal Cohort) IV. To determine the overall response rate&#xD;
      (excluding the irradiated lesion[s]) with combined checkpoint blockade with MEDI4736 and&#xD;
      tremelimumab with either low or high dose radiation. (Colorectal Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate median progression-free survival and overall survival. (NSCLC Cohort) II. To&#xD;
      determine local control within the irradiated field(s) and abscopal response rates. (NSCLC&#xD;
      Cohort) III. To evaluate associations between PD-L1 expression as well as levels of&#xD;
      infiltrating CD3+, CD8+ T-cells and overall response. (NSCLC Cohort) IV. To explore changes&#xD;
      in PD-L1 expression, circulating T-cell populations, T-cell infiltration, ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (RNA) expression, spatial relationship of immune markers, and mutational burden as a result&#xD;
      of low or high dose radiation. (NSCLC Cohort) V. To estimate median progression-free survival&#xD;
      and overall survival. (Colorectal Cohort) VI. To determine local control within the&#xD;
      irradiated field and abscopal response rates. (Colorectal Cohort) VII. To evaluate&#xD;
      associations between PD-L1 expression as well as levels of infiltrating CD3+ CD8+ T-cells and&#xD;
      overall response. (Colorectal Cohort) VIII. To evaluate changes between PD-L1 expression as&#xD;
      well as levels of infiltrating CD3+, CD8+ T-cells induced by targeted low or high dose&#xD;
      radiation. (Colorectal Cohort) IX. To explore changes in circulating T-cell populations,&#xD;
      T-cell infiltration, RNA expression, spatial relationship of immune markers, and mutational&#xD;
      burden as a result of low or high dose radiation. (Colorectal Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients with NSCLC are randomized to Arm A, B, or C. Patients with colorectal&#xD;
      cancer are randomized to Arm B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1: Patients with NSCLC are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) and durvalumab IV over 60 minutes&#xD;
      every 4 weeks for up to 16 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients then receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes 4 weeks after last combination&#xD;
      dose for up to 9 additional doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive tremelimumab and durvalumab and as in Arm A. Beginning at week 2,&#xD;
      patients receive high dose radiation therapy once per day (QD) over 10 days for up to 3&#xD;
      fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive tremelimumab and durvalumab and as in Arm A. Beginning at week 2,&#xD;
      patients receive low dose radiation therapy every 6 hours twice per day (BID) on weeks 2, 6,&#xD;
      10 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 12 weeks.&#xD;

                  have been deemed not to derive clinical benefit from PD-1 directed treatment;&#xD;
                  this includes patients who demonstrated an initial response and subsequent&#xD;
                  progression; no prior treatment with chemotherapy or targeted agents are&#xD;
                  required; intervening therapy is allowed between previous PD-1 directed treatment&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function independent of transfusion for at&#xD;
             least 7 days prior to screening and independent of growth factor support for at least&#xD;

             potentially indicated and could be safely delivered at the radiation doses specified&#xD;
             in this protocol; this lesion must not be the only measurable lesion so that it is&#xD;
             still possible to determine the response rate outside of the radiation treatment&#xD;
             field; this lesion must not be within the central nervous system (CNS) (brain or&#xD;
             spinal cord) or requiring urgent or emergent palliative radiation given the timing of&#xD;
             radiation specified on this protocol; furthermore, this lesion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For cohort 1 (NSCLC cohort) - the lesion to be irradiated must be in the lung,&#xD;
                  lymph nodes, adrenal gland or liver&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For cohort 2 (colorectal cohort) - the lesion to be irradiated must be in the&#xD;
                  liver&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown;&#xD;
             for this reason and because radiation is known to be teratogenic, evidence of&#xD;
             post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for female&#xD;
             pre-menopausal patients is required; women will be considered post-menopausal if they&#xD;
             have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause; the&#xD;
             following age-specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women &lt; 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women &gt;= 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments, had radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses &gt; 1 year ago, had&#xD;
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with &gt; 1 year interval since last menses, or&#xD;
                  underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non sterilized male&#xD;
             partner must use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception from the time of&#xD;
             screening and must agree to continue using such precautions for 180 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of durvalumab monotherapy; non-sterilized male partners of a female patient must&#xD;
             use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period; cessation of birth control&#xD;
             after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician; not engaging in&#xD;
             sexual activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout&#xD;
             period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and&#xD;
             the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control; female patients&#xD;
             should also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180 days after&#xD;
             receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days&#xD;
             after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab monotherapy; not engaging in sexual&#xD;
             activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method,&#xD;
             and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception; male patients&#xD;
             should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female partners (of childbearing potential) of male patients must also use a highly&#xD;
             effective method of contraception throughout this period&#xD;
&#xD;
