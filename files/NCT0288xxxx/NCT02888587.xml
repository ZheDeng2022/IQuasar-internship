      The study has two objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To obtain endoscopic and colonoscopic biopsies to harvest and culture intestinal crypts&#xD;
           from human tissue to produce organoids. These organoids will be used to study the&#xD;
           biology of innervated sensory epithelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to collect subject data relating to clinical management and demographic characteristics&#xD;
           of patients undergoing upper endoscopy or colonoscopy to learn the mechanisms behind&#xD;
           visceral hypersensitivity, and neurodegenerative diseases that may arise in the gut.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Throughout the gastrointestinal tract there are specialized sensory epithelial cells that&#xD;
      recognize stimuli from nutrients and bacteria. These cells have been traditionally known for&#xD;
      their endocrine function. However, it was recently discovered using mouse models that these&#xD;
      cells receive synaptic inputs from enteric and peripheral neurons, such as those with cell&#xD;
      bodies in dorsal root ganglia or the vagal nodose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This finding opened a few possibilities, including the following: 1) sensory function of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract is modulated by neural activity; 2) gut bacteria influences brain&#xD;
      function through a direct neural circuit; and 3) viruses that preferentially infect neurons&#xD;
      access the central nervous system through this neural circuit [1,2]. To translate findings in&#xD;
      animal models to humans, the investigator must test the hypotheses in which the physiology of&#xD;
      gut sensory epithelial cells resembles that of humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visceral hypersensitivity is a core symptom for several gastrointestinal and brain behavior&#xD;
      disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, autism and anorexia. Unfortunately, the basic&#xD;
      mechanisms of sensory processing in the wall of the gut are non-existent. This lack of&#xD;
      knowledge precludes the development of therapeutic strategies to treat disorders linked to&#xD;
      visceral hypersensitivity. The investigator's efforts to translate animal research into human&#xD;
      models will be a foundation to develop target therapies for visceral hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, it is possible to derive organoids from intestinal crypts harvested from human&#xD;
      intestinal or colonic tissue. The organoids have all epithelial cell types, including gut&#xD;
      sensory cells. Here, the investigator's goal is to use de-identified human tissues to culture&#xD;
      intestinal organoids in the laboratory, and use it as a platform to study the biology of&#xD;
      innervated sensory epithelial cells. This work is significant because it will open the&#xD;
      possibility to learn the mechanisms behind visceral sensation and neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
      that may arise in the gut.&#xD;

    <description>Organoids are expected to contain enteroendocrine cells. We will use electrophysiology to measure the electrical excitability of these cells. In enteroendocrine cells from patients with a visceral hypersensitivity diagnosis is expected that cells will fire action potentials at a significantly lower threshold. These results will be correlated with RNA sequencing analysis to study the expression of sensory receptors in enteroendocrine cells.</description>
