      The aim of the study is to estimate the proportion of intensive care unit patients receiving&#xD;
      current aminoglycosides dosing regimens as part of their antibiotic therapy and achieving the&#xD;
      recommended maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) after the first and subsequent aminoglycoside&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aminoglycosides are often prescribed as part of empirical therapy for severe sepsis and&#xD;
      septic shock, especially when Gram-negative bacteria are suspected. From a pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      perspective, the ratio between the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and the minimum&#xD;
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the infecting pathogen (Cmax/MIC) is considered as the best&#xD;
      index of bacterial killing for aminoglycosides. In 2011, French guidelines on aminoglycoside&#xD;
      use recommend a targeted Cmax of 30-40 mg/L for gentamicin and 60-80 mg/L for amikacin.&#xD;
      However, these recommended plasma levels may not be achieved in high risk patients such as&#xD;
      ICU patients. Many factors can influence the pharmacokinetics of antimicrobial drugs in&#xD;
      critically ill patients. Indeed, alterations in the volume of distribution, plasma albumin&#xD;
      concentration, increased cardiac output, increased blood volume, and paradoxical renal and&#xD;
      hepatic clearance increase can be observed in the early stage of severe sepsis and are&#xD;
      frequently observed in ICU patients. Previous studies have reported low aminoglycoside plasma&#xD;
      concentrations in the early phase of therapy in ICU patients. However, data for the&#xD;
      subsequent doses of aminoglycosides were not available. Therefore, to address this lack of&#xD;
      data, an observational study is performed to describe the proportion of ICU patients&#xD;
      achieving targeted aminoglycoside Cmax after the first and subsequent aminoglycoside doses&#xD;
      using conventional dosing regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aminoglycoside agents are given in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics according to&#xD;
      the suspected pathogens and to local clinical practice. A once-daily dosing regimen based on&#xD;
      the French guidelines is used: ≥15 mg/kg for amikacin and ≥3 mg/kg for gentamicin based on&#xD;
      actual weight at admission. For obese patients,the weight used for dosing is left to the&#xD;
      physician's discretion.All aminoglycosides are given as a 30-min i.v. infusion in glucose 5%&#xD;
      solution. The timing of Cmax sampling is 30 min after the end of initial infusion. When&#xD;
      subsequent doses of aminoglycoside were recommended as part of the patient's treatment plan,&#xD;
      trough plasma concentrations (taken at 16-24 h post-infusion) (Cmin) and Cmax were collected&#xD;
      as part of routine practice.The targeted concentrations for amikacin and gentamicin are as&#xD;
      follows: amikacin, Cmax ≥60 mg/L and Cmin &lt;2.5 mg/L; and gentamicin, Cmax ≥30 mg/L and Cmin&#xD;
      &lt;0.5 mg/L.The following data are collected:•demographic characteristics: age, sex, and height&#xD;
      , weight and body mass index (BMI);•medical history, initial reason for ICU admission and&#xD;
      Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) at ICU admission;•clinical parameters: urine&#xD;
      output; the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and the Acute Kidney Injury&#xD;
      Network (AKIN) score are calculated daily from the initiation of aminoglycoside&#xD;
      therapy;•presence of renal replacement therapy (RRT);•co-prescription of nephrotoxic agents&#xD;
      (e.g. glycopeptides, diuretics);•biological parameters: serum creatinine concentration,&#xD;
      hepaticf unction (serum total bilirubin and transaminase) and platelets that are daily&#xD;
      measured in routine practice;•type of infection and anti-infective therapy and&#xD;
      microbiological cultures collected. Amikacin and gentamicin concentrations are measured using&#xD;
      automated immunoassays(Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) on a COBAS®C System.&#xD;
