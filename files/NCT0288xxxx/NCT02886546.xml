  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) is widely performed due to its many&#xD;
      advantages, including a reduced need for blood transfusion and fewer surgical complications&#xD;
      compared with conventional open prostatectomy. As this approach is also recommended in&#xD;
      elderly patients with serious comorbidities, optimal fluid therapy guidance during this&#xD;
      procedure is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic variables such as pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV)&#xD;
      are used to predict and guide fluid therapy during controlled ventilation. These variables&#xD;
      arise from heart-lung interactions during positive pressure ventilation, which influence left&#xD;
      ventricular stroke volume (SV). RALP requires carbon dioxide insufflation and the steep&#xD;
      Trendelenburg position to optimise surgical conditions, and can reduce cardiac output and&#xD;
      respiratory compliance. Accordingly, the usefulness of PPV and SVV, which are affected by&#xD;
      changes in intrathoracic pressure, in predicting fluid responsiveness during laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery under these conditions may be questioned. A recent study established that PPV and SVV&#xD;
      derived by uncalibrated pulse contour analysis had a relatively poor capacity to predict&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness during laparoscopy on dynamic preload indices. In contrast, another&#xD;
      study SVV measured by oesophageal Doppler monitor (ODM) could predict fluid responsiveness&#xD;
      during laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CardioQ-ODM+ combines the proven ODM Doppler measurement of blood flow with pulse contour&#xD;
      analysis, which is quickly and easily calibrated from the Doppler signal. We hypothesized&#xD;
      that PPV and SVV measured by calibrated pulse contour analysis would be a good indicator of&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness during laparoscopy with pneumoperitoneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that PPV and SVV measured by&#xD;
      calibrated pulse contour analysis of CardioQ-ODM+ can accurately predict fluid responsiveness&#xD;
      during RALP, which involves both pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position.&#xD;
      Investigators also assessed the capacity of other dynamic variables (SPV [systolic pressure&#xD;
      variation], and SVV determined by ODM Doppler flow, dynamic elastance [PPV/SVV] and corrected&#xD;
      flow time [FTc]) to predict fluid responsiveness during RALP.&#xD;
