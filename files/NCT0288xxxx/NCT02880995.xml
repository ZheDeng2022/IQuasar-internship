  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first purpose of this study is to determine if dopamine synthesis capacity is&#xD;
      significantly lower in treatment non-responders from illness onset relative to treatment&#xD;
      responders. And the second purpose of this study is to determine the potential of [18&#xD;
      fluorine(F)]-DOPA to be used to predict treatment response to antipsychotic treatment in&#xD;
      first episode psychosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is amongst the leading causes of global disability in adults. A major factor&#xD;
      underlying this is that about 30% of patients show little or no response to first-line&#xD;
      antipsychotic drugs. There is one drug, clozapine, with proven efficacy in these patients.&#xD;
      However, currently there are no good predictors of treatment non-response and consequently&#xD;
      patients have to undergo empirical trials with first-line drugs. This contributes to the long&#xD;
      delays, on average 4-5 years, seen in identifying and starting patients on clozapine.&#xD;
      Furthermore, clozapine is poorly tolerated and has potentially life-threatening side-effects,&#xD;
      which mean that the investigators desperately need new, alternative drugs. Lack of&#xD;
      understanding of the neurobiological basis underlying non-response has impeded the&#xD;
      development of alternatives to clozapine in the past. However recently it has been shown that&#xD;
      non-responders show reduced dopamine synthesis capacity relative to patients who have&#xD;
      responded to antipsychotics. The effect size for this difference is very large, d&gt;1.2. This&#xD;
      study was cross-sectional, in patients who had already received antipsychotic treatment for a&#xD;
      number of years. The key questions now are thus:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. is dopamine synthesis capacity different at illness onset in drug naïve patients who&#xD;
           subsequently show non-response to antipsychotic treatment relative to drug naïve&#xD;
           patients who respond to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. is it possible to predict who will respond to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this the investigators are going to investigate the relationship between presynaptic&#xD;
      dopamine dysfunction and antipsychotic responsiveness in a prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, the investigators are going to measure striatal dopamine synthesis capacity using&#xD;
      [18 fluorine(F)]DOPA positron emission tomography in drug-naïve first episode psychosis and&#xD;
      determine treatment response after 6 weeks of treatment with amisulpride. Response will be&#xD;
      defined as a &gt;30% reduction in symptom ratings on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect size in our cross-sectional study was d=1.3. Based on this effect size a sample&#xD;
      size of 12 per group will have &gt;80% power to detect a group difference with p&lt;0.05 2-tailed&#xD;
      using an independent t-test. Given a non-response rate of 30% the investigators will thus&#xD;
      require 40 patients at baseline to get 12 non-responders. To allow for 20% drop-outs we will&#xD;
      require 50 patients at baseline.&#xD;
