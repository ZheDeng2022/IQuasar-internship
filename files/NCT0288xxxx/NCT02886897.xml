      Background: Combinations of dendritic and cytokine-induced killer cell (D-CIK) based adoptive&#xD;
      immunotherapy and anti-PD-1 antibody may enhance the immune response and stop cancer cells&#xD;
      from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Phase II clinical trial to investigate the safety, clinical activity and toxicity&#xD;
      of combinations of D-CIK and anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with treatment-refractory solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Phase II clinical trial in patients with advanced metastatic hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma,bladder cancer,colorectal cancer,non-small-cell lung&#xD;
      cancer,breast cancer and other solid cancers. The D-CIK was isolated from peripheral blood of&#xD;
      participants,then activated,expanded and incubated with anti-PD-1 antibody before infusion.&#xD;
      The enough number (1.0-1.5 *10^10 cells) of D-CIK were infused back into participants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heparinized peripheral blood was obtained from participants over a 2-week period. PBMCs were&#xD;
      separated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation, suspended in X-VIVO 15 serum-free&#xD;
      medium, and culture with 1000 U/ml rhIFN-γfor the first 24 h, followed by stimulation with&#xD;
      100 ng/ml OKT3 , 1000 U/ml rhIL-2 and 100 U/ml IL-1α to activate the CIK.Dendritic cells were&#xD;
      incubated with CIK. Fresh medium containing 1000 U/ml rhIL-2 was added every 2 days and the&#xD;
      cell density was maintained at 2×10^6 cells/mL.D-CIK were harvested, washed, and resuspended&#xD;
      after culture for 14 days. Before cell transfer,D-CIK were incubated with anti-PD-1&#xD;
      antibody,and a fraction of the D-CIK were collected to assess their number, phenotype, and&#xD;
      viability of cells, and to test for possible contamination by bacteria, fungi, or endotoxins.&#xD;
      Then, autologous D-CIK (1.0-1.5*10^10 cells) were transferred to patients via intravenous&#xD;
      infusion. Generally, participants received at least 4 cycles of treatment at 2-week intervals&#xD;
      or received doses until disease progression occurred. If the participants were&#xD;
      disease-stable, additional cycles of maintenance treatment were eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated for the safety, clinical activity and toxicity. The primary&#xD;
      end point was the objective response for each participant at the time of D-CIK and anti-PD-1&#xD;
      infusion as assessed by RECIST. Peripheral blood of patients were also assessed for related&#xD;
      cytokine using ELISPOT assays. Additional,the investigators will evaluate tumor markers in&#xD;
      participants with clinical response/non-response by immunohistochemical staining of tumor&#xD;
      sections from previous diagnostic or therapeutic biopsy samples to determine the predictive&#xD;
      biomarker that may be used in future studies.&#xD;
