  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are characterized by the association to a myopathic&#xD;
      syndrome, inflammatory infiltrates in the skeletal muscle. They remain, even today, an&#xD;
      important factor of morbidity and mortality in these patients. At present, studies that&#xD;
      evaluated the prevalence of polymyositis / dermatomyositis are very few; they were mainly&#xD;
      recorded in the United States and Japan, the prevalence of polymyositis / dermatomyositis has&#xD;
      been estimated between 3.5 and 21.5 cases / 100 000 (according to the old diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      of Bohan and Peter). However, previous works are old and retrospective; above all, they have&#xD;
      almost always been performed (90% of cases) from cases reported to the hospital, leading to&#xD;
      selection bias and an underestimate of the true prevalence of polymyositis / dermatomyositis&#xD;
      in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, these data lead to achieve this epidemiological study, descriptive, multicenter, based&#xD;
      on the population of Normandy.&#xD;
