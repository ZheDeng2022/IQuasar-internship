      Purpose: The incidence of surgery for lumbar disc hernia varies. According to the national&#xD;
      spine registries in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, there is a 30-60% difference in surgical&#xD;
      incidence between these countries. The cause for this difference is not known. It may reflect&#xD;
      a difference in incidence of lumbar disc hernia, but with a similar socio-economic and&#xD;
      ethnical background in these countries, it is more likely that the differences are due to&#xD;
      varying surgical indications. Comparing indications for surgery, patient reported outcome and&#xD;
      factors predictive for outcome after surgery for lumbar disc hernia in these countries could&#xD;
      provide information about optimal indications for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: (i) there are no differences in patient-reported outcome after surgery between&#xD;
      these countries, (ii) there are no differences in indications for surgery between these&#xD;
      countries and (iii), factors that predict outcome are similar in these countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of research: By using data from three Nordic national spine registers, we will compare&#xD;
      baseline data, indications for surgery and patient reported outcome one year after surgery&#xD;
      for lumbar disc herniation. Register based studies have advantages such as large sample&#xD;
      sizes, reflecting real life, but they also have limitations such as lower follow-up rates&#xD;
      than clinical trials. A non-response analysis will be performed to take this into account.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational register based study, with prospective data registration and a&#xD;
      retrospective study design. Included are individuals treated surgically for a lumbar disc&#xD;
      herniation between the ages of 18 through 65 years, without a history of previous lumbar&#xD;
      spine surgery. Surgery has been performed in Denmark, Norway or Sweden during 2011, 2012 or&#xD;
      2013. Data will be presented according to the STROBE criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registers&#xD;
&#xD;
      All registries have the aim of studying outcome after spine surgery. All departments and&#xD;
      patients participate voluntarily. At the time of admission, the patient reports data&#xD;
      consisting of information on social factors, comorbidity and previous surgery. After surgery,&#xD;
      the surgeon records diagnosis and type of surgery performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swespine Register has included individuals treated with surgery for lumbar disc&#xD;
      herniation since 1993. During the last decade, the number of departments participating in the&#xD;
      registry has varied between 35 and 41 of the 42 to 45 departments providing spinal surgery&#xD;
      services in Sweden. Coverage is approximately 90%. The completeness (number of patients&#xD;
      reported to Swespine at the time of surgery) is approximately 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Norwegian Spine register, NORspine, is based on experiences from the Swespine register&#xD;
      and previous validation studies from a local clinical registry, and was founded in 2007. In&#xD;
      total 36 of 40 centers performing lumbar spine surgery in Norway report to NORspine. Coverage&#xD;
      is approximately 90%. The completeness is approximately 65%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish spine register, DaneSpine, is based on Swespine and was acquired by the Danish&#xD;
      Spine Society from the Swedish Society of Spinal Surgeons in 2009 and has successively been&#xD;
      implemented. In total 17 of 19 centers performing lumbar spine surgery in Denmark report to&#xD;
      DaneSpine. Coverage is approximately 90%. The completeness is approximately 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for all studies, there is a risk that loss to follow-up may bias the results. Solberg et&#xD;
      al. (2011) studied 633 patients, who were operated on for degenerative disorders of the&#xD;
      lumbar spine in Norway, and found that a loss to follow-up of 22% would not bias conclusions&#xD;
      about overall treatment effects. There were no indications of worse outcomes in the&#xD;
      non-responders group. In a similar one-center study of the DaneSpine. HÃ¸jmark et al. (2016)&#xD;
      found that a loss to follow-up of 12% at did not seem to bias the conclusions that can be&#xD;
      drawn from DaneSpine at that center. Preliminary data indicates that predictors of outcome&#xD;
      after lumbar disc herniation surgery are comparable with data in a study with a very high&#xD;
      follow-up rate and with the Swespine register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymized individual level data from all three registers will be pooled in one database. The&#xD;
      cohort will be divided by country for comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data and out of range data&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of missing data case exclusion analysis by analysis, will be used. Out of range data&#xD;
      will be deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be cleaned by excluding patients with missing or incorrect date of surgery,&#xD;
      missing date for follow-up, previous lumbar spine surgery and surgery other than discectomy&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After data cleaning, we aim to perform blinded statistical analyses, in which the independent&#xD;
      statistician performing the analyses is unaware of group belonging (i.e. country). The code&#xD;
      will not be broken until the analyses and interpretations have been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons of indications for surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of baseline data will include age at surgery, sex, anthropometrics, number of&#xD;
      smokers, Oswestry Disability Index, numeric rating scale leg pain, numeric rating scale back&#xD;
      pain, EQ-5D, number on sick leave, employment status, and duration of leg and back pain and&#xD;
      presented as mean (SD), mean (95% confidence interval), or number (%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables will be analyzed by analysis of variance, Chi-square or logistic regression tests.&#xD;
      Data will be presented as crude (unadjusted) data to elucidate any differences between the&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons of outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons of the change of the outcome variables from baseline to 1 year, as well as&#xD;
      comparisons of the actual value at 1 year will be performed. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA),&#xD;
      Chi-square or logistic regression tests will be used and the crude (unadjusted) data will be&#xD;
      presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline variables will be used as covariates in the ANCOVA and the adjusted data&#xD;
      presented. Additionally, the results from the ANCOVA will be compared with results from&#xD;
      propensity score matching or ANCOVA with the propensity score as a covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-response analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-response analysis will be performed comparing all available baseline variables between&#xD;
      those that responded to the 1 year follow-up with those that did not respond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of similar character has never been performed before. Due to the nature of the study,&#xD;
      the sample size is not formulated in the guise of power, risk level, or clinical difference.&#xD;
      The number of patients participating in the study is estimated to 7500. The sample is so&#xD;
      large that differences in the Oswestry Disability Index of as low as 2 points may be detected&#xD;
      (power 90%, significance level 5%), but in the interpretation the minimal important&#xD;
      difference of 10-15 points in the Oswestry Disability Index often referred to has to be taken&#xD;
      into account.&#xD;
