  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with&#xD;
      high risk oral intraepithelial neoplasia. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine oral cancer-free survival of patients with high risk oral intra-epithelial&#xD;
      neoplasias (IEN) treated with pembrolizumab versus observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab for patients with oral IEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the histologic and clinical response rates (in the subgroup of patients with&#xD;
      clinically evident measurable oral IEN lesions) to pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the immune infiltrate in oral IEN lesions before and after treatment&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess predictive, tissue-and blood-based, biomarkers of benefit from pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      oral IEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the presence of neo-antigens in IEN lesions before and after treatment, and&#xD;
      their correlation with oral cancer-free survival and immune infiltrate characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the oral micro-biome before and after treatment with pembrolizumab and its&#xD;
      association with neo-antigens and benefit from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients undergo observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36&#xD;
      months and then periodically thereafter.&#xD;
