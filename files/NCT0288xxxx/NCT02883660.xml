      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients who have been prescribed&#xD;
      antidepressant medications and have experienced significant adverse effects are more likely&#xD;
      to be poor metabolizers on the CYP450 (CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5+) drug metabolizing&#xD;
      enzymes and/or homozygous for the short allele of the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) compared&#xD;
      to patients who took an antidepressant medication and did not experience significant adverse&#xD;
      effects but also had minimal or no response to the medication. The target medications being&#xD;
      studied include escitalopram, citalopram, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, venlafaxine, duloxetine,&#xD;
      bupropion, vortioxetine, vilazodone, and levomilnacipran only.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genetic variations in the CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5+ drug metabolizing enzymes&#xD;
      are responsible for metabolism of a large number of psychiatric and nonpsychiatric&#xD;
      medications. Variations in the genes encoding for these enzymes can alter their activity&#xD;
      resulting in unexpectedly high or low serum levels of the drug leading potentially to change&#xD;
      in both efficacy and adverse events. The serotonin transporter protein is a presynaptic&#xD;
      transmembrane protein responsible for serotonin reuptake. The &quot;short&quot; form of the serotonin&#xD;
      transporter promoter (SLC6A4) is associated with reduced activity of the of the transporter.&#xD;
      Patients who are homozygous for the &quot;short&quot; alleles of SLC6A4 may be more likely to have with&#xD;
      poor response, slow response, and greater adverse events with serotonergic medications. The&#xD;
      target medications being studied include escitalopram, citalopram, paroxetine, fluvoxamine,&#xD;
      venlafaxine, duloxetine, bupropion, vortioxetine, vilazodone, and levomilnacipran only.&#xD;

        One hundred (100) subjects aged 18 years or older, currently or in the past on one of the&#xD;
        target antidepressants, will be recruited into this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to give informed consent prior to the initiation of any protocol required&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must be able to understand the nature of the study, agree to comply with the&#xD;
             study procedures, and communicate about medical history to the study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject was treated with one of the following &quot;target antidepressants:&quot; Escitalopram,&#xD;
             citalopram, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, venlafaxine, duloxetine, bupropion, vortioxetine,&#xD;
             vilazodone, and levomilnacipran. Rationale: These antidepressants are primarily&#xD;
             metabolized by CYP isoenzymes that will be assessed. Antidepressants like sertraline,&#xD;
             fluoxetine, and mirtazapine are metabolized by multiple CYP isoenzymes and therefore&#xD;
             are less likely to be significantly affected by metabolizer status on a particular CYP&#xD;
             isoenzyme. For patients who have been treated with multiple antidepressants, the&#xD;
             antidepressant that was associated with the greatest overall burden of AEs will be&#xD;
             selected as the target antidepressant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5a. Study group: &quot;Increased AEs&quot; currently or in the past on one of the target&#xD;
        antidepressants as operationally defined as either A or B: A) One or more AEs that were&#xD;
        moderate/severe OR three or more AEs that were mild occurring on less than the usual&#xD;
        minimum recommended dose of the antidepressant, or B) Three or more AEs that were&#xD;
        moderate/severe OR five or more AEs that were mild on a dose of the antidepressant within&#xD;
        the usual recommended dose 5b. Control group: Both A and B A. Less than 30% reduction in&#xD;
        the severity of depression after treatment for at least 6 weeks B. Minimal or no AEs on&#xD;
        that antidepressant&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects on antidepressants other than those specified in the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects for whom it is unclear which medication caused the adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects for whom participation in the study would be detrimental to their mental of&#xD;
             physical health based on investigator's opinion&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have had a medical condition that, in the investigator's judgment, may be&#xD;
             causing the reported adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prisoners or patients who are involuntarily incarcerated&#xD;
