    <textblock>
      The inability to consistently deliver at large scale promising education interventions is an&#xD;
      important contributing cause to inequality in the U.S. The research team applies insights&#xD;
      from price theory and field-based randomized controlled trials to examine the effect of&#xD;
      implementing a promising academic skills development program at large scale before&#xD;
      implementing at scale. The project is designed to provide evidence of direct scientific and&#xD;
      policy value for attempts to scale up a specific intervention, but also stimulate a much more&#xD;
      thorough investigation of social policy scale-up challenges by refining these methods and&#xD;
      demonstrating their feasibility and value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team examines the challenge of program scale up for a promising intervention&#xD;
      studied in Chicago at medium scale in the past - SAGA tutoring. Past work has demonstrated&#xD;
      that SAGA's intensive, individualized, during-the-school-day math tutoring can generate very&#xD;
      large gains in academic outcomes in a short period, even among students who are many years&#xD;
      behind grade level. This study will explicitly explore the extent to which there is a&#xD;
      trade-off between effectiveness and scale for this intervention. By taking advantage of the&#xD;
      power of random sampling, this study will also allow for observation of the program's&#xD;
      effectiveness as if it were running at three-and-a-half times the proposed scale in a subset&#xD;
      of the study population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The University of Chicago Education Lab and Crime Lab New York research teams are carrying&#xD;
      out a randomized controlled trial during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 academic years to build on&#xD;
      previous collaborations with the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), the New York City Department&#xD;
      of Education, and SAGA Innovations that have found that SAGA's intensive, individualized,&#xD;
      during-the-school-day tutoring can generate very large gains in academic outcomes in a short&#xD;
      period of time, even among students who are many years behind grade level. This research&#xD;
      suggests the promise of this approach for improving the academic skills and educational&#xD;
      attainment of disadvantaged youth, even once they have reached adolescence. However, to truly&#xD;
      affect outcomes at the local and national level, SAGA would have to be rolled out on a much&#xD;
      greater scale than researchers have been able to study in Chicago. Yet little is known about&#xD;
      how to take promising interventions to scale. This study seeks to build the science of&#xD;
      scale-up, by examining the extent to which this individualized tutoring program can be&#xD;
      implemented at an even greater scale and by explicitly exploring the trade-offs between&#xD;
      effectiveness and scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAGA Innovations program expands on the nationally recognized innovation of high- dosage,&#xD;
      in-school-day tutoring developed in Match Education's charter school in Boston. The tutoring&#xD;
      program meets as a scheduled course, Math Lab, once a day during the normal school day, and&#xD;
      is provided in addition to a student's regular math class. Students work two-on-one (two&#xD;
      students with one tutor) with the same full-time, professional tutor for the entirety of the&#xD;
      school year. The content of the tutoring sessions is aligned with what students are learning&#xD;
      in their regular math courses, but is also targeted to address individual gaps in math&#xD;
      knowledge. Also following the original model developed by Match Education, SAGA tutors use&#xD;
      frequent internal formative assessments of student progress to individualize instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous randomized controlled trial conducted by the University of Chicago research team&#xD;
      found that one year of this intervention, delivered in AY2013-14 in the Chicago Public&#xD;
      Schools, generated between one and two extra years of academic growth in math, over and above&#xD;
      what the normal U.S. high school student learns in one year (Cook et al., 2015; Reardon,&#xD;
      2011). The estimated effects for math achievement are on the order of 0.19 to 0.30 standard&#xD;
      deviations, depending on the exact test and norming used. The intervention also improved&#xD;
      student grades in math by 0.58 points on a 1-4 grade point scale, compared to a control mean&#xD;
      of 1.77. These gains are particularly important because of the growing evidence on the&#xD;
      importance of math specifically for short- and medium-term success in school, and for&#xD;
      long-term life outcomes such as employment and earnings (Duncan et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to build upon the investigators' previous evaluations of the program, and&#xD;
      will provide insight into the ability of this program to serve youth at a much larger scale.&#xD;
      Specifically, this study aims to answer the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the effect of implementing an evidence-based individualized tutoring program at&#xD;
           larger scale?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the relationship between the effect of the program and the scale at which the&#xD;
           program is implemented?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation sites are divided into two sets: sites in Chicago at which students are&#xD;
      randomized to receive tutoring (hereby referred to as &quot;scale-up&quot; schools), and sites in&#xD;
      Chicago and New York City where principals have primary discretion to choose which students&#xD;
      receive tutoring (hereby referred to as &quot;returning schools&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study research question #1, investigators will take advantage of the power of&#xD;
      random sampling to study scale-up of this program without actually having to implement the&#xD;
      program at a much larger scale. The first research question seeks to measure the average&#xD;
      quality of the scaled up program in Chicago, in which researchers will utilize data from the&#xD;
      scale-up schools. Students in both scale up and returning schools are both randomly assigned&#xD;
      to tutors. However, students in the scale-up schools have two additional randomizations - (1)&#xD;
      tutor applicant randomization and (2) treatment assignment randomization. For the first&#xD;
      feature, the research team is having SAGA over-recruit tutors as though they were&#xD;
      implementing at larger than the intended scale in the scale up schools. Investigators then&#xD;
      randomly select one in three-and-a-half tutor applicants to continue through SAGA's standard&#xD;
      hiring process, and positions at the scale-up schools are only filled by these randomly&#xD;
      selected tutors. As students are randomly assigned to treatment in these scale-up schools,&#xD;
      investigators will be able to measure program effects at about three-and-a-half times the&#xD;
      scale at which the program is being implemented at these schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure treatment effects for research question #1, the research team will estimate both&#xD;
      intent to treat (ITT) and treatment on the treated (TOT) impacts. Researchers will estimate&#xD;
      the ITT effect as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Y=B0 + B1T + B2X + E&#xD;
&#xD;
      where Y is the outcome of interest, T indicates students that are randomly assigned to be&#xD;
      offered the chance to participate in the tutoring program, X is a set of baseline controls&#xD;
      (which specifically includes randomization block, gender, age, learning disability,&#xD;
      free/reduced lunch status, race, baseline grade level, GPA, number of As/Bs/Cs/Ds/Fs in the&#xD;
      prior year, math and reading standardized test scores from the prior year, days absent from&#xD;
      school, disciplinary incidents including suspensions and arrests, and a binary flag for&#xD;
      students with missing GPA and attendance data), E is a random error term, and B0, B1, B2 are&#xD;
      parameters to be estimated. The random assignment of T assures that under standard&#xD;
      assumptions, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation yields an unbiased estimate of the ITT&#xD;
      as the estimate of B1, or the effect of being offered participation in the SAGA tutoring&#xD;
      program. As all students who were randomized into the program were paired with tutors that&#xD;
      were randomized via the process described above, our ITT (and subsequently, TOT) effect will&#xD;
      specifically measure the effect of the program when administered at three-and-a-half times&#xD;
      the scale as it is currently being administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ITT measures the effect of being offered the chance to participate. As students assigned&#xD;
      to treatment are not required to participate in the program, the ITT may not measure the&#xD;
      effect of participation. The research team will measure the effect of participation using&#xD;
      random assignment of T as an instrument for participation. If all participants were randomly&#xD;
      selected (i.e. if there are no control students who are allowed to participate in the&#xD;
      tutoring program) this method calculates the effect of the treatment on the treated (TOT), or&#xD;
      the effect of participating for the group of students who choose to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain insight into research question #2 above, which seeks to determine the relationship&#xD;
      between program scale and effects, tutors at all sites are ranked by SAGA leadership based on&#xD;
      relative expected quality. The research team will then randomize student pairs to tutors in&#xD;
      an effort to identify a tutor's effect on student outcomes. Using this methodology,&#xD;
      researchers can study whether tutor ranking predicts the size of the program effects. As the&#xD;
      research team assumes that the program would hire tutors in the order of their ranking&#xD;
      depending on the number of tutor slots they needed to fill, this analysis will shed light on&#xD;
      the relationship between scale and effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the impact of being assigned to a tutor of a particular ranking (i.e. the ITT&#xD;
      estimate of research question #2), investigators will run regression models that regress&#xD;
      academic outcomes on tutor rank. Our main outcome of interest is math standardized test&#xD;
      scores. Our primary analysis will model outcomes as a linear function of tutor rank. As a&#xD;
      secondary exploratory analysis, we will estimate the shape of the relationship between&#xD;
      outcomes and tutor rank using the following leave-one-out cross-validation exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimate the relationship non-parametrically by running a regression at the&#xD;
           student-level of the outcome (primary: math standardized test scores) on a full set of&#xD;
           separate fixed effects for every tutor rank. Call the coefficient on the fixed effect of&#xD;
           the rth ranked tutor, γ ̂_r.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For rank r=1,…,R: Estimate using the student-level data the relationship between the&#xD;
           outcome and tutor rank as a polynomial of order p=0, 1, 2, …, 10 holding the students&#xD;
           assigned to tutors ranked r out of the sample. Use the coefficients from the polynomial&#xD;
           terms to predict γ ̂_r, and call that f ̂_p (r). Save the squared error for each&#xD;
           polynomial: (f ̂_p (r)-γ ̂_r )^2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Select the polynomial p that minimizes ∑_(r=1)^R(f ̂_p (r)-γ ̂_r )^2 .&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Report the estimated relationship between the outcome and rank using the selected order&#xD;
           of polynomial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the functions of tutor rank, each regression will include block fixed effects&#xD;
      that capture how student pairs were randomly assigned to tutors. The blocks include student&#xD;
      groups within a classroom with shared special restrictions (e.g. having no restrictions,&#xD;
      needing a Spanish-speaking tutor, or needing a tutor who is qualified for advanced&#xD;
      mathematics courses). Other covariates in the model will be the same as those included in our&#xD;
      ITT and TOT analysis for research question #1, noted above, to measure the effect of the&#xD;
      program when administered at three-and-a-half times the scale as it is currently being&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As students switch tutors for a variety of reasons, researchers will also need to calculate&#xD;
      the TOT estimate to look at the impact of being assigned to and actually working with a tutor&#xD;
      of a particular ranking. To do so, investigators will use the rank of the randomly assigned&#xD;
      tutor as an instrument for the weighted average tutor rank, where the weight placed on each&#xD;
      tutor's rank is equal to the proportion of time (measured in days) the student spent with&#xD;
      that tutor. Investigators will use daily attendance data to create this weighted average.&#xD;
      This method will help investigators understand whether working with a higher-ranked tutor&#xD;
      means that a student actually receives better quality instruction, or whether an additional&#xD;
      relationship between tutor rank and actual quality exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use only observed outcomes for the analysis. If an outcome is missing for more than 5&#xD;
      percent of the sample, we will also report the treatment effect on whether or not the outcome&#xD;
      is observed. When baseline covariates are missing, we will impute missing values with zero&#xD;
      and include an indicator for missingness as an additional baseline control.&#xD;
