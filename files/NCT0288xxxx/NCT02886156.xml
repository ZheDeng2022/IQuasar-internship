  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple clinical studies have indicated that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most common&#xD;
      chronic sleep disorder, may affect neurocognitive function, and that treatment for continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) has some neurocognitive protective effects against the&#xD;
      adverse effects of OSA. However, the effects of CPAP treatment on neurocognitive architecture&#xD;
      and function remain unclear. Therefore, this multicenter trial was designed to investigate&#xD;
      whether and when neurocognitive architecture and function in patients with OSA can be&#xD;
      improved by CPAP treatment, and to explore the role of gut microbiota in improving&#xD;
      neurocognitive function during treatment.This study will be a multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial with allocation concealment and assessor blinding. A total of 148 eligible&#xD;
      patients with severe OSA will be enrolled from five sleep centers, and randomized to receive&#xD;
      CPAP with best supportive care (BSC) intervention or BSC intervention alone. Cognitive&#xD;
      function, structure and function of brain regions, gut microbiota, metabolites, biochemical&#xD;
      variables, electrocardiography, echocardiography, pulmonary function, and arterial stiffness&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline before randomization and at 3, 6, and 12 months. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators will enroll 74 healthy controls and assess all of the aforementioned&#xD;
      variables at baseline.&#xD;

      Background Multiple clinical studies have indicated that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the&#xD;
      most common chronic sleep disorder, may affect neurocognitive function, and that treatment&#xD;
      for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has some neurocognitive protective effects&#xD;
      against the adverse effects of OSA. However, the effects of CPAP treatment on neurocognitive&#xD;
      architecture and function remain unclear. Therefore, this multicenter trial was designed to&#xD;
      investigate whether and when neurocognitive architecture and function in patients with OSA&#xD;
      can be improved by CPAP treatment, and to explore the role of gut microbiota in improving&#xD;
      neurocognitive function during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design This study will be a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with allocation&#xD;
      concealment and assessor blinding. A total of 148 eligible patients with severe OSA will be&#xD;
      enrolled from five sleep centers, and randomized to receive CPAP with best supportive care&#xD;
      (BSC) intervention or BSC intervention alone. Cognitive function, structure and function of&#xD;
      brain regions, gut microbiota, metabolites, biochemical variables, electrocardiography,&#xD;
      echocardiography, pulmonary function, and arterial stiffness will be assessed at baseline&#xD;
      before randomization and at 3, 6, and 12 months. In addition, the investigators will enroll&#xD;
      74 healthy controls and assess all of the aforementioned variables at baseline.&#xD;

      Ethics and Dissemination Ethics approval was given by the Medical Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital (approval number 2015-79).&#xD;
