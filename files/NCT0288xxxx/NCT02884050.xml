      Data generated from this pilot project will be used to support a larger, NIH funded study to&#xD;
      investigate the physiologic mechanisms associated with the cognitive side effects of a&#xD;
      commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug (AED), topiramate (TPM). This study will provide pilot&#xD;
      data to 1) demonstrate the viability of using quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) to&#xD;
      examining physiological effects of AEDs as they relate to language function, and 2) perform&#xD;
      formal power estimate calculations in support of a longer-term connectivity study using&#xD;
      stochastic modeling techniques including power, coherence, and Granger causality metrics to&#xD;
      analyze AED effects on quantitative EEG. Traditionally, the cognitive side effects of AEDs&#xD;
      have been considered a byproduct of decreased neuronal excitation associated with medical&#xD;
      therapy, although recent data suggests that this may not be true for some newer medications,&#xD;
      such as TPM. The proposed experiments will employ quantitative EEG to investigate the effects&#xD;
      of topiramate on neuronal network connectivity and pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      relationships in order to explore individual physiological responses. Topiramate is selected&#xD;
      because of its relatively unique effects on generative verbal fluency, but unlike older AEDs,&#xD;
      TPM is associated with little EEG change. The investigators will compare the effects of TPM&#xD;
      to baseline and an inactive placebo in a randomized double blind crossover design.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive side-effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are important components of treatment&#xD;
      tolerability, although the physiologic mechanisms associated with their cognitive effects are&#xD;
      poorly understood. Quantitative EEG and other neurophysiologic measures are sensitive&#xD;
      indicators of central AED effects and in the older AEDs, with slowing consistent with a&#xD;
      diffuse encephalopathy, tend to covary with neuropsychological performance. EEG changes are&#xD;
      generally more sensitive than neuropsychological testing to AEDs, and have been demonstrated&#xD;
      for oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence demonstrates that the cognitive effects of these agents cannot be explained&#xD;
      simply by diffuse reduction of neuronal excitability. Older AEDs are associated with a&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate generalized cognitive effect such as decreased psychomotor speed, which is&#xD;
      also accompanied by encephalopathic EEG patterns including increased spectral EEG power in&#xD;
      the lower frequency bands. Several of the newer AEDs have not demonstrated this pattern. Some&#xD;
      of these have reduced cognitive effects; however, one of the new AEDs, topiramate (TPM),&#xD;
      which also does not possess this EEG encephalopathic pattern, actually produces greater&#xD;
      cognitive deficits than many older AEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although newer AEDs tend to have a more favorable cognitive profile, TPM, which is indicated&#xD;
      for partial or primary generalized epilepsy as well as migraine prophylaxis, is being&#xD;
      increasingly prescribed for a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders including bipolar&#xD;
      disorder, weight loss and even eating disorders despite carrying a high risk of&#xD;
      neuropsychological impairment with a prominent effect on verbal fluency. Although TPM's&#xD;
      effect on verbal fluency may reflect a more widespread disruption of frontal lobe function,&#xD;
      TPM's effect on verbal fluency has also been interpreted by some as reflecting a more general&#xD;
      effect on language. TPM has multiple mechanisms of actions including modification of Na+ or&#xD;
      Ca2+ dependent action potentials, enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated&#xD;
      receptors, and inhibition of kainate-mediated conductance at glutamate receptors of the&#xD;
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA)/kainate type. In addition,&#xD;
      TPM is a carbonic anhydrase (CA) II inhibitor, and although the functions of CA in the&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) is not well-established, at least some CA isoenzymes (CA II)&#xD;
      have heavy human brain concentrations in oligodendrocytes and myelin. Because TPM is unique&#xD;
      in that its neuropsychological effects are not accompanied by quantitative spectral EEG&#xD;
      components, a generalized reduction in neuronal excitation is insufficient to account for&#xD;
      TPM's neuropsychological profile. Therefore, investigators are investigating whether the&#xD;
      physiologic mechanisms underlying TPM's negative cognitive effect is reflected by altered&#xD;
      patterns of neuronal EEG connectivity following a single dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TPM's inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase suggests that its mechanism of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment may be related to white matter dysfunction altering neuronal connectivity. If&#xD;
      true, then TPM's effects should be greater on generative fluency than semantic-decision due&#xD;
      to disruption of intentional system connectivity of the frontal lobe and anterior cingulate&#xD;
      with other brain regions. Semantic-conceptual processing with semantic-decision should be&#xD;
      unaffected. However, TPM has multiple mechanisms which may contribute to its cognitive&#xD;
      effects. If a generalized &quot;frontal lobe&quot; effect is present, then similar TPM effects should&#xD;
      be present for working memory activations. EEG provides the opportunity to explore&#xD;
      differential changes in functional connectivity associated with AEDs as a function of task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, TPM appears to have a significant and selective effect on word finding and&#xD;
      verbal fluency in a minority of patients that isn't manifest by other AEDs. As Goldstein et&#xD;
      al point out in their recent review, this type of heterogeneity of response may be part be&#xD;
      explained by genes involved in both the metabolism and central response to TPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the physiological effects of TPM on cognition are manifest&#xD;
      at the functional network level, with the greatest reduction in connectivity expected during&#xD;
      verbal fluency. The primary objective of this project is to characterize TPM's effects on&#xD;
      working memory and verbal fluency during quantitative EEG recording in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      This study will provide pilot data to 1) demonstrate the viability of this approach to&#xD;
      examining physiological effects of AEDs as they relate to language function, and 2) perform&#xD;
      formal power estimate calculations in support of a longer-term connectivity study using&#xD;
      stochastic modeling techniques including power, coherence, and Granger causality metrics to&#xD;
      analyze AED effects on quantitative EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research goal of this project is to establish the relationship of single dose TPM&#xD;
      on quantitative cognitive EEG in order to investigate the physiological mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      the cognitive effects of AEDs. Investigators will examine neuronal network connectivity and&#xD;
      potential pharmacokinetic relationships to individual physiological responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1a. To determine the change in functional EEG connectivity following single dose&#xD;
      TPM compared to placebo during a working memory task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary research goal of this project is to collect preliminary data on the genetics of&#xD;
      TPM metabolism and genetic influences on TPM-induced changes in verbal fluency and working&#xD;
      memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. To investigate the association between genotype and changes in verbal fluency&#xD;
      and working memory as a result of taking a single 100 mg TPM versus a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, double crossover study designed to&#xD;
      investigate the physiologic effect of a single dose of TPM (100 mg) or placebo on cognition&#xD;
      and working memory. Subjects will undergo cognitive EEG recording, neuropsychological testing&#xD;
      and blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of the research study and the possible risks will be explained to each potential&#xD;
      subject. The subjects will be made aware that their medical care is not contingent on their&#xD;
      participation. Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject by one of the&#xD;
      co-investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the study days, subjects will be initially directed to the University of Florida (UF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroinformatics Lab in the J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After signing the informed consent, subjects will be randomly assigned to a study&#xD;
           treatment sequence. All medication will be purchased by the UF Pharmacy. Subjects will&#xD;
           be asked to abstain from alcoholic beverages or over-the-counter medications for at&#xD;
           least 48 hours prior to testing though they will be permitted to consume caffeinated&#xD;
           beverages on the day of their assessment if that is part of their standard morning&#xD;
           routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After being ask to consent to the study, a brief demographic, medical and medication&#xD;
           history will be taken on the first visit to assure that subjects are not currently on&#xD;
           any medications that can interact with either TPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject will be fitted with EEG electrodes. On the 2nd and 3rd visits, study medication&#xD;
           will be consumed just prior to the electrode placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After completing the EEG recording session (approx. 2.5 hours), electrodes will be&#xD;
           removed, Blood will be drawn for serum concentrations (a genetic sample will be taken at&#xD;
           this time on the first visit ONLY after separate consent is obtained).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject will then be given a small snack after which a brief neuropsychological&#xD;
           assessment (~ 20 minutes) will be administered by a blinded tester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This same procedure will be repeated at least one week apart until all study conditions have&#xD;
      been obtained. All testing will be performed at approximately the same time of day. Subjects&#xD;
      will be required to arrange for transportation home each day following completion of the&#xD;
      experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG RECORDING AND WORKING MEMORY TASK The EEG portion of this project will be conducted in&#xD;
      the Neuroinformatics Lab in the J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering&#xD;
      at the University of Florida. Subjects will be comfortably seated inside an acoustically and&#xD;
      electrically shielded booth designed to reduce ambient noise and 60 Hz activity. 128 small&#xD;
      electrodes will be placed on the research subjects' scalp using spandex electrode cap.&#xD;
      Standard procedures are used to reduce the electrical resistance at each recording site by&#xD;
      injecting a small amount of conductive gel into each electrode holder on the cap. The scalp&#xD;
      in each electrode site will be rubbed lightly before the gel injected. In addition, seven&#xD;
      additional flat-type electrodes are to be used, (a) two for each lateral side of both eyes,&#xD;
      (b) two for the above and below of the left eye, (c) two for right behind each ear and (d)&#xD;
      one for one of the arms depending on the subject's hand orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject then is seated on a non-metal wooden chair in front of a computer screen inside&#xD;
      the electromagnetically and acoustically shielded chamber located in the lab. The subject&#xD;
      should memorize different set of numbers (maximum of five different digits) that will appear&#xD;
      on the screen. A few seconds later a probe (one digit number) will appear on the screen and&#xD;
      the subject need to responds as quickly as possible by pressing a button to indicate whether&#xD;
      the number belongs to the set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hour paradigm consists of four 15 minute blocks. Practice block will be given before the&#xD;
      actual one and one minute break time between the blocks will be given. Investigators can&#xD;
      communicate with the subject either by looking at the closed-circuit TV (CCTV) system from&#xD;
      outside or by talking through the wired radio system during the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEUROPSYCHOLOGY BATTERY A battery of neuropsychological tests that includes measures from our&#xD;
      cognitive AED protocol as well as additional language-specific measures will be used:&#xD;
      Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWA), which tests the ability to generate words&#xD;
      beginning with a specific letter of the alphabet; Action Verb Fluency, in which the subject&#xD;
      lists as many action verbs (run, climb) as they can in one minute; Category Fluency, in which&#xD;
      the subject lists as many names (i.e., of animals, pieces of clothing, etc) as they can in&#xD;
      one minute; Category Switching, where the subject switches between recall of names from two&#xD;
      different categories, i.e., between fruits and furniture; Hopkins Verbal Learning Test&#xD;
      (HVLT),which offers a brief assessment of verbal learning and memory (recognition and recall)&#xD;
      for individuals 16 years and older. It is a word list learning task; Symbol Digit Modalities&#xD;
      Test (SDMT), a test of graphomotor and psychomotor speed. Additional psychological tests that&#xD;
      will be administered include Boston Naming Test, action verb fluency test, and the Boston&#xD;
      Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Picture Description Task (PictA) in which the subject is asked&#xD;
      to describe a black-and-white schematic pencil drawing of a scene containing several types of&#xD;
      elicitation stimuli. (&lt;5 min). Alternate versions of this task include the Minnesota Test for&#xD;
      Differential Diagnosis of Aphasia (PictB) and the Nichols-Brookshire &quot;Rescue&quot; Picture&#xD;
      Description Task (PictC) Administration of this battery will take approximately 20-25&#xD;
      minutes. All tests will be audiotaped for further speech and language analysis.&#xD;
