  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some cancers of the oesophagus and stomach express excessive copies of either the cMYC&#xD;
      (Myelocytomatosis oncogene) gene, the HER2 (Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) gene or&#xD;
      both. These genes may potentially contribute to the growth and spread of cancer.Ibrutinib is&#xD;
      a drug that is already used in the treatment of certain cancers of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is preclinical evidence that it shows activity against gastric and stomach cancer cells&#xD;
      over-expressing cMYC and HER2 genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iMYC study will assess the activity of ibrutinib in cancers of the oesophagus and stomach&#xD;
      which over-express these genes and which have previously been treated with standard&#xD;
      chemotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any anti-cancer activity seen will be measured and correlated with metabolic changes on FDG&#xD;
      (18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose) - PET (positron emission tomography)&#xD;
      scan, changes in DNA and circulating tumour cells in the blood, and molecular changes in the&#xD;
      cancer itself through the use of optional repeat tumour biopsies. If an effect is seen it&#xD;
      could provide justification for further research in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible if they have advanced cancer of the oesophagus or stomach and have&#xD;
      been treated with at least one line of prior therapy. The study will be conducted at the&#xD;
      Royal Marsden Hospital at its Sutton and Chelsea sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will involve an initial group of up to 17 patients. Screening, recruitment and follow up&#xD;
      will last for 3 years in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients wishing to take part must consent to having their cancer biopsied to test for cMYC&#xD;
      and HER2 amplification, as well as a number of imaging and blood tests. There are optional&#xD;
      further tumour biopsies whilst on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with ibrutinib until progression of their disease or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm phase II study. Patients will receive standard dose&#xD;
      single-agent ibrutinib delivered orally at a dose of 560mg once daily continuously on a 4&#xD;
      weekly cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single arm, open label means that both researchers and participants know the treatment which&#xD;
      is being administered, and all participants in the trial will receive the study drug&#xD;
      ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase 2 study was chosen as more information about the efficacy and toxicity of this drug&#xD;
      in this specific group of patients is needed prior to considering a larger phase 3 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are those with advanced unresectable or metastatic oesophagogastric&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma who have been treated with at least 1 prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease. In the case of HER2 positive tumours,&#xD;
      previous treatment with chemotherapy with or without a HER2 targeted agent is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a two step enrollment process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enrollment for prescreening to establish cMYC and HER2 status (which may occur during&#xD;
           1st line treatment or after progression on 1st line treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enrollment for randomisation and treatment The patient will first be given the&#xD;
           prescreening participant information sheet (PIS) and informed consent form (ICF) that&#xD;
           has been approved by the Ethics Committee. They will have the study explained to them&#xD;
           and be given the opportunity to ask questions. If they agree to take part, they will be&#xD;
           asked to sign the approved consent form, and they will keep a copy of the signed consent&#xD;
           form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prescreening If a participant agrees to take part in the prescreening for the study a&#xD;
           previously obtained sample of their cancer (usually a diagnostic biopsy) will be taken&#xD;
           out of storage and sent to the trial laboratory where the tissue will be tested for both&#xD;
           cMYC and HER2 amplification. If there is no archival tumour sample available or if the&#xD;
           existing tumour sample is of insufficient quality, the patient will be given the option&#xD;
           to consent to a pre-screening biopsy to obtain a fresh sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A blood test will be taken for plasma DNA analysis including circulating tumour cell&#xD;
           number, c-MYC copy number variation (by digital droplet PCR) and blood-borne biomarkers.&#xD;
           It can take up to 4 weeks to get these results which is why we will try to pre-screen&#xD;
           patients to avoid delays in treatment. When the patient's disease progresses on 1st line&#xD;
           treatment and if they are a suitable candidate for second line treatment their team will&#xD;
           confirm if there are spaces available on study according to the the patients cMYC and&#xD;
           HER2 status.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If there are spaces available they will be given the main study PIS and ICF that has&#xD;
           been approved by the Ethics Committee. They will have the study explained to them and be&#xD;
           given the opportunity to ask questions. If they agree to take part, they will be asked&#xD;
           to sign the approved consent form, and they will keep a copy of the signed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a participant agrees to take part in the main study, assessments will be made to make&#xD;
           sure that he/she is eligible for the study. Some of these assessments may already have&#xD;
           been done as part of the participant's standard of care, in which case, the results of&#xD;
           those tests may be used. The assessments that will be done are described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Disease status Tumour sample details, c-MYC and HER2 status if re-tested&#xD;
           Medical/surgical history Pregnancy testing for female patients World Health Organisation&#xD;
           (ECOG) performance status Physical examination to assess all conditions that are current&#xD;
           and ongoing. Vital signs: height, weight, pulse, systolic blood pressure and diastolic&#xD;
           blood pressure ECG Tumour biopsy* Tumour assessments (RECIST v1.1), consisting of either&#xD;
           staging CT or MRI imaging FDG-PET scan* Concomitant medication. Adverse events Blood&#xD;
           tests for clinical biochemistry and haematology Urinalysis Blood tests for DNA analysis&#xD;
           including Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) number, c-MYC copy number variation (by digital&#xD;
           droplet PCR) and bloodborne biomarker analysis*&#xD;
&#xD;
           *These procedures will only be carried out once all other criteria for trial entry are&#xD;
           met.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the results of screening tests confirm that the patient can take part in the study&#xD;
           they will be asked to return to the clinic to see their doctor for assessments as&#xD;
           detailed below during the study treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study treatment period During the treatment period the patient will be seen regularly in&#xD;
           clinic.The treatment is oral capsules given once per day every day in cycles lasting 28&#xD;
           days. Patients will be seen on day 1, 8 and 15 of the first cycle of treatment and then&#xD;
           on day 1 of every cycle (every four weeks) for the remainder of the study duration. When&#xD;
           they stop being treated within the study they will have a 30 day follow up visit and&#xD;
           then be followed up every 8 weeks, although this contact can be over the telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before each treatment cycle, the patient will be examined and have safety blood tests to&#xD;
           make sure that it is safe to proceed with treatment as mentioned below. Patients will&#xD;
           have different procedures done at different times during the study treatment period&#xD;
           including:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurement of resting blood pressure and pulse rate before every treatment (at all&#xD;
           study visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Physical examination at the beginning of each cycle (every four weeks). Documentation of&#xD;
           any changes in the medication taken and whether the patient has had any problems or&#xD;
           discomfort since the last visit (at all study visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
           An ECG at baseline and on completion of study, and at any further timepoint if&#xD;
           clinically indicated Blood samples to check haematology and clinical chemistry results&#xD;
           (every 4 weeks or if clinically indicated) Blood samples for plasma DNA analysis&#xD;
           including CTC number, c-MYC copy number variation (by ddPCR) and bloodborne biomarker&#xD;
           analysis. These will be taken on cycle 1 day 15, cycle 3 day 1 and then every 8 weeks&#xD;
           (alternate cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood samples to assess pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib on cycle 1 day 8 (predose, 2&#xD;
           hours, 6 hours post dose) and one further sample on cycle 1 day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment of the status of disease using CT or MRI imaging at week 8 and then every 8&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment with PET CT scan at baseline, day 14 and week 8 to correlate with tumour&#xD;
           response and genetic changes seen Health related quality of life questionaires for the&#xD;
           patient to fill out at the beginning of each cycle (every 4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
           As mentioned above, a biopsy at the time of screening is mandatory for entry into the&#xD;
           trial. As part of the trial further optional biopsies will be offered to the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
           at day 14 (in all patients on ibrutinib) at week 8 (on those patients responding to&#xD;
           ibrutinib) on discontinuation of study treatment (on those patients who have progressed&#xD;
           on ibrutinib)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment discontinuation visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           When the patient withdraws from the study or treatment is permanently discontinued, they&#xD;
           will need to attend the clinic for a visit and the following assessments will be carried&#xD;
           out:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Changes in the medication taken and any problems or discomfort since their last visit&#xD;
           will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the patient has a side effect at their final study visit or withdrawal visit then the&#xD;
           study doctor may wish to contact them and ask about it, until it has completely&#xD;
           resolved. The study sponsor may also ask the study doctor for this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When the patient has completed the study, the doctor will then decide whether they&#xD;
           require further treatment outside the study. They will continue to be followed up within&#xD;
           the study every 8 weeks to document what other cancer treatment they may or may not be&#xD;
           taking and to document overall survival. This contact may be in clinic if they are&#xD;
           attending the hospital or can be by telephone if they are not.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Timeline for Final Report The study is planned to recruit over 24 months with a further&#xD;
           12 months of follow up with final report planned for within 12 months of the last&#xD;
           patient's last visit.&#xD;
