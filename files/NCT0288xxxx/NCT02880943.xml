    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentre, open-label, phase I/II study to evaluate the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD), and the most successful dose (MSD) of XOFIGO®, in renal cancer patients&#xD;
      with metastases to bone, without (Group A) or with (Group B) visceral metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-finding will be performed according to the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) using&#xD;
      either toxicity (escalation cohort) or joined toxicity-efficacy (expansion cohort) endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of patients will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: patients with bone disease mainly will be treated with XOFIGO® alone. (node&#xD;
           and/or adrenal metastases and/or ≤5 lung metastases ≤1cm each are allowed in Group A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: patients already treated with an ongoing approved Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor&#xD;
           (TKI) for their visceral metastases will be treated with XOFIGO® for bone disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XOFIGO® will be administered intravenously as a bolus injection every 4 weeks with a maximum&#xD;
      of 6 administrations per patient. Four dose levels are available for evaluation : 27.5&#xD;
      kBq/kg, 55 kBq/kg, 88 kBq/kg and 110 kBq/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting dose for phase I will be 55 kBq/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection Patients will come to the hospital at baseline, and screening assessments must be&#xD;
      performed within 28 days prior to first XOFIGO® administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XOFIGO® period Patients will receive an injection of XOFIGO® on Day 1 of each 4 weeks-cycle&#xD;
      for a maximum of 6 cycles. Patients will be subject to physical examination, blood sampling&#xD;
      and pain evaluation prior to each injection. Scintigraphy of biodistribution of radium-223&#xD;
      dichloride will be realised on C1D1 after the 1st injection of XOFIGO® On C1D15, patients&#xD;
      will also come for physical examination and blood sampling. On C2D15 (end of DLT period for&#xD;
      phase I), patients will also come for end of DLT period evaluation and will be subject to&#xD;
      physical examination and blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to C3D1 and C5D1, patients will undergo WB-IRM and FNa-PET. End of treatment visit&#xD;
      (EOT) will take place 4 weeks after the last administration of XOFIGO®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of confirmed bone progression at XOFIGO® discontinuation time, patients will&#xD;
      continue to undergo WB-IRM and FNa-PET every 2 months until confirmed bone progression or end&#xD;
      of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmation of bone progression upon WB-IRM will be performed 4 weeks after the initial&#xD;
      progression is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Patients will be followed-up for a maximum of 12 months from the 1st administration&#xD;
      of XOFIGO®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum number of patients to be enrolled in the escalation cohort is 21. Maximum number of&#xD;
      patients to be enrolled in the expansion cohort is 21. Group A: 2-4 patients; Group B: 38-40&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
