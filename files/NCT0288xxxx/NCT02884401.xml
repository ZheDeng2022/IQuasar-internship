  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective case series study aiming to evaluate the effect of post-menopausal&#xD;
      osteoporosis on the jaw bone around dental implants with a modified titanium surface. The&#xD;
      study consists of 8 visits that will be performed within a minimum period of 15 months.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Rheumatology Department and Radiology Department at&#xD;
      Barts Health National Health Service (NHS) Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include 20 post-menopausal osteoporotic women with a requirement of a tooth&#xD;
      to be replaced. The main objective of this study is to radiographically compare alveolar&#xD;
      (jaw) bone changes in width and height after the placement of a dental implant with a&#xD;
      hydrophilic (SLActive) surface and 12 months after loading (placement of the crown) it in&#xD;
      post-menopausal osteoporotic women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective case series study aiming to radiographically assess the changes in&#xD;
      alveolar bone width and height after the placement of a SLActive implant (implant with a&#xD;
      modified surface that should stimulate bone formation) and 12 months after loading it in&#xD;
      post-menopausal osteoporotic women. The null hypothesis is: in post-menopausal osteoporotic&#xD;
      women there are no significant changes in the peri-implant alveolar bone after the placement&#xD;
      of a SLActive implant and 12 months after loading it in terms of width and height assessed by&#xD;
      the use of CBCT images. The aim is to include 20 post-menopausal osteoporotic women with a&#xD;
      requirement of a tooth to be replaced. However, considering a potential drop-out rate of 10%,&#xD;
      the investigators have planned to increase the recruitment for this trial to 22&#xD;
      postmenopausal women. They will be recruited from the Rheumatology Department and Radiology&#xD;
      Department at Barts Health NHS Trust, amongst those patients attending for a consultation&#xD;
      with the osteoporosis specialist or for taking a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan.&#xD;
      Before starting the visit, post-menopausal women meeting the inclusion criteria will be asked&#xD;
      by a study examiner if they agree to be quickly screened for the presence of an intercalate&#xD;
      edentulous area (edentulous area in between the teeth)and if they may be interested in taking&#xD;
      part into the study. If they agree, a quick dental examination will be performed by a study&#xD;
      examiner (a qualified dentist) after the visit. The patients who would qualify for enrolment&#xD;
      will receive information on the study, the patient information sheet and consent form,&#xD;
      together with a letter to give to their General Dental Practitioner (GDP) in order to be&#xD;
      referred to the Centre for Oral Clinical Research. The patients that do not qualify for&#xD;
      enrolment will receive a report of the oral screening in case they require dental treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the referral letter arrives at the Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Barts Health, the&#xD;
      patient will be contacted to answer any further question and to book an appointment to attend&#xD;
      the enrolment visit, should they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 8 visits that will be performed over a minimum period of 15 months at&#xD;
      the Centre for Oral Clinical Research at the School of Dentistry of Queen Mary University of&#xD;
      London (QMUL):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enrollment visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Signing of informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recording of any concomitant medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Confirmation of participant eligibility pertaining to the presence of an&#xD;
                intercalate single edentulous area fulfilling the inclusion criteria (wisdom teeth&#xD;
                and second molars excluded)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Basic Periodontal Examination (BPE) recording;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical measurement of the periodontal parameter in the teeth adjacent to the area&#xD;
                where the implant will be placed (Probing pocket Depth, PPD; Recession, REC; Plaque&#xD;
                Index, PI; Bleeding on Probing, BOP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exit participant if not eligible, arrangement for full-mouth debridement treatment&#xD;
                outside the study protocol (if needed) and refer to GDP for other dental problems&#xD;
                (such as caries and endodontic infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the patient agrees, a letter will be sent to the General Practitioner (GP) to inform&#xD;
           about the participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Full-mouth debridement(within 90 days from enrolment):&#xD;

                may be used as required to ensure pain control for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In case a participant requires further periodontal treatment, this will be arranged&#xD;
           outside the study protocol. No implant will be placed until a condition of periodontal&#xD;
           health (no pockets ≥5 mm) will be reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • In order to plan the implant placement and according to the clinician's judgment and&#xD;
           the complexity of the case, either a Cone Bean Computed Tomography (CBCT) scan or a&#xD;
           peri-apical intra-oral x-ray, limited at the area of the implant placement, will be&#xD;
           taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Implant placement (within 120 days from visit 2):&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Resonance frequency analysis. In case horizontal GBR is performed simultaneously to&#xD;

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the participant&#xD;
