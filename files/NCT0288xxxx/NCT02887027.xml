    <textblock>
      Multiple studies indicate that exercise is effective in treating depressed mood and reducing&#xD;
      anxiety sensitivity. As depressive symptoms and anxiety sensitivity are elevated in&#xD;
      individuals with anxiety and depressive disorders, exercise could help reduce these symptoms&#xD;
      and aid in the overall treatment of these disorders. This project aims to test an ecological&#xD;
      momentary exercise intervention (Exercise4Mood) delivered via a mobile phone application in&#xD;
      individuals with anxiety or depressive disorders. Previous protocols have tested the&#xD;
      acceptability and usability of Exercise4Mood in healthy participants. In Phase 1 of the&#xD;
      study, focus groups were conducted to explore the acceptability and usability of the&#xD;
      Exercise4Mood app. Qualitative feedback was collected and modifications were made to the app&#xD;
      based on this feedback. In Phase 2 of the study, the Exercise4Mood app was tested in 6&#xD;
      healthy participants. Preliminary unpublished findings indicate that the app was acceptable&#xD;
      and promoted increased physical activity. The aim of this protocol is to test the&#xD;
      acceptability, usability, and efficacy (to improve mood and reduce anxiety) of Exercise4Mood&#xD;
      in patients with anxiety or depressive disorders.&#xD;

      Design: A multiple baseline design will be employed: the intervention will be introduced in&#xD;
      the 1st participant after a baseline period of 8 days, in the 2nd participant after 11 days,&#xD;
      and in the 3rd participant after 15 days. The same pattern will be followed for participants&#xD;
      4-6. Participants will be in the intervention period for 21 days, 18 days, and 14 days&#xD;
      respectively, at a prescription of 150 minutes of moderate intensity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who pass the phone screen will be invited to come to our laboratory for remaining&#xD;
      screening procedures. At the screening visit, in-person assessment will include informed&#xD;
      consent procedures, evaluation of psychiatric inclusion/exclusion criteria and mood, anxiety&#xD;
      and traumatic stress disorders with the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Diagnostic&#xD;
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 5 Adult Version (ADIS-5) and additional&#xD;
      informal assessment if needed (e.g. to assess eating disorders). The diagnostic assessment&#xD;
      will be performed by a study staff member who has been trained in administration of the&#xD;
      ADIS-5 and clinical interviewing. If a diagnostic assessment has been conducted at the Center&#xD;
      for Anxiety and Related Disorders (CARD) at Boston University within the last six weeks,&#xD;
      participants will be given the option to provide consent for it to be used instead (plus&#xD;
      additional portions of the ADIS-5 if needed). Eligible participants will be assigned to one&#xD;
      of the three conditions above (as this is a single case design, it is not randomized;&#xD;
      participants are assigned sequentially to the conditions above). The Screening Visit, which&#xD;
      will last 1 hour, may take place on the same or a different day as the pre-baseline visit&#xD;
      depending on the researcher and participant's availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Baseline Visit (Day 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This in-person visit will occur on Day 1 before the baseline recording period and last 45&#xD;
      minutes. Participants will complete baseline questionnaires and a Physical Activity Recall&#xD;
      interview (PAR). Participants' height and weight will be collected. Participants will be&#xD;
      given a tutorial on and be provided with an activity and heart monitoring device to wear.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to engage in their normal level of activity until their next&#xD;
      visit. They will be instructed to wear an activity monitor during all waking hours and a&#xD;
      heart rate monitor if they exercise. They will be scheduled for a Pre-Intervention Visit&#xD;
      either 8, 11, or 15 days later (depending on assignment above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Intervention Visit (Day 8, 11, 15 for Participants 1, 2, and 3, respectively):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This in-person visit will occur after the baseline recording period and last 45 minutes.&#xD;
      Participants will be prescribed the Exercise4Mood Mobile Intervention for a period 21, 18, or&#xD;
      14 days (depending on assignment above) at a prescription of 150 minutes of moderate&#xD;
      intensity (i.e. 64 percent to 76 percent of your maximum heart rate, typically achieved with&#xD;
      a brisk walk) exercise per week (as defined by American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)&#xD;
      guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit, they will complete an introduction to Exercise4Mood. This will involve&#xD;
      meeting with the PI who will provide a broad overview of the intervention and training on how&#xD;
      to download and use the Exercise4Mood app (and a number to call in case of technical&#xD;
      difficulties). Participants will be provided with a Subject ID number and password that they&#xD;
      will use to log in to the Exercise4Mood app. They will self-select what days and times they&#xD;
      would like to exercise. The PI will help problem solve and ensure that their self-selected&#xD;
      plan is feasible. The PI will note down the days and times so that text-message reminders can&#xD;
      be sent to the participant. Participants will complete a Physical Activity Recall interview&#xD;
      (PAR). Participants will leave the visit with the Exercise4Mood app downloaded on their&#xD;
      personal phone and an exercise schedule for the next 21, 18, or 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Period (21, 18, or 14 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the two days following the Pre-Intervention Visit, participants will be prompted to&#xD;
      complete the Introduction to Exercise4Mood app modules at home. During these modules, they&#xD;
      will be provided with information about getting started with exercising. This will include a&#xD;
      list of different types of moderate intensity exercise (as listed below) from which&#xD;
      participants will self-select what type of exercise they would like to engage in over the&#xD;
      intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Walking briskly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biking slowly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Jogging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Swimming leisurely&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elliptical or other gym machines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stair walking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basketball&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aerobic Yoga&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tennis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catch/throw sports (e.g. baseball)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention period, participants will receive text message prompts to engage with&#xD;
      the Exercise4Mood app and engage in exercise. At the end of each week that they are in the&#xD;
      intervention, they will be prompted to complete questionnaires through the Exercise4Mood app.&#xD;
      These questionnaires will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. During this period, they&#xD;
      will wear an activity monitor during all waking hours and a heart rate monitor when they are&#xD;
      exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint Visit (Day 29):&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 29, participants will complete an in-person 30 minute visit. During this visit, they&#xD;
      will complete an interview about their physical activity engagement, questionnaires (if they&#xD;
      did not completed them on the app the day prior), and return the activity and heart rate&#xD;
      monitor. Participants will be provided with referrals for mental health treatment.&#xD;
