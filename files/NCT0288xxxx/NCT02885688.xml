  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding liquid nutrition therapy that&#xD;
      is given by vein to standard-of-care treatment for sepsis can help to control sepsis symptoms&#xD;
      better than giving standard-of-care treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers also want to compare the length of ICU and hospital stay and any side effects&#xD;
      between these 2 treatments.&#xD;

      Study Groups and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is eligible and chooses to take part in this study, they will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows&#xD;
      if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive standard-of-care treatment alone for up to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive standard treatment for up to 7 days, plus liquid nutrition. The liquid&#xD;
      nutrition will be given by vein non-stop for up to 7 days. The liquid nutrition therapy may&#xD;
      stop sooner if participant's doctor thinks they are ready, based on how they are tolerating&#xD;
      tube feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Groups: As part of standard treatment, participants will receive breathing and blood&#xD;
      pressure support, daily routine blood draws, imaging, standard drugs (such as antibiotics and&#xD;
      blood pressure drugs), and other tests the doctor decides are needed. These tests and&#xD;
      treatment will begin within 12 hours after participant is admitted to the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's doctor will discuss the standard treatment and tests with them in more detail.&#xD;
      Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the standard treatment and&#xD;
      tests are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is in Group 2, blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn on Days 1-7 to check&#xD;
      their blood oxygen and sugar levels. These tests may help the doctor make any needed changes&#xD;
      to participant's liquid nutrition therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will take part in this study for up to 7 days. Patient's participation on this&#xD;
      study will be over after Day 7 or when they can leave the ICU, whichever happens first.&#xD;
      Participant may be taken off study early if intolerable side effects occur or if they are&#xD;
      unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The liquid nutrition provided in this study is FDA approved&#xD;
      and commercially available. Comparing the 2 study groups is investigational. The study doctor&#xD;
      can explain how the liquid nutrition is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
