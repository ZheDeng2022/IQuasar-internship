    <textblock>
      The autoimmune diabetes ACCELERATOR PREVENTION TRIAL (adAPT) is based on the accelerator&#xD;
      hypothesis. The trial is designed to establish whether metformin, an oral hypoglycaemic agent&#xD;
      that is known to reduce insulin demand in type 2 diabetes (T2D), can do the same in children&#xD;
      at risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and thereby prevent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of adAPT will screen participants aged 5-16 years (inclusive) for&#xD;
      islet-related autoantibodies who are the siblings or offspring of individuals diagnosed with&#xD;
      T1D before the age of 25years in Scotland and England.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four principle islet-related antibodies associated with T1D. The presence of two or&#xD;
      more confers a 40% risk of developing T1D in five years. While the presence of none or one&#xD;
      antibody carries a similar risk for developing T1D to the general population (1 in 500 in&#xD;
      5years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that 5% of those screened will be identified as double-antibody positive,&#xD;
      these participants will be invited to join the intervention phase of the study - randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT). Up to 200 eligible subjects could be identified by screening with a&#xD;
      minimum of 90 being enrolled into the RCT phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      adAPT is a proposed three stage project. The current protocol defines the screening phase,&#xD;
      Stage 1 and seamless entry into Stage 2. Screening will identify children and young people at&#xD;
      high risk of developing T1D and invite them to participate in Stage 1 which will involve a&#xD;
      minimum of 4 months treatment with either metformin/placebo, however Stage1 treatment will&#xD;
      run seamlessly into Stage 2. Stage 1/2 treatment will last up to 21 months (to accommodate&#xD;
      15months screening, 4 months treatment and 2 months analysis). Post Stage1 analysis/ late&#xD;
      Stage 2 participation will last up to 36 months (participants enrolled early into Stage 1&#xD;
      will have the longest intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Stage1 participants will be tested on three occasions (baseline, month 1 and month&#xD;
      4) for metabolic response using a 5-point mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Testing will&#xD;
      continue in Stage 1/2 with 3 visits further visits at months 8, 12, 18. Late Stage 2 visits&#xD;
      will occur on months 24, 30 &amp; 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to continue into Stage 3, taking treatment up to 60 months post&#xD;
      analysis of Stage 1 and associated protocol amendment and additional consent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      adAPT is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled Phase IV clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin, a licensed medicine but will be tested out with its current license (off-label).&#xD;
      Participants will either receive metformin (liquid) or matched placebo in a double blind&#xD;
      manner; neither the participant or study team will know the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin, the study medication, reduces the demand for insulin in Type 2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
      adAPT will test if metformin can also reduce insulin demand in children at risk of Type 1&#xD;
      Diabetes (T1D). adAPT has an adaptive design with each stage informing the next with&#xD;
      progression depend upon the previous stages outcome Stage 1 exposes each participant to&#xD;
      metformin or placebo for four months, following which they seamlessly enter Stage 2. However,&#xD;
      because recruitment rolls over 15 months many of those recruited early on will have entered&#xD;
      Stage 2 before some even reach Stage 1. Accordingly, the protocol and submission also&#xD;
      outlines Stages 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A successful Stage 1 will lead-on to a clinical outcome trial (Stages 2 and 3) which, if&#xD;
      successful, will fundamentally change our understanding of what causes diabetes and how to&#xD;
      prevent it. Stage 1 is required to confirm that adAPT trial design is achievable. Outcome&#xD;
      evaluation will be undertaken at 21 months. Stage 2 (proof-of-concept) will test if metformin&#xD;
      can slow-down the development of diabetes. The outcome data form Stage 1 will allow for power&#xD;
      to be calculated to drive the number of participants required for the study for Stages 2 (and&#xD;
      3). It is proposed that once the power and thus population numbers are established for Stage&#xD;
      2 (out with this protocol) that new participants will enter Stage 1 via screening and follow&#xD;
      the established trial pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes biological markers will be measured and formally assessed at the end of Stage 2,&#xD;
      after 36 months. Stage 3 will occur if metformin treatment in Stage 2 is proven to be better&#xD;
      than placebo for slowing the development of diabetes. Stage 3 will further investigate the&#xD;
      development of diabetes between the groups, using biological markers and clinical outcomes at&#xD;
      five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children/adolescents aged between 5-16 years (inclusive) at the time of screening and who are&#xD;
      siblings or offspring of people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes before the age of 25 are&#xD;
      eligible to be invited to participate in the screening phase of adAPT. Families/ children&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in screening and will informed of the study by invitation&#xD;
      letter (via the index T1D patient) from their designated clinician/Principal Investigator&#xD;
      (PI) or via their family practitioner through Scottish Primary Care Research Network/Clinical&#xD;
      Research Network (SPCRN/CRN). In addition potential participants may contact the study team&#xD;
      independently (self-referral) in response to media/press and internet coverage. Those invited&#xD;
      via letter will be requested to either return the reply slip, or call/Short Message Service&#xD;
      (SMS)/email the study team to register their interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent and child age-appropriate Screening Information will be provided and written consent&#xD;
      and assent will be completed. Consent/assent will only occur after a minimum of 24 hours has&#xD;
      elapsed from study information provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will take place in clinically appropriate locations. Screening requires a small&#xD;
      non-fasting blood sample (3.5 mls). Participants will be offered topical anaesthesia prior to&#xD;
      the blood sample being taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sample will be tested for four islet-related antibodies. Two or more antibodies will&#xD;
      infer a positive test, while one or less will conclude a negative test. It is anticipated&#xD;
      that approximately 5% of the screened population will present with a positive results and&#xD;
      thus a 40% risk of diabetes over 5 years and thus are eligible to be invited into Stage 1 of&#xD;
      the study. It is expected that 95% of people screened will test negative and their&#xD;
      participation will conclude (except for remote data linkage relating to diabetes diagnosis&#xD;
      for 10 years post study participation). The antibody tests are posted to the study's partner&#xD;
      laboratory in Bristol, United Kingdom (UK) with results being available within an 8 week&#xD;
      timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody positive participants/families will receive a result consultation and an invitation&#xD;
      to the intervention stage of the study. Age-appropriate information sheets will be provided&#xD;
      for children/adolescents in addition to parents/guardian information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If child/adolescent and parent/guardian assent/consent to participant in the RCT phase the&#xD;
      following visits will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 Month 0 (M0) visit - lasting approximately 2.5 to 3 hours:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure participant height, weight and waist circumference. Urine pregnancy test for all&#xD;
      menstruating female participants. Topical anaesthesia will be offered and applied if&#xD;
      participant agreeable. (Following assessment of anaesthesia) a cannula will be inserted for&#xD;
      blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety blood samples to measure fasting glucose levels, full blood count, liver function,&#xD;
      urea and electrolytes. Samples sent to local National Health Service (NHS) hospital&#xD;
      accredited laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research blood samples: Antibodies, Immunology, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA -with consent and&#xD;
      Vitamin B12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed Meal Tolerance Testing (MMTT) baseline samples (Insulin, C-peptide and Glucose)&#xD;
      followed by Ensure Plus (or equivalent) drink at 6ml per kg dose (maximum 360ml) with 4&#xD;
      further blood tests being obtained at 30 minute intervals (via the in situ cannula) for 2&#xD;
      hours; Time points: 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will occur following eligibility criteria and safety sample results review by&#xD;
      PI. If the participant is not eligible the participant and parent will be informed of the&#xD;
      rationale for non-eligibility and the participant' s family doctor will be informed of any&#xD;
      clinically significant findings (with consent.) Participants will be provided with study&#xD;
      medication (Metformin or placebo) and given instructions on dose and administration after&#xD;
      randomisation has taken place at M0 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible, more than one sibling can be screened and, if seropositive, recruited. To avoid&#xD;
      treatment contamination, immediate family members will be allocated to the same treatment&#xD;
      group, with the first family member tested being the one who is randomly allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required study medication dose is calculated using the participant's weight using a&#xD;
      dosing algorithm using 2.5kg increments to the nearest 0.5mls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On commencement of treatment metformin can cause gastric intolerance, therefore to minimise&#xD;
      side effects for the first two weeks participants will be requested to take once daily&#xD;
      10mg/kg - half the target dose. Medication is administered/ taken orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 0 + 2 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research nurse will contact the parent/participant to review tolerability and if tolerated&#xD;
      increase to twice daily dosing of 10mg/kg and will assess adverse event profile. New written&#xD;
      dosing instructions will be provided. If the participant is not tolerating dose they will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 1 Visit - lasting approximately 2.5 to 3 hours:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures are the same as M0 without an antibody blood sample. Study medication is increased&#xD;
      to the target dose of 20mg/kg, twice daily. Participants are provided with new written dosing&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 1 + 1 week:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research nurse will phone the parent/participant to review tolerability of up-titrated dose&#xD;
      and assess adverse event profile. If the dose is not tolerated they their dose will be&#xD;
      reduced to the previous tolerated dose of 10mg/kg, twice a day which will continue for the&#xD;
      remainder of the trial. Where down-titration occurs new written dosing instructions will be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 4, 8, 12, 18, (Late Stage 2: 24, 30, 36) - lasting approximately 2.5 to 3 hours:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures are the same as M0 with antibody sample. Clinical significant results will&#xD;
      reported as per local laboratory ranges and protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Months 1, 2 &amp; 3 and every 3 months or as required the research nurse will contact&#xD;
      parent/participant to assess adverse event profile.&#xD;
