      The Ethical, Legal and Social Issues Substudy in relation to the Genotype Tissue Expression&#xD;
      Project (GTEx) aims to describe tissue requesters' approach to discussions about donation to&#xD;
      GTEx and to assess the determinants of families' and patients' willingness to donate to GTEx.&#xD;
      It also explores ethical issues such as privacy, risks, and release of incidental findings&#xD;
      and recommend best practices for conducting authorizations and training requesters.&#xD;

      The Genotype Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) is a partnership between multiple NIH agencies&#xD;
      and funded by the Common Fund. Families who agreed to donation of organs and tissues for&#xD;
      transplantation were asked to authorize the collection of additional tissues for GTEx by&#xD;
      participating Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO). Donated tissues are placed in a National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute biobank, and the donor's genome and medical record information analyzed and&#xD;
      released to researchers through NIH's database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). The&#xD;
      tissues and information will be kept in the biobank indefinitely and cell lines may be&#xD;
      developed from the donated skin and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) sub-study examines the issues surrounding risks to&#xD;
      privacy and breach of confidentiality to family decision makers (FDM) as well as FDM&#xD;
      perspectives on the return of findings to donor families. The ELSI sub-study assessed the&#xD;
      authorization process and make suggestions for its improvement. Semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      were completed with families who decided to donate to GTEx as well as those who refused to&#xD;
      donate to the project. Tissue requesters (TR) who make the GTEx approaches for participating&#xD;
      OPOs, were also asked to complete an online survey for each approach they completed for GTEx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study builds on this research team's extensive work in organ and tissue donation and the&#xD;
      work currently being conducting during the ELSI pilot of the GTEx project. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to examine the impact of stress and complex information on donor&#xD;
      families' decision-making to inform the consent process; understand how variations in&#xD;
      requesters, consent approaches, and the characteristics of family decision makers affect&#xD;
      understanding, recall of and willingness to donate tissues for research; consider the ethical&#xD;
      and legal issues of the request and consent process; and, test a novel intervention designed&#xD;
      to train tissue requesters to employ effective communication techniques when making requests&#xD;
      for tissue. The overall goal is to develop a set of recommendations that will maximize the&#xD;
      likelihood that family decision makers (FDM) make informed donation decisions under stressful&#xD;
      circumstances. The specific aims of the ELSI GTEx study are:&#xD;

      Specifically, the investigators propose to examine the impact of stress and complex&#xD;
      information on the decision making of donor families to inform the consent process,&#xD;
      understand how variations in requesters, consent approaches, and the characteristics of&#xD;
      family decision makers affect understanding and recall of and willingness to donate tissues&#xD;
      for research, consider the ethical and legal issues of the request and consent process, and&#xD;
      test an intervention to train tissue requesters to employ effective communication techniques&#xD;
      when making requests for tissue. The overall goal is to develop a set of recommendations that&#xD;
      will maximize the likelihood that family decision makers (FDM) make informed donation&#xD;
      decisions under stressful circumstances. The specific aims of the ELSI GTEx study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify elements of nonverbal and relational communication impacting FDM knowledge,&#xD;
           recall and GTEx decision making. Using the methods and procedures of the pilot study,&#xD;
           the investigators will conduct an observational study of the GTEx request process to&#xD;
           understand the communication-related variables impacting FDM knowledge, recall and&#xD;
           decision making. In addition, a subsample of audiotapes will be obtained from&#xD;
           tissue-only donors whose consent conversations are conducted by telephone and are&#xD;
           audiotaped. This will provide information about the important nonverbal and relational&#xD;
           elements of communication on the outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H1a. Sociodemographic characteristics of FDM will impact the major outcomes of interest&#xD;
           to this study (recall, comprehension and consent). Specifically, FDM who have more&#xD;
           education, are white, female and younger will be more likely to donate, have better&#xD;
           recall and knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H1b. Relational elements of communication, such as confirmational messages (e.g.,&#xD;
           messages that expressed validation or acceptance) or persuasive tactics such as&#xD;
           credibility, altruism, or esteem, and engaging in a lengthier conversation will be&#xD;
           associated with a greater likelihood to donate have better recall and knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H1c. Tissue requesters' and FDMs' comfort speaking about GTEx, the proclivity of FDMs to&#xD;
           ask question and engage more proactively in the conversation will be associated with a&#xD;
           greater likelihood to donate have better recall and knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a study, using a quasi-experimental design, to understand the impact of the&#xD;
           stressful environment in which the requests occur. This study will assist the ELSI team&#xD;
           to obtain an evidence base that will allow us to disentangle the effects of stress from&#xD;
           the complexity of the information about the purpose of the donation and guide&#xD;
           recommendations for a final consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adapt and test a communication intervention targeting tissue requesters' (TR) use of&#xD;
           effective, ethically acceptable techniques that maximize the likelihood of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3a. Post intervention, TRs will exhibit more relational communication with FDMs during&#xD;
      requests. H3b. Post intervention, TRs will spend more time attending to the emotional needs&#xD;
      of FDMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3c. Post intervention, TRs will spend more time discussing information identified as&#xD;
      important to informed decision making for tissue donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3d. Post intervention, there will be overall higher consent rates for donation to the&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
