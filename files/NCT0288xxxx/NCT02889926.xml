  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leg ulcers are defined as wounds lasting for more than a month. They would receive 0.2% of&#xD;
      the population of Western countries. In Europe, the cost per episode of leg ulcers is&#xD;
      estimated at 6650 euros (10 000 euros for a foot ulcer). The cost of treatment of wounds&#xD;
      would be 2 to 4% of the health budget. Infection is the most common complication of chronic&#xD;
      wounds: in most cases, it results in delayed healing, at most, it can result in amputation or&#xD;
      serious general complications Bacterial contamination of ulcers is constant. Over time for&#xD;
      over 25 years, various studies have shown about relatively identical results. The bacteria&#xD;
      are present in over 90% of the etiology of venous leg ulcers. These bacteria are divided into&#xD;
      four most common classes: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas.&#xD;
      The bacterial ecology changes over time. Indeed Staphylococcus aureus appears first, while&#xD;
      the Pseudomonas is associated with ulcers lasting for several months. Anaerobic more&#xD;
      difficult to find, are found in 30% of cases Cohabitation between leg ulcers and bacteria&#xD;
      often without clinical consequence: These are the stages of infection and colonization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infection is related to the proliferation of bacteria and their invasion into the skin,&#xD;
      by increasing their virulence (virulence genes acquisition). The increase in the number of&#xD;
      bacteria and the multiplicity of bacterial genera are one reason for the increased virulence&#xD;
      of bacteria. When bacteria proliferate, because the host defenses are inadequate, or because&#xD;
      there is a vascular disease which promotes the proliferation, clinical signs appear&#xD;

      RESEARCH PROJECT Vascular medicine at St Joseph, the management of chronic wounds concerns&#xD;
      80% of hospitalized patients, more than 1,000 patients per year. The reason for&#xD;
      hospitalization of these patients outside of revascularization gestures, often performing a&#xD;
      skin graft. The existence of an infection of the ulcer on arrival in the service is not a&#xD;
      cons-indication for transplant, but will delay it until the signs of infection are brought&#xD;
      under control. This scenario is common. The Medical Information department on six months,&#xD;
      noted over 100 patients coded &quot;leg ulcers&quot; principal diagnosis and &quot;soft tissue infections&quot;&#xD;
      secondary diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of this recruitment and the lack of recommendations for the management of&#xD;
      these patients justifies the completion of a clinical and microbiological work Until recent&#xD;
      months, at the request of Microbiology, bacteriological referred to biopsy was performed&#xD;
      first line when suspected of being infected ulcer. After reading the literature, and because&#xD;
      of the invasive nature of this gesture, the evaluation of biopsy compared to the swab in a&#xD;
      large patient population seems to necessary to the investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work is randomized blinded for microbiological and observational part for the&#xD;
      clinical part, on a prospective series of consecutive carriers of infected leg ulcer&#xD;
      patients, regardless of the etiology of leg ulcers, excluding dermohypodermitis complicating&#xD;
      acute bacterial leg ulcers, with several objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE Demonstrate the non-inferiority of the swab compared to biopsy in the&#xD;
      management of patients hospitalized for infected leg ulcer&#xD;
&#xD;
      two situations&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If graft Primary endpoint: time in days between the beginning of hospitalization and the&#xD;
           day the transplant can be performed. Indeed, the transplants are performed when the&#xD;
           doctor determines that the infection is under control&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the patient is not grafted:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: time between the beginning of hospitalization and the end of the ideal&#xD;
      hospitalization (when the clinician believes that the patient can get out)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES and CRITERIA healing rate of patients at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
      bacteriological agreement: between the swab and biopsy Comparing the interest of biopsy&#xD;
      compared to the swab: percentage of patients for whom the unblinding was necessary and where&#xD;
      the biopsy was more informative than the swab (different bacteria require special treatment)&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      levies failure rate when the sample is sterile while the ulcer is infected clinically. The&#xD;
      collection of demographic, etiological, nutritional profile, and the collection of various&#xD;
      local signs can provide indicators of response to the proposed strategy. This type of study&#xD;
      has never been done in the population of leg ulcers.&#xD;
