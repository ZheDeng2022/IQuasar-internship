    <textblock>
      It is estimated that the incidence of congenital heart disease varies between 0.5 and 1% of&#xD;
      live births, 5,000 new cases per year currently in France These are serious diseases that can&#xD;
      be life-threatening to more or less short term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advances in surgical techniques in recent years has improved the prognosis of these&#xD;
      patients in the first months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of surgery is, among other things, conditioned by a support per complex&#xD;
      operation, involving a multimodal intensive monitoring, and respiratory and hemodynamic&#xD;
      support techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These elements of surveillance, NIRS (Near-infrared spectroscopy) allows measurement of&#xD;
      non-invasive tissue saturation (rSO2) in cerebral and renal oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fundamental principle of NIRS based on an estimate of the percentage proportion of&#xD;
      cerebral oxy-hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A light source is emitted by NIRS and through body tissues to the brain where the light will&#xD;
      be absorbed and refracted depending on the tissue composition in oxy-hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refracted light will be analyzed by NIRS which in turn using software will help to determine&#xD;
      a percentage of oxyhemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal values of cerebral NIRS are between 50 and 80%.NIRS can be used according to this&#xD;
      principle to estimate cerebral tissue oxygenation but also for other tissues such as the&#xD;
      kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than the figure, those are changes NIRS compared to a baseline that will alert us to the&#xD;
      conditions of tissue oxygenation and allow us to identify hypoxia times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the value of the NIRS depends on 3 criteria: the tissue blood flow, the percentage&#xD;
      of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin percentage.&#xD;
