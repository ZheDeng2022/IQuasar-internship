  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients ≥ 3 years of age with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic pontine glioma will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. However, the primary objectives of this study are to 1) compare&#xD;
      overall survival, the time from randomization to death from any cause, for study subjects&#xD;
      3-21 years of age with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic pontine glioma who receive&#xD;
      Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) + radiation therapy vs. radiation therapy&#xD;
      alone and 2) describe the toxicity profile (all subjects) for Antineoplaston therapy +&#xD;
      radiation therapy vs. radiation therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to compare progression-free survival for study subjects 3-21 years&#xD;
      of age with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic pontine glioma treated with Antineoplaston&#xD;
      therapy + radiation therapy vs. radiation therapy alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized Phase 3 protocol study of Antineoplaston therapy + radiation therapy vs.&#xD;
      radiation therapy alone in subjects ≥ 3 years of age with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic&#xD;
      pontine glioma. In those subjects randomized to Antineoplaston therapy + radiation therapy,&#xD;
      Antineoplaston therapy is administered for 104 weeks while radiation therapy commences on day&#xD;
      one of Antineoplaston therapy and continues for 6 weeks. Subjects continue on Antineoplaston&#xD;
      therapy if an objective response or stable disease is achieved during therapy and are&#xD;
      maintained on Antineoplaston therapy to the end of the protocol study unless they develop&#xD;
      progressive disease. Subjects randomized to radiation therapy alone receive 6 weeks of&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives are to compare the following in the two treatment arms: 1) overall&#xD;
      survival for study subjects ≥ 21 years of age; 2) progression-free survival for subjects ≥ 21&#xD;
      years of age; 3) objective response, complete response, partial response, and progressive&#xD;
      disease rates, based on the enhancing portion of the tumor, for all subjects, using&#xD;
      bidimentional measurement of tumor; 4) objective response, complete response, partial&#xD;
      response, and progressive disease rates, for all subjects with non-enhancing tumors, using&#xD;
      unidimentional measurement of tumor; and 5) objective response, complete response, partial&#xD;
      response, and progressive disease rates, based on the enhancing + non-enhancing portions of&#xD;
      the tumor, for all subjects, using unidimentional measurement of tumor.&#xD;

    <description>The Kaplan-Meier nonparametric method is used to evaluate overall survival in the two therapy groups. Survival difference is evaluated using a log-rank test, which compares the two therapy groups. A Cox proportional hazards model is used as a supportive analysis to assess the magnitude of difference between the two therapy groups. The median survival rate in the two therapy groups (and 95% confidence intervals) is evaluated. Hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval are estimated.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with Diffuse, Intrinsic Pontine Glioma as defined by the following criteria&#xD;
             are eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A characteristic MRI appearance, including variable contrast enhancement after&#xD;
                  gadolinium administration, diffuse T2/FLAIR signal, and involvement of more than&#xD;
                  50% of the pons.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Confirmation of anaplastic glioma (i.e., oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma,&#xD;
                  oligoastrocytoma) or GBM histology if there is less than 50% involvement of the&#xD;
                  pons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening evaluation requires a MRI performed within 14 days prior to the start of ANP&#xD;
             therapy. Study subjects must be on a fixed dose of steroids for at least five days&#xD;
             prior to the screening MRI. If the steroid dose is changed between the date of imaging&#xD;
             and the start of treatment, a new baseline MRI is required. All MRIs must be performed&#xD;
             at an accredited radiology center. All MRIs should include at a minimum: T1-weighted&#xD;
             images pre/post gadolinium administration, fluid attenuated inversion recovery&#xD;
             (FLAIR), and T-2 weighted images.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects 3-21 years of age must have a clinical history of disease of less than 6&#xD;
             months and at least two of the following clinical findings: cranial nerve deficit,&#xD;
             long tract signs (i.e. hemiparesis) and ataxia are eligible. Subjects &gt; 21 years of&#xD;
             age do not need to meet these criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be ≥ 3 years of age. RT is not recommended for subjects less than 3&#xD;
             years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects ≤ 16 years of age with a Lansky performance status of &gt; 40 are eligible.&#xD;
             Subjects &gt; 16 years of age with a Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 40 are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with organ and marrow function (as defined below) are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes &gt; 2000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,000/ mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum Na+ ≤ 150 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum K+ ≤ 5.5 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times institutional upper limit&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt;50,000/ mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT) / ALT (SGPT) &lt;5 times institutional upper limit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the recommended therapeutic dose, the effects of ANP therapy on the developing&#xD;
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential who agree&#xD;
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to protocol study entry and for the duration of the protocol study&#xD;
             are eligible. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this protocol study, she will inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, parents, and/or guardians who are able to understand a written informed&#xD;
             consent document, and are willing to sign it, are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No type of prior therapy, including other investigational agents, is allowable. A&#xD;
             prior diagnostic biopsy or surgical shunt for hydrocephalus is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with disseminated disease, multicentric tumors, leptomeningeal disease, or&#xD;
             the history of retrotumoral bleeding are not eligible. The screening / baseline MRI&#xD;
             includes the spinal cord to rule out leptomeningeal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a known history of ganglioglioma are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a current diagnosis or family history of neurofibromatosis I or II are&#xD;
             not eligible. - Subjects with a current diagnosis or family history of&#xD;
             neurofibromatosis are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled hypertension despite maximal medical&#xD;
             management (three supine blood pressure measurements ≥ 150/99 taken at least one hour&#xD;
             apart) or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             protocol study requirements are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of New York Heart Association Class II congestive heart&#xD;
             failure are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are not eligible because the teratogenic and abortifacient effects of&#xD;
             ANP therapy in humans are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to the mother receiving ANP therapy,&#xD;
             breastfeeding is discontinued if the mother receives ANP therapy.&#xD;
