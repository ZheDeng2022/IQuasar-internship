    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well nivolumab with or without ipilimumab works in&#xD;
      treating patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor that has spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body or cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab, interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the response rate of nivolumab alone and in combination with ipilimumab in&#xD;
      subjects with metastatic or locally advanced/unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumor&#xD;
      (GIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Ascertain the response rate of nivolumab alone and in combination of ipilimumab in&#xD;
      subjects with metastatic or locally advanced/unresectable GIST by Choi criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the progression-free survival (PFS). III. Ascertain the clinical benefit rate (CBR&#xD;
      = complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] and stable disease [SD]) of nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab in refractory/unresectable GIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore the safety of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab and ipilimumab in this&#xD;
      population assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare RR and CBR in patients whose tumors are programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)&#xD;
      positive (+) and PD-L1 negative (-) at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. In the patients who are PD-L1 positive, compare RR and CBR in patients with 1% and 5%&#xD;
      tumor membrane staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the baseline mutational load of patients at the start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the response to treatment based on the baseline mutation load and baseline GIST&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the response rate based on GIST mutational status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 14 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and ipilimumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes every 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 14 days for up to 2 years in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
