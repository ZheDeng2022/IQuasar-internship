  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Until recently, at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH), epidural analgesia for labor pain was&#xD;
      delivered with a pump that could only provide continuous infusion of the freezing medication&#xD;
      in combination of pushes of medication activated by the patient, a technique called patient&#xD;
      controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). In the last decade or so, the literature has suggested&#xD;
      that this continuous infusion of medication is not as effective as previously thought, and&#xD;
      suggested that instead of continuous infusion we should use intermittent programmed pushes.&#xD;
      The investigators now have devices that are able to do that. Programmed intermittent epidural&#xD;
      bolus (PIEB) is a new technological advance based on the concept that boluses of freezing&#xD;
      medication in the epidural space are superior to continuous epidural infusion (CEI). Recently&#xD;
      the epidural pumps at MSH were reprogrammed to deliver bolus of medication at regular&#xD;
      intervals (PIEB), in addition to what the patient can deliver herself (PCEA). Studies have&#xD;
      shown that delivering analgesia in this manner prolong the duration of analgesia, reduce&#xD;
      motor block, lower the incidence of breakthrough pain, improve maternal satisfaction and&#xD;
      decrease local anesthetic consumption. The investigators have recently concluded a study at&#xD;
      MSH using PIEB where excellent results were observed. However, in that study, some patients&#xD;
      exhibited higher than necessary sensory blocks. The investigators believe that the technique&#xD;
      can be optimized by using the same interval of the previous study with smaller volumes of the&#xD;
      intermittent boluses. Optimizing the technique, may allow the investigators to be able to&#xD;
      reduce even further the amount of medication used by each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that there is an optimal volume of the PIEB bolus at a fixed&#xD;
      interval of 40 minutes of 0.0625% bupivacaine plus fentanyl 2mcg/ml that will provide 90% of&#xD;
      women the necessary drug requirements during first stage of labor (EV90), thus avoiding&#xD;
      breakthrough pain and need for PCEA or physician intervention. We hypothesize that this&#xD;
      effective volume will be between 7 and 12 mL (6.6 mg/hr to 11.3 mg/hr of bupivacaine).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies involving programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB) to date have provided an&#xD;
      analgesic regimen that delivered an amount of local anesthetic that was below the patient's&#xD;
      requirement per hour, as the studies were done in the context of an association with patient&#xD;
      controlled epidural anesthesia (PCEA) as a rescue technique. As a result, PCEA requests were&#xD;
      frequent and therefore these studies have not been able to truly understand the pharmacology&#xD;
      of the bolus technique in the PIEB regimen, as the PCEA utilized by patients added an extra&#xD;
      component to the regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Mount Sinai Hospital, PIEB devices have been recently introduced. Currently our standard&#xD;
      epidural mixture is bupivacaine 0.0625% with fentanyl 2mcg/ml. Based on previous research&#xD;
      done by the investigators, the current epidural regimen consists of 10 ml PIEB at 40 minute&#xD;
      intervals, with PCEA boluses of 5 ml and a lock out interval of 10 minutes, for a maximum of&#xD;
      20 ml of the epidural mixture per hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will vary the volume of the bolus (7-12 mL) of bupivacaine&#xD;
      0.0625% with fentanyl 2mcg/ml. PCEA bolus of 5mL of the same solution will also be available.&#xD;
      The goal is to establish the ideal PIEB volume that will be effective for our patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
