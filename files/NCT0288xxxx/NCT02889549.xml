  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor is an oral, reversibly-binding, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist used&#xD;
      clinically for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes (ACS). Guideline recommendations on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy have been&#xD;
      formulated that ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus aspirin in preference to clopidogrel 75mg&#xD;
      daily plus aspirin for ACS patients. However, few East Asian patients have been included in&#xD;
      these trials to assess the use of these drugs. In addition, a growing body of data supported&#xD;
      that East Asian might have different adverse event profiles (thrombophilia and bleeding) and&#xD;
      &quot;therapeutic window&quot; compared with white subjects. But it is still not clear whether a low&#xD;
      dose of ticagrelor is superior to clopidogrel in diabetic patients with stable coronary&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies found that antiplatelet drugs might have anti-inflammatory effects and protect&#xD;
      endothelial function. ACS patients treated by ticagrelor had a significantly higher increase&#xD;
      in levels of circulating progenitor cells compared to those treated by clopidogrel,&#xD;
      suggesting a benefit on endothelial regeneration that may participate in the pleiotropic&#xD;
      property of the drug. This may prompt the regression of blood vessels and the endothelium&#xD;
      stability. But it is not very clear that the effect of low-dose ticagrelor on vascular&#xD;
      endothelial function in diabetic patients with stable coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators performed this randomized, single-blind clinical trial to&#xD;
      observe the effects of different doses of ticagrelor and standard-dose clopidogrel on&#xD;
      platelet aggregation and endothelial function in diabetic patients with stable coronary&#xD;
      artery disease.&#xD;

      Ticagrelor is an oral, reversibly-binding, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist used&#xD;
      clinically for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes (ACS). Guideline recommendations on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy have been&#xD;
      formulated that ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus aspirin in preference to clopidogrel 75mg&#xD;
      daily plus aspirin for ACS patients. However, few East Asian patients have been included in&#xD;
      these trials to assess the use of these drugs. In addition, a growing body of data supported&#xD;
      that East Asian might have different adverse event profiles (thrombophilia and bleeding) and&#xD;
      &quot;therapeutic window&quot; compared with white subjects. In Korea and Japan, it has been recently&#xD;
      reported that low doses of ticagrelor might have a more potent inhibition of platelet&#xD;
      aggregation than clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) in healthy subjects and patients with stable&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, respectively. But it is still not clear whether a low dose of&#xD;
      ticagrelor is superior to clopidogrel in diabetic patients with stable coronary disease. A&#xD;
      recent study on pharmacokinetics and tolerability of ticagrelor has found that maximum plasma&#xD;
      concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of ticagrelor (90 mg twice&#xD;
      daily) and its active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) tended to be approximately 40% higher in&#xD;
      healthy Chinese volunteers compared with Caucasian subjects. This data also suggested that a&#xD;
      low dose of ticagrelor might be more appropriate for Chinese patients with coronary heart&#xD;
      disease. In view of a large diurnal variation with a single daily dose, a lower dose twice&#xD;
      daily may be a better choice for Chinese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies found that antiplatelet drugs might have anti-inflammatory effects and protect&#xD;
      endothelial function. ACS patients treated by ticagrelor had a significantly higher increase&#xD;
      in levels of circulating progenitor cells compared to those treated by clopidogrel,&#xD;
      suggesting a benefit on endothelial regeneration that may participate in the pleiotropic&#xD;
      property of the drug. This may prompt the regression of blood vessels and the endothelium&#xD;
      stability. But it is not very clear that the effect of low-dose ticagrelor on vascular&#xD;
      endothelial function in diabetic patients with stable coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators performed this randomized, single-blind clinical trial to&#xD;
      observe the effects of different doses of ticagrelor and standard-dose clopidogrel on&#xD;
      platelet aggregation and endothelial function in diabetic patients with stable coronary&#xD;
      artery disease.&#xD;
