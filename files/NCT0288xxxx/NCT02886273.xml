      Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major cause of mortality in industrialized countries and&#xD;
      represents a major health issue. The survival rate after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest&#xD;
      (OHCA) is only 10-15%, regardless of first recorded rhythm. Prior heart disease is a major&#xD;
      risk factor for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), and coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most&#xD;
      common underlying cause. A better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms occurring&#xD;
      during cardiac arrest (CA), earlier diagnosis of underlying cause as well as identification&#xD;
      of risk factors related to CA may improve patient treatment and increase survival. In our&#xD;
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)-study, we intend to investigate whether biomarkers,&#xD;
      such as copeptin, hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP in addition to clinical evaluation may improve risk&#xD;
      stratification and supply information related to pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we intend to gather additional pathophysiological information related to&#xD;
      coagulation activation in CA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), as intravascular&#xD;
      thrombosis may impair microcirculation and reduce end-organ blood flow which is associated&#xD;
      with a poor prognosis. We intend to study coagulation activation during and immediately after&#xD;
      SCA with regard to outcome, and assess the contribution of the intrinsic system, measured&#xD;
      together with that of the extrinsic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low levels of n-3 fatty acids (FA) are reported as a risk factor for SCD. Red blood cell&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may serve as a useful surrogate of&#xD;
      cardiac omega-3 fatty acid status. The exact mechanism by which FAs might protect against&#xD;
      serious cardiac arrhythmias is not known, but they are expected to exert a membrane&#xD;
      stabilizing effect during an ischemic episode. In our study we intend to evaluate the&#xD;
      association between ventricular fibrillation (VF) and the content of EPA and DHA in red blood&#xD;
      cells. Furthermore, as vitamin D is associated with n-3 FAs in the diet, we also aim at&#xD;
      investigating the association between 25-hydroxy (OH)-vitamin D and VF.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sudden cardiac death (SCD), also termed sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), accounts for&#xD;
      approximately 15 percent of the total mortality in industrialized countries. In Europe, the&#xD;
      incidence of out-of-hospital Emergency Medical Services (EMS) attended sudden cardiac arrest&#xD;
      (SCA) is estimated to 81.6/100 000 person-years, 52.5 % of which is presumed to have a&#xD;
      cardiac cause [1]. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common underlying heart disease&#xD;
      associated with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) [2]. SCD is the initial presentation of&#xD;
      CAD in 15 percent of CAD-patients [3]. Furthermore, it is also the most frequent mechanism of&#xD;
      death in patients with known CAD, accounting for 40-50 percent of CAD-mortality [4]. Compared&#xD;
      to healthy subjects the incidence of SCD is six- to tenfold higher in the presence of&#xD;
      clinically recognized heart disease [5], and cardiomyopathies represents the second largest&#xD;
      cause of SCD [6]. Despite early advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) provided by the&#xD;
      EMS the mortality rate remains high [1]. Due to the dramatic consequence of SCA,&#xD;
      understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms and early identification of etiology is&#xD;
      essential to improve outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCA due to VF may be the presenting symptom of acute myocardial ischemia or may be a&#xD;
      consequence of scarring due to a previous myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiac troponin (c-Tn)&#xD;
      is the most commonly used biomarker for diagnosing an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [7].&#xD;
      Although earlier detection of AMI may be obtained by the introduction of high sensitivity&#xD;
      (hs)-cTn assays, there still remains a troponin-blind period very early after symptom onset&#xD;
      [8, 9], with the need for serial blood sampling to diagnose or exclude an AMI [7, 9].&#xD;
      Furthermore, there are challenges related to the specificity of elevated levels of hs-cTn&#xD;
      [10, 11]. Therefore, measurement of hs-cTn in a single blood draw in the ambulance or at&#xD;
      admission may not provide sufficient information for the diagnosis of AMI among patients with&#xD;
      OHCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lately, several studies have demonstrated an incremental diagnostic value of copeptin when&#xD;
      added to conventional cTn or hs-cTn for early detection of AMI [12, 13]. Copeptin levels peak&#xD;
      early (0-1 h) after symptom onset and are already increased at the time of first medical&#xD;
      contact in the ambulance for patients with MI [8]. Copeptin used in combination with hs-cTn&#xD;
      may therefore improve the diagnosis of AMI in very early presenters, and help differentiating&#xD;
      the underlying cause of SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copeptin has also been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of adverse events&#xD;
      following MI [14] and is shown to be associated with outcome after OHCA [15, 16]. Less is&#xD;
      known about the prognostic value of troponins in patients experiencing a cardiac arrest (CA).&#xD;
      Higher values of hs-cTnT are seen in one-year non-survivors as compared to survivors of OHCA,&#xD;
      although not shown to be an independent predictor of 12-months survival [10]. In our study,&#xD;
      the objective will be to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of hs-cTnT and&#xD;
      copeptin in SCA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with heart failure are at increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. B-type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) have been demonstrated to be&#xD;
      useful diagnostic tools to rule out both chronic and acute heart failure [17]. Little is&#xD;
      known about the natural course of natriuretic peptides during a SCA event, but BNP is&#xD;
      demonstrated to be an independent predictor of long-term mortality [18], as well as survival&#xD;
      to hospital discharge after OHCA of cardiac origin [19]. There is also a well-documented&#xD;
      association between BNP or NT-proBNP and the short- and long-term risk of death in patients&#xD;
      with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [20, 21]. In our study, we intend to investigate the&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic utility of NT-proBNP sampled during or immediately after OHCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall survival rate after OHCA is low. Even in successfully resuscitated patients&#xD;
      admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), the prognosis remains poor. Former studies have&#xD;
      shown a marked activation of blood coagulation, with a concomitant inadequate activation of&#xD;
      the endogenous fibrinolytic system, in resuscitated OHCA-patients [22-25]. Intravascular&#xD;
      clotting and &quot;no reflow&quot; in the microvasculature represent a barrier to successful end-organ&#xD;
      perfusion and may influence the outcome in cardiac arrest (CA) patients [26]. Understanding&#xD;
      the pathophysiological mechanisms of CA is important to guide management and improve outcome.&#xD;
      Plasma thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes, fibrin monomers (FM) and D-dimer are used as&#xD;
      specific markers of activated blood coagulation. Previous studies have shown markedly&#xD;
      increased TAT-levels in patients with nontraumatic OHCA [22, 23]. Admission TAT is also shown&#xD;
      to be a useful prognostic marker in resuscitated OHCA patients and is independently&#xD;
      associated with survival after resuscitation from CA [24]. D-dimer levels are found to&#xD;
      increase after CA and CPR [22, 27]. Accordingly, Adrie et al. [28] demonstrated high&#xD;
      admission levels of D-dimer in all OHCA patients. Furthermore Szymanski et al. [29] reported&#xD;
      higher D-dimer concentrations on admission to be a strong and independent predictor of&#xD;
      mortality in OHCA patients. In our study, we intend to study the activation of blood&#xD;
      coagulation, including both the extrinsic- and the intrinsic coagulation pathways, during and&#xD;
      immediately after SCA with regard to outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most interventions to date do not directly affect the transient pathophysiologic event&#xD;
      initializing potentially fatal arrhythmias. Instead, they attempt to alter and prevent&#xD;
      underlying disease like CAD. Animal studies have shown that fish oils are protective against&#xD;
      ischemia-induced VF [30]. Support for these data comes from the Physicians' Health Study&#xD;
      [31], which is a prospective study of 20 551 men aged 40 to 84, free of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease at baseline, with a follow-up period of 11 years. As compared to consumption of fish&#xD;
      less than once a month, fish intake at least once per week was associated with a reduced risk&#xD;
      of SCD (RR 0.48). In the same study there was no reduction in the risk of total myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, non-sudden cardiac death or total cardiovascular mortality, and the protective&#xD;
      effect of fish was suggested to be due to a reduction in fatal ventricular arrhythmias. It&#xD;
      has been hypothesized that the lower risk of SCD with higher fish intake may be related to&#xD;
      the long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) EPA and DHA found in fish. Consistent&#xD;
      with this hypothesis are the observations from the physicians' Health Study [31] that the&#xD;
      risk of SCD was significantly lower in subjects with blood n-3 FA levels in the highest as&#xD;
      compared to the lowest quartile. The same potential effect of fish oils to protect against&#xD;
      SCD was illustrated in the randomized, open-controlled GISSI-prevention study [32]. Patients&#xD;
      with a recent myocardial infarction receiving n-3 FAs supplements had a significant lower&#xD;
      incidence in the combined endpoint of death plus nonfatal infarction and nonfatal stroke at&#xD;
      42 months (12.6 versus 13.9%). After adjustment for risk factors, all of the observed benefit&#xD;
      was due to a 20 % reduction in the risk of death, mostly due to reduction in SCD. However, a&#xD;
      study of 200 patients secured with an ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) following&#xD;
      an episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or VF, has not shown a reduction in the recurrence&#xD;
      of these arrhythmias after supplementation with EPA/DHA. In that study there was actually a&#xD;
      trend toward a higher incidence of VT/VF in patients randomized to EPA/ DHA substitution&#xD;
      [33]. In that setting the underlying mechanism for the generation of VF might, however, not&#xD;
      be ischemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanism by which FAs might protect against serious cardiac arrhythmias is not&#xD;
      known. They are important constituents of cell membranes and may affect several&#xD;
      electrophysiologic properties, such as resting potential, action potential, repolarization&#xD;
      and refractory period. Alterations in cellular calcium concentration can contribute&#xD;
      significantly to changes in both impulse generation and impulse conduction in myocardial&#xD;
      cells. Incorporation of n-3 fatty acids in the cellular membrane is shown to affect membrane&#xD;
      fluidity which in turn may have an influence on calcium entry or removal. An alternative&#xD;
      mechanism may be changes effected by n-3 FAs on myocardial production of eicosanoids. In&#xD;
      particular the inhibition of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production is likely to be of significant&#xD;
      pathophysiological benefit, since TXA2 is shown to be implicated in myocardial ischemia and&#xD;
      arrhythmogenesis [34].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study by William S. Harris et al. [35] has shown that levels of EPA/ DHA in cell&#xD;
      membranes of red blood cells (RBC EPA/ DHA) highly correlate with the cardiac EPA/ DHA level.&#xD;
      The RBC response to supplementation was also very similar to that observed in the heart.&#xD;
      Therefore RBC EPA+ DHA may serve as a useful surrogate of cardiac omega-3 fatty acid status.&#xD;
      The investigators expect n-3 FAs to exert a membrane stabilizing effect during an ischemic&#xD;
      episode, and hypothesize that patients suffering VF during the initial phase of their first&#xD;
      AMI presentation have lower levels of RBC EPA/ DHA than matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last years vitamin D is another dietary supplement found to be associated with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. This fat-soluble vitamin, primarily derived from sun-exposure and&#xD;
      fatty fish, has been demonstrated to influence cardiac contractility and myocardial calcium&#xD;
      homeostasis [36], and insufficiency of this vitamin may have deleterious effects on cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic functions as evaluated by heart rate turbulence and heart rate variability [37]. In&#xD;
      prospective studies, severe vitamin D deficiency has been strongly associated with total&#xD;
      mortality, cardiovascular events and SCD [38-42]. In one study of 3299 patients who were&#xD;
      routinely referred to coronary angiography, the authors demonstrated hazard ratios for death&#xD;
      due to heart failure and for SCD of 2.84 (1.20-6.74) and 5.05 (2.13-11.97), respectively,&#xD;
      when comparing patients with severe vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D &lt;25 nmol/liter)] with&#xD;
      persons in the optimal range [25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/liter] [43]. Demonstrated effects on&#xD;
      electrophysiology,contractility, and cardiac structure suggest that vitamin D deficiency&#xD;
      might actually be a causal factor for development of cardiac diseases. The pronounced effect&#xD;
      on SCD found in several studies might be an indication of a possible protective effect of&#xD;
      high vitamin D-levels against ventricular arrhythmias. This is, however, not well studied and&#xD;
      the optimal cut-off-value for protection is not well defined. Therefore, a comparison of the&#xD;
      25-OH-vitamin D levels between different OHCA categories of patients, with and without an&#xD;
      acute coronary event, may be appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using the statistical package SPSS (Statistical&#xD;
      Package for the Social Sciences). A statistically significant level of p &lt; 0.05 will be&#xD;
      applied for all tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPA/ DHA and vitamin D in the different clinical patient categories will be compared to&#xD;
      controls collected from the RACS (Risk markers in the Acute Coronary Syndromes) database&#xD;
      (NCT00521976).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and later&#xD;
      revisions and accepted by the Regional Board of Research Ethics as well as the Norwegian&#xD;
      Health Authorities. Analytic data will be related to patient number and not to patient&#xD;
      identity. According to Norwegian regulations, the family of non-survivors will be informed by&#xD;
      the attending physician and the inclusion of patients needs to be documented in the hospital&#xD;
      records. The family of the deceased is entitled to object to the use of any biological&#xD;
      samples for research purposes. Patients regaining consciousness and mental capability during&#xD;
      their hospital stay will be asked personally for a written informed consent. For the&#xD;
      remaining survivors the next of kin will be asked for permission on behalf of the patient. If&#xD;
      either the patient or the family refuses participation, blood samples already collected at&#xD;
      resuscitation and admission will be destroyed.&#xD;
