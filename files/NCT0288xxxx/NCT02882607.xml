      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of an innovative, culturally relevant,&#xD;
      community-based peer group intervention to increase young rural Malawian women's&#xD;
      preconception behaviors to optimize their reproductive health. The study uses a longitudinal,&#xD;
      two group (two-arm) design with a delayed control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining optimal reproductive health in the context of high HIV prevalence is a serious&#xD;
      dilemma facing young women in Malawi and other high HIV prevalence countries. Optimal&#xD;
      reproductive health requires practicing preconception behaviors to promote overall health&#xD;
      including avoiding HIV infection. These healthy preconception behaviors include: practicing&#xD;
      safer sex (abstaining or using condoms) to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs),&#xD;
      including HIV infection; obtaining treatment for STIs; maintaining good health habits such as&#xD;
      diet, exercise and avoiding substance use; using an effective family planning method to&#xD;
      prevent unintended pregnancy; and having an HIV test periodically and with the partner when&#xD;
      conception is intended. However the Malawi Demographic and Health Survey provides evidence&#xD;
      that few women ages 15-20 in Malawi currently practice these healthy preconception behaviors.&#xD;
      Currently, no programs in Malawi offer an integrated approach to optimal reproductive health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fill this gap, this study developed an innovative, culturally relevant, community-based&#xD;
      peer group intervention to increase young rural Malawian women's preconception behaviors to&#xD;
      optimize their reproductive health. The intervention is called Mzanga Samala Moyo Wako&#xD;
      ([Mzanga] Sharing Responsibility for Pregnancy Planning and HIV Prevention). Mzanga builds on&#xD;
      the investigators' previous research in Malawi, which tested a culturally relevant HIV&#xD;
      prevention peer group intervention that changed HIV prevention-related knowledge, attitudes,&#xD;
      and safer sex behaviors for rural adults and adolescents. This study integrated that prior&#xD;
      HIV prevention content with new content on maintaining health, family planning, and&#xD;
      preconception HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test Mzanga's efficacy using a longitudinal, two group (two&#xD;
      arm) design: intervention group and delayed control group. Because Mzanga is expected to&#xD;
      diffuse widely, we randomize at the community rather than the individual level. Eighteen&#xD;
      geographically separate rural communities stratified by size and distance from the main paved&#xD;
      road and then randomly assigned to Mzanga or the delayed control condition. We implement&#xD;
      Mzanga in 9 waves. A final sample of 345 per group after attrition provides adequate power&#xD;
      (80%) to detect small-to-medium effects. After baseline data collection, the Mzanga group&#xD;
      receives the eight-session intervention. Outcomes are measured at 9 months post-baseline (6&#xD;
      months post-intervention), followed by a booster session for the Mzanga group, and final&#xD;
      evaluation at 15 months post-baseline. After the 15-month data collection, Mzanga is offered&#xD;
      to the delayed control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims and hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To test the efficacy of the Mzanga intervention for improving reproductive health&#xD;
      outcome mediating and behavioral variables for Malawian rural young women at 9 and 15 months&#xD;
      post-baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1.Controlling for baseline differences and group effects, compared to the delayed control&#xD;
      group, the intervention group will show more positive mediating and behavioral outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Practice safer sex,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtain prompt treatment for STI symptoms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maintain good health habits (diet, exercise, substance use);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Use an effective family planning method except when pregnancy is intended;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Have an HIV test periodically, with partner when conception is intended; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. More positive scores for the mediating variables of knowledge, attitudes, perceived&#xD;
           norms, self-efficacy, and intentions for each of these behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To test a theoretical model of the mechanisms through which the Mzanga intervention&#xD;
      changes preconception health behaviors of young women in rural Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2. Mzanga's effects on healthy preconception behaviors (a-e above) will be mediated by&#xD;
      knowledge, attitudes, perceived norms, self-efficacy, and intention scores.&#xD;
