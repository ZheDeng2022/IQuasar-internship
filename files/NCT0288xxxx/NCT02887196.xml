      Twenty-five women will be followed through their breast cancer treatment. The women will be&#xD;
      asked to provide their opinions and desires for lifestyle intervention at different times&#xD;
      throughout treatment. In addition, basic clinical data will be collected . The primary goal&#xD;
      of this pilot study is to investigate the physical and behavioral changes that occur in&#xD;
      patients receiving treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;

      In this cross sectional, longitudinal, observational study, 25 women will be followed through&#xD;
      their treatment for stage I-III breast cancer. The women will be asked to provide their&#xD;
      opinions and desires for lifestyle intervention at four timepoints throughout treatment. In&#xD;
      addition to qualitative data, basic clinical data will be collected (anthropometrics, vital&#xD;
      signs, dietary intake, and physical activity). The primary goal of this pilot study is to&#xD;
      investigate the anthropometric and behavioral changes that occur in patients undergoing&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To better understand patients' attitudes toward and perceived barriers to nutrition&#xD;
      and physical activity interventions during neoplastic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients' reported attitudes, motivation, and perceived barriers will change&#xD;
      throughout treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To measure the physical and metabolic changes that occur throughout neoplastic&#xD;
      treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Over 50% of the participants will gain body weight during treatment and metabolic&#xD;
      parameters will trend with body weight change.&#xD;
