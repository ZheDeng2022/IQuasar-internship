    <textblock>
      The purpose of this mixed methods study is to evaluate the implementation of an adapted Safe&#xD;
      Childbirth Checklist in a rural hospital in Chiapas, Mexico. The study aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the implementation of the adapted Safe Childbirth Checklist using quality of&#xD;
           care indicators and the perspectives of providers and patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine changes in the perceptions of disrespectful and respectful practices around&#xD;
           childbirth among providers before and after a quality improvement program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To understand how postpartum women and their male partners perceive the care they&#xD;
           received at the hospitals in Ángel Albino Corzo and Revolución with regard to&#xD;
           disrespectful and respectful practices, and how, if at all, these experiences compare&#xD;
           with prior birth experiences in other settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine trends in proportion of facility-based births in the catchment area of the&#xD;
           hospital after the implementation of the adapted Safe Childbirth Checklist&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a mixed methods convergent intervention study design. Quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      data will be collected and integrated to answer the specific aims above. There are 3 groups&#xD;
      of people who will be approached to participate in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obstetric providers at the maternity center in Revolución (approximately 7-15 people)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pregnant women who come to the maternity center or hospitals in Ángel Albino Corzo or&#xD;
           Revolución to give birth from September 2016 - June 2017 (approximately 300 women, age&#xD;
           &gt;15 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postpartum women who delivered in the maternity center or hospitals after September 2016&#xD;
           (approximately 30-40 women, age &gt;15 years old) and their male partners (approximately&#xD;
           30-40 men, age &gt;15 years old) who live in Partners In Health-affiliated communities&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality improvement training program will center on coaching around the adapted Safe&#xD;
      Childbirth Checklist. This document contains reminders for evidence-based practices during&#xD;
      childbirth, and it has been adapted to the context in Mexico. Only standard of care practices&#xD;
      will be taught and employed at the maternity center. The quality improvement program has no&#xD;
      additional intervention that would change diagnoses or management during peripartum care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to subjects are minimized by ensuring privacy in all research encounters. Additionally,&#xD;
      research staff will not provide any clinical care to subjects, thereby dissociating&#xD;
      participation in research from receiving clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no anticipated harms to the participants of this study that would compromise their&#xD;
      safety because our quality improvement program does not introduce a new diagnostic test or&#xD;
      treatment modality. The only foreseeable risk is emotional distress from discussing a&#xD;
      potentially traumatic birth experience, which could occur with both healthcare providers and&#xD;
      patients. The research team will undergo sensitization training in identifying signs of&#xD;
      distress that may arise during the survey, interview, or focus group. They will be instructed&#xD;
      to provide the appropriate mental health referrals if necessary. Partners In Health has a&#xD;
      growing mental health program that can provide appropriate clinical accompaniment if&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are restricting the study specifically to women who have an opportunity to&#xD;
      benefit from the results of the study because they live in the catchment area of the&#xD;
      maternity center and may seek childbirth care there in the future. The investigators are only&#xD;
      including the providers at a single maternity center because that is the facility where&#xD;
      Partners In Health has an affiliation and leads the quality improvement training program.&#xD;
      Participants who do not stand to benefit from the results due to geographic or political&#xD;
      barriers will not be included. All research will be conducted in Spanish. Non-Spanish&#xD;
      speaking women are rare in this area, and will have to be excluded from the study due to the&#xD;
      lack of trained interpreters in indigenous languages in the area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food will be provided at all focus groups. Postpartum women and their partners who consent to&#xD;
      participate in interviews will receive a small token of appreciation, such as a bag of beans,&#xD;
      bag of rice, or a bottle of cooking oil. These remunerations are thought to be appropriate&#xD;
      for the cultural setting and are not large enough to be coercive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consents will be done by trained research staff, not by clinical staff, to avoid&#xD;
      coercion. The obstetric providers will be asked to provide written consent, as they are&#xD;
      literate. The postpartum women and their partners will provide verbal consent, as the&#xD;
      majority are illiterate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adapted Safe Childbirth Checklist and discharge survey will be programmed into a mobile&#xD;
      application on CommCare, which provides a secure cloud for data capture. Only research staff&#xD;
      responsible for direct data analysis will have access to this secure data cloud.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus groups and interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed in Spanish, and&#xD;
      translated into English. All personally identifiable information will be removed. These files&#xD;
      will be saved on an encrypted computer and only shared with research members through secure&#xD;
      firewalls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be one master file that lists the participants names and unique study ID number,&#xD;
      so that responses can be linked longitudinally for providers and patients. Only the principal&#xD;
      and lead investigators will have access to this file, which will be kept on an encrypted&#xD;
      computer and deleted at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Partners In Health team manager will provide ongoing supervision of the trained study staff&#xD;
      and will be available to ensure appropriate data collection and trouble-shoot any questions&#xD;
      or difficulties. The PI, funders, and site directors will review any adverse events to&#xD;
      address potential areas of improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No survey or focus group or interview transcript will contain personally identifiable&#xD;
      information. The name of the participant and her community of residence will be kept in a&#xD;
      secure Excel file linked to a unique study ID. The study ID will be used on all research&#xD;
      related materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be saved on encrypted computers, and files will only be shared behind a secure&#xD;
      firewall. Only investigators who are directly involved in data collection and analysis will&#xD;
      have access to these files.&#xD;
