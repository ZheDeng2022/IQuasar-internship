  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent improvements in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence, mortality, stage at diagnosis, and&#xD;
      survival in the general U.S. population have been attributed to routine screening with prompt&#xD;
      removal of polyps, early detection, and timely and appropriate treatment. American&#xD;
      Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have not experienced improvements in CRC related outcomes and&#xD;
      are significantly less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to receive recommended CRC screening.&#xD;
      The purpose of this three-arm randomized controlled trial is to determine the efficacy of&#xD;
      interventions designed to enhance CRC screening. The study also uses mixed methods to&#xD;
      finalize the intervention and to determine promoters and barriers of screening. The study&#xD;
      also conducts process evaluation to determine cost-effectiveness of the interventions,&#xD;
      fidelity of study implementation, and to develop plans to sustain and scale-up the&#xD;
      intervention model. The study will determine the efficacy of serially implemented&#xD;
      interventions of graded intensity for increasing CRC screening using the fecal immunochemical&#xD;
      test (FIT) in accordance to recommended guidelines among average risk American Indians (AIs)&#xD;
      aged 50-75 residing on reservations in rural Southwestern U.S. Serial implementation refers&#xD;
      to offering routine screening, irrespective of response to an earlier invitation, in&#xD;
      concordance with guidelines which recommend annual FIT testing between ages 50-75. The FIT is&#xD;
      most appropriate because it is an approved, high sensitivity fecal occult blood test and is&#xD;
      available at Indian Health Service (IHS) and tribal health facilities where resources to&#xD;
      provide screening colonoscopy are limited. The study is a collaborative effort between the&#xD;
      Albuquerque Area Indian Health Board (100% Indian-owned and operated), six Pueblo Tribes in&#xD;
      rural Southwestern U.S., and the University of New Mexico. Findings from this research could&#xD;
      lead to an immediate increase in CRC screening and ultimately reduce CRC burden among AIs,&#xD;
      thus addressing national and tribal priorities of reducing CRC disparities among AIs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the effectiveness of CRC screening tests for average risk adults, these tests are&#xD;
      under-utilized by AI/ANs. A recent study of AI/ANs who utilize IHS facilities reported that&#xD;
      only about 4.0% of average risk AI/ANs age 50-75, compared with nearly 65% of U.S. adults,&#xD;
      were current with CRC screening guidelines. The overall objective is to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      serially implemented interventions of graded intensity designed to enhance annual CRC&#xD;
      screening using the FIT in AI communities. The aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Finalize and evaluate the efficacy of serially implemented interventions of graded&#xD;
      intensity for increasing annual CRC screening uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Determine promoters and barriers to enhancing annual CRC screening practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Conduct process evaluation studies on: cost-effectiveness of the interventions,&#xD;
      implementation fidelity, and sustainability and scalability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol A. Aim 1-Qualitative Research (Intervention Finalization)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research Design: Qualitative design, using focus group methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Population: Recruited from the project's Community Advisory Council, from the&#xD;
           Albuquerque Area Southwest Tribal Epidemiology Center's (AASTEC's) Executive Council,&#xD;
           Community Health Representatives, and other tribal stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recruitment Target: Up to 30-36 eligible (assuming attrition) persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recruitment Methods: Purposive sampling methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Procedures: Conduct three focus groups, with each group consisting of 6 to 8&#xD;
           participants. Each session will meet for approximately two hours. Before starting the&#xD;
           discussion, participants will provide informed consent and complete a survey collecting&#xD;
           socio-demographic information. The purpose of these focus groups is to finalize the&#xD;
           intervention's educational material, ensuring it is culturally appropriate and contains&#xD;
           messages operationalizing various constructs of the theory guiding the study (Health&#xD;
           behavior Framework; HBF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Aim 1-Quantitative Research (Efficacy RCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research Design: Randomly assigned, three-group, pretest-posttest design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research Setting: Six Pueblo Tribes in New Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization: Using simple random allocation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants Identification and Sampling: Identify eligible participants from the IHS&#xD;
           Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) electronic health record system. We will&#xD;
           invite all eligible persons (estimated at 1,700) identified through the RPMS to&#xD;
           participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Interventions: The interventions are graded in intensity: high intensity, medium&#xD;
           intensity, and reference group (usual care).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Procedures: After randomizing tribes to the three Groups, we will mail a recruitment&#xD;
           letter, a consent form for completion of surveys, and a baseline survey. We will mail&#xD;
           the first posttest survey 12 months after mailing the baseline survey, with the 2nd and&#xD;
           3rd posttest surveys mailed in successive 12-month intervals. Between the baseline and&#xD;
           1st posttest surveys, participants will receive the group-specific intervention. All&#xD;
           eligible adults will be included in the analyses for the primary outcome (ie, completion&#xD;
           of the FIT kit) since non-completion of a FIT is a valid response. All eligible&#xD;
           participants in Groups 1 and 2 will receive a mailed FIT kit whether or not they return&#xD;
           the baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Implementation of the Intervention: We will simultaneously implement the intervention,&#xD;
           over three 12-month cycles. For Groups 1 and 2, we will mail the FIT kit, and the&#xD;
           educational material about one month following the initial recruitment letter/baseline&#xD;
           survey mailing. For Group 1, navigators will offer up to four education outreach&#xD;
           sessions. Group 2 will receive the FIT and education material mailing. Group 3 will&#xD;
           receive usual care (screening recommendation and a FIT kit at a clinic visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Baseline and Posttest Surveys: These surveys will collect data on CRC-related knowledge,&#xD;
           attitudes, perceived control, perceived susceptibility and severity, social support, and&#xD;
           self-efficacy. The baseline survey will also collect socio-demographic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Data Management and Analysis: We will summarize categorical and continuous variables&#xD;
           using descriptive statistics. For all analyses, the overall type I error rate will be&#xD;
           Î±=0.05. We will use appropriate methods such as Tukey's honest significant difference&#xD;
           test or a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the primary outcome, annual completion of the FIT kit, the primary endpoint is the&#xD;
           proportion of participants within each Group who completed and returned 0, 1, 2 or 3 FIT&#xD;
           kits. All analyses will be intent-to-treat, since all eligible participants will be&#xD;
           included in the analysis. We will compare the primary outcome across interventions via a&#xD;
           likelihood ratio test with a multiple comparisons adjustment. To summarize intervention&#xD;
           effects, we will report odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for&#xD;
           completing all 3 FIT kits as compared to returning each of 2, 1, or no FIT kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary outcomes are temporal changes in the HBF constructs (eg, knowledge,&#xD;
           attitudes, perceived risk) from baseline to 12-month cycles following the baseline&#xD;
           survey. We will assess temporal changes in the HBF constructs with repeated measures&#xD;
           linear regression modeling to understand the interventions' effects over time.&#xD;
           Predictive value of the interventions and the HBF constructs on the yearly FIT uptake&#xD;
           will be assessed by refitting the repeated measures logistic regression model described&#xD;
           in the primary analysis for the dependent variable of return of completed FIT kit (yes&#xD;
           vs. no) at each time point, but also including as a covariate score from all returned&#xD;
           surveys measuring HBF constructs. We will report odds ratios (and 95% CIs) for&#xD;
           completion by Groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Sample Size Considerations: We powered our study to measure significant changes by Group&#xD;
           in the annual completion of the FIT (primary outcome). With hypothesized proportions of&#xD;
           participants with 0, 1, 2 or 3 returned FIT kits that reflect an average of 4%, 14% and&#xD;
           24% completing the FIT each year for the three Groups, respectively, the power of the&#xD;
           study is ~99% with 566 participants per Group (total=1,698). We adjusted for multiple&#xD;
           comparisons in our power calculation by using a Bonferroni correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2-Qualitative Research (Understanding Behavior Change Context)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research Design: Qualitative design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Population: Participants &quot;largely adherent&quot; (completed FIT 2 or 3 of 3 times) and&#xD;
           &quot;not adherent&quot; (completed FIT 0 or 1 of 3 times) to guidelines; navigators; providers&#xD;
           and medical directors of IHS facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recruitment Target: Up to 120-144 participants (assuming attrition) who took part in the&#xD;
           Aim 1 Efficacy RCT; with 60 participants &quot;largely adherent&quot; and 60 participants &quot;not&#xD;
           adherent&quot; to the FIT guidelines. All the navigators (n=3) working on the project and&#xD;
           medical directors (n=3) of the three participating IHS facilities. One health care&#xD;
           provider from each of the three participating IHS facilities (n=3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recruitment Methods: Purposive sampling methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Procedures: Conduct 12 focus groups, with each group consisting of 6 to 8 participants.&#xD;
           Each session will meet for approximately two hours. Before starting the discussion,&#xD;
           participants will provide informed consent. The moderator will explore HBF factors most&#xD;
           conducive to being &quot;largely adherent&quot; to screening guidelines. Among participants &quot;not&#xD;
           adherent&quot; to CRC screening guidelines, we will inquire about barriers to completing a&#xD;
           FIT and their potential solutions. We will also inquire about how we can sustain and&#xD;
           scale-up the interventions for broader dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct interviews with navigators, and health care providers and medical directors of the&#xD;
      IHS facilities. Before starting the interview, we will obtain informed consent. Interviews&#xD;
      with the navigators will focus on delivery of the intervention, barriers and promoters to&#xD;
      providing navigation, participants' reasons for &quot;largely adhering&quot; or &quot;not adhering&quot; to CRC&#xD;
      screening guidelines, and strategies to sustain and scale-up the interventions. Interviews&#xD;
      with the health care providers and medical directors will focus on systems-level factors that&#xD;
      may or may not facilitate delivery of CRC screening services, viability of using navigation&#xD;
      for cancer screening in community settings, and strategies to sustain and scale-up the&#xD;
      interventions. We will collect baseline socio-demographic information from the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3-Process Evaluation Studies (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Implementation Fidelity, and&#xD;
      Sustainability and Scalability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Procedure-Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: We will collect and use primary and secondary&#xD;
           data to define parameters for the Markov models of cost-effectiveness. We will include&#xD;
           data on CRC epidemiology in New Mexico, screening and treatment costs, and screening&#xD;
           compliance rates for each cycle of the serially implemented interventions. We will&#xD;
           collect data on all costs including navigation, mailing of FITs, educational material,&#xD;
           and follow-up costs by each Group. We will assess direct medical costs through the IHS&#xD;
           RPMS, which contains patient encounter-level data by outpatient ICD-9 diagnoses and&#xD;
           procedure codes. We will extract data on sensitivity, specificity and efficacy of&#xD;
           screening tests from the peer-reviewed literature. We will begin by constructing a&#xD;
           decision tree for each of the Groups. We will compute the costs of each decision node&#xD;
           (FIT completed/FIT not completed and received colonoscopy/did not receive colonoscopy)&#xD;
           based on directly accrued medical and non-medical costs obtained from data sources&#xD;
           identified above. The result of the cost-effectiveness analysis will be an incremental&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the three Groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedure-Implementation Fidelity: We will evaluate fidelity of implementation based on&#xD;
           standard components, including: reach to potentially eligible participants; recruitment;&#xD;
           resources and expertise needed for the research; the broader content (ie, social,&#xD;
           physical, cultural, and structural factors); fidelity of delivery of the interventions;&#xD;
           amount of the intervention actually delivered; amount of the intervention actually&#xD;
           received; challenges encountered in implementing the research; potential contamination;&#xD;
           and number and quality of partnerships.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedure-Sustainability and Scalability: We will operationalize concepts for sustaining&#xD;
           and scaling-up efficacious interventions, including: the nature of the interventions;&#xD;
           the interventions' efficacy; the cost and cost-effectiveness of the interventions;&#xD;
           partnerships; organizational capacity; contextual factors; promoters and barriers; and&#xD;
           generalizability to other populations.&#xD;
