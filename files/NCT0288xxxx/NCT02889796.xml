    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI score is defined as the average of the scores of eight functional categories (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities), usually completed by the participant. Responses in each functional category are collected as 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do a task in that area), with or without aids or devices. The eight category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI score on a scale from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). When 6 or more categories are non-missing, total possible score is 3. If more than 2 categories are missing, the HAQ-DI score is set to missing. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement (less disability).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Disease Activity Score for 28 Joint Count Using C-Reactive Protein [DAS28 (CRP)] &lt; 2.6 at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint counts (28 joints), swollen joint counts (28 joints), SGA (VAS: 0 = no disease activity to 100 = maximum disease activity), and hsCRP (CRP = hsCRP) for a total possible score of 1 to 9.4. Higher values indicate higher disease activity. Participants with missing outcomes were set as non-responders.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's radiographs of bilateral hands, wrists and feet are taken and evaluated through central review using the mTSS method. The mTSS (range [0-448]) is defined as the erosion score (range [0-280]) plus the joint space narrowing (JSN) score (range [0-168]). An erosion score of 0 to 5 is given to each joint in the hands and wrists, and a score of 0 to 10 is given to each joint in the feet where 0 indicates no erosion while 5 or 10 indicates extensive loss of bone (maximum erosion). JSN is scored from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating normal or no narrowing and 4 indicating complete loss of joint space. The maximal TSS is 448. Negative change in value indicates improvement (less erosion of bone, normal joint spaces).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item, self-reported, generic, comprehensive, and health-related quality of life questionnaire based on 8 health domains in 2 components: physical well-being (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions), mental well-being (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health). Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale with highest possible score of 100. Higher scores indicate better health status or functioning. Positive change in value indicates improvement and better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Participant's radiographs of bilateral hands, wrists and feet are taken and evaluated through central review using the mTSS method. The mTSS (range [0-448]) is defined as the erosion score (range [0-280]) plus the joint space narrowing (JSN) score (range [0-168]). An erosion score of 0 to 5 is given to each joint in the hands and wrists, and a score of 0 to 10 is given to each joint in the feet where 0 indicates no erosion while 5 or 10 indicates extensive loss of bone (maximum erosion). JSN is scored from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating normal or no narrowing and 4 indicating complete loss of joint space. The maximal TSS is 448. Negative change in value indicates improvement (less erosion of bone, normal joint spaces).</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 36, and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI is a questionnaire that measures impairments in work activities in participants with RA which consists of 6 questions: Q1-currently employed; Q2-work time missed due to RA; Q3-work time missed due to other reasons; Q4-hours actually worked; Q5-degree RA affected productivity while working (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant from working); Q6-degree RA affected productivity in regular unpaid activities (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant's daily activities). Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages: Activity impairment due to RA: 100×{Q6/10}. If Question 1 (Are you currently employed?) is 'NO', then only the activity impairment score can be determined. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI score is defined as the average of the scores of eight functional categories (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities), usually completed by the participant. Responses in each functional category are collected as 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do a task in that area), with or without aids or devices. The eight category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI score on a scale from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). When 6 or more categories are non-missing, total possible score is 3. If more than 2 categories are missing, the HAQ-DI score is set to missing. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement (less disability).</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Disease Activity Score for 28 Joint Count Using C-Reactive Protein [DAS28 (CRP)] &lt; 2.6 at Week 12</title>
          <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint counts (28 joints), swollen joint counts (28 joints), SGA (VAS: 0 = no disease activity to 100 = maximum disease activity), and hsCRP (CRP = hsCRP) for a total possible score of 1 to 9.4. Higher values indicate higher disease activity. Participants with missing outcomes were set as non-responders.</description>

        <description>Participant's radiographs of bilateral hands, wrists and feet are taken and evaluated through central review using the mTSS method. The mTSS (range [0-448]) is defined as the erosion score (range [0-280]) plus the joint space narrowing (JSN) score (range [0-168]). An erosion score of 0 to 5 is given to each joint in the hands and wrists, and a score of 0 to 10 is given to each joint in the feet where 0 indicates no erosion while 5 or 10 indicates extensive loss of bone (maximum erosion). JSN is scored from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating normal or no narrowing and 4 indicating complete loss of joint space. The maximal TSS is 448. Negative change in value indicates improvement (less erosion of bone, normal joint spaces).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item, self-reported, generic, comprehensive, and health-related quality of life questionnaire based on 8 health domains in 2 components: physical well-being (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions), mental well-being (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health). Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale with highest possible score of 100. Higher scores indicate better health status or functioning. Positive change in value indicates improvement and better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>FACIT-Fatigue scale is a brief, 13-item, symptom-specific questionnaire that specifically assesses the self-reported severity of fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and functioning in the past 7 days. The FACIT-Fatigue uses 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) numeric rating scales for a total possible score of 0 to 52. Positive change in value indicates improvement (no or less severity of fatigue).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Individual ACR Component: HAQ-DI at Weeks 2, 4, and 24</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI score is defined as the average of the scores of eight functional categories (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities), usually completed by the participant. Responses in each functional category are collected as 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do a task in that area), with or without aids or devices. The eight category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI score on a scale from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Individual ACR Component: HAQ-DI at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI score is defined as the average of the scores of eight functional categories (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities), usually completed by the participant. Responses in each functional category are collected as 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do a task in that area), with or without aids or devices. The eight category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI score on a scale from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>TJC was examined on 68 joints of the fingers, elbows, hips, knees, ankles, and toes distal for pain in response to pressure or passive motion at the study time points. Joint pain was scored as 0 = Absent; 1 = Present for each joint. The overall Tender Joint Count ranged from 0 to 68. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Individual ACR Component: Swollen Joint Count Based on 66 Joints (SJC66) at Weeks 2, 4, 12, and 24</title>
        <description>The total SJC66 was based on 66 joints (same 68 joints counted in TJC68 minus hips). It was derived as the sum of all &quot;1s&quot; (presence of a joint swelling was scored as &quot;1&quot; and the absence of swelling was scored as &quot;0,&quot; provided the joint was not replaced or could not be assessed due to other reasons) thus collected with no penalty considered for the joints not assessed or those which had been replaced. The range for SJC66 is 0 to 66. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Individual ACR Component: SJC66 at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
        <description>The total SJC66 was based on 66 joints (same 68 joints counted in TJC68 minus hips). It was derived as the sum of all &quot;1s&quot; (presence of a joint swelling was scored as &quot;1&quot; and the absence of swelling was scored as &quot;0,&quot; provided the joint was not replaced or could not be assessed due to other reasons) thus collected with no penalty considered for the joints not assessed or those which had been replaced. The range for SJC66 is 0 to 66. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Improvement (Decrease) in the HAQ-DI Score ≥ 0.22 at Weeks 2, 4, 12, and 24</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI score is defined as the average of the scores of eight functional categories (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities), usually completed by the participant. Responses in each functional category are collected as 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do a task in that area), with or without aids or devices. The eight category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI score on a scale from 0-3 [0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled) when 6 or more categories are non-missing, so total possible score is 3. Improvement is defined as reduction in HAQ-DI, (baseline value - postbaseline value) ≥ 0.22. If more than 2 categories are missing, the HAQ-DI score is set to missing. Participants with missing outcomes were set as non-responders.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Improvement (Decrease) in the HAQ-DI Score ≥ 0.22 at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI score is defined as the average of the scores of eight functional categories (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities), usually completed by the participant. Responses in each functional category are collected as 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do a task in that area), with or without aids or devices. The eight category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI score on a scale from 0-3 [0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled) when 6 or more categories are non-missing, so total possible score is 3. Improvement is defined as reduction in HAQ-DI, (baseline value - postbaseline value) ≥ 0.22. If more than 2 categories are missing, the HAQ-DI score is set to missing. Participants with missing outcomes were set as non-responders.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Weeks 2, 4, 12, and 24</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint counts (28 joints), swollen joint counts (28 joints), SGA (VAS: 0 = no disease activity to 100 = maximum disease activity), and hsCRP for a total possible score of 1 to 9.4. Higher values indicate higher disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint counts (28 joints), swollen joint counts (28 joints), SGA (VAS: 0 = no disease activity to 100 = maximum disease activity), and hsCRP for a total possible score of 1 to 9.4. Higher values indicate higher disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint counts (28 joints), swollen joint counts (28 joints), SGA (VAS: 0 = no disease activity to 100 = maximum disease activity), and hsCRP for a total possible score of 1 to 9.4. Higher values indicate higher disease activity. Participants with missing outcomes were set as non-responders.</description>

        <title>American College of Rheumatology N Percent Improvement (ACR-N) at Weeks 2, 4, 12, and 24</title>
        <description>ACR-N is defined as the smallest percentage improvement from baseline in swollen joints, tender joints and the median of the following 5 items (PGA, SGA, subject's pain assessment, HAQ-DI and hsCRP). It has a range between 0 and 100%. PGA and SGA assessed using VAS on a scale of 0-100 [0 and 100 indicating no disease activity and maximum disease activity]; subject's pain assessment using VAS on a scale of 0-100 [0 and 100 indicating no pain and unbearable pain]; HAQ-DI score contains 20 questions,8 components: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities and scored on a scale of 0-3 [0 and 3 indicating without difficulty and unable to do]. If this calculation results in a negative value, then the ACR-N is set to 0. The ACR-N value indicates an improvement of N%, with higher numbers indicating greater improvement.</description>

        <description>ACR-N is defined as the smallest percentage improvement from baseline in swollen joints, tender joints and the median of the following 5 items (PGA, SGA, subject's pain assessment, HAQ-DI and hsCRP). It has a range between 0 and 100%. PGA and SGA assessed using VAS on a scale of 0-100 [0 and 100 indicating no disease activity and maximum disease activity]; subject's pain assessment using VAS on a scale of 0-100 [0 and 100 indicating no pain and unbearable pain]; HAQ-DI score contains 20 questions,8 components: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities and scored on a scale of 0-3 [0 and 3 indicating without difficulty and unable to do]. If this calculation results in a negative value, then the ACR-N is set to 0. The ACR-N value indicates an improvement of N%, with higher numbers indicating greater improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Weeks 2, 4, 12, and 24</title>
        <description>CDAI is calculated using formula: CDAI = TJC based on 28 joints (TJC28) + SJC based on 28 joints (SJC28) + SGA + PGA. PGA and SGA are assessed using a VAS on a scale of 0-10 [0 and 10 indicating no disease activity and maximum disease activity]. CDAI can range from 0 to 76, with higher score indicating more severe disease activity status. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CDAI at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
        <description>CDAI is calculated using formula: CDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + SGA + PGA. PGA and SGA are assessed using a VAS on a scale of 0-10 [0 and 10 indicating no disease activity and maximum disease activity]. CDAI can range from 0 to 76, with higher score indicating more severe disease activity status. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) at Weeks 2, 4, 12, and 24</title>
        <description>SDAI is a composite measure that sums the TJC28, SJC28, SGA, PGA, and the hsCRP (in mg/dL). PGA and SGA assessed using VAS on a scale of 0-10 [0 and 10 indicating no disease activity and maximum disease activity]. Higher score indicates more severe disease activity status and total possible score is 0 to 86. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>SDAI is a composite measure that sums the TJC28, SJC28, SGA, PGA, and the hsCRP (in mg/dL). PGA and SGA assessed using VAS on a scale of 0-10 [0 and 10 indicating no disease activity and maximum disease activity]. Higher score indicates more severe disease activity status and total possible score is 0 to 86. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in mTSS at Week 52</title>
        <description>Participant's radiographs of bilateral hands, wrists and feet are taken and evaluated through central review using the mTSS method. The mTSS (range [0-448]) is defined as the erosion score (range [0-280]) plus the joint space narrowing (JSN) score (range [0-168]). An erosion score of 0 to 5 is given to each joint in the hands and wrists, and a score of 0 to 10 is given to each joint in the feet where 0 indicates no erosion while 5 or 10 indicates extensive loss of bone (maximum erosion). JSN is scored from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating normal or no narrowing and 4 indicating complete loss of joint space. The maximal TSS is 448. Negative change in value indicates improvement (less erosion of bone, normal joint spaces).</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item, self-reported, generic, comprehensive, and health-related quality of life questionnaire based on 8 health domains in 2 components: physical well-being (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions), mental well-being (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health). Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale with highest possible score of 100. Higher scores indicate better health status or functioning.</description>

        <title>SF-36 PCS Score at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item, self-reported, generic, comprehensive, and health-related quality of life questionnaire based on 8 health domains in 2 components: physical well-being (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions), mental well-being (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health). Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale with highest possible score of 100. Higher scores indicate better health status or functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 PCS Score at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item, self-reported, generic, comprehensive, and health-related quality of life questionnaire based on 8 health domains in 2 components: physical well-being (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions), mental well-being (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health). Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale with highest possible score of 100. Higher scores indicate better health status or functioning. Positive change in value indicates improvement and better quality of life.</description>

        <title>SF-36 MCS Score at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item, self-reported, generic, comprehensive, and health-related quality of life questionnaire based on 8 health domains in 2 components: physical well-being (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions), mental well-being (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health). Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale with highest possible score of 100. Higher scores indicate better health status or functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 MCS Score at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item, self-reported, generic, comprehensive, and health-related quality of life questionnaire based on 8 health domains in 2 components: physical well-being (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions), mental well-being (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health). Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale with highest possible score of 100. Higher scores indicate better health status or functioning. Positive change in value indicates improvement and better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants by European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Health Profile Categories at Weeks 4, 12, and 24</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) is a standardized measure of health status of the participant at the visit (same day) that provides a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 components: a descriptive system of the participant's health and a rating of his or her current health state on a 0-100 VAS. The descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Rating gets recorded on a vertical VAS in which the endpoints are labeled best imaginable health state is 100 (on the top) and worst imaginable health state is 0 (on the bottom). Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants by EQ-5D Health Profile Categories at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) is a standardized measure of health status of the participant at the visit (same day) that provides a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 components: a descriptive system of the participant's health and a rating of his or her current health state on a 0-100 VAS. The descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Rating gets recorded on a vertical VAS in which the endpoints are labeled best imaginable health state is 100 (on the top) and worst imaginable health state is 0 (on the bottom). Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status of the participant at the visit (same day) that provides a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. Participant rates their current health state on a 0-100 VAS. It gets recorded on a vertical VAS in which the endpoints are labeled best imaginable health state is 100 (on the top) and worst imaginable health state is 0 (on the bottom). Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EQ-5D Current Health VAS at Weeks 4, 12, and 24</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status of the participant at the visit (same day) that provides a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. Participant rates their current health state on a 0-100 VAS. It gets recorded on a vertical VAS in which the endpoints are labeled best imaginable health state is 100 (on the top) and worst imaginable health state is 0 (on the bottom). Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health. Positive change indicates improvement (better health).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EQ-5D Current Health VAS at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status of the participant at the visit (same day) that provides a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. Participant rates their current health state on a 0-100 VAS. It gets recorded on a vertical VAS in which the endpoints are labeled best imaginable health state is 100 (on the top) and worst imaginable health state is 0 (on the bottom). Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health. Positive change indicates improvement (better health).</description>

        <description>The WPAI is a questionnaire that measures impairments in work activities in participants with RA which consists of 6 questions: Q1-currently employed; Q2-work time missed due to RA; Q3-work time missed due to other reasons; Q4-hours actually worked; Q5-degree RA affected productivity while working (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant from working); Q6-degree RA affected productivity in regular unpaid activities (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant's daily activities). Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages: Absenteeism (work time missed) due to RA: 100×{Q2/(Q2+Q4)}. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <title>WPAI-RA: Mean Percentage of Work Time Missed (Absenteeism) at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
        <description>The WPAI is a questionnaire that measures impairments in work activities in participants with RA which consists of 6 questions: Q1-currently employed; Q2-work time missed due to RA; Q3-work time missed due to other reasons; Q4-hours actually worked; Q5-degree RA affected productivity while working (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant from working); Q6-degree RA affected productivity in regular unpaid activities (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant's daily activities). Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages: Absenteeism (work time missed) due to RA: 100×{Q2/(Q2+Q4)}. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

          <title>WPAI-RA: Mean Percentage of Impairment While Working Due to RA (Presenteeism) at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
          <description>The WPAI is a questionnaire that measures impairments in work activities in participants with RA which consists of 6 questions: Q1-currently employed; Q2-work time missed due to RA; Q3-work time missed due to other reasons; Q4-hours actually worked; Q5-degree RA affected productivity while working (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant from working); Q6-degree RA affected productivity in regular unpaid activities (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant's daily activities). Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages: Presenteeism (impairment while working) due to RA: 100×{Q5/10}. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

          <description>The WPAI is a questionnaire that measures impairments in work activities in participants with RA which consists of 6 questions: Q1-currently employed; Q2-work time missed due to RA; Q3-work time missed due to other reasons; Q4-hours actually worked; Q5-degree RA affected productivity while working (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant from working); Q6-degree RA affected productivity in regular unpaid activities (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant's daily activities). Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages: Work productivity loss (overall work impairment) due to RA: 100×{Q2/(Q2+Q4) + [(1-Q2/(Q2+Q4) × (Q5/10)]}. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in WPAI-RA: Mean Percentage of Work Time Missed (Absenteeism) at Weeks 4, 12, and 24</title>
        <description>The WPAI is a questionnaire that measures impairments in work activities in participants with RA which consists of 6 questions: Q1-currently employed; Q2-work time missed due to RA; Q3-work time missed due to other reasons; Q4-hours actually worked; Q5-degree RA affected productivity while working (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant from working); Q6-degree RA affected productivity in regular unpaid activities (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant's daily activities). Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages: Absenteeism (work time missed) due to RA: 100×{Q2/(Q2+Q4)}. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <description>The WPAI is a questionnaire that measures impairments in work activities in participants with RA which consists of 6 questions: Q1-currently employed; Q2-work time missed due to RA; Q3-work time missed due to other reasons; Q4-hours actually worked; Q5-degree RA affected productivity while working (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant from working); Q6-degree RA affected productivity in regular unpaid activities (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant's daily activities). Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages: Presenteeism (impairment while working) due to RA: 100×{Q5/10}. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in WPAI-RA: Mean Percentage of Overall Work Productivity Impairment Due to RA at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
          <description>The WPAI is a questionnaire that measures impairments in work activities in participants with RA which consists of 6 questions: Q1-currently employed; Q2-work time missed due to RA; Q3-work time missed due to other reasons; Q4-hours actually worked; Q5-degree RA affected productivity while working (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant from working); Q6-degree RA affected productivity in regular unpaid activities (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant's daily activities). Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages: Work productivity loss (overall work impairment) due to RA: 100×{Q2/(Q2+Q4) + [(1-Q2/(Q2+Q4) × (Q5/10)]}. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in WPAI-RA: Mean Percentage of Activity Impairment Due to RA at Weeks 36, and 52</title>
        <description>The WPAI is a questionnaire that measures impairments in work activities in participants with RA which consists of 6 questions: Q1-currently employed; Q2-work time missed due to RA; Q3-work time missed due to other reasons; Q4-hours actually worked; Q5-degree RA affected productivity while working (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant from working); Q6-degree RA affected productivity in regular unpaid activities (0-10 VAS, with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating RA completely prevented the participant's daily activities). Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages: Activity impairment due to RA: 100×{Q6/10}. If Question 1 (Are you currently employed?) is 'NO', then only the activity impairment score can be determined. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
