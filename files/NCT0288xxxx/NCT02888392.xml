  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will primarily demonstrate the efficacy of kiwifruit as a food&#xD;
      intervention for the relief of constipation and associated symptoms in functionally&#xD;
      constipated adults, and those with IBS-C. Secondary measures will show the consumption of&#xD;
      kiwifruit will result in improvements in gastro-intestinal discomfort levels of adults with&#xD;
      IBS-C.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised, single-blinded, cross-over design. Both target study populations&#xD;
      (those with functional constipation, and the matched healthy control group) will complete the&#xD;
      16-week trial. Each study group will be randomly selected to either begin the first&#xD;
      intervention period on the kiwifruit treatment or the psyllium treatment, and following the&#xD;
      washout period will then receive the opposite treatment. Researchers and analysts will be&#xD;
      blind as to as to the order of treatment individuals will receive. A dedicated treatment&#xD;
      administrator will be assigned to provide the treatments to participants and liaise with them&#xD;
      during the intervention phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be free living and required to maintain their normal dietary and&#xD;
      lifestyle habits for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be quantification of CSBM (complete spontaneous bowel&#xD;
      movement). Secondary outcome measures will include additional stool frequency measures and&#xD;
      other questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>Pysllium seed husk; ispaghula, isabgol, or psyllium, are portions of the seeds of the plant Plantago ovata, (genus Plantago), a native of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. They are hygroscopic, which allows them to expand and become mucilaginous. Psyllium is a faecal bulking agent used to treat constipation. It absorbs liquid in the intestines, swells and forms a bulky soft stool that is easy to pass</description>

        The study group will consist of 3 balanced groups of 20 subjects. A functionally&#xD;
        constipated group (FC), an irritable bowel syndrome with constipation group (IBS-C), and a&#xD;
        healthy control group (HC). The FC and IBS-C groups are the study population of interest to&#xD;
        measure improvements in digestive comfort, and the HC will ensure no adverse events,&#xD;
        confirming kiwifruit are suitable for consumption by the general healthy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must fall within:&#xD;

          2. BMI between 18-35 Screening questionnaires for participant selection, together with&#xD;
             the sample ROME III FC/ IBS-C criteria screening questions are provided in Appendix C.&#xD;
             This questionnaire enables potential participants to be screened for both FC and&#xD;
             IBS-C, together with some &quot;red flag&quot; questions to further determine participant&#xD;
             suitability.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    6. Fewer than three defecations per week ii. Loose stools are rarely present&#xD;
                       without the use of laxatives iii. Insufficient criteria for irritable bowel&#xD;

        ≥ 7.2 mmol/l will not be accepted into the trial.&#xD;

        serotonin reuptake inhibitors), tricyclates, opiates or anti-inflammatories will be&#xD;
        permitted into the trial on condition the medication has been in use continually and the&#xD;
        condition has been stable for &gt; 3 months. Similarly those with stable and controlled&#xD;
