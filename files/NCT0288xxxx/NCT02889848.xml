  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study evaluates the safety and tolerability of a single injection of collagenase&#xD;
      enzyme directly into a uterine fibroid in subjects already selected for hysterectomy or&#xD;
      myomectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibroids contain excessive amounts of collagen and it is possible that digestion of collagen&#xD;
      may be beneficial in reducing pain and bleeding associated with fibroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three subjects will be injected with saline only to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      the injection method. Additional subjects will then be injected with increasing doses of&#xD;
      study drug.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Collagenase enzyme breaks down collagen and has shown efficacy in clinical trials for a&#xD;
      number of diseases for which there is an accumulation of collagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that lysis of collagen may reduce the collagen content of fibroids thus&#xD;
      decreasing the size of fibroids, and possibly reducing the stiffness of fibroids. This may&#xD;
      result in reducing the symptoms of pain and bleeding associated with fibroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study three subjects will be injected with saline only followed immediately by&#xD;
      hysterectomy in order to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the injection method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve subjects will receive a single injection of study drug as follows: three subjects will&#xD;
      receive a set dose of collagenase enzyme followed by hysterectomy or myomectomy 24-96 hours&#xD;
      later (Group 1) to evaluate safety of the injection of study drug. Nine subjects will then&#xD;
      receive increasing doses of collagenase enzyme followed by hysterectomy or myomectomy 60-90&#xD;
      days later (Group 2).&#xD;

             greater than or equal to 3 cm diameter, and less than or equal to 10 cm diameter for&#xD;
             subjects in Group 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fibroids will be intramural fibroids which will be surrounded by a layer of&#xD;
             myometrium. Fibroids must be well visualized on ultrasound examination and provide a&#xD;
             clear path for injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who were planning to undergo abdominal hysterectomy or myomectomy for treatment&#xD;
             of symptomatic fibroids. Subjects must be willing to defer the operation until 24-96&#xD;
             hours after study treatment for Group 1 and for 60-90 days after study treatment for&#xD;
             Group 2. The patients will understand that they may choose to have surgery or any&#xD;
             other non-study treatment at any time after enrollment and end study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &quot;Typical&quot; large fibroids visualized as hypo-intense on a T2-weighted MRI scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
