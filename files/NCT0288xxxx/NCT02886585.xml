      This research study is studying Pembrolizumab as a possible treatment for this diagnosis for&#xD;
      metastases in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab may help the immune system fight cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved pembrolizumab FDA for some&#xD;
      diseases that are being treated on this study, but not for central nervous system metastases.&#xD;
      Researchers hope to study the effects of pembrolizumab. Many cancers use specific pathways&#xD;
      (such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) to evade the body's immune system. Pembrolizumab works by&#xD;
      blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathways and thus releasing the brakes on the immune system so it can&#xD;
      stop or slow cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers hope to study the effects of pembrolizumab in cancer that has metastasized to the&#xD;
      brain. These drugs work by stimulating the immune system to fight cancer.&#xD;

             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
