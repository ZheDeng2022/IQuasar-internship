  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryotherapy has a wide range of clinical applications in rehabilitation, used for activities&#xD;
      such as controlling inflammation, pain control or management of edema after an injury or&#xD;
      surgery. In the field of cryotherapy they studied cold neuromuscular responses, where it has&#xD;
      shown a decrease in nerve conduction velocity, which leads to a decrease in muscle strength.&#xD;
      However it has been described in some work applications brief cold (&quot;Quick Icing&quot;) may be&#xD;
      opposite to those described effects, increasing the strength, the time of intervention the&#xD;
      most important and decisive in these possible improvements or decreases factor. This effect&#xD;
      is observed in response to a few seconds of application of cold, and would be given by an&#xD;
      increased activity of motor neurons. Assess the influence of rapid cooling application&#xD;
      (&quot;Technique Quick Icing&quot;) and prolonged cooling in handgrip strength when performing a manual&#xD;
      dynamometer test in college students.&#xD;

      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type of study: Experimental study, type randomized clinical trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conceptual framework:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quick or rapid cooling Icing: brief application of cold, for a period of up to 30&#xD;
                seconds on a body surface which seeks to promote the activation of the nervous&#xD;
                system to produce increased excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prolonged Cold: prolonged application of cold, for at least 5 minutes or more, on a&#xD;
                body surface that aims to reduce nervous system activation slowing of nerve&#xD;
                conduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Operational definition of variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grip strength: Strength in kilograms evaluated through manual dynamometry test the&#xD;
                time for a grip. Force values are recorded in an Excel table displaying data in&#xD;
                kilograms evaluated. (Manual hydraulic dynamometer brand JAMAR® be used).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quick Icing: will apply through glasses of ice on the ventral region of the&#xD;
                dominant forearm of the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prolonged cold: It shall be implemented through an ice pack (ice bag), placed on&#xD;
                the ventral side of the dominant forearm in one of the comparison groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control: Group of people will not be subjected to any intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Place of research: The study will be conducted in the laboratory of physiotherapy&#xD;
           rehabilitation science faculty building C5 401 room floor room, campus Casona de la&#xD;
           Universidad Andrés Bello, Av Fernández Concha 700, Las Condes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Methodological Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has the characteristics of a random analytical experimental design (ECA), the&#xD;
      study will be conducted in the laboratory Intervention Kinesics, room 401, fourth floor C5,&#xD;
      Faculty of Rehabilitation Sciences, Campus Casona Las Condes, Av. Fernández Concha 700,&#xD;
      Comuna Las Condes. The sample will be selected from the university community that makes up&#xD;
      the faculty of Rehabilitation Sciences (FCR). The research will be registered in the network&#xD;
      of clinical trials registry (www.clinicaltrials.gov), obtaining a registration number. The&#xD;
      study has submitted to the ethics committee of the East Metropolitan Health Service (SSMO),&#xD;
      to ensure that all bioethical labor standards are met. It is approved on August 23, 2016.&#xD;
      This allowed to start the investigation. Population will be taken as students who are&#xD;
      studying between first and fourth year of racing Kinesiology, Speech Therapy and Occupational&#xD;
      Therapy. The sample is determined by a deliberate selection process through a survey of&#xD;
      closed questions. This survey will allow participants to choose from the selection criteria&#xD;
      proposed in the work. The number of participants that make up the sample will be taken for&#xD;
      the convenience of researchers. As inclusion criteria have been established which follow:&#xD;
      Students of the Faculty of Rehabilitation Sciences UNAB, subjects older than 18 years and&#xD;
      have not submitted musculoskeletal disorders in the dominant upper extremity in the last 6&#xD;
      months. Moreover, as exclusion criteria have been considered: the presence of pain or&#xD;
      discomfort in performing handgrip with the dominant limb, intolerance to cold, diseases such&#xD;
      as cryoglobulinemia, Raynaud's disease or paroxysmal hemoglobinuria cold, rheumatic diseases&#xD;
      such as lupus erythematosus systemic, multiple myeloma or rheumatoid arthritis, positive test&#xD;
      cube ice and osteosynthesis materials or stent in the dominant upper extremity. The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be assessed in the sampling process through the selection of survey&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They have designated three stages of conducting the study. Stage 1, called &quot;Stage sampling&quot;&#xD;
      consist of the application of the survey to students of different levels of the three races&#xD;
      of the faculty. Then it analyzes information collected by performing a first filter in&#xD;
      selecting potential participants. This filter is given by the survey questions that reflect&#xD;
      the inclusive and exclusive criteria. Personal contact with students who meet the&#xD;
      characteristics of participation and will be invited to join the study will be conducted. A&#xD;
      selectable and interested in participating they will be explained the purpose of the&#xD;
      investigation and asked for their consent to participate in writing. The document will be&#xD;
      given consent previously approved by the bioethics committee of the East Metropolitan Health&#xD;
      Service (SSMO), based in the Salvador Hospital, Providence commune. Stage 1 will be as&#xD;
      lasting three weeks, following the planned proposal on the Gantt chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage of the design, called &quot;Evaluation&quot; will last for two weeks according to the&#xD;
      proposal in the Gantt chart established. This step will be the completion of the ice cube&#xD;
      test following the established protocol. This will apply a second filter of selectable&#xD;
      subjects and who agreed to participate consentidamente, and not excluded from the survey&#xD;
      team. Then an assessment of the ability of participants will be made to perform painless&#xD;
      handgrip on a stage with the same environmental conditions in which they carry out research&#xD;
      (laboratory Physiotherapy Faculty Rehabilitation Sciences, Room 307, fourth floor building C5&#xD;
      ). Thus the stage 2 will be an instance of second filtering selection of participants, to&#xD;
      have people who eventually will make up the working groups of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3, called &quot;Experimental&quot;, will run for eight weeks. Participants will be distributed&#xD;
      forming three working groups, a group called &quot;Quick Icing&quot; (QI), another group called&#xD;
      &quot;Prolonged Cold&quot; (PC) and a third group called &quot;Control&quot; (C). The designation for each group&#xD;
      will advance by a simple randomization process using a table of random numbers, and will be&#xD;
      in charge of the study director. Thus each participant will be labeled with a number and&#xD;
      included in a specific group. This randomization process will seek to minimize selection&#xD;
      bias. The director will be the only one who has the numbered list of participants in each&#xD;
      group. From this process of randomization working groups will be established, that is, &quot;Quick&#xD;
      Icing&quot;, &quot;Prolonged cold&quot; and &quot;Control&quot;. After forming the three groups, an evaluator 1 record&#xD;
      demographic characteristics of each participant. This record will include data such as; age,&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI), gender and body fat percentage. This information will be extracted&#xD;
      from the survey participant selection that will form groups and measuring the percentage of&#xD;
      body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In analysis of these data will determine the homogeneity of the groups to establish any&#xD;
      comparisons at the end of the process after having results. An evaluator 2, unknown belongs&#xD;
      to each participant, record the maximum handgrip strength of the dominant limb of each&#xD;
      individual. The maximum handgrip strength will be evaluated following the proposed design the&#xD;
      test protocol using manual dynamometry, registering the force of subjects measured in&#xD;
      kilograms (kg). The evaluator 2 shall request three executions within a period of 15 seconds&#xD;
      leaving a rest interval of 60 seconds between each attempt, this according to the protocol&#xD;
      proposed by the researchers, based on the work of Watanabe and cols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluator 2 tabulate the values of the three executions in an Excel spreadsheet marking&#xD;
      the mean handgrip strength valoe will be recorded as the &quot;pre&quot; maximum force. Followed by the&#xD;
      assessment process handgrip strength, we will lead each participant to the intervention group&#xD;
      that corresponds, ie group &quot;Quick icing&quot; group &quot;Prolonged Cold&quot; or &quot;Control&quot;. In the&#xD;
      laboratory has established three working box, one for each intervention procedure. People&#xD;
      will only have contact with subjects pertaining to your workgroup, without knowing&#xD;
      participants in the other groups, this will be achieved with the double-blind establish&#xD;
      avoiding bias intervention. Each participant will be seven minutes in their respective work&#xD;
      box. The first minute of the time in question is used for the installation of each&#xD;
      individual, leaving the remaining 6 for the application of the procedure. The protocol will&#xD;
      consist of installation position the person seated, supporting the dominant forearm on a&#xD;
      table leaving visible the ventral side of the segment. The participants of the group &quot;Quick&#xD;
      icing&quot; will be subject to the application of cold on the ventral side of the dominant forearm&#xD;
      for 30 seconds, using the technique of ice beakers dynamically. Participants must wait in the&#xD;
      box six minutes before the therapeutic intervention. The quick icing process will be applied&#xD;
      from 6 minutes for the time described above. The group of &quot;prolonged Cold&quot; will receive the&#xD;
      intervention of &quot;ice bag&quot; for a period of 5 and a half minutes from 1 minute on the ventral&#xD;
      side of the dominant forearm. The &quot;Ice Bag&quot; will have a weight of 700 grams. The &quot;Control&quot;&#xD;
      group will receive a placebo application through an &quot;ice bag&quot; empty. The bag will be applied&#xD;
      from 1 minute to 6 and a half minutes, as prolonged cold group. After 7 minutes of&#xD;
      individuals in each group will return to the station where the evaluator 2 dynamometry record&#xD;
      the handgrip strength of the dominant segment in your Excel spreadsheet tabulating the best&#xD;
      record of three possible attempts again. This will get the value of maximum force &quot;post&quot; of&#xD;
      people in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      He completed the &quot;experimental stage&quot; proceed to step 4 called &quot;Data Analysis&quot; which will&#xD;
      last for three weeks to allow the ordering of data, development of descriptive and&#xD;
      inferential statistics. This stage will lead the research director, who will be responsible&#xD;
      for storing and organizing data collected by the evaluators. Descriptive statistics for the&#xD;
      variable maximum isometric muscle strength pre and post, will be from intragroup and&#xD;
      intergroup averages. Secondary variables age and body mass index will be described in terms&#xD;
      of average and standard deviation. The secondary endpoint genre will be described in terms of&#xD;
      frequencies and percentages. To represent the descriptive statistics of the variable maximum&#xD;
      force, graphic boxes, which show the averages will be used. For each variable statistical&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance was applied to determine the normal distribution&#xD;
      of the data, and thus assess whether there are significant differences in these parameters.&#xD;
      To make this analysis STATA ® program will be used. According to normal or abnormal&#xD;
      distribution data obtained ANOVA statistical test or SHARIPO-WILK be used. The results from&#xD;
      these statistical tests allow the preparation of Table 1 (demographic data), which will&#xD;
      reflect the initial data of the participants in each group. Following the framework of&#xD;
      inferential statistics will proceed to compare differences in mean maximal isometric forces&#xD;
      pre- and post intragroup and intergroup using ANOVA statistical test or Kruskal-Wallis&#xD;
      depending on whether the distribution of these variables was normal or abnormal. The analysis&#xD;
      will also consider the differences in the mean values of maximum force considering the&#xD;
      variable intra- and inter-group genre. Once the statistical analysis done, it is considered&#xD;
      two weeks to analyze the results and approach a discussion around them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completed all stages of design, we will proceed to spread the work through the&#xD;
      application to national and international scientific journals, it will be drafted in&#xD;
      accordance with the regulations required by the journal to which it will run. It has seen a&#xD;
      period of three months for the dissemination of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel each stage of the design will be registered on the clinicaltrials.gov mode page&#xD;
      report the status of the investigation.&#xD;
