&#xD;
        Cohort 2: HIV-1 infected children (6 to &lt; 12 years of age and screening weight ≥ 25 kg) who&#xD;
        are virologically suppressed for ≥ 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Cohort 4 Group 1: HIV-1 infected children (≥ 2 years of age and screening weight of ≥ 14 to&#xD;
        &lt; 25 kg) who are virologically suppressed for ≥ 6 months prior to screening and unable to&#xD;
        swallow tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL on a stable regimen (or undetectable HIV-1&#xD;

             copies/mL) for ≥ 6 months preceding the Screening visit. Unconfirmed virologic&#xD;
             elevations of ≥ 50 copies/mL (transient detectable viremia, or &quot;blip&quot;) prior to&#xD;
             screening are acceptable. If the lower limit of detection of the local HIV-1 RNA assay&#xD;
             is &lt; 50 copies/mL (eg, &lt; 20 copies/mL), the plasma HIV-1 RNA level cannot exceed 50&#xD;
             copies/mL on two consecutive HIV-1 RNA tests.&#xD;

          -  Stable antiretroviral regimen of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)&#xD;
             in combination with a third agent for a minimum of 6 months prior to the screening&#xD;
             visit. Individuals undergoing dose modifications to their antiretroviral regimen for&#xD;

          -  Positive confirmatory HIV test (confirmatory nucleic acid-based testing if &lt; 18 months&#xD;
             of age)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On a stable ARV regimen for ≥ 1 month or treatment naive (Individual is considered&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For &lt; 1 year of age, eGFR ≥ the minimum normal values for age according to the&#xD;
             information below using the Schwartz Formula&#xD;
&#xD;
