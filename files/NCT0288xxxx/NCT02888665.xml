    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride&#xD;
      when given together with pembrolizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients&#xD;
      with sarcoma that have spread to other parts of the body or that cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such&#xD;
      as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving doxorubicin hydrochloride together with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with sarcoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab and doxorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride (doxorubicin) in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the clinical response rate of advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients&#xD;
      receiving the combination of pembrolizumab and doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the clinical activity of pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced STS with&#xD;
      respect to time to response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the clinical activity of pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced STS with&#xD;
      respect to duration of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the clinical activity of pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced STS with&#xD;
      respect to progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the clinical activity of pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced STS with&#xD;
      respect to overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare response rates between patients with high levels of PD-L1 expression with those&#xD;
      who have PD-L1 absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of doxorubicin hydrochloride followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and doxorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride IV over 1-3 hours on day 1 of courses 2-7 only. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

            <groups_desc>The primary objective of the phase II design compared ORR with historical rates (Judson et al. Lancet Onc., 2014). A 2-stage design with null hypothesis of 15% using a 1-sided 0.05 α level test has 85% power to detect an increase to 35%. This required up to 35 patients. After 2 responses in stage 1 (20 pts), the study moved to stage 2 (15 pts). If 10 responses were seen (29%), this would have ruled out an ORR of 15%. The study was closed when it became clear we would not meet this benchmark.</groups_desc>
