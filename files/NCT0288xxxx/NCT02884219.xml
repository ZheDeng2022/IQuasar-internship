  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Much controversy exists about the optimal management of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in&#xD;
      preterm infants, especially in those born at a gestational age &lt;28 weeks and/or a birth&#xD;
      weight ≦1000 grams due to a lack of evidence for or against different approaches. A PDA has&#xD;
      been associated with serious complications. However, a common finding is that medical and/or&#xD;
      surgical treatment of a PDA seems not to reduce the risk of mortality or major morbidity.&#xD;
      This might be related to the fact that a substantial portion of preterm infants are treated&#xD;
      unnecessarily, because the ductus arteriosus (DA) might have closed spontaneously without any&#xD;
      specific intervention. An expectative approach is gaining interest, although convincing&#xD;
      evidence is still missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate whether in preterm infants &lt;28 weeks' gestation&#xD;
      with a PDA an expectative management is not inferior to early treatment with regard to the&#xD;
      composite of mortality and/or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and/or bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      dysplasia (BPD) at a postmenstrual age of 36 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtainment of informed consent the first echocardiographic evaluation is performed at a&#xD;
      postnatal age of 24-72 hours. In absence of exclusion criteria patients will only be&#xD;
      randomized when a PDA is present, the transductal diameter measures &gt;1.5 mm and a blood flow&#xD;
      pattern with a predominantly left-to-right shunt is observed. Randomization will assign the&#xD;
      neonate to either the medical treatment (COXi) arm or the expectative PDA management arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential that neonatal management is similar in both arms with the exception of the&#xD;
      prescription of COX-inhibition and routine echocardiographic examination after a course of&#xD;
      COXi in the medical treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical treatment arm When the patient is allocated to the medical treatment arm&#xD;
      COX-inhibition is prescribed and started as soon as possible, but no later than 3 hours after&#xD;
      the echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators prefer to use Ibuprofen (IBU) for COX-inhibition in this study. Aside from&#xD;
      the above mentioned reasons the investigators are confronted with an actual lack of&#xD;
      availability of indomethacin in most centers in the Netherlands and Belgium. However,&#xD;
      Indomethacin (INDO) can be prescribed for medical ductal closure if this is preferred by a&#xD;
      participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing schemes for IBU and INDO are according the local guidelines. For the first week of&#xD;
      life the birth weight is used for calculation of the COXi dosage. After a postnatal age of 7&#xD;
      days the actual weight is used for dose calculation, except when the actual weight is still&#xD;
      less than the birthweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment described above is considered standard of care in many NICU's worldwide. It&#xD;
      should be noted that there is no modification of the commonly advised usage of IBU in this&#xD;
      study. There are reports that suggest that an high dose of IBU might be more effective in&#xD;
      ductal closure in preterm infants, especially in those less than 27 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
      However, in a systematic review one refrained from recommendations regarding high dose IBU&#xD;
      because of the limited number of patients enrolled in studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preferred route of administration of IBU is intravenously. However, this is at the&#xD;
      disposal of the attending physician, since enteral administration appears at least as&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic reevaluation is performed at least 12 hours after the last (3rd) dose of&#xD;
      the first COXi course. If the ductus arteriosus is found to be closed, no further analysis or&#xD;
      treatment is needed regarding the ductus arteriosus. A ductus arteriosus is considered to be&#xD;
      closed when it can't be visualized using color Doppler imaging or when the transductal&#xD;
      diameter measures less than 0.5 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the ductus arteriosus hasn't closed, a second course of COX-inhibition is started at&#xD;
      least 24 hours after the third dose of the first course. COXi dosages are similar to the&#xD;
      first course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve to 24 hours after the last dose of the second course (6th gift) echocardiography is&#xD;
      performed. If the ductus arteriosus is found to be closed, no further analysis or treatment&#xD;
      is needed regarding the ductus arteriosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the duct failed to close after two courses of COXi (6 doses in total) and the PDA is&#xD;
      judged to be still hemodynamically significant, ductal ligation can be considered, only when&#xD;
      the so-called 'ligation criteria' are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectative PDA management arm Patients randomized to the expectative management arm will not&#xD;
      receive any COXi and PDA management in this group can be characterized as &quot;watchful waiting&quot;.&#xD;
      This is not a unique approach, since a restrictive approach towards a PDA is increasingly&#xD;
      used in many centers worldwide without the observation of an increased risk of neonatal&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity, such as severe chronic lung disease (CLD), intraventricular&#xD;
      hemorrhage (IVH), NEC and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential that neonatal management is similar in both study arms with the exception of&#xD;
      the prescription of COXi and echocardiography at the end of the drug course in the medical&#xD;
      treatment arm. It is of the upmost importance that NO extra interventions are to be&#xD;
      undertaken with the intention to conservatively prevent or treat a (suspected) PDA in the&#xD;
      expectative arm, such as fluid restriction and diuretics for that reason. Moreover, it should&#xD;
      be noted that there is insufficient evidence that fluid restriction and/or diuretics are of&#xD;
      any benefit in patients with a (suspected) PDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When during the first week the attending physician is of the opinion that the patient is in&#xD;
      danger, when it's deprived from treatment with COXi, open label treatment can only be&#xD;
      considered when the 'open label criteria' are met.&#xD;
