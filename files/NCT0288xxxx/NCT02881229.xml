    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a clinical database of patients presenting with vulvar complaints&#xD;
      in order to comprehensively assess the presentation and current trends in management of&#xD;
      vulvar disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vulvar disorders are common, but their frequency and importance are often under-recognized.&#xD;
      The spectrum of vulvar disease is vast and includes congenital malformations, inflammatory&#xD;
      mucocutaneous diseases, blistering and erosive diseases, benign and malignant tumors,&#xD;
      autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and various idiopathic conditions. Evaluation and&#xD;
      management of genital complaints and dermatoses are complicated by the frequent&#xD;
      multifactorial nature of vulvar symptoms and variable clinical expressions of disease on the&#xD;
      vulva. In many cases, empiric treatment is instituted in the absence of a definitive&#xD;
      diagnosis. Of note, expertise in the diagnosis and management of vulvar disorders is often&#xD;
      lacking on the parts of gynecology, dermatology and primary care physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek to analyze the data on this patient population at Northwestern&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital (NMH) and the outpatient clinics of the Northwestern Memorial Faculty&#xD;
      Foundation (NMFF) to better define the clinical spectrum of vulvar disease. The investigators&#xD;
      will also assess approaches to the diagnosis and management of patients with vulvar disease&#xD;
      with attention given to clinical outcome and the impact on quality of life. This information&#xD;
      with help the investigators to better understand the scope of care these patients currently&#xD;
      receive, to identify deficits in current practice, and to advance potential new standards of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
