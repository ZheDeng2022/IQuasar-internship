      A school-based behavioral intervention for Mexican youth with attention/behavior concerns&#xD;
      (the Collaborative Life Skills Program for Latinos/Familias Unidades Empezando Retos y Tareas&#xD;
      para el Éxito [CLS-FUERTE]:) will be pilot-tested in a mixed-method investigation with four&#xD;
      Mexican elementary schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include 24-32 students (n = 6-8 per 4 schools) in participating schools.&#xD;
      School personnel will help identify students with and at-risk for&#xD;
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with at least one caretaker and teacher able&#xD;
      to participate in the intervention. Students must be in 1st-6th grade at a participating&#xD;
      school and must demonstrate clinically significant attention/behavioral concerns and related&#xD;
      impairment as rated by caretakers and teachers. Caretakers and teachers must be able to&#xD;
      attend program sessions held at the child's school over an approximately 6-week period.&#xD;
      Through a school-clustered random assignment design, two schools will be selected to receive&#xD;
      CLS-FUERTE during the fall of the 2016-2017 school year and two schools will be selected to&#xD;
      receive school services as usual while waiting to receive CLS-FUERTE the spring of the&#xD;
      2016-2017 school year. Caregivers and teachers of students will complete questionnaires about&#xD;
      child behavior and family functioning and caregivers will participate in focus groups at 4&#xD;
      time points regardless of treatment assignment: Pre (prior to random assignment), Post 1&#xD;
      (following CLS-FUERTE in the fall cohort), Post 2 (following CLS-FUERTE for in spring&#xD;
      cohort), and Follow-up (at the end of the school year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility and acceptability of CLS-FUERTE will be examined via participation enrollment,&#xD;
      attendance, and engagement ratings and focus group feedback. Improvement in satisfaction with&#xD;
      school services and youth outcomes will be examined and estimates of effect sizes will be&#xD;
      used to support future scaled-up investigation.&#xD;
