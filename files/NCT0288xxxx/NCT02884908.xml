      The primary study objective is to determine the efficacy of pregabalin administered orally&#xD;
      for a period of 12 weeks in reducing risky drinking and symptoms of posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder who have selected genotypes at the gamma-amino butyric acid transporter and receptor&#xD;
      genes. The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in&#xD;
      participants with alcohol use disorder and co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder who&#xD;
      have selected genotypes at the gamma-amino butyric acid transporter and receptor genes. The&#xD;
      investigators will utilize a large and diverse sample of African-Americans that includes both&#xD;
      genders and individuals with different types of trauma. All participants will receive&#xD;
      standardized bi-weekly Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment (BBCET).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 60% of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a comorbid alcohol&#xD;
      use disorder (AUD). This comorbidity is associated with more severe PTSD symptoms, higher&#xD;
      rates of psychosocial and medical problems, higher relapse rates, and poorer treatment&#xD;
      outcome. Pre-clinical studies have indicated that PTSD and AUD share common molecular&#xD;
      underpinnings. Particularly, the adaptations in the brain neuro- transmitter systems to&#xD;
      chronic excessive drinking that are evident during alcohol withdrawal share similarities with&#xD;
      PTSD cluster B and E symptoms (characterized by symptoms of re-experiencing and&#xD;
      hyper-arousal), which initiate a cycle of relapse into excessive drinking and worsening of&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms. Excessive glutamate and reduced gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)&#xD;
      neurotransmitter concentrations were found in various brain regions in individuals with&#xD;
      co-morbid PTSD/AUD. The anticonvulsant pregabalin (with high affinity for the alpha-2-delta&#xD;
      auxiliary site of voltage gated calcium channels) that modulates the effects of the GABA&#xD;
      transporter (GAT-1) and increases its density of GABA, has shown preliminary efficacy in&#xD;
      reducing drinking in AUD with comorbid generalized anxiety disorder, and improves outcomes&#xD;
      from PTSD. Large scale studies with ample statistical power in VA settings and community&#xD;
      populations, with diverse combat and non-combat related trauma, are now warranted to evaluate&#xD;
      the promising preliminary evidence that pregabalin can improve outcomes for those with AUD&#xD;
      and PTSD. An important personalized medicine approach to optimize pregabalin efficacy would&#xD;
      be to select individuals with AUD and PTSD with genetic variation at the GAT-1 transporter so&#xD;
      as to match its potential therapeutic effects with specific types of individual. In&#xD;
      African-Americans, variants at the SLC6A1 gene promoter region insertion (i.e.,&#xD;
      non-insertion/insertion or insertion/insertion (NI/I or I/I) compared with those of&#xD;
      Non-insertion/Non-insertion (NI/NI) type have significantly higher levels of GAT-1promoter&#xD;
      activity. The investigators will, therefore, segregate our target sample by genetic variation&#xD;
      at the GAT-1 transporter. Because of the low allelic frequency of individuals with the double&#xD;
      copy insertion, the investigators will combine these into one group with those with the&#xD;
      single copy (i.e., NI/I/II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test pregabalin efficacy in reducing both AUD and PTSD Clusters B or E in 2&#xD;
      treatment groups of medication (pregabalin, placebo) x 2 genetic variants (NI/I/II vs. NI/NI)&#xD;
      in a double- blind, placebo-controlled 12-week clinical trial with a set target quit-date&#xD;
      (TQD) for drinking. The investigators will utilize a large and diverse sample of&#xD;
      African-Americans that includes both genders and individuals with different types of trauma.&#xD;
      Pregabalin dose and placebo will be titrated to the maximum dose from baseline to week 6&#xD;
      using a double-dummy procedure to ensure equivalence of capsules received. The TQD will be&#xD;
      set at week 6. The split design (post-TQD vs. pre-TQD) will allow the study to separately&#xD;
      examine both whether pregabalin's therapeutic effects reduce drinking and prevent relapse&#xD;
      post cessation and whether the cessation of drinking results in improved PTSD cluster B or E&#xD;
      symptoms in carriers of specific GAT-1 transporter genotypes. All participants will receive&#xD;
      standardized bi-weekly Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment (BBCET) and&#xD;
      follow-up post treatment and 3 month assessments. The specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that AUD patients treated with pregabalin and having&#xD;
      the non-insertion/insertion or insertion/insertion (NI/I or I/I) variant of the SLC6A1 gene&#xD;
      for GABA transporter (GAT-1) will be more predictive of the ability not drink heavily than&#xD;
      pregabalin-treated patients with the NI/NI genetic variant and placebo-treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that AUD patients treated with pregabalin and having&#xD;
      the non-insertion/insertion or insertion/insertion (NI/I or I/I) variant of the SLC6A1 gene&#xD;
      for GABA transporter (GAT-1) will be more efficacious in reducing PTSD cluster B or E&#xD;
      symptoms (or both) than pregabalin-treated patients with the NI/NI genetic variant and&#xD;
      placebo-treated patients.&#xD;
