    <textblock>
      Orthognathic surgery is commonly performed for the treatment of dentofacial deformities. Yet,&#xD;
      one of the most prevalent and long-term complication encountered is neurosensory disturbance&#xD;
      thus impairing sensation to parts of the face. In Hong Kong, it has been reported that in&#xD;
      patients receiving orthognathic surgery, 5.9% experience long-term neurosensory disturbance&#xD;
      post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin is a neurohormone that is produced and secreted by the pineal gland in the brain.&#xD;
      Its main physiological role in humans is to regulate sleep. Oral Melatonin supplements is&#xD;
      also used in the management of jetlag and other sleep disorders. Recently, animal and human&#xD;
      studies have shown Melatonin to improve tolerance to pain and to have a neuroprotective and&#xD;
      neuroregenerative effect after nerve injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, it is hypothesized that peri-surgical oral Melatonin supplement can improve&#xD;
      neurosensory recovery after orthognathic surgery&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthognathic surgery is a commonly accepted treatment modality for the management of&#xD;
      dentofacial deformities. Although in many cases, satisfying, if not excellent, aesthetic and&#xD;
      functional results can be obtained with orthognathic surgeries, this is not without risks;&#xD;
      and one of the most prevalent and long-term complication encountered is neurosensory&#xD;
      disturbance either in the inferior alveolar nerve or the infraorbital nerve depending on the&#xD;
      jaw receiving the osteotomy. A systematic review by JÄ™drzejewski et al. in 2015 reported&#xD;
      cranial nerve injury/sensitivity alteration to be the most common complication after&#xD;
      orthognathic surgery and is seen in 50% of cases, and almost all patients will report altered&#xD;
      sensation in the immediate post-operative period. Although this will decrease over time,&#xD;
      Henzelka et al. have reported a 3% incidence of paresthesia in the inferior alveolar nerve 1&#xD;
      year post-surgery, and Thygesen et al. reported sensory changes in the infraorbital nerve in&#xD;
      7 to 60% of patients depending on site of measurement 1 year post-surgery. In Hong Kong, a&#xD;
      10-year retrospective study of 581 patients by Lee et al. in 2013 reported a 5.9% rate of&#xD;
      neurosensory disturbance 1-year post-orthognathic surgery. Of these cases, the majority&#xD;
      affected the inferior alveolar nerve, and the combination of ramus osteotomies together with&#xD;
      anterior mandibular osteotomies significantly increased the chances of permanent neurosensory&#xD;
      disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biosynthesis of Melatonin:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a neurohormone that is endogenously produced and&#xD;
      secreted by the pineal gland in the brain in a circadian rhythm, with a plasma concentration&#xD;
      highest at night and lowest during the day. Its normal physiological roles in humans are to&#xD;
      regulate diurnal rhythm, sleep, mood, immunity, reproduction, intestinal motility, and&#xD;
      metabolism. Oral exogenous melatonin has been used in the management of jetlag and other&#xD;
      sleep disorders. Recently, animal and human studies have shown melatonin to improve tolerance&#xD;
      to tourniquet pain in patients receiving hand surgery performed under regional anaesthesia,&#xD;
      to improve dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and to have a&#xD;
      neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effect after nerve injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacology of Melatonin:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Bioavailability: The absorption and bioavailability after oral intake of Melatonin varies&#xD;
      greatly. Absorption of Melatonin can range from complete in younger patients and decrease to&#xD;
      approximately 50% in the elderly. Bioavailability is usually approximately 15% due to&#xD;
      variations in first-pass metabolism. Peak value is ususally observed 60 - 150min after oral&#xD;
      consumption. When applied topically to the skin, it has been found that topical application&#xD;
      of 0.01% Melatonin cream will increase serum levels of Melatonin from a mean of 4.9pg/mL&#xD;
      pre-application to 5.1pg/mL 1-hour post-application to 8.1pg/mL 8-hours post-application, and&#xD;
      to 9.0pg/mL 24-hours post-application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Distribution: Melatonin is highly lipid-soluble with a protein binding capacity of&#xD;
      approximately 60%. In vitro, Melatonin has been shown to mainly bind to albumin, alpha1-acid&#xD;
      glycoprotein and high-density lipoprotein. Due to its high lipid-solubility, Melatonin has&#xD;
      the ability to cross most membrane barriers, including the blood-brain barrier and placenta&#xD;
      and can be found in saliva, serum, and urine after oral administration. Melatonin receptors&#xD;
      can be found in many tissues throughout the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Biotransformation and Excretion: Melatonin is mainly hydroxylated by cytochrome P450&#xD;
      (CYP1A2) in the liver into 6-hydroxymelatonin with a small amount into the serotonin&#xD;
      metabolites cyclic 3-hydroxymelatonin and indolinone tautomer of 2-hydroxymelatonin. These&#xD;
      are further conjugated to their sulfate and glucuronide conjuates and excreted in the urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usages of Melatonin:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from the regulating sleep and diurnal rhythm, exogenous Melatonin has been recently&#xD;
      proved in animal studies and randomized controlled trials in humans to be beneficial in many&#xD;
      other areas of medicine and surgery, mostly hypothesized to be due to its antioxidative&#xD;
      properties that reduce inflammatory mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial by Mowafi and Ismail in 2008 have shown that in patients who&#xD;
      required hand surgery with the use of tourniquet under regional anaesthesia, pre-medication&#xD;
      with 10mg oral Melatonin 90 minutes before surgery can significanly reduce verbal pain score&#xD;
      for tourniquet pain when compared to the placebo group. The time to the first dose of&#xD;
      post-operative analgesic request was significantly longer in the Melatonin group and the&#xD;
      amount of post-operative analgesic consumption in the Melatonin group was also significantly&#xD;
      lower. No significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects between the Melatonin&#xD;
      and placebo groups was reported in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies have shown neuroregenerative and neuroprotective effects of Melatonin. In a&#xD;
      controlled study in rats, Atik et al. have shown Melatonin to be beneficial in promoting&#xD;
      nerve recovery at high doses. In this study, the tibial and peroneal branches of the sciatic&#xD;
      nerve were dissected and subsequently coapted with prolene suture. Post-trauma, 10mg/kg&#xD;
      Melatonin was injected intraperitoneally for 21 days. Histologically, rats which received&#xD;
      Melatonin exhibited less endoneural collagen with better organizad collagen along the repair&#xD;
      line of the nerve. There were also fewer demyelinized axons. By 12 weeks post-trauma, walking&#xD;
      track analysis showed significantly better function in the Melatonin group when measured with&#xD;
      the sciatic function index (SFI). Electrophysiological findings showed that by 12 weeks&#xD;
      post-trauma, the latency was significantly less in the Melatonin group, whilst action&#xD;
      potential amplitude and nerve conduction velocity were significantly higher in the Melatonin&#xD;
      group compared to the control group. It was concluded in this study that high doses of&#xD;
      Melatonin has a significant beneficial effect on nerve recovery as measured functionally,&#xD;
      histopathologically, and electrophysiologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another controlled study in rats, Kaya et al. have shown beneficial effects of Melatonin&#xD;
      on cut and crush injured sciatic nerve. In this study Melatonin was administered&#xD;
      intraperitoneally at a dose of 50mg/kg/day for 6 weeks post-trauma. In terms of SFI values,&#xD;
      Melatonin treatment accelerated the recovery process to reach -50 SFI level by the 3rd week,&#xD;
      as compared to the placebo group, which only reached this SFI level by the 6th week.&#xD;
      Histologically, rats treated with Melatonin showed better strutural preservation of the&#xD;
      myelin sheaths compared to the control group. Biochemically, the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      Melatonin was further comfirmed by showing lower lipid peroxidation and higher superoxide&#xD;
      dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities in sciatic nerve samples when&#xD;
      compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar beneficial effects were reported by Zencirci et al. in their study of Melatonin in&#xD;
      peripheral nerve crush injury in rats. In their study, rats were allocated into the control&#xD;
      group or into the treatment group, which further divided into a group receiving 5mg/kg&#xD;
      intraperitoneal Melatonin for 21 days post-trauma, and another group receiving 20mg/kg for&#xD;
      the same length of time. Again, they have shown an increase in SFI values in the injured&#xD;
      sciatic nerves treated with Melatonin when compared to the control group.&#xD;
      Electrophysiological measurements again showed that Melatonin treatment deceased the latency&#xD;
      values and increased the conduction velocities. However, it was not mentioned whether&#xD;
      significant differences were observed between the group receiving 5mg/kg Melatonin and&#xD;
      20mg/kg Melatonin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fujimoto et al. were also able to show a potent protective effect of Melatonin on spinal cord&#xD;
      injury. In this study, experimental ischemic-induced spinal cord injury was inflicted in&#xD;
      rats. Subesequently, the rats were either placed in the controlled group or received 2.5mg/kg&#xD;
      Melatonin injected intraperitoneally at 5 minutes, then 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after injury. It&#xD;
      was found that Melatonin reduced the occurrence of neutrophil-induced lipid peroxidation.&#xD;
      Melatonin also reduced thiobarbituric acid reactive substance content and myeloperoxidase&#xD;
      activity, which were responsible for motor deficits. Histologically, findings from the&#xD;
      Melatonin group showed less cavity formation than the control group.&#xD;
