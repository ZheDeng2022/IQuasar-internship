    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to evaluate and validate the accuracy and usability&#xD;
      of a deployed beta sensor-based system. This is a cross-sectional validation study of 100&#xD;
      apparently health community dwelling adults aged 60+ years. Participants will perform&#xD;
      standardized lifestyle, exercise and sedentary type physical activities in a clinic&#xD;
      laboratory and home setting.&#xD;

      Wearable activity monitors have the potential to continuously and objectively measure&#xD;
      physical activity. However, existing monitors do not address the unique challenges that face&#xD;
      older adults, who comprise the largest segment of population who suffer from physical&#xD;
      disabilities and dexterity issues that can make using such monitors exceedingly difficult. In&#xD;
      fact, the majority of wearable devices on the market address the needs of three broad&#xD;
      segments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Consumers: these devices are designed and optimized for motivated, healthy younger&#xD;
           individuals and require pairing with smartphones to transmit data, while restricting or,&#xD;
           at best, limiting access to raw data and algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Researchers: research-focused devices tend to be validated across a wide range of&#xD;
           studies, but are not optimized for wearability or longitudinal use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Developers: Developer-focused devices typically provide high configurability, a high-&#xD;
           definition screen, and a variety of sensors (e.g. accelerometer, gyroscope, air&#xD;
           pressure, light, temperature, etc.) that are suited for research and development, but&#xD;
           are not optimized for power-efficient use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the barriers that existing monitors impose on measuring free-living physical&#xD;
      activity data, EveryFit developed in-home activity monitoring technology that addresses the&#xD;
      specific and unique needs of the older population (incorporated in product called QMedic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this project is to evaluate and validate the accuracy and usability&#xD;
      of a deployed beta sensor-based system. The technology utilizes novel power-efficient&#xD;
      engineering to continuously measure physical activity (including intensity, type and&#xD;
      duration) in both laboratory and free-living settings. To accomplish this objective we will&#xD;
      enroll 100 adults 60+ years of age who will perform standardized lifestyle, exercise and&#xD;
      sedentary type physical activity in the laboratory. A subset of participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to wear the monitor in free-living settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work can have far-reaching impact given the growth in the older adult&#xD;
      population, which suffers disproportionally from chronic disease and functional impairments.&#xD;
      Validating technology that measures physical activity continuously and accurately at the home&#xD;
      is a critical step in scaling the system, conducting affordable population- scale studies,&#xD;
      and maximizing the societal impact of the innovation.&#xD;
