    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to develop and test a care model to treat excessive&#xD;
      drinking and alcohol use disorders in the primary care setting. The goal of this research&#xD;
      study is to increase the identification and treatment of problem drinking in the primary care&#xD;
      setting. Individuals will be asked to participate in this study because routine screening and&#xD;
      assessment conducted at your primary care clinic indicates that you have recently exceeded&#xD;
      healthy drinking limits as outlined by the National Institutes of Alcohol and Alcoholism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive drinking (ED) and alcohol use disorders (AUD) remain one of the nation's leading&#xD;
      public health problems, yet this problem is largely under-recognized and undertreated.&#xD;
      Although many people with ED/AUD see a primary care physician annually, there has been&#xD;
      limited research and implementation of models to treat ED/AUD in primary care. Important&#xD;
      changes in the healthcare system and advances in alcohol research offer new and potentially&#xD;
      transformative opportunities to integrate ED/AUD treatment into primary care practices. In&#xD;
      particular, these changes have led to the development of new patient-centered, integrated&#xD;
      care models that facilitate the treatment behavioral health issues in primary care. Experts&#xD;
      have repeatedly called for the development of a chronic care model to treat alcohol problems&#xD;
      in primary care, similar to models now used to treat other chronic illnesses, including&#xD;
      depression. Yet, research to develop and test such models has been surprisingly limited. The&#xD;
      primary aim of this study is to develop and test a chronic care model to treat ED/AUD in the&#xD;
      patient-centered model home (PCMH) using the NIH stage model of intervention development.&#xD;
      Specifically, using a mixed methods approach, this study proposes to adapt and test the&#xD;
      collaborative care (CC) model for depression to treat ED/AUD in a high volume PCMH.&#xD;
      Importantly, we will build the CC model onto a Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to&#xD;
      Treatment (SBIRT) program that is already in place in the PCMH. Notably, this SBIRT model&#xD;
      currently refers those with ED/AUD out to specialty treatment providers. The proposed study&#xD;
      will be conducted in two phases. Phase I will involve initial adaptation of the CC model for&#xD;
      depression. During this phase, relevant depression CC protocols and measures will be adapted&#xD;
      for ED/AUD and piloted tested on participants (n = 25) recruited in a PCMH. Phase II will&#xD;
      involve model refinement based on iterative cycles of patient and PCMH staff feedback and&#xD;
      examination of drinking outcome data. During this phase, participants (n = 60) will be&#xD;
      assessed and followed for three months. Iterative development will focus on: 1) utilizing a&#xD;
      stepped-care model of treatment which will include outpatient detoxification, behavioral&#xD;
      interventions, and medication intervention and management, 2) maximizing patient engagement,&#xD;
      and 3) balancing the resource and expertise constraints of treating ED/AUD in a PCMH.&#xD;
      Participants in Phases 1 and 2 will be followed at 1 and 3 months and primary outcome data on&#xD;
      drinking outcomes will be examined.&#xD;

    <description>Participants, who choose medication treatment, will be offered naltrexone (50 mg per day), which is an FDA-Approved medication for alcohol use disorder. According to the package insert for NTX, the medication has been associated with liver toxicity at very high doses (up to 300 mg/day); however, a number of clinical trials and published studies suggest there are few serious adverse effects, including minimal hepatotoxicity, associated with daily dose of 50 mg of naltrexone. Its most common side effects in opioid-free individuals are nausea, vomiting, anxiety, headache, abdominal discomfort, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, irritability, and decreased appetite. A rare serious adverse effect may include minimal liver toxicity, but is more likely to occur at very high doses (300 mg/day).</description>
