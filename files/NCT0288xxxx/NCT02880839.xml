      History and current status of related studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cervical pedicle is a tiny structure adjacent to important tissues including the spinal&#xD;
      cord and vertebral artery. Cervical pedicle screw internal fixation is the conventional&#xD;
      treatment for cervical spine fracture, and the technique provides acceptable internal&#xD;
      fixation; however, current manipulation methods result in high pedicle screw penetration&#xD;
      rates, a high risk of damage to peripheral vessels and nerves, and high rates of&#xD;
      postoperative deformity. Improved techniques and minimally invasive methods such as&#xD;
      transcutaneous pedicle screw implantation have been designed to effectively reduce&#xD;
      surgery-related injury while maintaining the accuracy and safety of pedicle screw&#xD;
      implantation. Unfortunately, there is no unified standard regarding implantation of cervical&#xD;
      pedicle screws, and many pedicle screw implantation methods are used including partial&#xD;
      cervical lamina excision and pipeline-dredge discharge. However, both of these techniques are&#xD;
      clinically limited because of poor maneuverability. Digital navigation is an emerging&#xD;
      technique based on the discrete-accumulation principle. The technique integrates computer&#xD;
      methods, numerical control, laser and new materials, and provides a new digital technique for&#xD;
      confirming the location and orientation of cervical pedicle screws, ensuring safe surgical&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Features different from other related studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies focused primarily on investigating the curative effects of pedicle screw&#xD;
      implantation in cervical spine fracture. To the best of the investigators knowledge, there&#xD;
      are no studies of cervical spine fracture treatment by digital navigation-assisted cervical&#xD;
      pedicle screw placement before June 2006 in Web of Science. The investigators located two&#xD;
      similar articles (Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy Surgical Trial (identifier: NCT02076113)&#xD;
      and Slotted Hole Versus Fixed Hole C-Tek (identifier: NCT00585923)) in a search of&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov up to June 2006. The outcome measures in these two studies included bony&#xD;
      fusion Short Form 36 and the physical component score. In contrast to these two studies&#xD;
      regarding inclusion criteria and grouping, the investigators study was designed to&#xD;
      investigate the accuracy and safety of digital navigation-assisted cervical pedicle screw&#xD;
      placement, hoping to provide valuable quantitative evidence for the clinical application of&#xD;
      this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible adverse events included any expected or unexpected symptoms. If severe adverse&#xD;
      events occurred, their details including the date of occurrence and measures taken to treat&#xD;
      the adverse events were reported to the principal investigator and the institutional review&#xD;
      board within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, management, analysis and open access&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Case report forms with demographic data, disease diagnosis, accompanying&#xD;
      diseases, drug allergy history, and adverse events were collected, processed using Epidata&#xD;
      software (Epidata Association, Odense, Denmark), collated, and then recorded electronically&#xD;
      by data managers using a double-data entry strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: The locked electronic database was accessible and locked only by the project&#xD;
      manager, and was not altered. Paper and electronic data regarding screening, informed&#xD;
      consent, and clinical outcomes have been preserved at the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong&#xD;
      University, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The electronic database was statistically analyzed by a professional&#xD;
      statistician who created an outcome analysis report that was submitted to the lead&#xD;
      researchers. An independent data monitoring committee supervised and managed the trial data,&#xD;
      ensuring a scientific and stringent trial to yield accurate and complete data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data open access: Anonymized trial data was published at http://www.figshare.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed by a statistician using SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS Inc.) and&#xD;
      followed the intention-to-treat principle. Normally distributed measurement data was&#xD;
      expressed as mean, standard deviation, and minimums and maximums. Non-normally distributed&#xD;
      measurement data were expressed as lower quartile (q1), and median and upper quartile (q3).&#xD;
      The Kruskal-Wallis H-test was used to compare the visual analogue scale spine scores among&#xD;
      the three groups, and Fisher's exact test was used to compare the degree of bony fusion of&#xD;
      the atlantoaxial joint and the incidence of adverse reactions. P &lt; 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
