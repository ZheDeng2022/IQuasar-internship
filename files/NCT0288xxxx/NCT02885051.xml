  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to correlate the composite PIPP-R (Premature Infant Pain&#xD;
      Profile-Revised) scale and the parasympathetic nervous system (heart rate variability).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The premature newborns hospitalized for several weeks are exposed to a significant number of&#xD;
      nursing procedures or painful or stressful medical. Repeated pain in the neonatal period may&#xD;
      have negative consequences in the short and / or long term. The diagnosis of pain remains&#xD;
      difficult because based on the hetero-assessment involving the use of validated scales. The&#xD;
      PIPP-R scale (Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised) appears to be the most complete and best&#xD;
      validated scale as composite (behavior items, vegetative and contextual). However, it is&#xD;
      rarely used in routine care in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatives to clinical scoring the pain level were described, in particular the analysis of&#xD;
      the variability of the heart rate [VHR] by HFVI index (High Frequency Variability Index) or&#xD;
      skin conductance. The analysis of the spectral components of high frequencies or HFVI would&#xD;
      be an indicator of parasympathetic activity. The HFVI was compared to the EDIN scale, purely&#xD;
      behavioral level, proposed as chronic pain marker. Skin conductance would be a stress marker&#xD;
      reflecting variations of the sympathetic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These techniques are currently marketed for routine use. However, these methods have been&#xD;
      compared and the NIPE (Newborn Infant parasympathetic Evaluation), which assesses the HFVI&#xD;
      index, was not compared to a validated scale procedural acute pain (such as PIPP-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems important, before disseminating these methods, explore the consistency of these&#xD;
      techniques with each other and validated scales, and their acceptability by nurses.&#xD;

    At the end of the inclusion period, the observed correlations were much lower than expected.&#xD;
    Thus, it did not seem relevant to prolong the inclusions.&#xD;
