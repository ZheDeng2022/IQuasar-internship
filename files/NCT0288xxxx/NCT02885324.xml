      This pilot will study the feasibility and exploratory efficacy of using Cabozantinib for&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory central nervous system tumors for which there are no curative&#xD;
      options. Patients will also be followed for safety, time to progression, event free survival&#xD;
      and overall survival&#xD;
