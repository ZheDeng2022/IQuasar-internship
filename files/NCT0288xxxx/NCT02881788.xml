  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minnesota Healthy Brain Initiative will be an ongoing project that aims to increase awareness&#xD;
      regarding brain health and its maintenance as well as increasing awareness of the impact of&#xD;
      alcohol on brain function. In the immediate future, we hope to obtain data from a non-injured&#xD;
      normative, diverse population represented by the state fair patrons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that a non-invasive 30-minute test, requiring a subject to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires and watch images on a TV screen, will yield information relevant to both&#xD;
      diagnosis and prognosis of neurological state. To clarify, these tests will not produce&#xD;
      information that would involve a diagnostic finding for the participants. We will measure eye&#xD;
      movements under a range of visual conditions, including saccades, fixations, smooth pursuit,&#xD;
      scan paths and optico-kinetic nystagmus&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving proper introduction and signing the proper consent forms, the subject will&#xD;
      receive instructions to carry out cognitive assessments and answer verbal questionnaires. The&#xD;
      subject will also undergo eye tracking. In order to validate the data collected by our&#xD;
      eye-trackers, we may ask the subject to complete a non-invasive vision assessment and a&#xD;
      breathalyzer assessment. Due to the nature of the breathalyzer assessment, we have decided&#xD;
      not to administer the breathalyzer assessment to subjects who are under the age of 21 and/or&#xD;
      pregnant. We also refuse to disclose the results of the breathalyzer assessment to the&#xD;
      subject since the data will be collected only for research purposes. Subjects' eye movements&#xD;
      will be tracked binocularly at a fixed distance from a computer monitor over a brief time&#xD;
      period. The visual stimuli will be video clips appropriate for a general or pediatric&#xD;
      audience. If at any point the subject becomes uncomfortable, the procedure will be aborted&#xD;
      and can be resumed at a later time.&#xD;
