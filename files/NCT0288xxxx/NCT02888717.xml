    <textblock>
      The para-aortic lymph node involvement in the advanced stage of cervical cancer is a poor&#xD;
      prognostic factor for overall survival. Concomitant chemo-radiotherapy has become the&#xD;
      standard treatment for advanced cervical cancer. In case of para-aortic lymph node&#xD;
      involvement, an extension of radiotherapy fields is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective multicentre study shown that the survival rate of patients with node ≤ 5 mm and&#xD;
      which benefited from the expansion of radiotherapy fields was identical to the survival of&#xD;
      pN0 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, due to a specific disease, this technique should not be performed in all patients.&#xD;
      It is necessary to reliably select patients with retroperitoneal lymph node involvement. For&#xD;
      this, it is recommended that prior to the concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, nodal staging&#xD;
      surgery with a definitive histological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So we propose to use molecular diagnostic test OSNA (One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification) to&#xD;
      improve lymph node metastasis detection sensitivity to achieve ultra-staging compared to&#xD;
      conventional histology.&#xD;

      The para-aortic lymph node involvement in the advanced stage of cervical cancer is a poor&#xD;
      prognostic factor for overall survival. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard&#xD;
      treatment for advanced cervical cancer. In case of para-aortic lymph node involvement, an&#xD;
      extension of radiotherapy fields is recommended.&#xD;

      A prospective multicenter study shown that the survival rate of patients with node ≤ 5 mm and&#xD;
      which benefited from the expansion of radiotherapy fields was identical to the survival of&#xD;
      pN0 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, due to a specific disease, this technique should not be performed in all patients.&#xD;
      It is necessary to reliably select patients with retroperitoneal lymph node involvement. For&#xD;
      this, it is recommended that prior to the concurrent chemoradiotherapy, nodal staging surgery&#xD;
      with a definitive histological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So we suggest using molecular diagnostic test OSNA (One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification) to&#xD;
      improve lymph node metastasis detection sensitivity to achieve ultra-staging compared to&#xD;
      conventional histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to consider a new concordance study to assess the feasibility of the technical&#xD;
      OSNA in a new indication: cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis protocol of a concordance study is the same regardless of the location of the&#xD;
      cancer. We evaluate the use of OSNA in order to ultrastaging of lymph node involvement for&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that OSNA would be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  better than the usual histological staging method&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and equivalence in terms of sensitivity and specificity compared to intensive&#xD;
           histological method To complete this study we propose to search the initial brain tumor&#xD;
           expression of cytokeratin 19.&#xD;

    <description>The main objective is to compare the performance of OSNA to both conventional methods and intensive histological analysis, for the detection of lymph node metastases in advanced cervical cancer.&#xD;
The evaluation criteria is :&#xD;
Determination of number of lymph node metastases expressed in a size in mm for conventional and intensive histological analysis.&#xD;
Determination of the number of lymph node metastases expressed in a number of copies in molecular biology.</description>

    <description>The para-aortic dissection surgery is performed in the usual way. The lymph nodes are isolated from fat tissue during surgery, and cut into 4 slices sterile.&#xD;
Slices A and C are sent OSNA analysis&#xD;
Slices B and D are sent ultimately histological analysis (1 cup HES or 5 cup HES + IHC) The nodes of less than 5 mm will be sent in final histological analysis due to the inability to cut into 4.&#xD;
After the analysis, the report indicates whether the node is:&#xD;
Free (-): &lt;250 copies&#xD;
Micrometastatic (+): 250 ≤ - &lt;5,000 copies,&#xD;
Macrometastatic (++): ≥ 5000 copies.</description>
