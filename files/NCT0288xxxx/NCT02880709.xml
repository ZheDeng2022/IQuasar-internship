  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major weight loss and taste changes are well documented in patients with hematological cancer&#xD;
      during chemotherapy. It has previously been documented, that such patients have preferences&#xD;
      for much umami, a little sweet, sour and salt, and no bitter. The purpose of the study was to&#xD;
      convert these results into real diets. Patients participated in two sensory pilot studies&#xD;
      (n=10), where dishes were tested for preferences before and after chemotherapy. From these&#xD;
      results four dishes were selected and tested on 32 patients in 30 days in a cross-over&#xD;
      design. The diets resulted in a beneficial and statistical significant difference in weight&#xD;
      development (p= 0.0008), with 1.2 ± 1.9 kg (+2%) in the intervention period and -2.8 ± 5.2 kg&#xD;
      (-4%) in the control period. This difference persisted after sensitivity analysis (± 10%) p=&#xD;
      0.005. However, the nutritional intake was still low in both periods, and the treatment with&#xD;
      cytarabin turned out to be a major confounder as dosage was significantly higher in the&#xD;
      control period.&#xD;

      The study was approved by the regional scientific ethical committee, and was registered in&#xD;
      ClinicalTrial.gov NTC no………...&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were selected consecutively with acute and chronic leukemia and lymphoma, Hodg-kin's&#xD;
      lymphoma, and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in treatment with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients were aged &gt;18 years, and only patients who were able to com-municate and&#xD;
      understand written and oral information and receive food orally were included. The special&#xD;
      diets were developed at the Central Kitchen at Rigshospitalet Initially, two single blinded&#xD;
      pilot studies of five patients were performed, with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      as the main study. In the first study patients tested 17 dishes with a taste-mix of&#xD;
      dominating umami, a little sweet, sour and salt, and no bitter. In the second round six&#xD;
      dishes were selected based on the results from the first round. All dishes had a high&#xD;
      energy-density, with a protein content of at least 5 g/100 g. Every dish was tested both&#xD;
      before and after chemotherapy. Patients rated acceptability on 9-point scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical controlled cross-over design with two periods of four weeks, intervention and&#xD;
      control, tested four dishes selected after the second pilot study. 32 patients were included&#xD;
      in that trial, and they started with their habitual diet as control and then switched to&#xD;
      recommendation of introduction of the four dishes selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients registered their weight every time they were at the hospital. During the&#xD;
      intervention period the patients received a recipe booklet with the four dishes and a noted&#xD;
      every time they ingested one of these. Compliance measurements were based on this&#xD;
      registration. Patients had access to the dishes when in-patients, but they did their own&#xD;
      cooking at home. It was possible to buy the similar dishes as pre-prepared meals in the&#xD;
      supermarkets. The dishes in the final study were: Chili con Carne, Chicken in Curry, Curry&#xD;
      Soup and Pasta Carbonara with added curry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed with R (version 2.15.3). In histograms used to show the degree of&#xD;
      acceptability for the dishes in the pilot studies, answers above 5 were graded as high grade&#xD;
      of acceptance. To present descriptive statistics, the results were expressed as mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD), median (interquartile range (IQR)) and range. As the data did not&#xD;
      show a normal distribution, Wilcoxon rang-sum tests (paired and unpaired) were used. Analyses&#xD;
      were carried out both according to intention-to- treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP)&#xD;
      principles. As many of the data sampled, especially the subjective ones, sensitivity analysis&#xD;
      (± 10% correction of the results) were performed.&#xD;
