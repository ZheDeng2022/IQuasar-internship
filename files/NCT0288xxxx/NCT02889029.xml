      Dedicated Airway Stents for Central Airway Stenoses&#xD;
&#xD;
      DASCAS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toulouse University Hospital is the sponsor of this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be conducted with the support of AnatomikModeling and ADERSPOT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Background: Tracheobronchial stent are devices designed to manage central airway&#xD;
           stenoses of various origins. Their shape and sizes are however not suitable for stenosis&#xD;
           of complex anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purpose: The investigators propose to test the feasibility and safety of treating&#xD;
           complex airway stenoses with dedicated tailored stents wrought by 3D computer-assisted&#xD;
           conception&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract: Central airway obstruction is currently managed with non-personalized stents, which&#xD;
      are usually efficient but lead to severe and potentially lethal complications in 10% of cases&#xD;
      (stent migration, obstructive granuloma, perforation, hemoptysis). These stents seem&#xD;
      particularly unsuited for anatomically complex stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dedicated airway stents (wrought and tailored by 3D computer-assisted conception based on 3D&#xD;
      chest CT-scan), by fitting perfectly tracheal or bronchial anatomy, should dramatically&#xD;
      improve the tolerance and safety of such prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first feasibility study, dedicated to patients suffering from anatomically complex&#xD;
      stenosis will test the safety of treating patients with these new approach. It should lead to&#xD;
      larger studies evaluating these new types of stents in larger indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3D computer-assisted modelization of airways, a virtual prosthesis and its shape are&#xD;
      designed and the shape of the stent is wrought by 3D-machining by AnatomikModeling®. The&#xD;
      stent is then build and sterilized by Sebbin® and inserted during rigid bronchoscopy on the&#xD;
      same terms as pre-existing models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Close follow up is then conducted, including clinical evaluation after one week, three and&#xD;
      six months; spirometry at one week and 6 months and chest CT-scan at one week.&#xD;

      Study design: Prospective monocentric feasibility study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm number or label and arm type: Only one experimental arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signature of a informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of clinical data (age, sex, etiology, site and mechanism of the stenosis, previous&#xD;
      treatments dyspnea, quality of life (VQ11 questionnaire))&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest CT-scan without contrast under continuous positive pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry (peak flow, FEV1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer-assisted modelization of the shape of the prosthesis using 3D reconstruction of&#xD;
      CT-scan&#xD;

      Machining of the shape in Ertacetal® (AnatomikModeling®)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fabrication and sterilization of the stent in silicon (Sebbin®)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insertion of the stent under rigid bronchoscopy and general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up at one week, 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest CT-scan without contrast at 1 week, spirometry at 1 week and 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects : 10 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcome, percentages of procedures conducted without complication at 1 week,&#xD;
      3 months, and 6 months and their confidence interval at 95% and incidences at 1 week, 3&#xD;
      months and 6 months for each complication will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentages of procedures conducted with improvement of dyspnea (improvement of at least&#xD;
           one point of NYHA score) at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months and their confidence interval&#xD;
           at 95% will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentages of procedures conducted with improvement of quality of life (improvement of&#xD;
           at least 10% of VQ11 score) at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months and their confidence&#xD;
           interval at 95% will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentages of procedures conducted with improvement of functional parameters&#xD;
           (improvement of at least 20% of DEP or FEV1) at 1 week and 6 months and their confidence&#xD;
           interval at 95% will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of procedures conducted with radiologic congruence of the stent at 1 week and&#xD;
           its confidence interval at 95% will be calculated.&#xD;
