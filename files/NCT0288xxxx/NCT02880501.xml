      History and current status of related studies Intertrochanteric femoral fracture frequently&#xD;
      occurs in the elderly that is often complicated by different levels of osteoporosis, and&#xD;
      mostly belongs to unstable fractures. This disorder is also frequently complicated by various&#xD;
      chronic diseases, which make patients have poorer surgical tolerance. Surgical treatment is&#xD;
      the widely accepted treatment method of intertrochanteric femoral fracture because it can&#xD;
      accelerate the recovery and reduce the complications caused by long-term bed time.&#xD;
      Intertrochanteric femoral fracture is unstable and occurs mostly in the elderly, so surgical&#xD;
      treatment should meet the requirements including less risk of wound infection, less&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss, great holding potential and strong stability of the implants,&#xD;
      which contribute to early hip joint function exercise and facilitate recovery after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the design principle of orthopedic implants, intramedullary and extramedullary&#xD;
      fixations are commonly used. Compared to extramedullary fixation, intramedullary fixation&#xD;
      places fixators closer to the affected region, produces shorter moment arm of force, better&#xD;
      shares the compression forces on the medial cortex of the femoral neck, exhibits higher shear&#xD;
      resistance, and provides greater stabilization for complex fractures in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to Garmma nail, an AO (Association for Osteosynthesis) proximal femoral nail has an&#xD;
      antirotation screw in the proximal end which ensures an elastic fixation of the fracture and&#xD;
      reduces the complications such as femoral shaft fractures. Nevertheless, 2 screws should be&#xD;
      installed in the femoral neck, which restricts the slippage between the main screw and the&#xD;
      compression screw, thus partial loading will be delivered through antirotation screws,&#xD;
      leading to occurrence of complications such as antirotation screw cutting and compression&#xD;
      screw withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional internal fixation methods including implantations of dynamic hip screws, Gamma&#xD;
      nails, and proximal femoral intramedullary nail exhibit unfavorable effects in the treatment&#xD;
      of intertrochanteric femoral fracture, in particular those complicated by severe osteoporosis&#xD;
      because these methods cannot achieve firm and reliable fixation with occasional nail head&#xD;
      cutting and nail withdrawal. Therefore, AO/ASIF (Association for Osteosynthesis/Association&#xD;
      for the Study of Internal Fixation) designed a novel antirotation intramedullary nail, which&#xD;
      better reduces the abovementioned complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) is a device designed based on proximal femoral&#xD;
      intramedullary nail and other intramedullary nails. This device is equipped with a spiral&#xD;
      wide blade which exhibits obvious antirotation and angular shear stress abilities, greatly&#xD;
      reducing complications and decreasing the possibility of surgical delay. Compared to&#xD;
      conventional screw systems, PFNA provides stronger antirotation and anti-inversion abilities.&#xD;
      For tapping of a spiral blade in the femoral neck, only lateral femoral cortex should be&#xD;
      opened without a need to remove bone matrix. The spiral blade tapped in the femoral neck will&#xD;
      produce compression to the bone in the femoral neck. Even though for patients with severe&#xD;
      osteoporosis, the spiral blade in the femoral neck can produce firm anchoring force with the&#xD;
      femoral neck. Compared with screw fixation, a spiral blade exhibits a larger rotational&#xD;
      torque, requires a smaller strength to be pulled out, and does not need additional screws&#xD;
      tapped in the femoral neck, so the latter is easier to be operated. The PFNA has a&#xD;
      medial-lateral angle of 6Â°, this allows insertion at the tip of the greater trochanter. The&#xD;
      distal diameter of the PFNA is relatively small, and its eccentricity is reduced compared to&#xD;
      that of intramedullary nails, which is more suitable to the anatomical morphology of proximal&#xD;
      femoral medullary cavity. The locking pores of the PFNA at its distal tip include round&#xD;
      static and oval-shaped dynamic types. Vertical installation of screws is considered dynamic&#xD;
      interlocking and oblique installation of screws static interlocking. From the perspective of&#xD;
      design, PFNA exhibits better biomechanical stability and shows advantages in duration of&#xD;
      surgery, intraoperative blood loss, failure rate of surgery and overall complications over&#xD;
      than internal fixation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFNA for the treatment of intertrochanteric femoral fracture in many cases has been reported,&#xD;
      but related studies are mainly retrospective case series, and a few retrospective randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials are reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Features different from other related studies Progress: PFNA is a device designed based on&#xD;
      modification of Garmma nail and it integrates the advantages of a dynamic hip screw (DHS)&#xD;
      used for extramedullary fixation and an intramedullary fixation device. PFNA exhibits more&#xD;
      advantages over DHS, including (1) smaller stress shielding, being more conducive to fracture&#xD;
      healing, and reduced cut-out phenomenon; (2) better shares the compressive stress of medial&#xD;
      femur, leading to lower incidence of hip deformity. Both proximal femoral intramedullary nail&#xD;
      and PFNA belong to intramedullary nails, but the latter exhibits the following advantages:&#xD;
      (1) one assembly can achieve antirotation and angular stability; (2) the wide blade at the&#xD;
      tip can compress as much peripheral matrix as possible, in particular under the circumstance&#xD;
      of osteoporosis, exhibiting better holding potential; (3) the blade of PFNA is more closely&#xD;
      attached to the matrix, which strengthens the stabilization of implant and prevents against&#xD;
      rotation and varus deformity; (4) biomechanical tests have confirmed that the spiral blade&#xD;
      can greatly increase shearing capacity; (5) spiral blades are implanted via a lateral&#xD;
      incision and internal fixation has the features including minimal wound, less bleeding,&#xD;
      satisfied reduction, rapid recovery, highly stable fractured stumps, being more conducive to&#xD;
      early exercise, avoidance of prolonged force arm caused by extramedullary fixation, increased&#xD;
      shear stress in the proximal femur, which greatly reduce the possibility of failure of&#xD;
      internal fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility: Intramedullary nail for the treatment of long bone fracture has been widely used&#xD;
      in the clinic and expert consensus has been achieved. The novel PFNA for the treatment of&#xD;
      interchochanteric femoral fracture in the elderly produces minimal wound, is easily&#xD;
      performed, and is therefore highly feasible in the clinic. Our team has been ready for&#xD;
      performing this project from various perspectives: (1) Personnel: This project will be&#xD;
      equipped with 2 chief physicians, 2 associate chief physicians, 3 attending physicians, 2&#xD;
      resident physicians, and 1 graduate student. Our team has a strong clinical and scientific&#xD;
      research capacity. (2) Techniques: our team has performed open or closed reduction and&#xD;
      intramedullary nail fixation in many patients, so we are experienced, can provide&#xD;
      sophisticated surgical skills in orthopedic trauma and joint surgery. (3) Equipment: The&#xD;
      study setting has been equipped with orthopedic traction bed, X-ray, CT, MR scanners and&#xD;
      other large equipments. All of these can provide hardware and software support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Under fluoroscopic guidance, closed reduction will be followed by minimally invasive&#xD;
      intramedullary nail fixation, which can effectively avoid vessel and nerve injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, management, analysis and open access Data collection: According to trial&#xD;
      design type and requirement, a table will be developed to record trial data. The recorded&#xD;
      data will be input into an electronic database using a double-data entry strategy by trained&#xD;
      professional staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: Information accuracy will be checked when all recruited patients are&#xD;
      followed up. The database will be locked by the research in charge and will not be altered.&#xD;
      All information relating to this trial will be preserved by Chaohu Hospital of Anhui Medical&#xD;
      University, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The electronic database will be fully disclosed to a professional statistician&#xD;
      for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data open access: Anonymized trial data will be published at www.figshare.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS19.0 software. The&#xD;
      normally distributed continuous variables will be expressed as the mean Â± standard deviation,&#xD;
      and those non-normally distributed variables will be expressed as median and quartile. The&#xD;
      categorical variables will be expressed as counts and the percentage. Paired t test or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon test (paired samples) will be used for comparison of continuous variables between&#xD;
      prior to and after PFNA implantation and the chi-square test for comparison of categorical&#xD;
      variables between prior to and after PFNA implantation. A level of P &lt; 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
