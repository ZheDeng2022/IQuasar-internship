      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of 1) a stepped mental health care&#xD;
      (MHC) intervention and 2) an integrated mental health care and vocational rehabilitation (VR)&#xD;
      intervention for people on sick leave because of burnout, adjustment disorder and&#xD;
      psychological stress in Denmark&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress disorders have negative effects on workability and have negative effects on both the&#xD;
      individual and society. Psychological stress and burnout is not recognized as psychiatric&#xD;
      diagnoses, and thus, the estimated prevalence in healthy and sick-listed people is somewhat&#xD;
      insecure in Denmark. Together with other common mental disorders, burnout, adjustment&#xD;
      disorder and psychological stress are causes of up 40 % of the sick leave claims in Denmark.&#xD;
      There is no clear evidence that mental health care alone will provide sufficient support for&#xD;
      vocational recovery for this target group. Integrated vocational and health care services&#xD;
      have shown good effects on return to work in other Scandinavian countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the Danish IBBIS study is to investigate the efficacy of 1) a stepped mental&#xD;
      health care intervention and 2) an integrated mental health care and vocational&#xD;
      rehabilitation intervention for people on sick leave because of burnout, adjustment disorder&#xD;
      and psychological stress in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This three-arm, randomized, controlled trial is set up to investigate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the stepped mental health care model and the integrated mental health care and vocational&#xD;
      rehabilitation intervention for people on sick leave because of burnout, adjustment disorder&#xD;
      and psychological stress in Denmark. 603 patients are recruited from Danish job centers in&#xD;
      four municipalities. The primary outcome is return to work at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results/discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will contribute with new knowledge on vocational recovery and integrated&#xD;
      vocational and health care interventions in a Scandinavian context.&#xD;
