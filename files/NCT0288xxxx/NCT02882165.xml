    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a condition resulting from environmentally&#xD;
      induced lung damage e.g. cigarette smoking and air pollution which, over time, causes&#xD;
      individuals to suffer from symptoms including chronic cough and progressive breathlessness.&#xD;
      In the UK COPD is predominantly caused by cigarette smoking which may have occurred decades&#xD;
      before the symptoms appear and the disease is diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify those COPD patients who currently have milder disease&#xD;
      and to investigate whether a detailed, medical assessment which has time to assess all&#xD;
      aspects of their care will improve their lung health and general wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD is a major cause of disability and death in the UK, with around 835,000 people currently&#xD;
      diagnosed with the disease and an estimated further two million people who suffer from&#xD;
      symptoms but do not yet have a diagnosis(1). Approximately 25,000 people each year die from&#xD;
      COPD in England and Wales (2), with the disease accounting for 5.4% of all deaths in England&#xD;
      and Wales in 2013 (3). Predominantly in its later, more severe stages, COPD causes an&#xD;
      enormous symptom burden to patients, and accounts for up to half of emergency admissions to&#xD;
      already overstretched hospital services in England (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with COPD, with a past history of smoking, are at higher risk of other medical&#xD;
      problems such as heart disease and stroke(5). Being breathless and having multiple physical&#xD;
      health problems can also lead to mental health problems such as anxiety and depression(5).&#xD;
      This means it can be challenging to provide this group of people enough time to fully assess&#xD;
      and treat all their problems, particularly due to current pressure on the length of GP&#xD;
      appointment times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst COPD is treatable, it is not curable, and emphasis on early diagnosis and intervention&#xD;
      provided a key part of the strategy for COPD published by NHS England in 2012(6). With early&#xD;
      diagnosis, the opportunity is provided to intervene with the aim of improving symptoms and&#xD;
      exercise tolerance, reducing the risk of exacerbations, slowing deterioration and prolonging&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1: History and Burden of COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is believed&#xD;
           to have been first described by Theophile Bonnet in 1679 in the form of cadaveric&#xD;
           'voluminous lungs'(7). Despite being a major cause of disability and death in the UK(1),&#xD;
           COPD still remains a relatively poor relation to many of the other current leading&#xD;
           causes of death in terms of health resource allocation, patient and public understanding&#xD;
           and the interest and motivation of health professionals to diagnose and manage the&#xD;
           disease(8). Over the last three hundred years, COPD has been known to health&#xD;
           professionals and the public in a variety of guises including emphysema, chronic&#xD;
           bronchitis, smoker's cough and chronic airflow obstruction. The term, Chronic&#xD;
           Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is believed to have been used for the first time in 1965&#xD;
           by William Briscoe at the 9th Aspen Emphysema Conference(7). Although the name has now&#xD;
           been successfully unified, the negative associations, variable diagnosis rates and&#xD;
           management strategies amongst patients with the disease continue. Sadly, a nihilistic&#xD;
           attitude towards the value of diagnosis and treatment of the disease is still found in&#xD;
           some clinicians, with some feeling the value of accurate and early diagnosis is small as&#xD;
           there is no evidence for any disease course altering interventions(8). Whilst there are&#xD;
           a lack of disease-modifying interventions other than smoking cessation, there are&#xD;
           effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that have been shown to&#xD;
           improve disease symptoms(4). Accurate, early diagnosis and disease education are the&#xD;
           first steps to achieving high quality care throughout the whole patient journey up to&#xD;
           and including palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           COPD patients may be perceived as either being on a slow emphysematous downward decline&#xD;
           or, to spiral rapidly through the cycle of recurrent exacerbations and hospital&#xD;
           admissions to lung function decline and death (8-10). However, with the range of&#xD;
           effective interventions now available (including pharmacological strategies, patient&#xD;
           education, diet and exercise strategies, vaccination and targeted smoking cessation&#xD;
           interventions) early diagnosis and ongoing proactive care should be the 'gold&#xD;
           standard'(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The relatively recent evidence supporting pulmonary rehabilitation(11), lung volume&#xD;
           reduction techniques(12), and modern developments in pharmacotherapy and preventative&#xD;
           care have provided health care professionals with access to therapies which have proven&#xD;
           benefits in terms of morbidity. The wealth of inhaled therapies flooding the market and&#xD;
           the enormous cost burden of COPD to the NHS has led to more interest and research in the&#xD;
           disease in the last decade. This research has generated an increased understanding of&#xD;
           disease pathology, recognition of multiple disease phenotypes and the growing&#xD;
           acknowledgement of the need to direct therapies to individuals rather than the disease&#xD;
           population as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Increasing bed pressures in the NHS has shifted focus towards identification of those&#xD;
           high-risk patients who are recurrent hospital attendees, and resources have been&#xD;
           directed towards strategies to reduce hospitalisation and towards community based care.&#xD;
           Currently, services vary enormously between hospital trusts and commissioning groups,&#xD;
           ranging from Community Matron support, hospital admission avoidance and early discharge&#xD;
           schemes, to full time, multidisciplinary, integrated COPD teams all of which are&#xD;
           attempting to bridge the gap in service provision and communication between Primary and&#xD;
           Secondary Care(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2: Risk Stratification within COPD In the last ten years, much research has been&#xD;
           directed towards risk stratification within COPD, and whereas previous risk&#xD;
           stratification has centred on lung function, i.e. FEV1, it is now recognised that the&#xD;
           disease is far more complex(4). A variety of factors such as symptom burden, historic&#xD;
           exacerbation rate, exercise tolerance, smoking status and co-morbidities have been shown&#xD;
           to be significant markers of health status and risk in COPD (4, 13-15)and so, may be&#xD;
           useful to predict deterioration and, consequent health and social care utilisation. Thus&#xD;
           far, attention has been mainly focused on highlighting factors indicating deterioration&#xD;
           into end stage disease with the aim of identifying how to most efficiently deploy health&#xD;
           services to manage these patients with both high symptom burden and high levels of&#xD;
           health care utilisation. Whilst this remains an important point of research there is a&#xD;
           limit to what can be achieved at this, relatively late point in the disease process,&#xD;
           where management is directed at achieving what is effectively, high quality,&#xD;
           multi-disciplinary, palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesise that to make a bigger difference to patients and the health service in&#xD;
           the longer term, attention needs to be focussed on the earlier stages of COPD before the&#xD;
           bulk of irreversible lung damage has already occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3: The DOSE score A variety of scoring systems exist to try to risk stratify COPD. The&#xD;
           DOSE score (Dyspnoea Obstruction, Smoking and Exacerbation) is an index of severity in&#xD;
           COPD developed by Jones et al in 2009 from an audit data set of patients from Devon in&#xD;
           the UK(16). The DOSE Index points associated with each category of all four variables&#xD;
           (mMRC Dyspnoea Scale Score, FEV1% predicted, smoking status, exacerbations per year) are&#xD;
           added to build the DOSE Index score. It was derived from multiple regression analyses of&#xD;
           possible markers of health status in COPD and their relationship to quality of life&#xD;
           scores. A scoring system was developed according to clinical and statistical strength&#xD;
           and this was validated against three other data sets from London, Holland and Japan. It&#xD;
           correlates well with other COPD severity scoring systems such as the BODE (Body mass&#xD;
           index, degree of airflow Obstruction, Dyspnoea and Exercise capacity) index(17) and ADO&#xD;
           (Age, Dyspnoea, airflow Obstruction) scores, but carries the advantage of using some&#xD;
           modifiable variables all of which are available from existing Primary Care datasets.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Jones et al demonstrated a 'high' score (&gt;4) to show the greatest risk of hospital&#xD;
           admission, increased hospital bed days and risk of respiratory failure(16). A high DOSE&#xD;
           score has since been demonstrated to predict an increased five year respiratory&#xD;
           mortality of 42.4% vs 11.0% in those with a low score(18) and to predict an increase in&#xD;
           respiratory symptom burden over the subsequent two years from scoring(19). A high score&#xD;
           has also been shown to predict an increased risk of subsequent exacerbation frequency,&#xD;
           hypercapnoea and poorer exercise capacity (20). In these patients we aim to optimise&#xD;
           symptoms and risk and to provide high quality palliative care, which may span many&#xD;
           years. Despite this, as demonstrated by Sundh et al, there will still be a mortality of&#xD;
           over 40% at five years in the high DOSE score group(18), associated with a considerable&#xD;
           symptom and care burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evidence exists to support poorer outcomes in COPD patients with certain co-morbidities,&#xD;
           particularly those related to heart disease, osteoporosis, Body Mass Index and mental&#xD;
           health (14). COPD prevalence is also strongly related to socioeconomic status. Other&#xD;
           parameters such as living alone, the presence of other respiratory co-morbidities, a&#xD;
           persistent inflammatory state reflected by raised inflammatory markers, the presence of&#xD;
           dementia and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease all seem likely to be associated with&#xD;
           poorer outcome and have less data or conflicting data associated with their link to&#xD;
           COPD(20).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The original paper by Jones et al noted a mean increase in DOSE score of 0.18 DOSE&#xD;
           points/year over nine years in the London cohort(16) but one would expect considerable&#xD;
           variation between patients in their rate of decline. The group is currently undertaking&#xD;
           'CASCADE', a five year, retrospective, database search of anonymised primary care&#xD;
           records (The Hampshire Health Record) in which, DOSE scores are recalculated over five&#xD;
           years and an increase in score is used as a surrogate marker for health status&#xD;
           deterioration. In those identified at baseline to have a low DOSE score (&lt;4), the&#xD;
           subsequent rate of change in DOSE scores and use of hospital emergency services will be&#xD;
           used to divide the cohort into 'high risk' and 'low risk' groups. 'CASCADE' also&#xD;
           identifies, at baseline, the co-morbid and social demographics mentioned in the above&#xD;
           paragraph in these patients. Using a regression analysis, we hope to identify which&#xD;
           co-morbid and social demographics can risk-stratify the patients at baseline, ultimately&#xD;
           creating a model, applicable in Primary Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In CASCADE II we will collect data regarding co-morbidities and social demographics from&#xD;
           a real world COPD population. As one of the secondary analyses this will provide us with&#xD;
           pilot data to further develop our risk prediction model in a real world clinical&#xD;
           setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evidence for treatments that affect disease progression rates in COPD is scarce (with&#xD;
           the exception of smoking cessation) perhaps partly as they are often a complex patient&#xD;
           group both clinically and socially who are highlighted late in their disease process.&#xD;
           Within the CASCADE II study we aim to go some way to remedy this deficit by further&#xD;
           exploring the potential relationship between interventions already recommended (e.g.&#xD;
           formal diagnosis using spirometry, optimal inhaler prescription, participation in&#xD;
           pulmonary rehabilitation and optimisation of comorbidities) and respiratory health&#xD;
           status when adequate time and expertise is prospectively allocated to recognise and&#xD;
           optimise all aspects of these patients' health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis We hypothesise that a complex intervention to optimise clinical and&#xD;
           supportive care in early stage COPD patients will improve health outcomes and will be&#xD;
           cost effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Aim Within a population of COPD patients deemed 'low risk' by DOSE score but with&#xD;
           respiratory symptoms, this study looks to establish whether intervention in the form of&#xD;
           a prospective, in depth, medical assessment and individualised optimisation of care will&#xD;
           alter their respiratory health status and clinical outcomes at twelve months in&#xD;
           comparison with standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Design A cluster randomised controlled interventional study of the impact on&#xD;
           health status of prospective assessment and individualised medical optimisation using GP&#xD;
           practices as clusters in a cohort based analysis.&#xD;
