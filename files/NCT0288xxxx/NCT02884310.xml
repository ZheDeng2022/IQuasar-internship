  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individually-tailored administration of the opioid analgesic component during general&#xD;
      anaesthesia is still a challenge for the anesthesiologist. The aim of this protocol is to&#xD;
      look if the gradient response of a nociception index to a calibrated tetanic stimulus during&#xD;
      standard anesthetic conditions, could help to titrate remifentanil analgesia before tracheal&#xD;
      intubation and before skin incision. The studied parameters are the SPI index developed by&#xD;
      General Electric, the &quot;Analgesia Nociception Index&quot; and the pupil dilation using the pupil&#xD;
      scan algometer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two randomized groups of patients scheduled for general surgery under Target Controlled&#xD;
      remifentanil propofol anaesthesia are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive two standard calibration tests (Tetanic stimulus at the ulnar nerve: 100&#xD;
      Hertz, 60 milliamperes, 30 seconds) before tracheal intubation and skin incision at a stable&#xD;
      remifentanil level of 3 ng/ml. Propofol concentration is targeted to maintain the BIS value&#xD;
      as close as possible to 50. Patients are mechanically ventilated at an inspired O2&#xD;
      concentration of 50% and using tidal volumes of 8 to 10 mL/kg and respiratory rates of 12 to&#xD;
      15/min. Patients receive an induction dose of neuromuscular blocking agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treated group, the importance of the Surgical Plethysmogram Index (SPI) gradient after&#xD;
      the tetanic stimulus will guide the subsequent administration of remifentanil to cover&#xD;
      tracheal intubation and surgical incision. As compared to SPI value before the calibration&#xD;
      test, a less than 10 unit increase in SPI will not prompt any change in remifentanil&#xD;
      concentration before tracheal intubation and surgical incision. An increase in SPI between 10&#xD;
      and 20 units will prompt a remifentanil effect-site target concentration of 4 ng/ml, between&#xD;
      20 and 30 of 5 ng/ml, and above 30 of 6 ng/ml for tracheal intubation. Once the trachea is&#xD;
      intubated, remifentanil concentration will be lowered to 3 ng /ml. It will be adjusted again&#xD;
      before surgical incision according to the same criteria. Ten minutes after surgical incision&#xD;
      until the end of the surgical procedure, the remifentanil concentration will be targeted to&#xD;
      maintain SPI between 20 and 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, conditions will be the same as those of first group, except that&#xD;
      remifentanil concentration will be adjusted according to heart rate and blood pressure. The&#xD;
      anesthesiologist in charge is blinded to the results of the SPI gradient after the two&#xD;
      calibration tests at 3 ng/ml remifentanil concentration and also blinded to the 2 other&#xD;
      nociception indexes at all times. Remifentanil concentration is targeted at 4 ng/ml before&#xD;
      tracheal intubation and surgical incision. Ten minutes after skin incision until the end of&#xD;
      surgery, remifentanil concentrations will be adjusted according to the hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data acquisition and analysis will lead to the following statistical comparisons between the&#xD;
      two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic reactivity to tracheal intubation and surgical incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concordance between SPI, Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI), and pupil diameter&#xD;
           variations in response to the calibration test and during maintenance of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reliability of the prediction of hemodynamic reactivity to intubation and incision by&#xD;
           the SPI, ANI, pupil diameter and hemodynamic response to the calibration test, and&#xD;
           improvement of the prediction when combining the information given by those parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Monitoring The monitoring will correspond to the classical monitoring of any general&#xD;
      anesthesia procedures (Electrocardiogram, peripheral saturation in O2, Non-Invasive Blood&#xD;
      Pressure, respiratory gases, pressure and flows in the airway, muscle relaxation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be continuously recorded and saved for subsequent analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inspired and expired gases : O2, Carbon dioxide (CO2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry : peak, plateau, and end-expiratory pressures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EKG : heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-invasive blood pressure : automatic measured every 5 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SPI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional monitoring :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bispectral Index (BIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ANI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pupil dilation measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Anesthetic medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.1. Premedication The premedication will consist of 0.5 mg oral alprazolam (XANAX) one&#xD;
      hour before induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2. Anesthesia General anesthesia will be induced and maintained using Target Controlled&#xD;
      Infusions (TCI) of propofol and remifentanil, and using a single cisatracurium bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2.1. Induction of anesthesia In the experimental group, the initial target effect-site&#xD;
      concentration (Ce) of remifentanil will be 3 ng/ml and 3 µg/ml for propofol. The propofol Ce&#xD;
      will be increased by steps of 1 µg/ml until loss of consciousness (6.0 µg/ml maximum). A 0.2&#xD;
      mg/kg bolus of cisatracurium will be given immediately after loss of consciousness. The&#xD;
      tetanic calibration test will be performed once all responses to train of four (TOF)&#xD;
      stimulation have disappeared. The BIS target before the tetanic stimulation will be 50 (range&#xD;
      40-60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pupil dilation and the ANI response to the tetanic stimulation will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After tracheal intubation, remifentanil concentration will be reduced to 3 ng/ml, and&#xD;
      propofol concentration adjusted to keep the BIS value as close to 50 as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, the induction of anesthesia will occur the same way as in the&#xD;
      experimental group, except that the initial concentration of remifentanil will be 3 ng/ml,&#xD;
      and 4 ng/ml for tracheal intubation and incision. It will be changed according to hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters thereafter. Propofol concentration will be targeted to maintain stable BIS values&#xD;
      around 50. The tetanic calibration test will be performed blindly once all responses to TOF&#xD;
      stimulation have disappeared, and once propofol and remifentanil concentrations have been&#xD;
      stable for more than 5 minutes. SPI, ANI, and pupil diameter values will be blindly recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2.2. Maintenance of anesthesia The upper and lower limits of propofol concentrations will&#xD;
      be 2.0 and 6.0 µg/ml, respectively. It will be targeted to maintain a stable BIS value around&#xD;
      50. During surgery, remifentanil concentrations will range between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml. In the&#xD;
      experimental group (SPI), the calibration test-defined remifentanil concentration and the&#xD;
      pre-incision propofol concentration will be kept intact for 10 minutes after the surgical&#xD;
      incision. Thereafter, they will be modified according to the below-defined criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, remifentanil concentration will be maintained at 4 ng/ml during 10&#xD;
      minutes after the surgical incision. Thereafter, propofol and remifentanil concentrations&#xD;
      will be modified according to hemodynamic reactivity, and according to BIS, which will be&#xD;
      kept at 50 (see tables below). SPI, and the other nociception indexes will be blindly&#xD;
      recorded in that group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2.3. Propofol concentration adaptations in both groups Propofol concentrations will be&#xD;
      adapted to maintain BIS as close to 50 as possible. Changes in propofol concentration will be&#xD;
      allowed every 5 minutes after having reached the new target, if necessary, as a function of&#xD;
      criteria defined in Table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 2 Propofol concentration adaptation as a function of BIS BIS Change in propofol&#xD;
      concentration &gt;70 +2 µg/ml &gt; 55 +1 µg/ml &lt; 45 -0.5 µg/ml &lt; 35 -1 µg/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2.4. Remifentanil concentration adaptations&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2.4.1. In the experimental group The goal in the experimental group will be to maintain a&#xD;
      SPI value between 20 and 40 during surgery, from 10 minutes after incision to the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After incision, remifentanil concentration will be adapted according to criteria defined in&#xD;
      Table 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 3 Remifentanil concentration adaptation during surgery (range 2 to 10 ng/ml) Event&#xD;
      Change in remifentanil concentration SPI&lt;20 -1 ng/ml SPI&gt;50 +1 ng/ml SPI&gt;80 +2 ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of hemodynamic reactivity (increase or decrease of more than 20 % as compared to&#xD;
      reference values), despite adequate adaptation of remifentanil concentration as a function of&#xD;
      SPI, it will be corrected according to criteria defined in paragraph 2.5 for hypotension or&#xD;
      bradycardia episodes. In case of hypertension, (more than 20% as compared to reference&#xD;
      value), despite adequate remifentanil concentration adaptation as a function of SPI, 0.5 mg&#xD;
      intravenous boluses of nicardipine (Nicardipine) will be administered intravenously until&#xD;
      return to acceptable values. Similarly, in case of tachycardia despite adequate adaptation of&#xD;
      remifentanil adaptation as a function of SPI values, it will be corrected by 1 mg intravenous&#xD;
      boluses of metoprolol (Seloken) until return to pre-defined values. In the event of both&#xD;
      cases, exclusion of the patient's data from statistical analysis should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2.4.2. In the control group Before surgical incision, in the absence of hemodynamic&#xD;
      reactivity, remifentanil concentration will be 4 ng/ml, and will not change for 10 minutes&#xD;
      after incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten minutes after incision, remifentanil concentration will be adapted according to&#xD;
      hemodynamic reactivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 4 Remifentanil concentration adaptation in the Control group Hemodynamic Reactivity (&gt;&#xD;
      20% as compared to reference values or Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) &gt; 90 mmHg and/or Heart&#xD;
      Rate (HR) &gt; 100/min): -1 ng/ml Hypotension/bradycardia (&lt;20% as compared to reference values&#xD;
      or MAP &lt; 60 mmHg and/or HR &lt; 45/min): +1 ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remifentanil concentration will always be kept between 2 and 10 ng/ml. In case of hemodynamic&#xD;
      changes at those concentrations, they will be corrected according to the criteria defined&#xD;
      above for the SPI group.&#xD;
