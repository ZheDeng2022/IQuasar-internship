    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Avastin (bevacizumab) can help to&#xD;
      control ovarian, fallopian, or primary peritoneal cancer that has been found during&#xD;
      second-look surgery.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in the study, you will receive bevacizumab by&#xD;
      vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of every 21-day study cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your first study visit will be about 5-7 weeks after your second-look surgery so that you&#xD;
      have time to recover. The study doctor will tell you when you will start having study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing. If you can become&#xD;
           pregnant and the doctor thinks it is needed, part of this routine blood sample may be&#xD;
           used for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycle 3 and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 6, 9, 12, and so on), you will have&#xD;
      an MRI or CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to receive bevacizumab for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your&#xD;
      best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse,&#xD;
      if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within about 7 days after your last dose of bevacizumab:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing. If you can become&#xD;
           pregnant, part of this sample will be used for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of several types of cancer, including ovarian cancer. However, it is considered&#xD;
      investigational to use bevacizumab as treatment for cancer found during second-look surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor will explain how the study drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 35 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have received standard of care frontline surgical and chemotherapy treatment (at least&#xD;
             six cycles of platinum and taxane therapy). Patients who received neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
