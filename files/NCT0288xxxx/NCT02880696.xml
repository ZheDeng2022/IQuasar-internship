  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A key function of our brain is to identify temporal structures in the environment and use&#xD;
      them to form expectations. These expectations allow us to plan and organize our behavior&#xD;
      towards changes in the environment, and optimize the use of our attentional and motor&#xD;
      resources. They also allow us to establish harmonious social interactions, coordinating us&#xD;
      with our interlocutor during an exchange. Our ability to form temporal expectations seems to&#xD;
      emerge very early but the development of this process is unknown. We only know that a set of&#xD;
      basic skills, probably related to that ability, are present from birth. This suggests that&#xD;
      temporal processing capabilities emerge during the prenatal period, but this has not been&#xD;
      studied. The objective of this project is to study preterm infants brain's ability to process&#xD;
      the intervals between stimuli and to form expectations on that basis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 patients (20 per group) : Presence of a functional response to stimulus omissions, only in&#xD;
      the test group (regular presentation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive the test stimulation sequence (regular), Group 2 will receive the&#xD;
      control stimulation sequence (random).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the test sequence, a vibration will be repeated for 3 s interspersed with intervals of&#xD;
      5 s, creating an expectation about the presentation of the next stimulus. Every 8 to 12&#xD;
      vibrations (random), a vibration will be omitted. According to our hypothesis, we should&#xD;
      observe an activity in the somatosensory cortex during the omission. A total of 10 omissions&#xD;
      will be presented, bringing the total duration of stimulus presentation to 13 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the control sequence, the interstimulus intervals are irregular, 3 to 7 seconds, so as&#xD;
      not to induce expectations. Omissions in this case should not be associated with a functional&#xD;
      brain response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of an activation in the primary somatosensory cortex will be assessed using&#xD;
      Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS), on newborns of 32, 33 and 35 weeks of corrected&#xD;
      gestational age, during omissions in a regular vibrotactile stimulation sequence (test group)&#xD;
      with respect to an irregular sequence (control group). A difference in activation during&#xD;
      omissions between groups will reflect the presence of a processing of time intervals at the&#xD;
      cortical level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also assess the difference in amplitude and time to peak of the response between the&#xD;
      corrected gestational ages and vigilance states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main endpoint: amplitude of the neurovascular response significantly higher and / or time to&#xD;
      peak significantly shorter during the omissions in the test group (regular sequence) compared&#xD;
      to the control group (irregular sequence), evaluated twice: at ages corrected SA 33 ± 3 days&#xD;
      and 35 weeks ± 3 days , and if possible SA 32 ± 3 days (optional measure depending on the&#xD;
      gestational age at birth and time to obtain consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: significant difference in amplitude and / or time to peak of the&#xD;
      neurovasculat response between corrected gestational ages and vigilance states.&#xD;
