  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis leads to reduced independence and quality of life. Total hip replacement is a&#xD;
      successful and cost-effective surgical intervention to relieve pain and improve functioning&#xD;
      in patients with osteoarthritis. Research has shown that preoperative health status strongly&#xD;
      predicts outcomes including physical function and hospitalization length after hip&#xD;
      replacement surgery. Frail patients, in particular, are at greater risk of poor postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes and could potentially benefit from interventions targeting an improvement in their&#xD;
      health status prior to undergoing a hip or knee replacement surgery. Partnering with the YMCA&#xD;
      and a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare providers, this pilot trial will examine the&#xD;
      feasibility of a multi-modal intervention for frail patients that includes a supervised&#xD;
      exercise program, vitamin D and protein supplementation, and a medication review. The results&#xD;
      of this feasibility study will guide the design of a future multi-centre study, which if&#xD;
      successful, could be developed into a routine model of care that is implemented in joint&#xD;
      replacement programs across Ontario and ultimately improving the lives of frail seniors&#xD;
      undergoing hip or knee replacement.&#xD;

      Study Design: The proposed study is a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing a&#xD;
      pre-operative multi-modal intervention and standard care among pre-frail/frail patients&#xD;
      undergoing total hip or knee replacement surgery. Pre-frail (score of 1 or 2) or frail (score&#xD;
      of 3-5; Fried Frailty Phenotype) patients, ≥ 60 years undergoing elective unilateral total&#xD;
      hip or knee replacement after at least 3 months will be recruited from the practices of 8&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeons (Hamilton Arthroplasty Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research assistant (RA) will conduct the eligibility screening at the Regional Joint&#xD;
      Assessment Program (Hamilton Health Sciences) and St. Joseph's Healthcare, Hamilton, ON&#xD;
      during an appointment (3-9 months prior to surgery). Patients with renal insufficiency, a&#xD;
      neuromuscular disorder, active cancer or any inflammatory arthritis will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratified block randomization will be used to randomly allocate participants to the&#xD;
      intervention or usual care arms of the study. The allocation sequence will be computer&#xD;
      generated using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.3. Once the study RA confirms the&#xD;
      patient's eligibility, and obtain consent, the RA will inform the research coordinator (RC)&#xD;
      who will randomize the participant using Red Cap randomization list. Then the RC will call&#xD;
      the participants to inform them if they fall in the intervention or control group and arrange&#xD;
      the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-Modal Frailty Intervention (3-9 months). Exercise: A Registered physiotherapist will&#xD;
      develop an individualized exercise program and schedule appointments with the patient at home&#xD;
      including goal setting discussion. Participants will be offered free YMCA membership to&#xD;
      participate in the IN Motion program.The IN Motion program is designed for older adults and&#xD;
      include gentle fit, hydrotherapy and walk fit classes along with health education sessions.&#xD;
      Participants will be taught how to monitor their own heart rate and level of exertion using&#xD;
      the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion 10-point Scale. All participants will be encouraged to&#xD;
      exercise at least 3 times per week for 45-60 minutes either at home and/or at YMCA IN Motion&#xD;
      classes. The home exercise will incorporate aerobic, resistance training, flexibility and&#xD;
      balance components. Patients will be provided with and asked to keep an exercise log-book.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive-behavioral Change Strategy and education:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Change Strategies (CBCS) may be an effective way to facilitate coaching&#xD;
      strategies to increase participant exercise levels. In the current study, modules will be&#xD;
      presented to participants in the event that they express any barriers to exercise. These&#xD;
      barriers will vary based on: the individual, environment, and previous exercise behaviors.&#xD;
      Throughout the intervention, CBCS will be performed and administered by the physiotherapist&#xD;
      prior to the participants scheduled surgery. The administration of the modules will be&#xD;
      dependent on the challenges that the participants express in relation to exercise (i.e., lack&#xD;
      of time, motivation, social support, etc.). A definition of each strategy will be given to&#xD;
      the participant; the physiotherapist will then work through a worksheet with the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein Supplement: Participants will be provided with 1-2 daily supplements (containing&#xD;
      20-40 gram protein, 1.5 g β-Hydroxy β-Methylbutyrate /serving) to be taken with a meal or on&#xD;
      activity days within 3-hours of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D: All participants in the intervention arm will be provided with a supply of Vitamin&#xD;
      D3 (1000 IU/day tablets) for the duration of the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Review: After randomization, a geriatrician will review the medications for&#xD;
      patients in the intervention arm and provide written recommendations to the participant's&#xD;
      family doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm: Patients in the control arm will receive usual care which may include the&#xD;
      recommendation to attend fitness classes before surgery; however these patients will not&#xD;
      receive the more intensive assessment/intervention of the physiotherapist and other&#xD;
      intervention components. Control participants will be asked pre-operatively and&#xD;
      post-operatively to indicate whether or not they exercise, take protein or vitamin&#xD;
      supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in intervention and control groups will, 1) be monitored for their YMCA&#xD;
      attendance and 2) be instructed on the completion a dietary intake log that indicate the type&#xD;
      of food and amount over a four-day period in order to calculate energy and micronutrient&#xD;
      consumption. Then a RA will call the participants to collect their food intake.&#xD;
