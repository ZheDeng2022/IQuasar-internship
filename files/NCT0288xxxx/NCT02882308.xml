      OPHELIA (OPHELIA (OlaParib and durvalumab in HEad and neck squamous celL carcInomA) trial is&#xD;
      a Greek, investigator-initiated, randomized open-label window-of-opportunity phase II study.&#xD;
      Patients with operable histologically documented squamous-cell carcinoma of the oral cavity,&#xD;
      oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx will be randomized between combination with durvalumab and&#xD;
      olaparib, cisplatin and olaparib, monotherapy with olaparib or no treatment, before starting&#xD;
      standard treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OPHELIA is a window-of-opportunity phase II study randomized between combination with&#xD;
      durvalumab and olaparib, cisplatin and olaparib, monotherapy with olaparib or no treatment,&#xD;
      before starting standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although patients will be randomized between the 4 arms, no formal comparison between the 4&#xD;
      arms will be performed.Patients allocated to the olaparib monotherapy arm will serve as a&#xD;
      proof-of-concept to interpret the mechanism of action of olaparib. Patients allocated in the&#xD;
      &quot;no treatment&quot; group will be used as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the change in the tumour Ki-67 before and after treatment with&#xD;
      the combination of olaparib + durvalumab or olaparib + cisplatin or olaparib monotherapy.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be early tumour response by RECIST criteria, pathologic complete&#xD;
      response rate, tolerability to treatment and surgical complications rate, and optionally,&#xD;
      metabolic response assessed by FDG-PET/CT scan. Translational correlates will be tested in&#xD;
      tumour tissue, plasma and germline DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the endpoints will be analyzed by an &quot;as treated analysis&quot; since the trial does not&#xD;
      include a formal comparison of the treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of olaparib monotherapy has been associated with reports of the following&#xD;
      laboratory findings and/or clinical diagnoses, generally of mild or moderate severity (CTCAE&#xD;
      Grade 1 or 2) and generally not requiring treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
