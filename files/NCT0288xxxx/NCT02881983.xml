      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulties in assigning and identifying emotional states, or to regulate the emotional&#xD;
      costs are recognized as one of the major factors of relapse. This study aimed to evaluate the&#xD;
      emotion regulation processes, in short term (STA, after 1month of withdrawal) and long-term&#xD;
      alcohol abstinent individuals (LTA, at least six months of abstinence), compared to healthy&#xD;
      control participants (C) in a positive and negative emotion induction protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the emotional regulation deficits assessed with physiological indicators (heart&#xD;
      rate variability, electrodermal response, pupil diameter) and clinically in presentations of&#xD;
      visual stimuli to emotional value (positive, negative, neutral) in alcohol use disorder's&#xD;
      (AUD) patients with short and long term abstinent compared to a control group of healthy&#xD;
      subjects. The investigators are particularly interested in the evolution of heart rate&#xD;
      variability considered as a good marker of vulnerability to AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying the relationships between physiological measures and clinical variables such as&#xD;
      behavioral indicators and self-reported assessment of cognitive and emotional skills among&#xD;
      the three groups (STA, LTA and C).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recording was performed for all participants during presentation of high emotional&#xD;
      inducing stimuli presenting human interactions (pictures and video sequences). For each&#xD;
      participant physiological responses (pupil diameter, heart rate, and skin conductance) were&#xD;
      recorded before, during and after induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were asked to evaluate the intensity and the valence of emotional stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a neurological evaluation, a clinical and cognitive assessment were performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological, clinical and cognitive evaluation - Each participant had a clinical structured&#xD;
      interview, a neurological evaluation, self-administered assessment (Hospital Anxiety &amp;&#xD;
      Depression Scale, Emotional Skills Profile, Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale, and&#xD;
      cognitive assessment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological assessment - The recording was performed for all participants during the&#xD;
      presentation of pictures (static stimuli) or videos (dynamic stimuli) selected according to&#xD;
      their high emotional intensity (positive, neutral and negative valence), representing human&#xD;
      interactions. For each participant heart rate, electrodermal activity, and pupil diameter&#xD;
      were recorded during three experimental conditions: rest, induction (presentation of stimuli)&#xD;
      and after induction (recovery). Participants were asked to evaluate the intensity and valence&#xD;
      of the pictures and videos using the Self-Assessment Manikin.&#xD;
