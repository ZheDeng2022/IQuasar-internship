      RATIONALE: Women may stay up-to-date with cancer screening if a health professional helps&#xD;
      them overcome barriers to screening, including helping them to schedule cancer screening&#xD;
      appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the use of health professional-tailored&#xD;
      telephone support compared with usual care from their personal doctor to help women overcome&#xD;
      barriers to screening for colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop and evaluate an enhanced telephone support intervention (Prevention Care Manager&#xD;
           [PCM]) to promote colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer screening more widely among&#xD;
           women enrolled in a Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MMCO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the impact of patient, Community/Migrant Health Center (C/MHC), and MMCO&#xD;
           characteristics on cancer screening status and the impact of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of the enhanced PCM intervention upon colorectal, breast, and&#xD;
           cervical cancer screening rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the status of women who are up-to-date (UTD) on CRC screening versus the UTD&#xD;
           status of cervical cancer and breast cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. The study is conducted in 2 parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 (barrier interview and pilot testing): Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
           primary language and whether or not they have had an outpatient visit in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Barrier interview: Patients undergo a 15-30 minute interview to determine barriers&#xD;
                they face preventing them from receiving recommended cancer screenings and&#xD;
                healthcare, as well as facilitators which have encouraged them to be screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pilot testing: Patients from the barrier interviews and other eligible Medicaid&#xD;
                Managed Care Organization (MMCO) patients receive scripted telephone calls from a&#xD;
                Prevention Care Manager to assist them in getting up-to-date on their cancer&#xD;
                screening tests over 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 (randomized control trial): Patients are stratified according to treatment center&#xD;
           (Community/Migrant health center vs Diagnostic and Treatment Center) and age. Patient&#xD;
           are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm I (Prevention Care Manager): Patients are stratified according to the number of&#xD;
                tests for which they are up-to-date at baseline. Patients receive reminder letters&#xD;
                encouraging them to contact their primary care provider for colorectal, breast, and&#xD;
                cervical cancer screening and 3 to 4 telephone support calls to help them become up&#xD;
                to date for colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm II (usual care): Patients receive usual care according to their primary care&#xD;
                physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, patients are followed for 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,600 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
