  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to determine whether GW856553 (7.5mg BD for 28 days) has an&#xD;
      effect on endothelial function in dyslipidaemic subjects as assessed by venous occlusion&#xD;
      plethysmography using brachial artery acetylcholine infusion. This will establish consistency&#xD;
      with preclinical findings, as well as confirm a physiologic human response at the current&#xD;
      safe maximal dose. Safety (specifically serum liver function testing) and tolerability will&#xD;
      also be evaluated in this trial.&#xD;
