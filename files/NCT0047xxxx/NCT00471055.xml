  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether capsaicin gel is effective in treating mild&#xD;
      to moderate degrees of osteoarthritis of the knee in the elderly patient compared with&#xD;
      placebo gel.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the population. It is&#xD;
      characterized pathologically by both focal loss of articular cartilage and marginal and&#xD;
      central new bone formation. OA of knee, the principal large joint to be affected, results in&#xD;
      disabling knee symptoms in an estimated 10% of people older than 55 years, a quarter of whom&#xD;
      are severely disabled. The risk of disability attributable to knee OA alone is as great as&#xD;
      that due to cardiac disease and greater than that due to any other medical disorder in the&#xD;
      elderly. A recent World Health Organization report on the global burden of disease indicates&#xD;
      that knee OA is likely to become the fourth most important global cause of disability in&#xD;
      women and the eighth most important in men. Knee OA is associated with symptoms of pain and&#xD;
      functional disability. Physical disability arising from pain and loss of functional capacity&#xD;
      reduces quality of life and increases the risk of further morbidity and mortality. Current&#xD;
      treatments aim at alleviating these symptoms of mild to moderate OA by several different&#xD;
      methods: non-pharmacological treatment (for example education, exercise, lifestyle changes)&#xD;
      or pharmacological treatments(for example paracetamol, NSAIDs and Capsaicin gel topical&#xD;
      treatments). Current evidence to support the various treatments in current use, however, is&#xD;
      very variable. Capsaicin, the active principle of hot chili pepper, is thought to selectively&#xD;
      stimulate unmyelinated C fibre afferent neurons and cause the release of substance P.&#xD;
      Prolonged application of capsaicin reversibly depletes stores of substance P, and possibly&#xD;
      other neurotransmitters, from sensory nerve endings. This reduces or abolishes the&#xD;
      transmission of painful stimuli from the peripheral nerve fibres to the higher centres.There&#xD;
      were many study on Capsaicin gel to confirm the effectiveness of capsaicin gel in many&#xD;
      dosages. However, there has been no efficacy study on the capsaicin 0.0125% of the Thai&#xD;
      produce &quot;Capsika gel &quot; before, therefore, this study is proposed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study must meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who are capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance&#xD;
             with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ambulatory nom pregnant females and males 40-&lt;80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who withdraw pain medication or nutritional supplements for symptom relief&#xD;
             for knee OA for a total of at least 15 days before screening visit 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pain at or below 80 mm on a 100 mm VAS in the index knee.&#xD;
