  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the selective destruction of abnormal cells through light&#xD;
      activation of a photosensitiser in the presence of oxygen. These cells accumulate more&#xD;
      photosensitiser than normal cells. The photosensitiser generates reactive oxygen species upon&#xD;
      illumination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For skin diseases, there has been an increasing interest in using precursors of the&#xD;
      endogenous photoactive porphyrins. The most commonly used precursors have been&#xD;
      5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its derivatives. The present test drug, Metvix®, contains the&#xD;
      methyl ester of ALA, which penetrates the lesions well and shows high lesion selectivity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCC is a highly frequent skin malignancy, and accounts for approximately 75% of all&#xD;
      non-melanoma skin cancers . It is the most common cancer in humans . Several&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment modalities are used for BCC, including excision surgery,&#xD;
      curettage and electrodesiccation, cryosurgery and more advanced modalities like radiation&#xD;
      therapy, plastic surgery with reconstruction and Moh's surgery. The treatment used depends on&#xD;
      the type, size, depth and localisation of the BCC lesion. Treatment options for BCC give good&#xD;
      response rates in the majority of patients but are inadequate in a small group of patients&#xD;
      defined as &quot;high-risk&quot; BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this particular patient group, even a moderate complete response rate with good cosmetic&#xD;
      results may be considered beneficial, since the number of patients who have to receive more&#xD;
      advanced therapy with the possibility of high morbidity and poor cosmetic outcome will be&#xD;
      reduced. Even a partial response is of clinical interest since the remaining tumour will&#xD;
      require less extensive surgery. In the case of treatment failure, Metvix PDT does not&#xD;
      interfere with the use of other treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variable &quot;complete response&quot; after one or two Metvix treatment cycles will be used as the&#xD;
      basis for the justification of sample size. The following hypothesis will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Complete response rate of Metvix is less or equal to 65 % versus the alternative&#xD;
      hypothesis HA: Complete response rate of Metvix is greater than 65 %&#xD;

      Prospective, open, multicenter study. The high risk BCC lesions will be treated with Metvix&#xD;
      cream. A biopsy confirming the diagnosis of each BCC lesion should have been taken within 6&#xD;
      months prior to treatment. The patients will receive one or two treatment cycles each&#xD;
      consisting of two Metvix PDT treatments 7 days apart (Lesion that show non-complete response&#xD;
      at 3 months will have a second PDT treatment cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point will be the histologically confirmed complete response rate within a&#xD;
      patient (No BCC cells in the biopsy taken 3 months after the last treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are safety evaluation during the first 13 weeks or 6 months (if two&#xD;
      treatment cycles) after the first Metvix treatment, cosmetic outcome and recurrence rates 12,&#xD;
      24, 35, 48 and 60 months after the first Metvix treatment.&#xD;
