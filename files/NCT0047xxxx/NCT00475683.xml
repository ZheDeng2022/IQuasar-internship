  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mucositis consists of inflammation of the mucosal membrane and is a prominent cause of&#xD;
      patient discomfort during cancer therapy. In children receiving chemotherapy, the incidence&#xD;
      of oral mucositis is reported to be between 40%-70%. Curcumin, a commonly-used spice in India&#xD;
      and Southeast Asia, was shown in animal models to prevent chemotherapy and radiotherapy&#xD;
      induced mucositis. We hypothesize that curcumin may prevent oral mucosal injury and reduce&#xD;
      the severity of oral mucositis in children receiving chemotherapy. Thus, the aim of this&#xD;
      study is to determine whether in children undergoing doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy,&#xD;
      does supplementation of curcumin, when compared to placebo, decrease oral mucositis both by&#xD;
      objective (mucositis scales) and subjective (pain scale) measurements. Effective prevention&#xD;
      and reduction of mucosal injury may significantly improve the care we provide to children&#xD;
      undergoing therapy for cancer.&#xD;

      Children older than 5 years of age diagnosed with cancer and treated at the Pediatric&#xD;
      Hematology/Oncology unit, Hadassah Medical Center will be eligible to the study. The study is&#xD;
      designed as a cross-over study, wherein each patient serves as his or her own control, thus&#xD;
      all included children should be scheduled to receive at least two identical curses of&#xD;
      doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy in which the dose of doxorubicin is at least 60mg/m2 per&#xD;
      course. The patients will be assigned to randomly receive curcumin or placebo in the 1st&#xD;
      course, with the other regimen administered at the 2nd course. Curcumin will be given as&#xD;
      fluid extract (1:1) at a dose of 10 drops, three times a day. Adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      will receive the adult recommend dose, i.e. 30 drops, three times a day. Placebo will be&#xD;
      given at the same dose. The patients will be taught to rinse the mouth with the medicine and&#xD;
      than spit out. The therapy will be given from a day prior to the first day of the cycle for&#xD;
      two weeks. A diary kept by the family will record each given dose. Possible side effects&#xD;
      associated with the study drug, such as vomiting, nausea, rash, etc., will be recorded. No&#xD;
      other adjunctive topical treatment will be used during the study. Adherence will be assessed&#xD;
      through subject reports as well as by review of returned medications every cycle collected&#xD;
      during the objective assessment site visits. Given the intent-to-treat analysis, all&#xD;
      participants will be included irrespective of how much of the study medication was taken.The&#xD;
      measurements of study outcome, i.e. OMAS score, WHO mucositis scale and visual analogue pain&#xD;
      scale will be done on day 1,7,10,14,21 Â± 1 of each chemotherapy cycle. The following data&#xD;
      will be recorded in all cycles: duration of neutropenia, the need and length of&#xD;
      hospitalization, use and dosage of opioid analgesia, need for total potential nutrition,&#xD;
      blood culture positive infection and other mucositis related complications.&#xD;
