  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the early access programme (EAP) of sorafenib in the indication of advanced renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (RCC). The study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in&#xD;
      patients with advanced RCC.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 3 % of all cancers. RCC can be cured if&#xD;
      diagnosed and treated when still localized to the kidney or immediate surrounding tissues.&#xD;
      Since most of the RCC tumours are diagnosed when still localized, approximately 40 % of all&#xD;
      patients survive 5 years. The median survival of Stage IV RCC after diagnosis is 8 to 12&#xD;
      months and the 5-year survival is less than 10 %. Surgery has been the primary therapy for&#xD;
      RCC for more than a century. Until recently, metastatic disease has been refractory to any&#xD;
      systemic therapy. Despite recent advances in immunotherapy (e.g. Interferon and&#xD;
      Interleukin-2), the response rates remain low (15 %) and few patients experience durable&#xD;
      remission. Surgical and radiation therapies for Stage IV disease are generally limited to&#xD;
      palliation of symptoms. For the majority of patients, metastatic RCC is incurable and&#xD;
      patients should be considered candidates for clinical trials when appropriate. In summary,&#xD;
      the available therapies for advanced unresectable and/or metastatic RCC have limited clinical&#xD;
      values, with response rates ranging from 6-20 % and little impact on the natural history of&#xD;
      the disease. Furthermore, the toxicities associated with these agents can be severe,&#xD;
      requiring careful patient selection, and this dramatically decreases the number of patients&#xD;
      who may benefit from therapy. Advanced RCC remains incurable and the need for more effective&#xD;
      therapies is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized, open-label treatment protocol for patients with advanced RCC.&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with 400 mg oral sorafenib twice a day on a continuous. Patients in&#xD;
      this protocol may continue to be treated with sorafenib as a single agent until any of the&#xD;
      following criteria for drug or protocol discontinuation is reached:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Progression of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient is unlikely to benefit from further treatment with sorafenib as judged by&#xD;
           the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intolerable toxicity of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Withdrawal of consent for any reason.&#xD;
