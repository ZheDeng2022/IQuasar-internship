      This study will collect blood, urine, and other tissue samples from 50 patients study-wide&#xD;
      with Pentalogy of Cantrell and other inherited diseases that involve mutations in non-muscle&#xD;
      genes. Mutations in non-muscle genes have been shown to result in human defects involving&#xD;
      blood platelets, kidney, hearing and sight. The major objective of this protocol is to study&#xD;
      a variety of blood, tissue and urine samples by looking at protein, DNA, and RNA in those&#xD;
      collected samples.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pentalogy of Cantrell is a very rare disorder in which patients have a combination of severe&#xD;
      defects of the middle of the chest including the sternum (breastbone), diaphragm (muscle&#xD;
      which separates the chest from the abdomen), heart, and abdominal wall. The defects can&#xD;
      affect both males and females and is apparent at birth or shortly after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect blood, urine, and other tissue samples from 50 patients study-wide&#xD;
      with Pentalogy of Cantrell and other inherited diseases that involve mutations in non-muscle&#xD;
      genes. Mutations in non-muscle genes have been shown to result in human defects involving&#xD;
      blood platelets, kidney, hearing and sight. The major objective of this protocol is to study&#xD;
      a variety of blood, tissue and urine samples by looking at protein, DNA, and RNA in those&#xD;
      collected samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment in this study is entirely voluntary and the subject can elect to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any time. Each subject will receive an oral and written explanation of this study&#xD;
      and the purpose, procedures, and risks of this study in language that is comprehensible. The&#xD;
      Investigator will be available to answer any questions the subject may have regarding the&#xD;
      study. If the subject is a minor, the parent who signs the consent for the minor must be the&#xD;
      legally recognized parent or guardian. Where deemed appropriate, the child will also be&#xD;
      included in all discussions about the trial and a minor's assent will be obtained. The parent&#xD;
      or guardian will sign on the designated line on the informed consent attesting to the fact&#xD;
      that the child had given assent. If the minor child refuses to provide assent, then&#xD;
      participation in the study will not occur. Informed consent will be obtained by the&#xD;
      Investigator or designee, and a copy of the signed consent document will be given to the&#xD;
      subject and placed in the subject's medical record. Subjects may withdraw permission of use&#xD;
      of blood/tissue/urine specimens at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue and/or blood and/or urine samples from participating institutions that have identified&#xD;
      cases of Pentalogy of Cantrell and/or related syndromes will be collected. These samples will&#xD;
      be sent to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for analysis and kept for a&#xD;
      period of 5 years, unless the subject withdraws permission during that period. Standard&#xD;
      methods will be used to collect the blood, tissue, and/or urine samples. For example, blood&#xD;
      samples will be obtained from routine blood drawing and tissue may be obtained from&#xD;
      previously obtained tissue secondary to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples that are sent to the NHLBI for analysis will have identifiers on them, so if new&#xD;
      information is discovered, the research subject may be contacted. All samples will be stored&#xD;
      in a locked storage facility to maximize patient confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Adverse Events are listed in the protocol and consent. Unanticipated Adverse&#xD;
      Events will be reported to the appropriate institutions. All serious adverse events will be&#xD;
      reported by the Investigator verbally and in writing to the Clinical Director and the NHLBI&#xD;
      IRB within the time frame set by the protocol. The nature of this study does not warrant a&#xD;
      DSMB, therefore the principal Investigator, Dr. Robert Adelstein will provide oversight of&#xD;
      the safety and data analysis of the conduct of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit of this study is discovery of the disease and the mutation that causes the&#xD;
      disease, therefore yielding generalizable knowledge regarding the disorder.&#xD;
