  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of a new experimental drug, IL-7, in people with HIV&#xD;
      infection. Animal studies have shown that IL-7 can improve the function and number of&#xD;
      infection-fighting cells called T lymphocytes, or T cells. If this study shows that IL-7 is&#xD;
      safe, additional studies will be done to see if it can improve the function or numbers of&#xD;
      T-cells in HIV-infected persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected persons who have been receiving HAART therapy for at least 12 months before&#xD;
      enrolling in the study and have been stable on this treatment for at least 3 months before&#xD;
      enrollment may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have about 10 clinic visits over 3 months. They receive three injections of&#xD;
      IL-7, one injection a week for 3 consecutive weeks. The injections are given as a shot under&#xD;
      the skin in the arm or leg. On the day of each injection, the participant stays in the clinic&#xD;
      for up to 8 hours or longer for observation and collection of blood samples. Three additional&#xD;
      visits (one every 3 months) may be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study visits the following may be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, physical examination, blood tests every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG) at study days 0 (day of first dose), 1, 7 (day of second dose),&#xD;
           14 (day of third dose) and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest x-ray study on day 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collections at frequent intervals during the first 96 hours after the first&#xD;
           dose administration. A catheter (thin plastic tube) may be put into a vein in the arm&#xD;
           and left in place to allow several blood samples to be drawn without repeated needle&#xD;
           sticks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine tests several times during the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Interleukin 7 (IL-7) is an essential cytokine for the thymic development and the post-thymic&#xD;
      survival, expansion and maturation of T lymphocytes in humans. The rationale for using IL-7&#xD;
      as immunotherapy in HIV infection would be to support the expansion, survival and functional&#xD;
      properties of T lymphocytes and enhance immune reconstitution. Phase I studies of a previous&#xD;
      formulation of rhIL7 in cancer and HIV infected patients have shown that T cell proliferation&#xD;
      and expansion can be achieved at doses that are well tolerated. The newly glycosylated form&#xD;
      of IL-7 tested in this study has a longer half-life allowing weekly administrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I/IIa, open label, single arm trial that will test the safety of three&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections of IL-7 at three different dose levels (10, 20 and 30&#xD;
      micrograms/kilograms) that will be tested sequentially. Eligible subjects (400&#xD;
      cells/microliters greater than CD4 greater than 101 cells/microliters and VL less than 1000&#xD;
      copies/milliliter, on antiretroviral therapy for at least one year) will be given 3 doses of&#xD;
      IL-7 at weekly intervals (day 0, day 7 and day 14). Participants will be followed on days 0,&#xD;
      1, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 with additional visits on days 35, 56, and 77 and optional follow up&#xD;
      every 3 months thereafter until week 56 (approximately 1 year after enrollment). The three&#xD;
      doses will be tested sequentially (10, 20 and 30 micrograms/kilograms per dose) and dose&#xD;
      escalation will occur only when safety data from day 28 of the previous dose level&#xD;
      participants are complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten subjects will enroll in each dose level and dose escalation will occur only after all&#xD;
      subjects complete four weeks without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. Secondary end&#xD;
      points include a PK study of glycosylated rhIL7 as well as immunologic studies throughout the&#xD;
      duration of the study to assess evidence of IL7 biologic activity with markers of T cell&#xD;
      proliferation and expression of the alpha chain of the IL7 receptor. This is a multi-center&#xD;
      international study sponsored by Cytheris with sites in USA, Canada, Italy and France.&#xD;
      Children will be excluded and a separate study will be required in the future after the&#xD;
      safety and biologic activity of this agent is established in adults. The study will enroll a&#xD;
      total of approximately 30 participants.&#xD;
