      -  Primary Objective will be to evaluate the use of Ga-67 citrate as an alternative&#xD;
           radiopharmaceutical for CSF imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objective will be to evaluate the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
           radiation dosimetry of In 111 DTPA and gallium-67 after intrathecal injection during&#xD;
           remission of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) and during LM occurrence, remission and&#xD;
           recurrence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In-111 DTPA is a radioactive dye that is standardly used to check the flow of CSF. Ga-67&#xD;
      citrate has been used to detect inflammation and tumors in other parts of the body, and&#xD;
      researchers want to learn if it is also able to detect tumors in the brain and spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can be enrolled in this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests will&#xD;
      help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. Blood (about 1-2&#xD;
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw will include a&#xD;
      pregnancy test for women who are able to have children. To be eligible to take part in this&#xD;
      study, the pregnancy test must be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 3&#xD;
      groups. The group you are assigned to will depend on whether tumor cells were found in the&#xD;
      CSF during your last spinal fluid exam. If you were found to have cancer cells in the CSF and&#xD;
      you have had no earlier treatment for this type of disease, the first 5 participants will be&#xD;
      assigned to Group A and will be given Ga-67 citrate injection alone, in the baseline study.&#xD;
      The next 5 participants who have cancer cells in the CSF and have had no earlier treatment&#xD;
      will be assigned to Group B. Group B will have Ga-67 and In 111 DTPA injection in the&#xD;
      baseline study. Otherwise, if the tumors in the CSF have been treated and are now cleared&#xD;
      from the CSF, you will be assigned to Group C and will receive standard follow-up care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, you will have an imaging session. This first imaging session&#xD;
      is called the &quot;baseline&quot; session. For the imaging, you will lie on a gamma camera table.&#xD;
      Depending on which group you are in, one or both of the radioactive dyes will be injected&#xD;
      into your CSF through the Ommaya reservoir. If you are in Group B or C, both In-111 DTPA and&#xD;
      Ga-67 citrate will be injected over about 2-4 minutes, total. If you are in Group A, Ga-67&#xD;
      citrate alone will be injected over about 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who are 2-17 years old, the doses of In-111 DTPA and Ga-67 citrate will be&#xD;
      adjusted to the surface area of your body (a measurement of your body size).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the hour immediately following the injections, your head, neck, and back areas will be&#xD;
      imaged (scanned) in order to see how the CSF flows. After that, you will have scans of your&#xD;
      entire body performed in order to see how quickly the radioactive dyes leave from different&#xD;
      parts of your body. These whole-body scans will each last 20 minutes. These scans (1 each&#xD;
      time) will occur at 1-2, 3-4, 6-8, 22-24, 28-32, 48, and 72 hours after the injections. You&#xD;
      will have blood samples collected before injection and during each imaging session in order&#xD;
      to measure how much radiation is absorbed by different parts of your brain, spine, and other&#xD;
      organs. These blood samples (less than Â¼ teaspoon each time) will be drawn during each of the&#xD;
      whole-body scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group A or B, you will receive standard follow-up care for up to 52 weeks after&#xD;
      the baseline imaging session. This is in order to check the status of the disease. If the&#xD;
      cancer goes into remission (no tumor cells are found in CSF) at any time during the 52 weeks,&#xD;
      you will have a follow-up imaging session. The follow-up imaging session will include the&#xD;
      same procedures, and In-111 DTPA and/or Ga-67 citrate injections as the baseline imaging&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group C, you will receive standard follow-up care for up to 52 weeks after the&#xD;
      baseline imaging session. If the cancer reappears at any time during the 52 weeks, you will&#xD;
      have a follow-up imaging session. The follow-up imaging session will include the same&#xD;
      procedures, and In-111 DTPA and Ga-67 citrate injections as the baseline imaging session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether you are in Group A, B or C, after your last follow-up imaging session, your&#xD;
      participation in this study will be over. If your cancer clears from the spinal fluid, the&#xD;
      records from your routine visit to the neuro-oncology clinic will be reviewed to follow your&#xD;
      progress until 30 days after the radioisotope injection for your last imaging session.&#xD;
      Researchers will review your medical records for potential side effects. If you do not have a&#xD;
      clinical visit within a week from that 30th day, the study chair will contact you by phone&#xD;
      concerning these matters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. In-111 DTPA is commercially available and FDA approved for&#xD;
      injection into the CSF. Although Ga-67 citrate is FDA approved for injection into a vein, it&#xD;
      is not FDA approved for injection into the CSF. It is commercially available, but injecting&#xD;
      it into the CSF has only been authorized for use in research. Up to 20 patients will take&#xD;
      part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
