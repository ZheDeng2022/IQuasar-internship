  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to provide current information, etiology and outcome of&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), risk factors for for CAP in isolates of Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae and Haemophilus influencae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and&#xD;
      Legionella. Risk factors, including patient demographics, comorbid illnesses, setting of&#xD;
      presentation, causative organisms, antibiotic history, and resistance profiles will be&#xD;
      assessed and outcome will be recorded.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following information will be collected: age, sex, occupation, hospital location at the&#xD;
      time of positive culture (ER, medical ward, ICU etc), date of positive culture, prior&#xD;
      hospitalization, receipt of outpatient dialysis, home care or other regular medical care (eg,&#xD;
      outpatient chemotherapy), presence of invasive devices, receipt of antibiotics, including&#xD;
      their type and whether they were adequate for the resistance profile of the organism, prior&#xD;
      positive microbiologic cultures, time and location of positive cultures, underlying diseases&#xD;
      and severity of illness, co-morbid illnesses, presence of urinary or intravascular devices,&#xD;
      recent immunomodulative therapies or radiation therapy, physical exam findings, laboratory&#xD;
      and radiographical data, antimicrobial usage within 30 days of onset of the infection,&#xD;
      microbiological data and resistance patterns, choice of antibiotics once organism identified,&#xD;
      bacteriological outcomes, laboratory results, demographic information, medications, clinical&#xD;
      outcome,gender, height, weight, ethnicity, and past medical history. We will collect&#xD;
      information retrospectively.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influencae, Mycoplasma&#xD;
             pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella species infections during the time&#xD;
             period the study will be reviewed. A community-associated pneumonia isolate will be&#xD;
             defined as one which was recovered from a clinical culture from a patient at UPMC who&#xD;
             had no established risk factors for infection with an antibiotic resistant organism.&#xD;
             Established risk factors are defined as: Isolation of the organism two or more days&#xD;
             after admission for hospitalization OR history of hospitalization, surgery, dialysis,&#xD;
             or residence in a long-term care facility within one year before the culture date OR&#xD;
             The presence of an indwelling catheter or percutaneous medical device (eg,&#xD;
             tracheostomy tube, gastrostomy tube, or Foley catheter) at the time of the culture OR&#xD;
             Previous isolation of an antibiotic resistant organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
