    <textblock>
      Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the main causes of development of chronic&#xD;
      liver disease and cirrhosis. There are no published studies which have investigated the&#xD;
      incidence of NAFLD in pregnant women or the correlation between the metabolic changes in&#xD;
      pregnancy and this phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed in our study to explore the incidence of NAFLD in pregnancy by ultrasonography (US)&#xD;
      during the end of the pregnancy or immediately after birth (after 36 weeks) and to look for a&#xD;
      correlation between fatty liver and demographic, clinical, nutritional and laboratory data&#xD;
      during pregnancy.&#xD;

      Fatty liver in pregnancy-protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the main causes of development of chronic&#xD;
      liver disease and cirrhosis. The incidence of NAFLD among the general population is about&#xD;
      17-30%. There are no published studies which have investigated the incidence of NAFLD in&#xD;
      pregnant women or the correlation between the metabolic changes in pregnancy and this&#xD;
      phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed in our study to explore the incidence of NAFLD in pregnancy by ultrasonography (US)&#xD;
      during the end of the pregnancy or immediately after birth (after 36 weeks) and to look for a&#xD;
      correlation between fatty liver and demographic, clinical, nutritional and laboratory data&#xD;
      during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: US examination will be performed by an experienced technician. The liver will be&#xD;
      scanned by B mode US using a 2-5 MHZ transducer. In those with fatty liver as seen by US, a&#xD;
      repeat examination will be performed after 6 weeks and 24 weeks. For women with the diagnosis&#xD;
      of fatty liver, serum lipid profile, glucose, liver function tests and insulin will be done.&#xD;
      Homa score as well as BMI will be calculated for each woman with fatty liver. All&#xD;
      participants will sign an informed consent which has been approved by the hospital ethical&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
