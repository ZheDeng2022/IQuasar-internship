  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of intracoronary cardiac stem cells&#xD;
      (CSCs) therapy in humans. Currently, there is no effective intervention to regenerate&#xD;
      (regrow) dead heart muscle after a heart attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that CSCs infused into nonviable myocardial segments will&#xD;
      regenerate infarcted myocardium by differentiating into cardiomyocytes and other cell types.&#xD;
      According to our hypothesis, CSC infusion regenerates myocardium with consequent improvement&#xD;
      in contractile function of the heart and general clinical status.&#xD;

      This will be a randomized, open-label study involving 20 patients and 20 controls. This study&#xD;
      will be done as a collaborative project between Brigham Women's Hospital and The University&#xD;
      of Louisville. This study is a phase I trial assessing the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      intracoronary autologous CSC [harvested from the right atrial appendage (RAA)]&#xD;
      transplantation in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The study will be conducted in two&#xD;
      stages: Stage A, in which the investigators will obtain an initial assessment of safety and&#xD;
      feasibility, and stage B, in which the investigators will adopt a block randomization&#xD;
      strategy that will enable us to assess the feasibility of conducting a subsequent, randomized&#xD;
      phase II trials. While the investigators also hope to have an estimate of efficacy, this&#xD;
      focus will be the specific aim of future phase II trials. All patients who are undergoing&#xD;
      on-pump CABG will be screened twice. The initial screening will be done to determine the&#xD;
      preliminary eligibility (before-CABG screening) of patients for the study. If the patients&#xD;
      satisfy the preliminary eligibility criteria stated below, the right atrial appendage, which&#xD;
      is routinely resected during all on-pump bypass surgeries, will be collected and processed.&#xD;
      Thereafter, the CSCs will be cultured and expanded from the RAA. The second screening will&#xD;
      occur an average of 4 ± 1 months after CABG surgery, and will utilize a LVEF of &lt; 40%&#xD;
      assessed by cardiac MRI and/or the disk summation method [or Simpson's method] using&#xD;
      echocardiography, for final enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The preliminary eligibility criteria will utilize an EF &lt; 40% measured by any of the&#xD;
           following: cardiac imaging tests performed within 2 weeks prior to screening:&#xD;
           echocardiography, gated SPECT and/or LV angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A maximum of 60 patients who satisfy the preliminary eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
           enrolled in the preliminary phase of the study (i.e., will have RAA tissue&#xD;
           harvested/cultured/expanded). Of these 60 patients, a maximum of 20 will be enrolled in&#xD;
           the final phase of the study (i.e., will undergo CSC injections and subsequent&#xD;
           follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this open-label study, a maximum of 20 patients will eventually receive intracoronary&#xD;
           CSC transplantation. These patients will have nonviable myocardium/scar from prior MI&#xD;
           and will undergo CABG for ICM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrollment of patients will be done in two stages: Stage A and stage B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In stage A, 9 consecutive patients will be enrolled in the treatment arm followed by 4&#xD;
           consecutive patients in the control arm. Stage A will enable us to perform an initial&#xD;
           assessment of whether the process of harvesting, processing, and administering cardiac&#xD;
           stem cells is associated with common/frequent short-term adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In stage B, patients will be randomized to the treated and control arms using a 2:3&#xD;
           ratio with a block size of 5 with a final variable block. As a result, the total number&#xD;
           of both treated and control patients will be 20 each. More specifically, 11 treated and&#xD;
           16 control patients will make up stage B. To ensure that randomization can be done at&#xD;
           the time of final enrollment, right atrial tissue will be harvested and cardiac stem&#xD;
           cells will be grown from all patients who meet the enrollment criteria at the time of&#xD;
           initial enrollment. If a patient is then randomized to the control arm, his/her cells&#xD;
           will be discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who satisfy the preliminary eligibility criteria will be enrolled and&#xD;
           revascularized within few days (&lt; 2 weeks) of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive venous and/or arterial grafts as needed during CABG surgery.&#xD;
           Nonviable myocardial segments will also be revascularized in order to enable subsequent&#xD;
           intracoronary delivery of CSCs into the scarred region.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During on-pump CABG surgery, patients will undergo resection of part of the RAA at the&#xD;
           cannulation site (this is done routinely during CABG surgery). Resected RAA tissue (&lt; 1&#xD;
           g) will be collected intra-operatively and handled as described in the preparation&#xD;
           section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac catheterization (coronary angiography) for intracoronary injection of CSCs will&#xD;
           be performed 4 ± 1 month after CABG surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worldwide, more than 500 patients have received intracoronary infusions of stem cells&#xD;
      (derived from the bone marrow and peripheral blood). None of these patients have had any&#xD;
      adverse events as a result of these infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this project is to determine whether intracoronary delivery of CSCs&#xD;
      can regenerate non-viable myocardial segments in patients with ICM. CSCs will be harvested&#xD;
      from right atrial appendages (RAAs) of patients with ICM during surgical revascularization,&#xD;
      cultured and expanded in vitro, and then transplanted back into the same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of harvesting CSCs from RAAs of patients undergoing&#xD;
           surgical revascularization, culturing and expanding them in vitro, and injecting them&#xD;
           into patients via the intracoronary route&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the safety of intracoronary infusion of CSCs&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these safety data, we hope to obtain initial evidence that CSC administration&#xD;
      results in clinical improvement.&#xD;
