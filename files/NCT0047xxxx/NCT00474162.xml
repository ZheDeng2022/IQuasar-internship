  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women are more likely to form clots than non-pregnant women as pregnancy increases&#xD;
      the clotting factors present in the blood. This helps to prevent excess bleeding (hemorrhage)&#xD;
      at the time of delivery. Hemorrhage occurs in 5-15% of pregnancies throughout the world, even&#xD;
      when delivery is by cesarean section. When hemorrhage occurs the anesthesiologist will&#xD;
      normally administer fluids into the woman's vein (intravenously) rapidly to replace the blood&#xD;
      that the woman has lost. Two types of fluids are commonly used. One is a salt water solution&#xD;
      (saline) and the other is a starch water solution (pentastarch). Use of either or both of&#xD;
      these solutions is common during hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These same solutions (salt water solution and starch solution) are used at BC Women's&#xD;
      Hospital during spinal anesthesia to prevent and treat low blood pressure (a common side&#xD;
      effect of spinal anesthesia). This is standard practice whether you are in this study or not.&#xD;
      You may also be given, depending on the anesthesiologist's preference, a drug (vasopressor)&#xD;
      that causes the blood vessels to become narrow (constrict) to prevent or treat the low blood&#xD;
      pressure. Whether you agree to be part of the study or not, your anesthesiologist will be&#xD;
      watching your blood pressure closely throughout your operation and if your blood pressure&#xD;
      becomes low he/she will treat it as is normally done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low blood pressure will also occur during hemorrhage. It is therefore important that we&#xD;
      determine whether the starch solution, which is more effective than the salt solution in&#xD;
      preventing low blood pressure during spinal anesthesia, does or does not affect clotting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research in non-pregnant adults (male and female) has found that laboratory tests of blood&#xD;
      clotting change with these solutions. For saline the evidence in some studies suggests that&#xD;
      the blood may clot better than normal while other studies suggest the opposite (does not clot&#xD;
      as well). In pregnant and non-pregnant adults the blood does not clot as well with certain&#xD;
      starch solutions. The starch solution used at BC Women's Hospital is called pentastarch and&#xD;
      no research has looked at its effect on clotting in pregnant women. In non-pregnant adults&#xD;
      pentastarch has less effect on clotting than other starch solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to see how pentastarch (starch solution) and normal saline (water&#xD;
      with salt in it) given at the time of spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean section affect&#xD;
      the ability of pregnant woman's blood to clot.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study patients will be randomized to one of two groups. One group will receive saline&#xD;
      solution (salt water) and the other group will receive the pentastarch solution. Neither the&#xD;
      patient, the anesthesiologist, the obstetrician nor nurses will know which group the patient&#xD;
      is in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women who participate in the study will have an intravenous. Once the tube is in the&#xD;
      vein, a blood sample will be taken from it before an intravenous solution is started. The&#xD;
      amount of blood taken will be approximately 1 tablespoon (15mL). This is not part of routine&#xD;
      care but is part of the study. This blood will be checked to see how well it forms a clot.&#xD;
      The study solution (15 ml/kg of either saline or starch solution, approximately 1 litre) will&#xD;
      then be attached to the intravenous. Once the patient is in the operating room and the spinal&#xD;
      anesthetic has been given the remainder of the study solution will be given very rapidly over&#xD;
      10 minutes into the vein. Once the study solution has been given, the patient will receive a&#xD;
      saline solution through their intravenous at a rate determined by the anesthesiologist&#xD;
      according to their normal practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five minutes after the study solution is given, a further blood sample (15 mL) will be taken&#xD;
      from the intravenous and it will be tested the same as for the first blood sample. A third&#xD;
      blood sample will be taken approximately 85 minutes later. As these blood samples will be&#xD;
      taken from the intravenous, the patient will not have to have a needle inserted to take them.&#xD;
      Approximately 10% of the time it may not be possible to take the blood sample from the&#xD;
      intravenous. If this should happen the investigator or the anesthesiologist will want to take&#xD;
      the blood sample from the opposite arm to the intravenous. The patient will be told that this&#xD;
      is going to happen and can withdraw from the study at that time. This will not affect any&#xD;
      further care that the patient receives. To minimize discomfort if blood is taken from the&#xD;
      opposite arm the skin will be made numb with local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be treated the same as any woman having a cesarean section under spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      with the exception that&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. the patient and the anesthesiologist will not know which study solution is being given and&#xD;
      2 three blood samples will be taken - to total 3 tablespoons (total: 3x1 tablespoon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of the study we will be using the information collected about the patient in&#xD;
      the normal course of the anesthetic, including the total amount of fluid that received during&#xD;
      cesarean section, the need for, type and amount of any medication during the cesarean&#xD;
      section, and an estimate of the total amount of blood lost during the operation. These are in&#xD;
      addition to the results of the laboratory tests of clotting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no extra time or cost involved for the patient.&#xD;
