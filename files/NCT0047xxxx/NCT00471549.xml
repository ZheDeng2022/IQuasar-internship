  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is associated with dyslipidaemia leading to generalized atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and nephropathy. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a glycoprotein involved&#xD;
      in bone homeostasis, has been implicated in the pathogenesis leading up vessel calcification.&#xD;
      Furthermore, CVD in diabetics is associated with increased levels of OPG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To investigate whether low dose simvastatin treatment (10-20 mg/day) reduces circulating&#xD;
      levels of OPG as well as adhesion molecules (VCAM-1; vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, ICAM;&#xD;
      intercellular cell adhesion molecule).&#xD;

      Type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of macro- and microvascular&#xD;
      complications, resulting from a generalized injury to the vascular endothelium. The&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms leading to cardio vascular disease (CVD) in diabetics are not&#xD;
      well defined. However, there is accumulating evidence, that damage to vascular smooth muscle&#xD;
      cells and endothelial cells partly occur through vessel shear stress, changes in nitric&#xD;
      oxide, and increased cytokine levels (i.e. TNF-α: tumour necrosis factor-α and IL-1:&#xD;
      interleukin-1). This ultimately results in sclerosis of the basal membrane caused by&#xD;
      endothelial cell proliferation and increased vascular permeability, allowing protein to leak&#xD;
      into the extra cellular matrix. Atherosclerotic lesions may also arise as a result of&#xD;
      accumulation of monocytes and macrophages containing oxidised LDL (foam cells) in the&#xD;
      arterial wall. This process is initiated by the expression of adhesion molecules (e.g.&#xD;
      VCAM-1; vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, ICAM; intercellular cell adhesion molecule) on the&#xD;
      luminal surface of vascular endothelial cells, allowing cellular attachment and migration&#xD;
      into the vascular wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a secreted basic glycoprotein and member of the TNF receptor&#xD;
      superfamily, is a soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL), and&#xD;
      TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), though with much lower affinity to TRAIL&#xD;
      compared to RANKL. OPG works as a decoy-receptor preventing the RANK-RANKL interaction,&#xD;
      thereby reducing the biological effect. The RANK-RANKL system induces osteoclast&#xD;
      differentiation and activation whereby bone absorption is promoted. Due to its properties as&#xD;
      a decoy receptor, OPG antagonizes this effect and inhibits bone loss. In addition to the&#xD;
      effects on osteoclasts, the RANK-RANKL system has been proposed to have cardiovascular&#xD;
      effects. Thus, activation of the RANK-RANKL system induces VCAM-1 synthesis, prolongs&#xD;
      endothelial cell survival, promotes angiogenesis, and reduces TNF-α levels. In contrast,&#xD;
      elevated levels of OPG are associated with the severity of CVD, although it is presently&#xD;
      unclear whether this association reflects a cause-effect relationship or is purely&#xD;
      coincidental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholesterol-lowering therapy with statins reduces cardiovascular mortality and morbidity risk&#xD;
      in diabetics and non-diabetic subjects. According to recent studies, statins may have&#xD;
      additional, pleiotropic effects and may in fact stabilize atherosclerotic plaques.&#xD;
      Experimental data obtained in animal models indicate dose-dependent angiogenetic effects and&#xD;
      promotion of vascular structure formation. It is therefore of interest that recent, in vitro&#xD;
      studies by Ben-Tahl et al. and Rasmussen et al. suggest that statins may suppress OPG and&#xD;
      adhesion molecule production in humans. Thus, umbilical vein endothelial cells and smooth&#xD;
      vascular muscle cells incubated with simvastatin and stimulated with TNF-α and IL-1 secreted&#xD;
      less OPG than control cells. Under normal circumstances, exposure to cytokines (TNF-α and&#xD;
      IL-1) is a powerful stimulus to OPG production in vascular cells and these results therefore&#xD;
      seem to support the concept, that simvastatin may ameliorate some of the deleterious effects&#xD;
      of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted to examine the effect of simvastatin treatment on circulating OPG&#xD;
      and adhesion molecule levels in a group of type 2 diabetic patients at increased risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to persistent microalbuminuria. Since both OPG and adhesion&#xD;
      molecules are associated with CVD and potentially modifiable by statin treatment this could&#xD;
      help improve our understanding of potentially pleiotropic effects of statins in reducing CVD.&#xD;
