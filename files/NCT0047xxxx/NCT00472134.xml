  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a local anesthetic dispensed via a&#xD;
      tiny catheter device, called the ON-Q PainBuster pump, placed during surgery on top of the&#xD;
      mesh used in the laparoscopic repair of ventral hernias. The goals are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reducing postoperative pain from this procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decreasing length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reducing or eliminating amount of post-operative narcotics used&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One outcome of the greater than 2 million abdominal operations performed in the United States&#xD;
      each year is an incisional hernia rate of 3% to 20%. As a result, approximately 150,000&#xD;
      ventral hernia repairs are performed annually. The increasing number of incisional hernias&#xD;
      merely reflects the evolution of surgery with the ability to perform larger abdominal&#xD;
      operations such as aortic surgery and colectomy. Primary tissue repairs have had unacceptable&#xD;
      rates of recurrence when used for larger defects. The introduction of prosthetic biomaterials&#xD;
      revolutionized hernia surgery with the concept of a tension-free repair. The subsequent rate&#xD;
      of recurrence has been lowered to less than 10%. However, the required dissection of wide&#xD;
      areas of soft tissue for mesh placement contribute to an incidence of wound infections and&#xD;
      wound-related complications of 12% or greater. These problems were part of the impetus to&#xD;
      develop minimally invasive techniques for ventral herniorrhaphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laparoscopic repair of ventral hernias is rapidly evolving with patient and surgeon&#xD;
      interest in less morbid herniorrhaphies and the appeal of minimally invasive surgery. The&#xD;
      technique is based on the open, preperitoneal repair described by Rives and Stoppa. The&#xD;
      placement of a large mesh in the preperitoneal location allows for an even distribution of&#xD;
      forces along the surface area of the mesh, which may account for the strength of the repair&#xD;
      and the decreased recurrence rates associated with it. The minimally invasive approach&#xD;
      embraces the concept that a retromuscular mesh repair may be more durable, although the mesh&#xD;
      is placed one layer deeper on an intact peritoneum in comparison to the open technique. The&#xD;
      technique incorporates other fundamental components of the open repair such as wide mesh&#xD;
      overlap of the defect and the use of transabdominal fixation sutures and spiral tacks to&#xD;
      secure the mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the laparoscopic approach to ventral hernia repair has been documented as safe and&#xD;
      effective, with low recurrence rates and minimal patient morbidity, some patients complain of&#xD;
      significant post-operative pain for up to 1-3 months after surgery. The exact cause of this&#xD;
      postoperative discomfort has not been clearly elucidated. Several hypotheses exist. Some feel&#xD;
      that the extensive adhesiolysis required for incisional hernia repair causes significant&#xD;
      peritoneal irritation that is exacerbated with the placement of intraperitoneal mesh. Others&#xD;
      implicate the spiral tacks placed through the mesh into the peritoneum as sources of&#xD;
      persistent discomfort. While others feel that the transabdominal fixation sutures are the&#xD;
      localizing site for the accompanying postoperative pain. Transabdominal suture site pain&#xD;
      after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is not uncommon, and occurred in 23% of patients in&#xD;
      one series.8 The transabdominal fixation suture sites are those incisions where sutures are&#xD;
      placed to secure the mesh placed during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair to the anterior&#xD;
      abdominal wall. The sutures are placed in a &quot;clockwise&quot; manner approximately every 4 to 5 cm&#xD;
      at the periphery of the mesh as well as 5 mm spiral tacks to hold it in place until&#xD;
      fibrocollagenous ingrowth secures the mesh to the abdominal wall. This persistent abdominal&#xD;
      pain has been documented as a minor long-term complication resulting from laparoscopic&#xD;
      ventral hernia repair, but it can be troublesome for patients in the immediate postoperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most effective method for managing this postoperative pain has not been defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of postoperative care is to minimize the amount of pain a patient experiences&#xD;
      following surgery and to help the patient make a quick recovery that leads to a shorter&#xD;
      hospital stay free of complications and an earlier return to self-reliance. The most common&#xD;
      treatment for pain after operation is opioid analgesic drug administration. Opioids are&#xD;
      associated with undesirable side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      itching, increased duration of postoperative ileus, and delay in discharge. These side&#xD;
      effects can be decreased with a reduction in the amount of opioid drugs utilized.&#xD;
      Additionally, systemic narcotics may not optimize pain management in a specific region of the&#xD;
      body because of its centralized effect. This may lead to a decreased mentation, reduced&#xD;
      mobility, and a slower return to normal activities. Because a reduction of the daily&#xD;
      consumption of narcotics is often associated with a decrease in analgesia, many other&#xD;
      treatments for postoperative pain have been evaluated. For example, epidural analgesia is&#xD;
      effective but the catheter needs to be placed preoperatively, is fairly invasive method, and&#xD;
      the maintenance of the epidural treatment can be time consuming and expensive. Many studies&#xD;
      have found clinical pain management benefits to the use of local analgesia, as measured by&#xD;
      the use of less post-operative pain medication and more favorable ratings on pain intensity&#xD;
      scales. Recently, a new method of delivering continuous wound infiltration with a solution of&#xD;
      local anesthetic through an indwelling irrigation apparatus has been used in an attempt to&#xD;
      reduce early postoperative discomfort in patients after thoracotomy, donor nephrectomy, and&#xD;
      open inguinal hernia repair. These prospective randomized double blind studies universally&#xD;
      report decreased postoperative discomfort and limited usage of opioids with the usage of&#xD;
      these novel catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the goal is to minimize postoperative pain so that post-operative narcotic&#xD;
      requirements will be unnecessary or required less frequently. The infusion of a local&#xD;
      anesthetic immediately following the surgical procedure is intended to allow the body tissues&#xD;
      to react more favorably to surgical stress and reduce early postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that continuous infusion of a local anesthetic along the edges of&#xD;
      the mesh near the transabdominal fixation sutures and spiral tacks placed to secure mesh to&#xD;
      the anterior abdominal wall will both subjectively and objectively improve postoperative pain&#xD;
      control following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. A secondary hypothesis is that&#xD;
      pulmonary function and bowel function postoperatively will recover faster with the use of a&#xD;
      continuous infusion of local anesthetic.&#xD;
