  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use MRI imaging, cognitive testing and outcome questionnaires to determine&#xD;
      how the brain recovers and reorganizes after an injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The extent of recovery from brain injury is often difficult to predict because of our limited&#xD;
      understanding of how the brain changes as it heals. New brain imaging methods may help in&#xD;
      this regard. One imaging technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has&#xD;
      made it possible to study the brain &quot;at work&quot;; that is, we can see regions of the brain that&#xD;
      are active during particular tasks such as focusing attention, making decisions, or&#xD;
      remembering words and pictures. Another MRI method called diffusion tensor imaging provides&#xD;
      information on the pathways between brain regions that may be altered with brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this research are to 1) determine the brain regions involved in making accurate&#xD;
      judgments about one's abilities and disabilities after a brain injury and whether damage to&#xD;
      these brain areas affects outcome; and 2) examine how recovery of cognitive and physical&#xD;
      abilities relates to changes in brain function over time. In order to accomplish the first&#xD;
      goal we will recruit Veterans who have sustained a head injury and matched control subjects.&#xD;
      For the second goal, we are asking patients and controls who have previously participated in&#xD;
      brain injury research with our lab to come back for another visit at three years post-injury.&#xD;
