  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a great lack of results from randomized clinical trials with high methodological&#xD;
      quality, assessing the effects of exercise during pregnancy. The main aims of this trial is&#xD;
      to study the effects of exercise during pregnancy in the prevention and treatment of disease&#xD;
      and complications which may arise during pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does regular exercise during pregnancy aid in preventing gestational diabetes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does regular exercise during pregnancy prevent low back and/or pelvic girdle pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does regular exercise during pregnancy prevent urine and/or fecal incontinence?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does regular exercise during pregnancy have an effect on labour and delivery?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does regular exercise during pregnancy prevent maternal excessive weight gain and fetal&#xD;
           macrosomatia?&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is regarded as a period of high risk when it comes to development of e.g. excessive&#xD;
      weight gain, gestational diabetes and musculoskeletal problems such as low back pain and&#xD;
      pelvic girdle pain, and urinary and fecal incontinence. While pregnancy and labor imply these&#xD;
      and other risks, exercise is regarded as advantageous during pregnancy. Today's knowledge&#xD;
      about the importance of exercise during pregnancy is mainly based on observational data from&#xD;
      epidemiological studies, and the scientific strength of the clinical recommendations given is&#xD;
      open to question. There is a great lack of results from randomized clinical trials with high&#xD;
      methodological quality, assessing the effects of exercise during pregnancy. As a result of&#xD;
      this, many important questions are still not answered. One of these is the effect exercise&#xD;
      during pregnancy has in the prevention and treatment of disease and complications which may&#xD;
      arise during pregnancy. Another question is the consequences that exercise during pregnancy&#xD;
      has for labor and delivery. This study is designed as a randomized clinical trial using&#xD;
      validated measurement tools to find answers to the mentioned questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both national and international literature the importance of physical activity is&#xD;
      highlighted. WHO has recently presented a global strategy for nutrition, physical activity&#xD;
      and health. In Norway physical activity and exercise have been strongly addressed, and is an&#xD;
      issue of high priority also in pregnant and postpartum women (St.meld.nr.16). Nevertheless,&#xD;
      few trials evaluating the effects of regular exercise have been published. There is a need&#xD;
      for evidence based knowledge to be implemented in education of health professionals, and in&#xD;
      the development of health promotion strategies aiming at the general population.&#xD;
