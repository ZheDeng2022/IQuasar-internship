      Joint replacement is a well-documented and cost effective treatment of degenerative diseases&#xD;
      in the hip (1,2). There are two different principles of fixation of prosthesis components;&#xD;
      cemented and uncemented. The most common mode of fixation in Scandinavia has historically&#xD;
      been with bone cement. In the recent years a reverse hybrid combination (uncemented stem and&#xD;
      cemented cup) is gaining popularity, especially in Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside luxation, infection and venous thromboembolism, the problem with aseptic loosening is&#xD;
      a known complication. A marker for aseptic loosening is local bone loss around the&#xD;
      components. This is measured with a densiometer and the method is Dual Energy X-ray&#xD;
      Absorbtiometry (DXA). Periprosthetic bone loss is evaluated by series of DXA scans around the&#xD;
      components over time. This enables us to follow changes in bone mineral density (BMD) close&#xD;
      to the prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to compare cemented and uncemented prostheses with this technique. This is a problem&#xD;
      since we don't know how much different contrast medias in bone cement affect DXA scans. This&#xD;
      area is poorly investigated. Attempts have been made to exclude the cement-mantle from the&#xD;
      measurements both digitally and manually, but these have showed poor precision. A kind of&#xD;
      consensus of assuming that contrast medias in bone cement give an increase in measured BMD of&#xD;
      20% (4). This is used when comparing cemented and uncemented components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have preformed laboratory tests of different cements. Zirconium oxide (ZrO2) and Barium&#xD;
      sulphate (BaSO4) are used as radiopacifiers. These contrast medias have different properties.&#xD;
      Our test showed that Zirconium give 63% higher BMD when we scanned cement alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is supported by a cadaver study showing significant differences between contrast free&#xD;
      cement and ZrO2 /BaSO4 containing cements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is our opinion that it is necessary to perform a prospective study to investigate this&#xD;
      more thoroughly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that it is not accurate enough to add 20% in BMD for cemented&#xD;
      implants when comparing them with uncemented implants. It is probably necessary to take into&#xD;
      account the amount of cement used and kind of contrast medium.&#xD;
