    <textblock>
      The treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been aimed at decreasing mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity because the etiology of the disease is unknown. The general aim of this&#xD;
      multicentre randomized placebo-controlled trial of low dose intermittent methotrexate with&#xD;
      folic acid is to establish whether methotrexate shows efficacy and safety in controlling&#xD;
      disease activity in SLE and preventing flares in disease activity or development of end-organ&#xD;
      damage. A second aim will be to document the steroid sparing effect of methotrexate in SLE. A&#xD;
      Third aim will be to measure toxicity and utility of methotrexate with folic acid and to&#xD;
      perform effectiveness and utility analyses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Approximately 65% of patients&#xD;
      develop SLE between 16 and 55 years of age, and it is 8-10 times more common in women.&#xD;
      Overall prevalence is estimated at 40-50 per 100,000 individuals in the US. SLE typically&#xD;
      includes periods of remission and flares. Systemic manifestation of SLE includes fatigue,&#xD;
      fever, arthralgia, weight loss, and skin rash. Disease progression is variable and&#xD;
      unpredictable from one individual to the next. Treatment is aimed at preventing damage due to&#xD;
      inflammation of the involved tissues. Death occur primarily from severe systemic infections&#xD;
      and renal insufficiency. Futhermore, patients with long-standing SLE on chronic steroid use&#xD;
      may succumb from atherosclerotic complications such as myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mainstay of treatment of acute disease manifestations is steroids, in&#xD;
      particular,prednisone. Once started, it is difficult to reduce or stop treatment without new&#xD;
      flares or severe steroid withdrawal. Longitudinal studies in SLE cannot dissociate morbidity&#xD;
      caused by the disease from that caused by prolonged steroid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the efficacy, safety and tolerance of methotrexate with folic acid compared&#xD;
           to placebo with folic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the steroid-sparing effects of methotrexate in SLE&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To perform a cost-effectiveness and a cost-utility analysis of methotrexate with folic&#xD;
           acid using generic and disease specific health status measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualification for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once written informed consent is obtained, subjects will have a screening visit and&#xD;
      laboratory evaluations performed to determine if they qualify for the study. A patient is&#xD;
      enrolled in the study once all eligibility criteria are met. No change in dosage of&#xD;
      prednisone, NSAIDs or plaquenil will be allowed between screening and qualifying visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment of the treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After qualifying for the study, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of two&#xD;
      treatments: placebo with folic acid 2.5 mg/day except on the day they take methotrexate or&#xD;
      placebo, or methotrexate at doses described below with folic acid 2.5 mg/day except on the&#xD;
      day whem methotrexate or placebo is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period: All patients will receive study medication (placebo or methotrexate) for at&#xD;
      least 12 months. If the patient is on steroid, every effort will be done to taper prednisone&#xD;
      according to a schedule. One flare requiring increase dose of steroid higher than baseline&#xD;
      (dose determined by local investigator) will be allowed. If a second flare occurs, it will&#xD;
      mean stopping the trial. There will be an open phase at the end of the trial during which&#xD;
      those responding favorably to methotrexate and those on placebo will be offered to either&#xD;
      continue or start methotrexate for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug formulation, route of administration, dosage and duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methotrexate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either methotrexate or MTX-placebo (except&#xD;
      formulation of the placebo consists of 44.00 mg of lactose, 31.00 mg of maize starch, 2.5 mg&#xD;
      of pregelatinized starch, 0.20 mg of polysorbate 80, 1.00 mg of riboflavin, 20.70 mg of&#xD;
      microcrystalline cellulose, 1.50 mg of magnesium stearate and small quantities of purified&#xD;
      water and sodium hydroxide 1N). It will be given orally. Each tablet contains 2.5 mg of&#xD;
      methotrexate or equivalent color, size and shape-matched placebo. Subject will be given 3 MTX&#xD;
      tablets, 2.5 mg increment or an equivalent number of MTX-placebo. Subjects ill be given 3 MTX&#xD;
      tablets, of 2.5 mg.increment or an equivalent number of MTX-placebo tablets to take all&#xD;
      together once a week for 12 months. If the patient does not have symptoms, signs or&#xD;
      laboratory evidence of toxicity after 2 weeks, MTX will be increased by 2.5 mg per 8 week&#xD;
      intervals until maximal does of 0.25 mg/kg/week or 20 mg/week is achieved. In the absence of&#xD;
      toxicity, MTX will be continued at that does or the maximal tolerated dose for 12 months.Dose&#xD;
      will be adjusted according to the guidelines for MTX does reduction for toxicity. At the end&#xD;
      of the blinded period, those patients who have completed the 12 months blinded study, who&#xD;
      have benefited from MTX with FA and want to continue or try it (for those who were on&#xD;
      placebo) will be offered to continue into an open-label trial of MTX with FA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Folic Acid:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Folic acid at a dose of 2.5 mg/day for 6 days/week will be given early to all patients. Folic&#xD;
      acid will not be given on the day the methotrexate or placebo is taken. folic acid is a&#xD;
      vitamin which has no known anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive activity at this dose and&#xD;
      no known toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines for methotrexate dose reduction for toxicity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strict guidelines have been defined for the adjustment of the dose of MTX or placebo. In each&#xD;
      participating centre, the physician who will review the laboratory tests and adjust the dose&#xD;
      will be different from the physician who will assess disease activity and clinical response&#xD;
      to the treatment. Both physicians will be blinded to the study drug, but this is done as&#xD;
      supplementary precaution to protect blinding should blood tests suggest that a patient is on&#xD;
      placebo or on MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient who terminate from the study prematurely will not be eligible to receive further&#xD;
      treatment with MTX in this follow-up study. The open trial model will be modeled on the&#xD;
      protocol except for the blinding. Patients who were receiving MTX will be offered&#xD;
      continuation of the drug with the same surveillance mechanism for an extra 6 months. Those&#xD;
      who were receiving MTX-placebo will be offered to try MTX. At the end of this 6 months, the&#xD;
      open label trial will be terminated.&#xD;
