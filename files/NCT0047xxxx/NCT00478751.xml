    <textblock>
      -  Determine the impact and the threshold of long wavelength UVA and visible light on&#xD;
           immediate and delayed pigment production of melanocompetent individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study basically wants to understand what types of light make us tan.&#xD;

      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A great deal is known about the impact of UVB and short wavelength UVA on&#xD;
                pigmentation. Most sunscreens only protect against UVB and portions of UVA.&#xD;
                However, it is not clear if other components of the spectrum of sunlight, not&#xD;
                currently protected by sunscreens, are capable of eliciting pigmentation. Very&#xD;
                little is known about the impact of long wavelength UVA and visible light on the&#xD;
                time course to pigmentation, the quality of pigmentation and durations of this&#xD;
                change in pigment if any. This has implications on the use of sunscreens to inhibit&#xD;
                pigment production and the treatment of conditions that are aggravated by sun&#xD;
                exposure such as melasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The impact of visible light (400-700 nm) on melanogenesis was studied by Porges et&#xD;
                al in 1988 . The threshold dose for IPD with visible light was between 40 and 80&#xD;
                J/cm2, while the threshold dose for &quot;persistent&quot; pigmentation was greater than or&#xD;
                equal to 80 J/cm2 (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -To determine the impact of long wavelength UVA and visible light on immediate and&#xD;
           delayed pigment production of melanocompetent individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient to serve as their own control. Patient must be melanocompetent (skin&#xD;
                phototypes IV to VI) with no history of vitiligo, melasma or photosensitivity. The&#xD;
                symmetric back or forearm will be used as a control of the irradiated area. Two&#xD;
                phototherapy delivery system will be developed for the study: 1) A targeted visible&#xD;
                light phototherapy device, 2) A targeted long wavelength UVA device.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pigmentation will be assessed by visual exam, fluorescent and reflectance&#xD;
                spectroscopy at 6 timepoints: immediately after irradiation, 30 minutes after&#xD;
                exposure, 1 hour after exposure, 1 day after exposure, 1 week after exposure and 2&#xD;
                weeks after exposure.&#xD;
