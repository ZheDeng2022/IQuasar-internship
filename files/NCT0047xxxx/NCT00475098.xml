  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experiments suggest that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) inhibits tumor growth and&#xD;
      metastasis. Studies in humans suggest that LMWH is associated with a higher survival in&#xD;
      patients with cancer related thrombosis. Two recent studies suggest that LMWH may increase&#xD;
      the survival of patients with cancer who do not have an associated thrombosis. The purpose of&#xD;
      the study is to assess the effect of LMWH on the overall survival of patients with localized&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer after complete surgical resection.&#xD;

      Phase III, prospective, multicentric, randomized, controlled, open trial in parallel groups&#xD;
      with a blind adjudication of all end-point criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference therapy :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the control group will receive postoperative treatment according to&#xD;
      local practice in the participating centers. However, the participating centers will have to&#xD;
      comply with the following guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant chemotherapy will be offered in all patients with stage II and stage IIIA cancers.&#xD;
      Adjuvant chemotherapy will be platin based and include two drugs for a maximum of 4 cycles.&#xD;
      Each center will have to select one regimen before the beginning of the study for all&#xD;
      patients included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who had chemotherapy before surgery can be included in the study provided that they&#xD;
      had a complete surgical resection. In this case the tumor stage for stratification will be&#xD;
      the pathologic stage assessed after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I cancers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with stage I cancer who will not be selected for postoperative chemotherapy can be&#xD;
      included in the study. Contraindication to chemotherapy Patients with a contraindication to&#xD;
      postoperative chemotherapy and those who refuse chemotherapy can be included in the study&#xD;
      provided they fulfill all inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental treatment is tinzaparin administered subcutaneously once a day at the dose of&#xD;
      100 IU/Kg during a twelve week period beginning after a maximum period of 8 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery. Patients randomized in the experimental group will receive adjuvant postoperative&#xD;
      treatment according to local practice with the same guidelines as in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed according to local practice, but at least two outpatient visits&#xD;
      with a chest radiograph will be planned each year during the three year follow-up period&#xD;
      after last inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion period (first patient in to last patient in) : 6 years. Patient total follow-up&#xD;
      (from surgery to end of follow-up) : 3 years after last inclusion (first enrolled patients&#xD;
      were followed 9 years). Total study period : 9 years.&#xD;
