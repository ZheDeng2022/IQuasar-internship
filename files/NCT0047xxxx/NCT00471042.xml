    <textblock>
      The purpose of this treatment research study is to assess the effectiveness of buprenorphine&#xD;
      maintenance treatment for opioid dependence delivered in a primary care clinic setting. This&#xD;
      study will determine whether buprenorphine treatment in primary care is effective in reducing&#xD;
      cravings, reducing illicit opioid use, reducing addiction severity, and retaining patients in&#xD;
      primary care treatment for opioid dependence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine maintenance treatment of opioid dependence in primary care may expand treatment&#xD;
      access. Buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid agonist approved for treatment of opioid&#xD;
      dependence (dependence on heroin, prescription opioid pain medication, or methadone), which&#xD;
      can be prescribed in primary care by authorized physicians. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of buprenorphine maintenance treatment in a primary care setting.&#xD;
      Outcome measures include illicit opioid use during treatment, addiction severity scores from&#xD;
      the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), patient craving ratings on a 100mm visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS), and patient retention in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 6-month, prospective cohort study of adults aged 18-65 who are seeking&#xD;
      buprenorphine maintenance treatment for opioid dependence. This study is observational, not&#xD;
      experimental, and patients will be treated in a naturalistic condition according to their&#xD;
      individual treatment needs. Clinic visits will occur weekly for the first 4 weeks (Induction&#xD;
      and Stabilization Phases), and monthly for the remaining 20 weeks (Maintenance Phase), at&#xD;
      which time up to a month of medication may be prescribed. Participation in ancillary&#xD;
      psychosocial treatment is recommended but not required. Urine toxicology and craving ratings&#xD;
      will be collected at each visit. Additionally, research visits will occur monthly to collect&#xD;
      data assessing addiction severity, risk factors, general health, and psychiatric symptoms.&#xD;
