      New medical abortion regimens are being tested with increasing frequency. However women's&#xD;
      preferences for certain attributes of the regimes are not being investigated to any great&#xD;
      degree. Consideration of women's preferences in designing new regimens may help to optimize&#xD;
      the medical abortion process. The proposed prospective survey research will attempt to&#xD;
      determine women's preferences for individual aspects of medical abortion treatment and&#xD;
      various regimens, and to determine what attributes of medical abortion treatment may be&#xD;
      driving these preferences. The information collected in this study may be used in developing&#xD;
      future treatment regimens or as the groundwork for future research into preferences,&#xD;
      acceptability, and satisfaction with treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The FDA-approved regimen for medical abortion specifies treatment with oral mifepristone&#xD;
      followed 48 hours later by oral misoprostol. Women's experiences with this regimen were&#xD;
      assessed in the early medical abortion trials that preceded FDA approval. The majority of&#xD;
      women who used this regimen rated their experience as satisfactory or very satisfactory after&#xD;
      the abortion was completed (Newhall 2000). A weakness of these data is that they were&#xD;
      collected from women who likely had an a priori preference for medical abortion as&#xD;
      demonstrated by their participation in experimental studies of this method. Other factors&#xD;
      affecting women's preferences had little to do with medical abortion per se such as the&#xD;
      ability to avoid the involvement of their insurance company by participating in a study or&#xD;
      that the method was offered free of charge (Clark S, et al. 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the time that these studies were performed, multiple investigations have evaluated&#xD;
      alternative regimens of using mifepristone and misoprostol for medical abortion (Creinin MD,&#xD;
      2000). Improving efficacy, reducing side effects, and increasing the flexibility in the&#xD;
      timing and route of medication administration have driven the development of these&#xD;
      alternative regimens (Newhall EP and Winikoff B, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with earlier studies, most trials of new regimens have assessed acceptability or&#xD;
      satisfaction post-treatment. In general, overall satisfaction has been reported as high&#xD;
      regardless of regimen (Ho PC, 2006). However, when asked about specific aspects of the&#xD;
      medical abortion treatment, women's preferences appear to be more nuanced. Route of&#xD;
      misoprostol administration is one example. Shannon, et al. (2006) compared mifepristone with&#xD;
      oral or vaginal misoprostol and found an overall acceptability of 91%, regardless of route of&#xD;
      administration. However, when specifically asked about preference for route, the odds of&#xD;
      preferring oral administration greatly exceeded the odds of preferring vaginal (OR = 13.7,&#xD;
      95% CI 6.5-28.7). A preference for oral administration was also demonstrated in a comparative&#xD;
      trial by Schaff, et al. (2001), however this preference was driven by the greater amount of&#xD;
      pain experienced by the vaginal group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further insight into the complexity of acceptability and satisfaction with specific regimens&#xD;
      was provided by a pilot study that I performed of mifepristone and buccal misoprostol (4&#xD;
      tablets of misoprostol dissolved between the cheek and gum for 30 minutes). Detailed&#xD;
      information regarding acceptability, likes, and dislikes was collected pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment. As with other studies, 91% of women surveyed would choose medical abortion&#xD;
      again. However, only 42% found the experience to be a positive one. When asked specifically&#xD;
      about the buccal route of administration, 72% disliked some aspect of using misoprostol in&#xD;
      this way. Of note, pre-treatment, just under half of the women would have preferred oral&#xD;
      administration and 13% buccal. Post-treatment, women were asked which route they would prefer&#xD;
      assuming equal efficacy. The majority (70%) listed oral whereas the preference for buccal&#xD;
      dropped to 9%. Most women cited dissatisfaction with the experience of using misoprostol&#xD;
      buccally either because it was inconvenient, tasted bad, or had a chalky aftertaste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about preferences usually include an assumption that all factors other than the&#xD;
      specific attribute being examined are equal, which may or may not be the case. Careful&#xD;
      examination of specific regimens presented as part of comprehensive scenarios joined with use&#xD;
      of targeted questions may provide more insight into our lack of understanding of preferences.&#xD;
      It is still unclear, for example, what decrement in efficacy, and subsequent need for a&#xD;
      surgical procedure, in combination with what degree of expected side effect and expected&#xD;
      amount of pain, and which route and timing of administration, women would find acceptable and&#xD;
      thus would determine their preferences if all of the options were available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to ascertain women's preferences for different aspects of&#xD;
      medical abortion treatment. In addition to questions directly assessing preferences, the&#xD;
      economic instrument of willingness to pay (WTP) will be employed. The technique of WTP is&#xD;
      based on the premise that the maximum amount of money an individual is willing to pay for an&#xD;
      attribute of treatment is an indicator of the utility or satisfaction to her of that&#xD;
      attribute (Donaldson C, 1993). This method has been used successfully in measuring the&#xD;
      strength of preference for medical or surgical abortion (Gibb S, et al. 1998), miscarriage&#xD;
      management (Ryan and Hughes, 1997), and models of antenatal care (Ryan M, et al., 1997). As&#xD;
      opposed to &quot;strength of preference&quot; measures that use a scale of quality adjusted life years,&#xD;
      which involve a time trade-off to achieve an improvement in a state of being, WTP values&#xD;
      health options by placing a monetary value on each option (Gibb, 1998). The maximum WTP can&#xD;
      be taken as an indication of preference strength for one option over another and relative WTP&#xD;
      values can be meaningfully compared assuming a like unit of measurement, for example of oral&#xD;
      versus vaginal misoprostol administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed survey addresses the characteristics of the FDA approved-regimen and alternative&#xD;
      regimens that have been designed and studied thus far. The variables included are the mode of&#xD;
      misoprostol administration (oral, buccal, vaginal, and sublingual), the time lapse between&#xD;
      mifepristone and misoprostol administration, where the medications will be taken (at home&#xD;
      compared with in the physician's office), side effects, pain, and efficacy. We have attempted&#xD;
      to be as inclusive as possible regarding the modifiable attributes of medical abortion&#xD;
      treatment such as route or timing of medication administration. The survey is divided into&#xD;
      three sections. The first section utilizes the WTP methodology in scenarios about side&#xD;
      effects and comparisons of different medical abortion regimens, and includes a single overall&#xD;
      comparison of medical with surgical abortion. With regard to the medical regimens, the&#xD;
      FDA-approved regimen, buccal, sublingual, and oral alternative regimens are all compared with&#xD;
      the vaginal regimen that is most commonly used in the United States today. The values used in&#xD;
      each regimen's side effect, pain, and efficacy profiles are based on gestational age&#xD;
      appropriate results from clinical trials. For example, the FDA-approved regimen is only for&#xD;
      use through seven weeks of gestation. It was, therefore, compared with the vaginal regimen as&#xD;
      it performs through seven weeks. Similarly, the buccal alternative has only been studied in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial against the vaginal regimen though eight weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second section of the survey asks women to rank and rate individual characteristics of&#xD;
      medical abortion treatment that are presented in the scenarios. The ranking and rating&#xD;
      questions serve two purposes, 1) convergent validity can be determined when comparing the&#xD;
      dollar amounts given in the WTP questions (implicit ranking) compared with the explicit&#xD;
      rankings and ratings given in the other questions and 2) they address individual variables&#xD;
      that are encompassed within each WTP scenario in an attempt to tease out how preferences for&#xD;
      certain aspects of medical abortion regimens compare to each other and which aspects might be&#xD;
      determining preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third section collects demographic data, including income level, as well as pregnancy and&#xD;
      previous abortion history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New medical abortion regimens are being tested with increasing frequency; however women's&#xD;
      experiences with these regimens are not being explored to any great degree. Consideration of&#xD;
      women's preferences in designing new regimens may help optimize the medical abortion process.&#xD;
      This prospective evaluation will attempt to determine which aspects of medical abortion&#xD;
      treatment women value, and thus prefer, most. The information collected in this study may be&#xD;
      used as a guide in developing future treatment regimens or clinical protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women, 18 years of age or older, who present to the Center for Family Planning Research&#xD;
      (CFPR) at Magee-Womens Hospital desiring a medical abortion will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      this study. The anticipated sample size is approximately 200. The attached survey (see&#xD;
      Attachment 1) will be given to each subject willing to participate in the study prior to any&#xD;
      screening procedures for her abortion. All subjects will be introduced to the survey content,&#xD;
      intent, and methods in a face-to-face discussion with a research assistant. The subjects will&#xD;
      then be given time to complete the survey independently. Research assistants will be&#xD;
      available for technical guidance or to answer technical questions as needed. Subjects will&#xD;
      complete this one-time survey anonymously. After the survey is completed the subjects will be&#xD;
      screened and the abortion performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data from the questionnaires will be compiled and descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      generated. Maximum willingness to pay (WTP) values will be estimated using the mean and&#xD;
      median. Association and difference comparisons of categorical values will be made using&#xD;
      Chi-square and Fisher's exact test where appropriate and continuous values using Student's&#xD;
      t-test. Univariable and multivariable regression analysis will be performed to determine&#xD;
      predictors of preferences based on WTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, preference and demographic data will be used to create a regression model to&#xD;
      evaluate what, if any, discrete factors drive women's preferences. This model also will be&#xD;
      used to adjust WTP values so that they can be taken as indications of willingness to pay and&#xD;
      not ability to pay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects and statistical power&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be a non-probability based convenience sample of women presenting&#xD;
      to the CFPR for medical abortion from October, 2006-April, 2007. It is estimate that&#xD;
      approximately 200 women will be able to complete the survey during this time. The number is&#xD;
      estimated based on our currently ongoing medical abortion trial, which will include 175&#xD;
      women, as well as those women undergoing non-trial related medical abortions through our&#xD;
      office. All women presenting to the Center for a medical abortion will be informed of the&#xD;
      survey and it is anticipated that most will be willing to participate. It is unclear what&#xD;
      proportion of subjects will prefer which medical abortion attributes. Using a conservative&#xD;
      proportional estimate of .5, a probability sample size of 200 gives a 90% confidence level&#xD;
      with a margin of error of 6%.&#xD;
