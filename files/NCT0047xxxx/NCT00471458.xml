      Previous studies of hyperthyroid patients suggest that they remain at increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity after restoring euthyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to compare the rate and causes of hospitalization of hyperthyroid&#xD;
      patients treated with radioactive iodine (RAI) with those of an age- and gender-matched&#xD;
      reference population in a long-term follow-up study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A population-based cohort study was conducted among 2611 hyperthyroid patients treated with&#xD;
      RAI between 1969 and 2002 in Tampere University Hospital, and among 2611 reference subjects.&#xD;
      A reference group was randomly selected, with an age- and gender-matched control subject&#xD;
      identified for each patient from the Population Register Centre. The control subject had to&#xD;
      be alive at the time when the patient received the first RAI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causes of hospitalization as well as the diagnosis and date of hospital admission were&#xD;
      obtained from the nationwide Hospital Discharge Register (HILMO) maintained by the Research&#xD;
      and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES) using a computerized record linkage,&#xD;
      with the personal identification number as the key. The HILMO database covers all dates and&#xD;
      causes of hospitalization (hospital admission requiring an overnight stay) of the Finnish&#xD;
      citizens since January 1969. New events were analyzed as the main outcome, including only the&#xD;
      first hospitalization due to a given indication. The special focus was on the cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
