      The aim of this trial was to apply a home based, flexible, stepped-care intervention designed&#xD;
      to improve the awareness and knowledge of family caregivers regarding dementia, to maximise&#xD;
      their caregiving resources and to improve their caregiving skills. A Randomized Controlled&#xD;
      Trial (RCT) will be used to evaluate the same wherein the intervention group will get the&#xD;
      services immediately and the control arm would receive the same after a period of 6 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Service development for older people with dementia in India needs to take account of the fact&#xD;
      that dementia tends to be a hidden problem. Thus, dementia is generally perceived to be part&#xD;
      of normal ageing, and not a health condition, and families rarely present to health services,&#xD;
      who are generally ignorant of most cases in their community. Health services are often&#xD;
      ill-equipped to meet the needs of older persons. Health care, even primary care, is&#xD;
      clinic-based; the older person must attend the clinic or hospital, often involving a long&#xD;
      journey and waiting time. The assessment and treatment that they receive is orientated&#xD;
      towards acute rather than chronic conditions. Thus, home-based interventions provide a&#xD;
      practical alternative to clinic-based interventions for persons affected by dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probable cases of dementia will be identified with the help of key informants (doctors,&#xD;
      priests, health workers, local leaders) in two of the most populated talukas of Goa (Bardez&#xD;
      and Tiswadi,). All probable cases will be examined by a trained clinician to confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis of dementia. Cases will be randomized to receive the intervention or placed in a&#xD;
      waiting list group who will receive the intervention after 6 months. The intervention will be&#xD;
      delivered by a trained community Home Care Advisors (HCA), supported when required by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigators and clinical consultants. The principal outcomes being evaluated are&#xD;
      carer burden and mental health, behavioral problems in the person with dementia, and costs of&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has two specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To adapt and apply a flexible, stepped-care intervention designed to improve the&#xD;
           awareness and knowledge of family caregivers regarding dementia, to maximise their&#xD;
           caregiving resources and to improve their caregiving skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the intervention in reducing carer&#xD;
           burden, improving behaviour problems in elderly persons with dementia and reducing the&#xD;
           costs of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is designed to provide family caregivers with information about dementia&#xD;
      syndrome, assistance in setting up local support groups with other caregivers, and training&#xD;
      in strategies to better manage common behavioural problems in the home setting. This package&#xD;
      would form the basis of the community intervention to be delivered in the proposed project.&#xD;
      The third group of carers are medical personnel. Some patients with dementia suffer from&#xD;
      behavioural or psychiatric problems which may improve considerably with the judicious use of&#xD;
      psychotropic medication. The use of such medication requires the assessment and evaluation by&#xD;
      a physician who has had basic training in the use of sedative medication in elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline assessment of the demographic characteristics of the family, the background&#xD;
      information about the Principal carer and the subject, costs of caring for the person with&#xD;
      dementia, behavioural problems in the subject, perceived burden and the impact on the carers&#xD;
      mental health. This information will be made available to the HCAs before they initiate the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and Intervention: All subjects will be allocated a study number and randomised&#xD;
      into two groups by a person at the central office. The person involved with the process of&#xD;
      randomization will be blind to the status of the subject. Random number table will be used&#xD;
      for the process. The HCA will then be informed of the family allotted to them for&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization the families will be divided into the following two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and control&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical intervention followed a treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following suitable training, the Home Care Advisors will apply a flexible home-care program&#xD;
      tailored to the needs of the individual and the family. The components of the intervention&#xD;
      will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basic education about dementia (what is the disease, its course, its features etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Education about common behaviour problems and how they can be managed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Support to the carer, for example for an elderly carer living alone with the patient, in&#xD;
           activities of daily living&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referral to specialists when behaviour problems are severe and warrant medication&#xD;
           intervention (sedatives).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments used for evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socio demographic characteristics of the person with dementia and the caregiver&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Everyday Abilities Scale for India (EASI): This questionnaire consisting of 12&#xD;
           questions, has been developed and widely used to test the functional abilities of daily&#xD;
           living relevant to Indian subjects[11]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory (NPI) Questionnaire: This instrument consists of two parts;&#xD;
           the first measures the severity of the problem behaviours associated with the condition&#xD;
           on a scale of 1-3 (NPI- S); the second measures the perceived distress of the problem&#xD;
           behaviours by the caregiver on a scale of 0-5 (NPI -D)[12].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Zarit Burden scale (ZBS): This is the most widely used scale in the studies of caregiver&#xD;
           burden and encompasses the physical, emotional and financial burden as perceived by the&#xD;
           caregiver[13].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General Health Questionnaire (GHQ): The 12 question GHQ is used to measure the&#xD;
           psychological impact on the caregivers' mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group This group will be put on a waiting list to receive the intervention after 6&#xD;
      months. Families will be free to choose any health care they desire during the waiting&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad outlines for the sessions for the intervention are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the Family Support system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this session the Home Care Advisor ( HCA ) will try and identify the principal carer, the&#xD;
      family structure and the pattern of informal care provided to the person with dementia. They&#xD;
      will try and identify stressors in the family like unemployment, alcoholism, financial&#xD;
      constraints, etc. They will try to understand the possible ways to restructure the informal&#xD;
      support system if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explaining what is Dementia :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This session will first begin with accessing the carer's knowledge about the disease and help&#xD;
      the carer understand the diagnosis and prognosis. The HCA will also give the family an&#xD;
      overall idea of the prevalence of the disorder in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying and managing caregiver burnout:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of the stepped care model depends on identifying the stress in the carer and help&#xD;
      them effectively manage it. A carer who is emotionally disturbed will not be in a position to&#xD;
      gain new knowledge or learn new skills. In a nuclear family the caregiver is most likely to&#xD;
      be the daughter in law who will have a number of other responsibilities which she carries out&#xD;
      at the cost of her mental and physical health. Over the years her role becomes a routine and&#xD;
      often a thankless job. The HCAs will try and create an environment which is supportive and&#xD;
      sensitive to the needs of the carer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress Management and Relaxation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this session the HCA will train the carer in stress management and relaxation&#xD;
      techniques. If the non pharmacological methods do not work, they will advise and arrange for&#xD;
      a visit to a psychiatrist for appropriate management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Managing Problem Behaviours:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this session the HCA will try and identify the problem behaviours like wandering,&#xD;
      repetitive behaviours, hallucinations, screaming episodes, clinging, incontinence etc. They&#xD;
      will help carers understand them and provide practical tips on management of problem&#xD;
      behaviours at home. The case will be discussed with the counselor and the clinical&#xD;
      consultants for their inputs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structuring a Day:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HCA will give the carer tips on how to structure a day so as to make it easier for the&#xD;
      subject and the carer to manage time and adjust to the changes taking place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition is often the major concern of the carers. The HCA will advise the carer on how to&#xD;
      improve the nutrition of the subject and the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of Associated Disorders:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Home Care advisors will be equipped with knowledge on the ailments that the person with&#xD;
      dementia is likely to have. The subject being old may have a number of disorders like&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Ischemic Heart Disease, renal failure which are neglected as&#xD;
      the disease progresses. The Home Care Advisors will try and find out if any of these&#xD;
      conditions exist and advise the appropriate referral for the management so as to improve the&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meeting with the Clinical Consultants and Counselor; The Home Care Advisors will meet the&#xD;
      clinical consultants every week to discuss the progress of the case and the arrange for a&#xD;
      visit whenever required. The Clinical consultants will also provide the appropriate advise&#xD;
      for the management of the subject. They will meet the counselor every fortnightly to discuss&#xD;
      the social and emotional aspects of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Networking:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HCAs will try and arrange a meeting of the carers and encourage them share their&#xD;
      experiences with each other. Group sessions, film shows and lectures will be arranged at the&#xD;
      meeting. They will be encouraged to meet and form support groups.&#xD;
