    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate a new two-stage approach&#xD;
      (delayed-immediate reconstruction) to breast reconstruction in women who may require&#xD;
      post-mastectomy radiation therapy. Researchers will compare the cosmetic outcomes and any&#xD;
      complications that occur in women who receive delayed-immediate reconstruction to those who&#xD;
      receive the standard approaches (either immediate reconstruction or delayed breast&#xD;
      reconstruction).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In women who have a mastectomy and desire breast reconstruction, the best timing of breast&#xD;
      reconstruction depends on whether radiation therapy (XRT) is needed. If XRT is not needed,&#xD;
      immediate reconstruction offers the best cosmetic result. However, if XRT is needed, it is&#xD;
      better to delay reconstruction until XRT is complete. There are 2 reasons to wait. First, the&#xD;
      presence of a reconstructed breast can interfere with the delivery of XRT, decreasing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this treatment. Second, exposing a reconstructed breast to radiation can&#xD;
      cause poor cosmetic results. Today, many women are not offered immediate reconstruction&#xD;
      because it is not known at the time of their mastectomy whether they will need XRT.&#xD;
      Researchers believe that for such women, a new approach called &quot;delayed-immediate&#xD;
      reconstruction&quot; will offer the cosmetic benefits of immediate reconstruction without the&#xD;
      potential drawbacks of ineffective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have your already scheduled skin-sparing&#xD;
      mastectomy. However, at the time of your routine mastectomy, you will also have a tissue&#xD;
      expander or postoperatively adjustable implant (fully inflated with saline or as allowed by&#xD;
      the remaining capacity [space] of the retained breast skin) placed in your breast. Some&#xD;
      patients will have a small biopsy of skin, that is normally discarded, done so that&#xD;
      scientists can learn about changes and ways of healing after radiation. When the final&#xD;
      pathology report is complete (about 1 week after mastectomy), the radiation doctor and/or&#xD;
      your surgeon will decide whether or not you need XRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results show that you do not need XRT, you will have the tissue expander or implant&#xD;
      removed and will have standard definitive breast reconstruction, using the preserved breast&#xD;
      skin about 2 weeks after mastectomy. The reconstructive technique used will be decided based&#xD;
      on anatomical considerations, surgical factors, and your personal desires. The postoperative&#xD;
      follow-up will be similar to that of patients who have standard immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results show that you do need XRT, the tissue expander or adjustable implant will be&#xD;
      completely deflated in the plastic surgery clinic before you receive standard XRT. Radiation&#xD;
      must be given either at MD Anderson or an MD Anderson-affiliated site. Deflation of the&#xD;
      tissue expander or implant will result in a flat chest wall that will decrease difficulties&#xD;
      with radiation delivery that can occur after an immediate breast reconstruction. If you also&#xD;
      require chemotherapy after mastectomy, the tissue expander or implant will remain inflated&#xD;
      during chemotherapy (additional saline-filling may also be performed during chemotherapy, if&#xD;
      required). In patients who have already received chemotherapy before mastectomy or who will&#xD;
      not require chemotherapy, the expander or implant will remain inflated during the 4-to-6-week&#xD;
      period between mastectomy and XRT. About 3 weeks into your radiation treatments, you will&#xD;
      come in to the plastic surgery clinic for a follow-up to check on the status of the implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several weeks after the completion of XRT, the tissue expander or postoperatively adjustable&#xD;
      implant will be gradually re-expanded over about 6-months. The internal scar capsule that&#xD;
      forms around the tissue expander or implant before deflation usually allows for re-expansion&#xD;
      after radiation therapy. Re-expansion after radiation therapy will be performed during&#xD;
      postoperative visits to the plastic surgery clinic every 2-to-4 weeks until the desired size&#xD;
      is achieved. About 6 months after the completion of XRT, a &quot;skin-preserving&quot; delayed&#xD;
      reconstruction with a preference for autologous tissues only (no breast implants) will be&#xD;
      performed. This will involve removal of the tissue expander or implant and definitive breast&#xD;
      reconstruction. At the time of the skin-preserving delayed reconstruction, a small biopsy of&#xD;
      usually thrown away radiated breast tissue as well as a sample of the skin, that is normally&#xD;
      discarded, of the flap (your tissue that is taken from your back, stomach or buttock to build&#xD;
      the breast) and a sample of the implant or tissue expander will be collected for laboratory&#xD;
      evaluation. Researchers will evaluate the skin changes from radiation and expansion as well&#xD;
      as from the internal scar capsule. This will be compared to radiated skin biopsies without&#xD;
      expansion and biopsies taken after skin expansion without radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your medical information and photographs of your breast(s) will be gathered throughout the&#xD;
      various stages of delayed-immediate reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed-immediate breast reconstruction is a two-stage approach and as such involves at least&#xD;
      2 surgical procedures. This does not include the possibility of procedures needed to modify&#xD;
      the reconstructed breast, a procedure on the healthy breast to make it symmetrical (similar&#xD;
      in appearance and size) with the reconstructed breast, and any nipple reconstruction and&#xD;
      areolar tattooing that may be needed. If, later on, it is necessary to revise the&#xD;
      reconstructed breast, a small skin sample (smaller than a pencil eraser) will again be&#xD;
      collected for additional studies. This will not affect the outcome of your surgery or the way&#xD;
      your breast will look.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative course, follow-up, and the need for additional surgical procedures will be&#xD;
      decided in a similar fashion to that of standard immediate and delayed breast reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The implants in this study have been FDA approved for skin&#xD;
      expansion as a method of breast reconstruction. They are not specifically approved for both&#xD;
      expansion and radiation. About 200 women will take part in this study. All will be enrolled&#xD;
      at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).&#xD;
