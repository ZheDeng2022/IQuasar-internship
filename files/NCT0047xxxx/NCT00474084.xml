    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first feasibility study is to evaluate the performance of Vesta™ &amp;&#xD;
      VestaCOR™ (Hydroxy-Apetite coated GenX) stent in de novo native coronary artery lesions. This&#xD;
      study will provide the longest follow-up experience available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double blind study conducted at three sites, two sites in India and one&#xD;
      in The Netherlands. To be eligible, a patient will be required to have a de novo stenotic&#xD;
      lesion of a length that could be covered by a single stent in a native coronary artery of&#xD;
      diameter 3.0mm and 3.5mm. A total of at least 60 patients and a maximum of 70 patients will&#xD;
      be treated with Vesta™ &amp; VestaCOR™ stent. These patients will be randomized to either a&#xD;
      smooth surface nanofilm coated stent (= VestaCOR™) (approx. 35 patients) or to a porous&#xD;
      coated stent (= Vesta™) (approx. 35 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed clinically at 30 days, 4 months, 9 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient is an acceptable candidate for CABG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease and/or a positive territorial functional&#xD;
             study. Documented stable angina pectoris ((Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS)&#xD;

             (Braunwald Class IB-C, IIB-C, or IIIB-C), or documented silent ischemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lesion is a single de novo coronary artery lesion with 50 and 100%&#xD;
             stenosis in one of the major epicardial territories (LAD, LCX or RCA). A second target&#xD;
             lesion in another major epicardial vessel could be treated and this second lesion&#xD;
             should fit with inclusion/exclusion criteria and will receive the same type of stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lesion must be covered by one study stent preferably with a margin of at&#xD;
             least 4mm on each side of the lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lesion length should be ≤ 11 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target reference vessel diameter must be  3.0mm and  3.5mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or the patient's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the&#xD;
             study and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as&#xD;
             approved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of the respective clinical&#xD;
