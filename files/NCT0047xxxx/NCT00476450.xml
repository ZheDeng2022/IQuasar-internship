    <textblock>
      This study will examine bacteria in patients mouths at different times during stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation and recovery. Drugs patients receive as part of the conditioning process for&#xD;
      a stem cell transplant increase their risk of infection. There might be a link between the&#xD;
      bacteria in the mouth and the bacteria that can cause infections. Knowing the changes in&#xD;
      bacteria might help researchers determine the best method to prevent infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who are scheduled to receive a stem cell transplant may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of medical records&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview about their oral care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of oral specimens just before the stem cell transplant, immediately after the&#xD;
      transplant, and 3 weeks after the transplant. The specimens are obtained as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;TAB&gt;-About one-fourth teaspoon of saliva is collected with a suction device similar to&#xD;
           that used in a dental office.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;TAB&gt;-Plaque from the surface of a tooth is collected with a plastic toothpick.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;TAB&gt;-Skin cells from the inside of the cheek and the surface of the tongue are&#xD;
           collected with a small soft brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;TAB&gt;-If a tube is inserted into the patient s lungs to assist breathing and the patient&#xD;
           is admitted to the intensive care unit, a specimen from the lungs is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for 100 days after their transplant. Additional oral specimens are&#xD;
      obtained from those who develop signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mouth is a complex biological ecosystem normally containing over 700 different species of&#xD;
      bacteria. These bacteria live in an exopolysacchride matrix biofilm. Usually, bacteria&#xD;
      colonize the oral cavity benignly. However, there are several studies in critically ill&#xD;
      patients demonstrating changes in oral flora with acute illness. Identification of&#xD;
      respiratory pathogens in the mouth has led researchers to hypothesize that a relationship&#xD;
      exists between the oral cavity and pulmonary infections. A common complication of allogeneic&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) is infection and pneumonia. Identification of&#xD;
      potential pathogens in the oral cavity of allogeneic stem cell patients could indicate a&#xD;
      similar association between oral pathogens and infection. A few studies describe the oral&#xD;
      microbial community in these patients and the possibility that these organisms are a source&#xD;
      of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to describe the changes in oral microbial flora of&#xD;
      allogeneic SCT patients at three time points during their treatment and recovery. Observed&#xD;
      differences in microbial organisms from baseline (prior to transplantation), through&#xD;
      neutropenia (within 48 hours of nadir post-transplantation) and myeloid engraftment (14-21&#xD;
      days post transplantation) will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the course of their treatment, if patients develop respiratory signs and symptoms that&#xD;
      require either a re-admission to an inpatient unit or intensive care unit admission, then&#xD;
      additional oral specimens will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the oral microbial flora found after development of&#xD;
      respiratory signs and symptoms in allogeneic PBSCT patients in the first 100 days&#xD;
      post-transplant. In addition, if the patient requires intubation, tracheal aspirates and oral&#xD;
      specimens will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population is composed of adult patients who are planning to undergo an allogeneic PBSCT&#xD;
      and can provide informed consent. The design is a prospective, descriptive study of the&#xD;
      microbial flora of the oral cavity of adult allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. Saliva&#xD;
      specimens, dental plaque and mucosal brushings will be collected at the three different&#xD;
      times. Oral specimens will be obtained from patients who develop respiratory signs or&#xD;
      symptoms that require an additional inpatient or intensive care unit admission. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed and assessed for respiratory signs, symptoms, inpatient or ICU admission until&#xD;
      day 100 post-transplant. The presence of bacteria (type and species) will be determined by&#xD;
      molecular genetics. The identification of bacteria will be studied using various comparative&#xD;
      molecular techniques, including DNA arrays and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All adult patients admitted to the Clinical Research Center of the NIH who are 18 years of&#xD;
        age or older who are scheduled to undergo an allogeneic PBSCT are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
        Collection of oral specimens in children who are allogeneic transplant recipients would&#xD;
        increase the anxiety in these participants and may require sedation. For this reason&#xD;
        children will be excluded from this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All adult patients who provide informed consent and who are scheduled to receive an&#xD;
        allogeneic bone marrow transplant are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have had recent oral surgery or oral trauma will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with tracheostomies will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with sickle cell disease or chronic granulomatous disease who are being&#xD;
        transplanted will be excluded from the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are less than 18 years of age will be excluded.&#xD;
