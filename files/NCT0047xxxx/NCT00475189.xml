    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess hormone withdrawal symptoms in women while&#xD;
      taking an oral contraceptive in the novel 24/4 (24 days of &quot;real&quot; pills) manner in comparison&#xD;
      to taking pills in the standard 21/7 (21 &quot;real&quot; pills) manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the 24/4 method will reduce common hormone withdrawal symptoms&#xD;
      compared to the standard 21/7 regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is further hypothesized that women using the 24/4 regimen will report greater satisfaction&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;

      Women who will be considered for this study are those who are presently taking combination&#xD;
      estrogen/progestin contraception for at least 2 months. They must be between the ages of 18&#xD;
      and 48 years with a body mass index of 40 or less. Study participants will be asked to keep a&#xD;
      daily diary of symptoms based on the symptoms listed above. This requires ranking the&#xD;
      severity of bleeding, pelvic pain, mood, and headaches based on a scale defined on the daily&#xD;
      diary. All subjects will keep track of any pain medication that they take on a medication&#xD;
      log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that are not sure if their symptoms (mood, pelvic pain or headache) increase on days&#xD;
      1-3 and 18-28, will be asked to keep the diary while taking their current contraceptive&#xD;
      medication. After they record their symptoms in the diary, it will be evaluated by the study&#xD;
      coordinator to see if they qualify (which means that mood, pelvic pain and headache must have&#xD;
      increased on days 1-3 and 18-28 compared to days 4-17). If they qualify, visit 1 will be&#xD;
      scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 1, subjects will undergo a physical exam and a pelvic exam. Subjects may be required&#xD;
      to have a Pap smear if one has not been performed or if there is not sufficient documentation&#xD;
      of one within the past year. Subjects will be given a single pack of Loestrin 1/20 for cycle&#xD;
      #1 along with their symptoms calendars and medication log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women will begin the study with one month of Loestrin 1/20, to be taken in a normal 21/7&#xD;
      manner, and will complete a daily questionnaire. To continue in the study, subjects must be&#xD;
      classified as having substantial fluctuation in their symptoms. At visit 2, (end of cycle&#xD;
      #1), subjects will return their completed calendar to the study coordinator. The calendar&#xD;
      will be reviewed for compliance and for eligibility based on symptom criteria. Subjects will&#xD;
      also be scheduled for lab work. Women who continue in the study will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      either to a group to start taking Loestrin 24 Fe (24 real pills and 4 placebo pills - Group&#xD;
      1), or to a group to continue taking Loestrin 1/20 in the standard 21/7 fashion for an&#xD;
      additional 3 cycles (Group 2). All women will be asked to continue keeping a daily log of&#xD;
      their symptoms, which will be turned in to the study coordinator at each of the scheduled&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will not be given the choice initially as to which group they will be placed;&#xD;
      however all women will be given the opportunity to evaluate the 24/4 regimen. After the first&#xD;
      3 randomized cycles (visit 3), subjects will turn in their calendars to the study&#xD;
      coordinator. Group 1 will be given a choice between continuing Loestrin 24 Fe or going back&#xD;
      to Loestrin 1/20. Group 1 will complete a brief survey regarding their choice and will be&#xD;
      given 3 packs of the pill of choice. All Group 2 subjects will be switched onto 3 cycles of&#xD;
      Loestrin 24 Fe. Subjects in both groups will continue keeping their daily symptoms calendar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 4, the end of cycle #5, all subjects will turn in their calendars to the study&#xD;
      coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 5, the end of cycle #7, subjects will turn in their calendars to the study&#xD;
      coordinator. All subjects will fill out a questionnaire. Subjects will be evaluated and will&#xD;
      be given a prescription for the OC of their choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be asked to complete mid-study and end of study quality of life and&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Draws 1-8 One of the objectives of this study is to compare hormone withdrawal symptoms&#xD;
      with actual hormone levels. Measuring hormones requires samples of blood. Over the course of&#xD;
      the study, there will be a total of 8 separate blood samples (for a total of approximately 8&#xD;
      teaspoons of blood) to be taken from each subject. Subjects in Group 1 who were randomized to&#xD;
      Loestrin 24 Fe during cycles 2 through 4 will start blood sampling on cycle day 24, the last&#xD;
      day of active pills in this cycle and continue at three day intervals. Subjects in Group 2&#xD;
      who were randomized to Loestrin 1/20 during cycles 2 through 4 will start blood sampling on&#xD;
      cycle day 21, the last day of active pills in the 4th cycle and continue at three day&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
