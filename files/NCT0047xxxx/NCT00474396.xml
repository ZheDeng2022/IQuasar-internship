      The purpose of the study is to determine whether low fat dairy diet reduces serum uric acid&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uric acid plays a role not only in the pathogenesis of gout but is also a predictor of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, hypertension and renal disease in man. We have identified the human&#xD;
      urate ion channel transporter (hUAT), located in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney&#xD;
      that is involved in both the secretion and reabsorption of urate across the tubule. This&#xD;
      channel has a unique lectin binding site that in in-vitro studies, has been found to be&#xD;
      modulated by glucose, galactose and lactose. We have also identified a mutation (G/A&#xD;
      polymorphism) in our laboratory, that in in-vitro studies has demonstrated diminished hUAT&#xD;
      channel activity. Cross-sectional studies have earlier shown that uric acid levels vary with&#xD;
      serum glucose levels. Studies have also reported that a low-fat dairy diet reduces the&#xD;
      incidence of gout, while others have shown that this diet reduces blood pressure&#xD;
      significantly when compared with a non-dairy diet. We hypothesize that the effect of blood&#xD;
      glucose levels in lowering uric acid levels is through the regulation of hUAT channel&#xD;
      activity. We also hypothesize that a low-fat dairy diet reduces serum uric acid levels&#xD;
      through hUAT regulation leading to a decrease in the incidence of gout and a reduction in&#xD;
      blood pressure levels. In our proposed randomized, controlled, cross-over trial in healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers, we aim to study the effect of a low-fat dairy diet and a non-dairy diet on&#xD;
      serum uric acid levels, the renal fractional excretion of uric acid and blood pressure. We&#xD;
      will also study the effect of an acute intravenous infusion of glucose on these parameters.&#xD;
      DNA analysis for hUAT mutations of study subjects will be done to assess if there is a&#xD;
      blunted response of hUAT activity in subjects with the polymorphism as compared to normal&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
