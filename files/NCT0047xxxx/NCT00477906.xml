    <textblock>
      Previous studies suggests that M-Vax, a melanoma vaccine prepared from patients own cancer&#xD;
      cells, can stimulated patients' immune system to react against their cancer. AVAX has&#xD;
      identified a dose and schedule of administration of M-Vax that work optimally. In this study,&#xD;
      AVAX will determine whether M-Vax is effective in shrinkage of melanomas that have spread&#xD;
      (stage IV). To increase it effectiveness, M-Vax administration will be followed by&#xD;
      administration of low doses of interleukin-2 (IL2), a marketed drug that is known to&#xD;
      stimulate immunity and cause some shrinkage of melanomas. Two-thirds of patients will receive&#xD;
      M-Vax + IL2, and one-third will receive a placebo vaccine + IL2. The study is blinded so that&#xD;
      neither the patients nor their physicians know which material they are receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible for this study, patients must have at least one melanoma tumor that can be&#xD;
      surgically removed and made into a vaccine. In addition, they must have melanoma that has&#xD;
      spread to to the lungs or to soft tissue sites (under the skin, on the surface of the skin,&#xD;
      lymph nodes). Eligible patients may have previously received one treatment (for example,&#xD;
      chemotherapy) for their melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects of M-Vax are expected to be mild; the most common is the development of sore&#xD;
      pimples at the site of vaccine injections. The low dose IL2 may cause some fatigue and other&#xD;
      mild symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that 387 patients will be treated in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      M-Vax is a therapeutic melanoma vaccine consisting of autologous melanoma cells that have&#xD;
      been irradiated and then modified with the hapten, dinitrophenyl (DNP). There is a large&#xD;
      amount of published evidence that hapten modification makes visible to the immune system&#xD;
      antigens, including tumor antigens, that otherwise do not elicit an immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-centered trial of&#xD;
      M-Vax in patients with stage IV melanoma with measurable metastases in lung and/or soft&#xD;
      tissues. To be eligible for screening, patients will have undergone surgery for therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention, which yields an adequate amount of melanoma tumor cells for preparation of&#xD;
      vaccines, which pass vaccine release testing. Eligible patients who meet all&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned in a double-blind fashion to M-Vax or Placebo Vaccine at a 2:1&#xD;
      ratio (M-Vax:Placebo Vaccine). The dose of M-Vax will be 4.0-20.0x10(6) DNP-modified&#xD;
      autologous melanoma tumor cells. The Placebo Vaccine will consist of diluent only. An initial&#xD;
      dose of M Vax or Placebo Vaccine will be administered without BCG followed by low dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2 iv). Then M Vax or Placebo Vaccine mixed with Bacillus of&#xD;
      Calmette and Gu√©rin (BCG) will be administered weekly for 6 weeks. Four courses of&#xD;
      interleukin-2 (IL2) will be administered to all patients starting about 2 weeks after the&#xD;
      last vaccine; each course will consist of 3 million units/m2 subcutaneously daily for 5 days&#xD;
      followed by a 16-day rest period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints of the study are: 1)Best overall anti-tumor response, and 2)Survival,&#xD;
      measured by % surviving at two years. Patients will be evaluated for anti-tumor response by&#xD;
      modified RECIST criteria between weeks 24 and 25 (i.e., 5-6 weeks after completion of IL2).&#xD;
      At the 6-month point patients who remain on study will receive an additional single booster&#xD;
      dose of M-Vax or Placebo Vaccine mixed with BCG. This will be followed by four more courses&#xD;
      of IL2. Two additional evaluations for anti-tumor response will take place at the 38-39 week&#xD;
      (month 9) and one-year points. Then patients will be regularly evaluated for tumor status and&#xD;
      adverse events until evidence of tumor progression that requires new therapy. Patients who&#xD;
      remain on-study will be followed until death but for a maximum of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intended sample size is 387, and there will be about 25 sites participating in the United&#xD;
      States, Europe, and Israel. An interim analysis will be performed after half the patients&#xD;
      have been accrued.&#xD;
