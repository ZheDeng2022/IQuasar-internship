      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of anti-third party cytolytic T-lymphocytes,&#xD;
      defined as the dose which achieve engraftment without severe GVHD (graft-vs-host disease) at&#xD;
      90 days after allogeneic transplantation of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Toxicity, response rate, time to progression and overall survival.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      GVHD can be a major problem after stem cell transplantation from a healthy donor. It is&#xD;
      caused by T-lymphocytes (a type of immune cell) from the donor that can react badly against&#xD;
      the person receiving the transplant (the recipient). Researchers want to see if stimulating&#xD;
      the donor T-lymphocytes against another person (a third party) and growing them for 28 days&#xD;
      will decrease the chance of developing GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the below&#xD;
      treatment, including chemotherapy and radiation, before your stem cell transplantation. These&#xD;
      include rituximab, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and mesna. Rituximab is designed to attach&#xD;
      to lymphoma cells, causing them to die. Cyclophosphamide is designed to destroy cancer cells&#xD;
      by interfering with their multiplication and slowing or stopping their growth and spread&#xD;
      throughout the body. Fludarabine is designed to interfere with DNA repair enzymes so that the&#xD;
      leukemic cell cannot repair damaged DNA. This increases the likelihood of the cell dying.&#xD;
      Mesna is a drug that lowers the risk of bladder side effects by the cyclophosphamide. Total&#xD;
      body radiation is given to to reduce the risk of transplant rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with CLL or lymphoma will receive Rituxan (rituximab) by vein, given over&#xD;
      several hours for each dose. The first rituximab dose is 13 days before the transplant. This&#xD;
      will be followed by 3 more doses of rituximab, given 6 days before the transplant, and 1 and&#xD;
      8 days after the transplant. All participants will receive fludarabine by vein over 30&#xD;
      minutes once per day for 4 days, starting 6 days before the transplant. All participants will&#xD;
      also receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 2 hours. The cyclophosphamide will be given&#xD;
      immediately after the first dose of fludarabine. All participants will also receive a&#xD;
      continuous infusion of mesna by vein for 24 hours after receiving the cyclophosphamide. One&#xD;
      day before transplantation, you will have total body radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving total body radiation, you will receive your stem cell transplantation. On the&#xD;
      day of the transplant, you will receive the anti-third party T Lymphocytes (CTLs) by vein.&#xD;
      This will be followed by vein infusion of stem cells from the donor. A sample of the&#xD;
      anti-third party T-cells cells will also be tested for immune function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive sirolimus by mouth for 10 days, starting 2 days before&#xD;
      transplantation. Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive drug which is given to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      transplant rejection. You will remain in the hospital for about 4 weeks after the transplant.&#xD;
      You will then continue as an outpatient in the Houston area for 100 days after your&#xD;
      transplantation, or until your doctor feels it is okay for you to leave the Houston area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your disease gets worse after your transplantation, you may receive additional immune&#xD;
      cells from the donor (DLI-donor lymphocyte infusion).You may be taken off this study if the&#xD;
      transplant does not grow or is rejected, if not enough of the CTLs can be produced, if your&#xD;
      disease continues to get worse after receiving additional donors cells, or if you experience&#xD;
      any intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have frequent blood tests as medically necessary to evaluate your medical condition.&#xD;
      About 3 tablespoons of blood will be collected for immune function testing at 1, 2, 3, 6 and&#xD;
      12 months after the transplant. You will have a bone marrow biopsy, x-rays, and CT scans for&#xD;
      evaluation of the cancer at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the transplant. The study is over&#xD;
      after 1 year. You will be followed-up after that time for routine care, as the doctors feels&#xD;
      it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. All of the drugs used in this study, have been approved by&#xD;
      the FDA in the treatment of cancer and transplantation. The Miltenyi CliniMACS System which&#xD;
      is used to purify stem cells and the anti-third party CTLs has not been approved by the FDA,&#xD;
      and its use in this study is experimental. Up to 24 patients will take part in this study.&#xD;
      All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
