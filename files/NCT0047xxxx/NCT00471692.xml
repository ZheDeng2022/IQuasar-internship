      Inguinal hernia repair is a common surgical procedure. The major current debates revolve&#xD;
      around laparoscopic hernia repair. The most recent Cochrane review concluded that&#xD;
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair was associated with less post operative and chronic pain,&#xD;
      shorter convalescence and earlier return to work when compared to open repair (McCormack K,&#xD;
      Scott NW, Go PM, Ross S, Grant AM. EU hernia trialist collaboration. Laparoscopic techniques&#xD;
      versus open techniques for inguinal hernia repair. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2003;&#xD;
      1(CD001785.). However, laparoscopic repair has not gained wide acceptance. It is more&#xD;
      expensive, technically difficult for the inexperienced surgeon, is associated with rare but&#xD;
      potentially more hazardous procedure related complications (Lo CH, Trotter D, Grossberg P.&#xD;
      Unusual complications of laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair. ANZ&#xD;
      journal of Surgery 2005 Oct, 75(10): 917 - 919.) and unlike open repair, requires a general&#xD;
      anaesthetic. Critics state that laparoscopic repair is not suitable for all general surgeons&#xD;
      and should be restricted to experts. Two prospective studies have shown that a longer&#xD;
      laparoscopic learning curve exists when compared to open surgery. Up to 200 laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedures are required to achieve a recurrence rate comparable to open mesh repair. (Bittner&#xD;
      R, Schmedt CG, Schwarz J, Kraft K, Leigl BJ. Laparoscopic transperitoneal procedure for&#xD;
      routine repair of groin hernia British journal of Surgery 2002 89; 1062 - 1066.) A&#xD;
      meta-analysis and large multicentre randomised study have added to these concerns by&#xD;
      demonstrating a higher recurrence rate with laparoscopic repair. (Memon MA, Cooper NJ, Memon&#xD;
      B, Memon MI, Abrams KR. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing open and&#xD;
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. British journal of Surgery 2003; 90: 1479 - 1492.&#xD;
      Neumayer L, Giobbie-Hurder, Jonasson O, Fitzgibbons R, Dunlop D, Gibbs J et al. Open mesh&#xD;
      versus laparoscopic mesh repair of inguinal hernias. New England Journal of Medicine 2004;&#xD;
      350: 1819 - 1827.). Over the period 1998 to 2003, in Denmark, the frequency of laparoscopic&#xD;
      repair remained constant at 4.5 - 8.0%, the laparoscopic approach being used more frequently&#xD;
      for bilateral hernia repairs and recurrent hernia repairs. There was a higher re-operation&#xD;
      rate following laparoscopic repair of bilateral inguinal hernias compared to bilateral open&#xD;
      hernia repair. (Wara P, Bay-Nielsen M, Juul P, bendix J, Kehlet H. Prospective nationwide&#xD;
      analysis of laparoscopic versus Lichenstein repair of inguinal hernia. British Journal of&#xD;
      Surgery 2005 92(10); 1277 - 1281.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these issues, a considerable number of adult inguinal hernia repairs will continue to&#xD;
      be performed using the open technique. There is the opportunity to improve the results of&#xD;
      open repair by potentially improving post operative pain and chronic pain. One method may be&#xD;
      to perform an ilio inguinal nerve block. However, this procedure can be complicated by&#xD;
      femoral nerve palsy, colonic or small bowel puncture and pelvic haematomas (Johr M, Sossai R.&#xD;
      Colonic puncture during ilioinguinal nerve block in a child. Anesth Analg 1999 88 1051 -&#xD;
      1052, Amory C, mariscal A, Guyot E et al. Is ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block always&#xD;
      totally safe in children? Paediatr Anaesth 2003; 13: 164 - 166. Vaisman J. Pelvic hematoma&#xD;

      British Journal of Surgery 2006; 93: 33 - 39)), resulting in delayed discharge of patients.&#xD;
      It also has a failure rate of 20 - 30% (Lim SL, Ng SB, Tan GM. Ilioinguinal and&#xD;
      iliohypogastric nerve block revisited; single shot versus double shot technique for hernia&#xD;
      repair in children. Paediatr Anaesth 2002; 12; 255 - 260.) The aim of our study is therefore&#xD;
      to assess the role of ilio inguinal nerve block in adult patients undergoing primary inguinal&#xD;
      hernia repair.&#xD;

      Patients presenting to the Royal Hobart Hospital for open surgery to an inguinal hernia were&#xD;
      approached for inclusion to the study. To patient refused entry. Informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained and the study was approved by the local ethics and research committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following induction of general anaesthesia, a sealed envelop was opened. This envelop was&#xD;
      prepared by the pharmacy department at the Royal Hobart Hospital. This envelope contained two&#xD;
      syringes presented sterile, each containing a clear liquid. The syringe labelled ilioinguinal&#xD;
      nerve block was given to the anaesthetist for insertion of an &quot;ilioinguinal nerve block&quot;&#xD;
      prior to surgical preparation and draping. The second syringe, labelled wound infiltration&#xD;
      was given to the scrub nurse for wound irrigation by the surgeon prior to closure of the&#xD;
      external oblique aponeurosis. Patients were divided into the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - 20mls 0.5% ropivacaine for ilio inguinal nerve block and 20mls saline for wound&#xD;
      irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - 20mls saline for ilioinguinal nerve block by anaesthetist and 20ml ropivacaine 0.5%&#xD;
      for wound irrigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 - 20mls saline for ilioinguinal nerve block and 20mls saline for wound irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GA protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0.03mg/kg midazolam IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2mcg/kg fentanyl&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Propofol to induce anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laryngeal mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance with oxygen/air and sevoflurane&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone 8mg IV for prophylaxis of post operative nausea and vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100mg PR diclofenac&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1g IV paracetamol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique for ilioinguinal nerve block:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Puncture site 1cm medial to anterior superior iliac spine and a fascial click is detected&#xD;
      before injection of local anaesthetic. i.e. just below external oblique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were prescribed a fentanyl PCA for 2 hours postoperatively (1000mcg in 50ml&#xD;
      normal saline with a bolus dose of 25mcg set for every 3 minutes. No background rate. If the&#xD;
      patient was unable to press the button, nursing staff did this until the patient was able to&#xD;
      do so). Using the PCA machine we were be able to record the number of PCA requests and the&#xD;
      total PCA fentanyl delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operative outcome measures. On an hourly basis until discharge, patients were asked to&#xD;
      rate their pain as none, mild, moderate or severe. They were also presented with a visual&#xD;
      analogue scale for post operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day one, two, fourteen and twenty eight post operatively, the patient was telephoned at&#xD;
      home and asked to grade their pain on a scale of none, mild, moderate or severe for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On going to bed at night&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The worst pain they had overnight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Getting out of bed in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amount of post operative analgesia required will be asked at the time of the telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were also asked for the time for return to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Walking without discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise without discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sexual activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Work&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operations were performed by the same consultant surgeon or by a surgical registrar under&#xD;
      direct supervision of the consultant surgeon. All patients had a standard prolene mesh&#xD;
      repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point. Post operative analgesia requirements. Visual analogue scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points. Return to normal activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics. For an 80% chance of detecting a difference in visual analogue scale with&#xD;
      standard deviation of 0.5 and p&lt;0.05, 30 patients would be required in each group.&#xD;
