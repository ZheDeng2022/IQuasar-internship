      Treatment of COPD patients depends on the stage of the disease. First of all it is strongly&#xD;
      recommended quit smoking, then bronchodilators drugs are added. In more advanced stages&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroids and pulmonary rehabilitation are added. In hypoxemic patients a long&#xD;
      term supplemental oxygen is advised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of sputum modifiers drugs is equivocal, since no objective improvement was&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-Acetylcystein (NAC) is a drug known for its anti-oxidant and mucolytic activity. In animal&#xD;
      models of disease it showed its beneficial activity , whereas in human such changes weren't&#xD;
      demonstrated. In all the studies FEV1 was used to demonstrate the beneficial effect of the&#xD;
      drug, although the disease changes are at the level of small airways which is almost not&#xD;
      expressed by the measurement FEV1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate the damage severity at the small airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the change in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the pulmonary function changes at rest and following exercise, including&#xD;
           parameters of air trapping (hyperinflation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods &amp; Materials Patients - Inclusion - 30 Moderate COPD (GOLD classification) , AGE&#xD;
      45-70, both sexes. Treated with inhaled steroids and long acting beta agonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion - Active ischemic heart disease, heart failure, orthopedic problems that preclude&#xD;
      ergometric bicycle activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire - The St. George questionnaire for quality of life will be used . Pulmonary&#xD;
      function testing- Lung volumes and spirometry un including inspiratory capacity will be&#xD;
      measured before and after exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol - 2 weeks run in, for observation disease stability and drug adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will randomly separated in 2 groups . Group A - will receive 600-1200 mg N-acetyl&#xD;
      cystein twice daily. Group B - will receive as control placebo . Following 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment patient will clinically re-examined and PFT's performed as described. After 2 weeks&#xD;
      of washout group A. will serve as control and group B. will be treated with NAC as described.&#xD;

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major cause of chronic morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality throughout the world. Many people suffer from this disease for years and die&#xD;
      prematurely from it or its complications. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the&#xD;
      world, and further increases in its prevalence and mortality can be predicted in the coming&#xD;
      decades. COPD is characterized by a slowly progressing, irreversible airflow limitation&#xD;
      caused by chronic inflammation in the bronchioles. It is diagnosed by performing spirometry.&#xD;
      In the early stages, COPD can be asymptomatic, although episodes of coughing, often with&#xD;
      sputum production, are not rare. In more advance stages, when there are also symptoms of&#xD;
      shortness breath on exertion, a significant part of lung function may be reduced. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of COPD is usually established in the later stages, and this diagnostic delay may&#xD;
      either be due to the patient's gradual adaptation to a decreasing lung function or denial of&#xD;
      the disease. In addition, because doctors are unaware of, or not responding to the symptoms&#xD;
      of the patient. The main cause of COPD is smoking and it often manifests itself after someone&#xD;
      has been smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day over 20 years (20 pack years). A smoker who is&#xD;
      &quot;sensitive&quot; to cigarette smoke may therefore have spirometric changes between the ages of 40&#xD;
      to 45 years if they started smoking as a teenager or early 20th. It has been estimated that&#xD;
      15-20% of smokers develop COPD, but more recent research suggests that as many as 50% develop&#xD;
      COPD if the smoker reaches a high age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of COPD patients depends on the stage of the disease. First of all it is strongly&#xD;
      recommended quit smoking, then bronchodilators drugs are added. In more advanced stages in&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroids and pulmonary rehabilitation are added. In hypoxemic patients a long&#xD;
