  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypovolaemia and tissue hypoperfusion can pass undetected during and after major surgery. The&#xD;
      resulting systemic inflammatory response and organ dysfunction, often not clinically apparent&#xD;
      for several days, may lead to increased morbidity and mortality and prolonged hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, intraoperative optimization of circulatory status by volume loading has been&#xD;
      shown to improve the outcome of patients undergoing high-risk surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, several reports (1-7) have shown that monitoring and maximizing stroke volume by&#xD;
      volume loading (until stroke volume reaches a plateau, actually the plateau of the&#xD;
      Frank-Starling curve) during high-risk surgery decreases the incidence of post-operative&#xD;
      complications and the length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, this strategy has required so far the measurement of stroke volume by a&#xD;
      cardiac output monitor, as well as a specific training period for the operators (8), and&#xD;
      hence is not applicable in many institutions as well as in many countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arterial pulse pressure variation (∆PP) induced by mechanical ventilation is known to be&#xD;
      a very accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness, i.e. of the position on the preload/stroke&#xD;
      volume relationship (Frank-Starling curve) (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By increasing cardiac preload, volume loading induces a rightward shift on the preload/stroke&#xD;
      volume relationship and hence a decrease in ∆PP. Patients who have reached the plateau of the&#xD;
      Frank-Starling relationship can be identified as patients in whom ∆PP is low (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the clinical and intraoperative goal of &quot;maximizing stroke volume by volume&#xD;
      loading&quot; can be achieved simply by minimizing ∆PP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We designed the present study to investigate whether monitoring and minimizing ∆PP by volume&#xD;
      loading during high-risk surgery may improve post-operative outcome and decrease the duration&#xD;
      of post-operative hospital stay.&#xD;

      Principal investigator Dr. Marcel Rezende Lopes, Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care,&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study design Single centre randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation centre Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, Santa Casa de Misericórdia&#xD;
      de Passos, Passos MG, Brazil&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medico-surgical pre-operative decision of post-operative ICU admission (because of&#xD;
           co-morbidities or/and the surgical procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age &gt; 18 yr&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elective surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiac arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body mass index &gt; 40&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients undergoing surgery with an open thorax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients undergoing neurosurgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  enrolment in any other protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics committee The study has been approved by the ethical committee of Santa Casa de&#xD;
      Misericórdia de Passos (Passos, MG, Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent Written informed consent will be required for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start date Sept 22, 2005&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finishing date January 23, 2006&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Randomisation will be done pre-operatively using sealed envelopes. Patients&#xD;
      will be assigned to a Control group (group C) or to an Intervention group (group I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative monitoring In group I, a specific multiparameter bedside monitor (DX 2020,&#xD;
      Dixtal, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil) will be utilized to record continuously and simultaneously the&#xD;
      ECG, the pulse oximetry signal, the arterial pressure curve and the capnographic signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific software is uploaded into this monitor, allowing the recognition of respiratory&#xD;
      cycles (from the analysis of the capnographic signal) and the automatic calculation and&#xD;
      display of ∆PP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention During the surgical procedure, patients will be managed according to standard of&#xD;
      care at Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Passos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C will receive per-operative fluid at the discretion of the anesthetist. Group I will&#xD;
      receive additional hydroxyethylstarch 6% (HES) boluses in order to minimize and maintain ∆PP&#xD;
      ≤ 10%. During the postoperative period, both groups will be managed by intensivists (in the&#xD;
      ICU) and clinicians (in the wards) not involved in the intraoperative management nor in data&#xD;
      collection. These individuals will not be informed of patient allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Over the study period all data will be collected prospectively. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed up until hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection prior to surgery Parameters to be recorded before the surgical procedure are&#xD;
      presented in table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body mass index is calculated according to the standard formula (BMI = weight/height2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum creatinine, prothrombin time, hemoglobin, and platelets will be obtained from routine&#xD;
      pre-operative biological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection during surgery Parameters to be recorded during the surgical procedure are&#xD;
      presented in table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection after surgery Data collection prior to and during surgery will be done by one&#xD;
      individual. Data collection after surgery will be done by another individual not aware of&#xD;
      patient allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information and parameters to be collected after surgery are presented in tables 3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 24h following ICU admission, blood lactate will be measured every 6h and the mean&#xD;
      lactate value will be calculated over the first 24h ICU period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative infectious, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal, hematologic, and renal&#xD;
      complications (table 4) will be recorded according to criteria previously used by other&#xD;
      investigators (10-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of mechanical ventilation, of ICU stay, and of hospital stay, as well as hospital&#xD;
      mortality will be recorded too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected systematically at days 1,2, and 5, as well as at ICU discharge, and&#xD;
      hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be analysed comparing patients in group C with those in group&#xD;
      I on an intention-to-treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the duration of postoperative hospital stay. On the basis of&#xD;
      our own hospital registry, the mean duration of postoperative hospital stay in group C is a&#xD;
      priori estimated at 16 ± 8 days (mean ± SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to previous publications (1,2), we postulated that the mean duration of&#xD;
      postoperative hospital stay in group I could be 35% lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 33 patients in each group was calculated for a 0.05 difference (two sided)&#xD;
      with a power of 80% (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are the number of post-operative complications per patient, as&#xD;
      well as the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analyses and stopping rules An intermediate analysis after the enrolment of the first&#xD;
      33 patients is planed, in order to readjust the population sample size if necessary, or to&#xD;
      stop the trial in case a significant reduction in length of hospital stay (primary endpoint)&#xD;
      is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of funding source Dixtal (Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil) will provide and upload the automatic&#xD;
      calculation software in a bedside monitor owned by Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Passos&#xD;
      (Passos, MG, Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dixtal had no role in the study design, and will have no role in data collection, data&#xD;
      analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author (Dr F.&#xD;
      Michard) will have full access to all data in the study and will have final responsibility&#xD;
      for the decision to submit for publication.&#xD;
