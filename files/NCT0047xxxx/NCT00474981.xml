  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cluster-randomized trial being conducted in the state of Haryana in North&#xD;
      India. Eighteen geographical areas served by Primary Health Centres (PHCs) have been&#xD;
      randomized to intervention or comparison areas. In the intervention areas, all physicians,&#xD;
      health workers and ICDS workers are being trained in the IMNCI. Each of these clusters has an&#xD;
      approximate population of 30,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMNCI intervention includes three main components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. improvement in the case management skills of health staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. improvement in the overall health system to support its performance, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. improvement in family and community health care practices which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  prevention and management of hypothermia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  community-based care of low birth weight infants&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  improved care-seeking for neonatal infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures of the study are neonatal and infant mortality. The study will&#xD;
      also collect information on cause-specific neonatal mortality, ascertained using a&#xD;
      standardized previously validated verbal autopsy instrument administered by trained, skilled&#xD;
      health workers. All the other outcomes (including initiation of breastfeeding within 1 hour&#xD;
      of birth; Exclusive breastfeeding at 4 weeks of age; Proportion of neonates identified to be&#xD;
      sick by caregivers who sought care) are secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of this comprehensive intervention will be measured by comparing the&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome measures in the intervention and comparison clusters,&#xD;
      controlling for any baseline differences such as the predefined outcomes and/or socioeconomic&#xD;
      status and demography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will serve as a guide to the Government of India of how to best implement the&#xD;
      IMNCI strategy and measure its impact.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of delivering community&#xD;
      and facility based newborn interventions as part of the IMNCI strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in reducing (i) neonatal mortality beyond the first 24 hours of birth, i.e. from 1-28&#xD;
           days of age and (ii) overall neonatal mortality, i.e. from birth to 28 days of age, in&#xD;
           the communities receiving the intervention [based on a cohort of infants born to women&#xD;
           identified through pregnancy surveillance]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in reducing (i) neonatal mortality beyond the first 24 hours of life (day 1-28) and (ii)&#xD;
           overall neonatal mortality (birth to 28 days of age) in the population of newborns more&#xD;
           likely to have greater impact from the intervention, i.e. those born at home and&#xD;
           available in the study area within 7 days of birth [based on a cohort of infants born at&#xD;
           home and available in the study area within 7 days of birth]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in reducing infant mortality (from birth to 365 days of age) in the intervention&#xD;
           communities [based on a cohort of infants born to women identified through pregnancy&#xD;
           surveillance]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to determine the effectiveness of delivering&#xD;
      community and facility based newborn interventions as part of the IMNCI strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - in improving newborn care practices in households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimates were revised subsequent to the expansion of the primary objectives and&#xD;
      completion of one year of surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort identified through pregnancy surveillance: The average neonatal mortality rate in the&#xD;
      18 sites in the first year of the study was 42 (range 31-52 ) in the cohort of infants born&#xD;
      to women identified through pregnancy surveillance .The neonatal mortality rate beyond the&#xD;
      first 24 hours of birth in the same cohort was 24 (range 19-31). We estimated that on an&#xD;
      average 3700 neonates per cluster would be enrolled over the study enrollment period of 27&#xD;
      months after taking into account 10% attrition, to detect 20% difference in mortality with&#xD;
      80% power and 95% confidence level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population more likely to have greater impact from the intervention: The average neonatal&#xD;
      mortality rate in the target population of newborns who are more likely to benefit from the&#xD;
      intervention i.e. those born at home and available in study area within 7 days of birth was&#xD;
      36 (range 19-43). The mortality beyond the first 24 hours of birth in the same cohort was 22&#xD;
      (range 13-25). On an average 2000 neonates per cluster would be enrolled over the study&#xD;
      enrollment period of 27 months. This would enable us to detect 25% difference in mortality&#xD;
      with 80% power and 95% confidence level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarise, 27 months of enrollment will give 80% or more power to detect:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pregnancy cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20% or greater reduction in neonatal mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20% in the mortality of neonates beyond first 24 hours of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the population more likely to have greater impact (i.e. those born at home and available&#xD;
      in the study area within 7 days of birth):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  25% or greater reduction in mortality from birth to 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  25% or greater reduction in the neonatal mortality beyond first 24 hours of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size has also been estimated for process evaluation outcomes through observations&#xD;
      at health facilities (quality of care at health facilities) and exit interviews (knowledge&#xD;
      and skills of mothers on home care of illness). Our guesstimates of the proportions in the&#xD;
      control group are based on experience of working in the area. The number of clusters was&#xD;
      taken as 9 per group based on sample size calculations for mortality discussed above. The&#xD;
      table below shows that 50 observations and 50 exit interviews per cluster (i.e. 450&#xD;
      observations and exit interviews each in the intervention clusters and 450 in the control&#xD;
      clusters i.e. a total of 1800) would be adequate to detect a 20% absolute increase in the&#xD;
      outcome with 90% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention was designed following the guidelines developed by the Government of India&#xD;
      in collaboration with the WHO and UNICEF (2). The intervention includes three main&#xD;
      components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improving the case management skills of health staff: Qualified physicians, supervisors&#xD;
           and other health workers in the intervention sites along with anganwadi workers will be&#xD;
           trained in IMNCI through an 8 day course. A set of information meetings will be designed&#xD;
           for traditional birth attendants registered medical practitioners and qualified&#xD;
           physicians working in the private sector. The training will be completed by a visit to&#xD;
           the trainee at his/her work place within 1 month of the course to review the&#xD;
           performance, correct any problems and support the use of the skills taught during the&#xD;
           course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Strengthening of health systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As part of its collaboration with the project, efforts will be undertaken by the&#xD;
           District Medical Officer's team to implement the following health systems improvements&#xD;
           with a focus on the intervention areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Availability of drugs and supplies needed for IMNCI: In order to ensure availability of&#xD;
           essential IMNCI drugs and supplies a checklist will be prepared and displayed in the&#xD;
           health facility. This list will be used as a checklist during Supervisory Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Improving referral pathways and services: Facilities will keep records of cases&#xD;
           attended, cases referred and problems reviewed in supervisory visits and review meetings&#xD;
           between the program in charge from the local health team and different categories of&#xD;
           health workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Supervisory Visits: Both scheduled and unscheduled visits will be conducted by&#xD;
           supervisors (belonging to the local heath system and those provided through this&#xD;
           project) trained in IMNCI. Supervisors will review the availability of facility supports&#xD;
           and drugs to implement IMNCI, as well as health workers performance, and provide&#xD;
           feedback and help problem-solving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improvement in family and community practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this component of the IMNCI strategy is to initiate, reinforce and sustain the key&#xD;
      family practices for child survival, growth and development. Practices that are of particular&#xD;
      importance for newborn health (early initiation of breastfeeding and avoidance of pre-lacteal&#xD;
      feeds; keeping the baby warm, avoiding early bathing, cord hygiene, care seeking for danger&#xD;
      signs and special attention for LBW newborns) will be promoted in addition to the standard&#xD;
      IMCI key practices (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME ASCERTAINMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      One field worker will be allocated 2000 to 3000 households and will keep his/her area under&#xD;
      surveillance to identify pregnant women. For all pregnancies identified, visits will be made&#xD;
      to the household on a day coinciding with infant age ~1 month to document the outcome of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Subsequent visits will be made at infant age 3, 6, 9 and 12 months to record the&#xD;
      vital status of the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCESS EVALUATION ACTIVITIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will be conducted by a 6 member team both in the intervention and control clusters and&#xD;
      will essentially focus on activities that ascertain how well the intervention is being&#xD;
      implemented. The evaluation will be conducted in a small subsample of the various activities&#xD;
      in each of the 18 clusters and will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observations of health care providers, consultations with caregivers of infants aged &lt;&#xD;
           29 days and infants between 1 to 11 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exit interviews with mothers who have recently visited a health care provider for&#xD;
           treatment of illness in an infant aged &lt; 29 days and infants between 1 to 11 months of&#xD;
           age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews with caregivers/mothers with a young infant who were home visited recently by&#xD;
           a health worker&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forms filled in the field will be manually self-checked for missing information, data range&#xD;
      and consistency by the person filling the form. A double data entry system will be used&#xD;
      followed by validation and merging of the double entered cleaned data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socioeconomic, environmental and demographic characteristics of the intervention and control&#xD;
      clusters will be examined for group comparability. Any significant differences will be&#xD;
      controlled for during data analysis. The potential confounders on which data will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distance from the nearest government outpatient facility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distance from the nearest private outpatient facility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distance from the nearest government inpatient facility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distance from the nearest private inpatient facility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Density of private providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Density of qualified private providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of private practitioners used for care of infants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequencies of the main study variables will be examined to assess the distribution of&#xD;
      data. If the data are not normally distributed, decisions about the need for data&#xD;
      transformation and the appropriateness of statistical tests will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluation will be done by comparing the primary and secondary outcome measures in&#xD;
      the intervention and control clusters, controlling for any socioeconomic, environmental or&#xD;
      demographic differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To account for the clustered nature of the data, techniques such as Generalized Estimating&#xD;
      Equation and multi-level modelling will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be carried out using Stata, Version 8.2.&#xD;
