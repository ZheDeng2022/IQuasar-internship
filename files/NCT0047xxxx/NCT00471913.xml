    <textblock>
      Study focus is femoral shaft (thigh bone) fractures (break) that require surgical treatment&#xD;
      under anaesthetic to stabilize the femur fracture. This is usually done by placing a metal&#xD;
      nail and screws inside the femur (thigh) bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed to allow us to learn more about the effect of using a different&#xD;
      starting point to insert the nail into the body in order to access the fracture and fix it.&#xD;
      This question is important because to date, all entry points currently used do result in some&#xD;
      muscle damage. In order to minimize this damage a lateral (side) entry nail has been&#xD;
      developed and is currently in use at many centres. This nail is new but, the lateral entry&#xD;
      technique for these types of fractures has been used extensively in the past, and this nail&#xD;
      has been developed in order to better accommodate the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that entering laterally instead of going deeper into the tissue to access the&#xD;
      bone to fix it is going to result in less muscle damage which in turn will improve functional&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed to prospectively evaluate functional outcome and MR imaging of&#xD;
      abductor damage following antegrade femoral nailing with different entry points&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent developments in IM nailing of the femur have favoured the use of the greater&#xD;
      trochanter as an entry site as opposed to using the &quot;classical&quot; piriformis fossa. With either&#xD;
      technique, a persistent problem appears however to be the damage caused to muscle tissue&#xD;
      during preparation of the femur and insertion of the nail. The recent development of femoral&#xD;
      nails with an entry point lateral to both these sites offers the potential advantage of&#xD;
      avoiding abductor muscle damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several cadaver studies, authors state that a trochanteric entry point causes more damage&#xD;
      than a piriformis entry, and that an even more lateral entry point causes even less damage to&#xD;
      the abductor muscles compared to the classical piriformis fossa entry site. There is however,&#xD;
      no prospective clinical study has specifically evaluated the condition of the abductor tendon&#xD;
      and the amount of muscle damage after antegrade nailing in the treatment of femoral shaft&#xD;
      fractures. The few clinical studies that have attempted to examine the functional outcome in&#xD;
      patients undergoing IM nailing of femoral fractures have used general measurement tools&#xD;
      (general functional clinical assessment, gross evaluation of gait) which do not reflect the&#xD;
      state of the art at this time and which do not specifically assess gluteal muscle condition.&#xD;
      To date, no published study has evaluated the integrity of the gluteus tendon, the damage to&#xD;
      the surrounding tissues, and the functional outcome using validated scores. Moreover, no&#xD;
      study has compared the &quot;traditional&quot; entry points to a lateral entry nail with this level of&#xD;
      precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care for the treatment of femoral shaft fractures is the insertion of an&#xD;
      intramedullary nail through the piriformis fossa. Following insertion of femoral IM nails, a&#xD;
      number of studies have demonstrated excellent clinical and radiographic results with&#xD;
      relatively few complications such as nonunion, malunion, or infection. Intraoperative&#xD;
      difficulties with respect to rapid identification of the appropriate starting point have&#xD;
      prompted the development of nails that use the greater trochanter as an entry site as opposed&#xD;
      to using the &quot;classical&quot; piriformis fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated earlier, with either technique, a persistent problem appears however to be the&#xD;
      damage caused to muscle tissue during preparation of the femur and insertion of the nail. The&#xD;
      recent development of femoral nails with an entry point lateral to both these sites offers&#xD;
      the theoretical advantage of avoiding abductor muscle damage. There is so far a lack of&#xD;
      prospective randomized trials which demonstrate radiological and clinical parameters of the&#xD;
      different entry points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To determine the abductor tendon and muscle damage with MR-imaging according to the&#xD;
      entry point of the femoral nail. Additionally, objective hip muscle function, general health&#xD;
      status and functional outcome will be assessed using validated instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to correlate muscle damage due to the different entry points and correlate with the&#xD;
      functional outcome. Further, to quantify the differences (advantages) of different IM nailing&#xD;
      techniques of the femur, with respect to effect on the abductor musculature, muscle testing&#xD;
      and gait, and patient-based functional outcome, to guide surgeons' decisions and future&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent Related Work In a recently published report by Ricci et al. the use of the&#xD;
      trochanteric entry point was associated with a low complication rate and good clinical&#xD;
      results including the assessment of a gait video. In this admittedly small prospective study&#xD;
      the superiority of either the trochanteric or the piriformis fossa entry point nail could not&#xD;
      be established. Although gait was evaluated video (in 30% of the study population), this was&#xD;
      limited to a subjective assessment of the presence of a Trendelenberg gait (absent, slight or&#xD;
      present). There was no statement about the muscle status, and functional outcome assessment&#xD;
      was limited to a Harris Hip Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abductor tendon condition and muscle damage has previously been assessed with MR-imaging by&#xD;
      the group of Pfirrmann et al. in patients with total hip arthroplasty through a transgluteal&#xD;
      approach. This study showed a high correlation between damage and clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-applicant's research group has previously carried out many clinical studies including&#xD;
      its part in a multi-centre randomized trial in femur fractures. It also specifically has&#xD;
      carried out a functional assessment of patients following femur fractures which included:&#xD;
      objective muscle testing of isokinetic force using a KinComÂ® dynamometer, formal gait lab&#xD;
      analysis using an eight camera real-time motion capture system in conjunction with a&#xD;
      force-plate walking platform, and as part of the same study, the administration of validated&#xD;
      self-assessment outcome questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far no prospective randomized trial has investigated, as we have planned to do, the&#xD;
      radiological (MR), functional, and clinical outcome after insertion of a femoral nail through&#xD;
      two different entry points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Patients will be assigned randomly (via computer generated randomization) to one of&#xD;
      two groups. The two groups will undergo standard treatment of IM nailing for the femoral&#xD;
      shaft fracture differing only in entry point of the nail: piriformis fossa entry point versus&#xD;
      lateral entry point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Patients between 19 and 60 years of age presenting with an isolated femoral shaft&#xD;
      fracture that requires IM nailing will be asked to participate in this study. Informed&#xD;
      consent for participation in the study will be obtained by either a member of the health care&#xD;
      team or by a research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to either piriformis&#xD;
      fossa or lateral entry femoral nailing. Preoperative, Intraoperative, and follow-up data will&#xD;
      be obtained. Data will detail clinical assessment, MRI results, objective muscle testing, and&#xD;
      gait analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis In a published report from Pfirrmann et al. distinct conclusions could be made&#xD;
      in a collective of 54 patients. We plan to recruit 60 patients (30 per group) with a&#xD;
      projected drop-out rate of 10%. As this is a pilot study, without previous reference, a&#xD;
      similarity in expected findings and required sample size must be inferred. Cases will be&#xD;
      randomized using a web-based allocation tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables for collection and analysis are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Demographics ii) ISS (Injury Severity Score) iii) AO Fracture Classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intraoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Elapsed time from injury to operative treatment ii) Fluoroscopy time iii) Incision&#xD;
           length iv) Blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) VAS pain scores ii) Morphine requirements q 24hrs iii) Change in hemoglobin q 24hrs&#xD;
           iv) Hospital Length of Stay v) Clinical and Radiological follow-up at 3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
           months vi) MRI at 12 months vii) Self-administered validated outcome tools at 6 and 12&#xD;
           months (SF-36, SMFA, Harris Hip Score, Merle d'Aubigne score) although last two are not&#xD;
           validated they would allow for comparison with widely published scores in established&#xD;
           literature&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Specific Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Postoperative follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be reviewed clinically in the fracture clinic at two, six, twelve&#xD;
           weeks, and six and twelve months postoperatively. Study data will be acquired at the six&#xD;
           and 12 month appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bilateral measurements will be recorded so that the results from the unaffected limb are&#xD;
           used as a control for the injured limb. Both the raw data and the side to side&#xD;
           differences will be used in the analysis. Physical examination to document any limb&#xD;
           length discrepancy, Trendelenberg sign, rotational malalignment, and the ranges of&#xD;
           motion of the hip and knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A study specific questionnaire will be administered to determine the extent and location&#xD;
           of any persistent pain in the affected limb, ability to return to their usual occupation&#xD;
           and recreational activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Functional outcome scores (SF-36, SMFA, Harris Hip Score, Merle d'Aubigne score) will be&#xD;
           collected at 6 and 12 months. All of these outcomes tools are widely referenced in the&#xD;
           literature and can be used for comparison purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MR Imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
           An MRI will be administered at 12 months and will include evaluation of abductor tendon&#xD;
           defects, diameter, signal intensity, ossification, and bursal fluid collections. The&#xD;
           abductor muscles will be evaluated by MRI for fatty atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Muscle strength testing and gait analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Muscle strength testing will take place at 12 months and will utilize the KinCom&#xD;
           Dynamometer (a widely used, standard research protocol and specifically-designed&#xD;
           instrument for use in muscle strength testing) to evaluate muscle strength: Peak&#xD;
           isokinetic force measurement: maximum strength (nm/kg), and work (J/min) of hip&#xD;
           abductors, hip extensors, and knee extensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Gait analysis will take place at 12 months and will employ a standard eight camera&#xD;
           real-time motion capture system in conjunction with a force-plate walking platform to&#xD;
           collect and evaluate pelvic obliquity, hip abductor movement, single leg support time,&#xD;
           and step length.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The side-to-side differences will be summarized and compared across treatment groups.&#xD;
           Additionally, aggregated raw data by treatment group will be summarized and compared,&#xD;
           using t-test for the comparison of continuous variables' means, and Chi-square for&#xD;
           categorical data.&#xD;
