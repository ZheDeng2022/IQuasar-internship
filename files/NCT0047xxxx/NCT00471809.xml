      The MARS trial is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study that compares the capacity&#xD;
      of azithromycin or montelukast to placebo as effective adjunctive therapy that allows&#xD;
      reduction of inhaled corticosteroids in children ages 6 to 17 years with moderate to severe&#xD;
      persistent asthma. The primary null hypothesis is that in children with moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      persistent asthma, a macrolide antibiotic (azithromycin) or a leukotriene receptor antagonist&#xD;
      (montelukast) will provide a steroid-sparing effect when compared to placebo as the dose of&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroid is reduced. This will be tested following achievement of control of&#xD;
      symptoms with moderate to high-dose inhaled corticosteroid in combination with a long-acting&#xD;
      bronchodilator agonist. Use of these doses for the inhaled corticosteroid will be based on&#xD;
      NHLBI step-up guidelines to achieve asthma control.&#xD;

      The MARS trial is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study that compares the capacity&#xD;
      of azithromycin or montelukast to placebo as effective adjunctive therapy that allows&#xD;
      reduction of inhaled corticosteroids in children ages 6 to 17 years with moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      persistent asthma. The primary null hypothesis is that in children with moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      persistent asthma, a macrolide antibiotic (Mac - azithromycin) or a leukotriene receptor&#xD;
      antagonist (LTRA - montelukast) will provide a steroid-sparing effect when compared to&#xD;
      placebo as the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS - budesonide) is reduced. This will be&#xD;
      tested following achievement of control of symptoms with moderate to high-dose ICS in&#xD;
      combination with a long-acting bronchodilator agonist (LABA - salmeterol). Use of these doses&#xD;
      for the inhaled corticosteroid will be based on NHLBI step-up guidelines to achieve asthma&#xD;
      control. Inadequate asthma control is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. chronic poor control: a) symptoms, or albuterol use for symptoms or low peak flow, or&#xD;
           peak flow less than 80% baseline on greater than 3 days per week on average, or b)&#xD;
           nocturnal awakenings for asthma symptoms requiring albuterol 2 or more nights over 2&#xD;
           weeks of observation, or c) FEV1 less than 80% of the best pre-randomization value on 2&#xD;
           consecutive visits 1-4 days apart, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an asthma exacerbation as determined by need for systemic corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment in the run-in period will be determined by the child's status at the first visit.&#xD;
      At enrollment (V0) all patients will be given budesonide as the ICS and salmeterol as the&#xD;
      LABA. Children will be treated with salmeterol BID and a dose of ICS based on chronic&#xD;
      medication use with stepping-down based on time and symptoms until criteria for inadequate&#xD;
      control as indication for stepping-up the dose of ICS. When inadequate control is documented&#xD;
      (V1), a four-day course of prednisone will be administered and the dose of ICS (still&#xD;
      administered with salmeterol BID) will be doubled to establish control. The children will be&#xD;
      followed with monthly clinic visits and interim phone calls, emphasizing use of daily diary&#xD;
      to document symptoms and doses of albuterol required. Reestablishment of control during a&#xD;
      2-week interval will prompt randomization. If control is not yet established by the first&#xD;
      increase in ICS dose during the stabilization period, the dose can be doubled along with a&#xD;
      second prednisone course until a maximum of budesonide of 1600 mcg/day is attained. The daily&#xD;
      dose of budesonide at randomization will be a minimum of 800 mcg to allow for a maximum of&#xD;
      4-fold reduction of dose, and a maximum of 1600 mcg to allow for patient safety considering&#xD;
      side effects of high dose ICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When clinical control is achieved by the increased dose of ICS, a child will then be&#xD;
      randomized (V2) to one of the three treatment arms, (1) placebo (one placebo tablet and one&#xD;
      or two placebo capsules), (2) azithromycin (one placebo tablet and one or two capsules&#xD;
      containing azithromycin with the dose based on weight), or (3) montelukast (one tablet&#xD;
      containing montelukast with the dose based on age as indicated in the package insert and one&#xD;
      or two placebo capsule). Children will be followed for an additional six weeks on the dose of&#xD;
      ICS that achieved control (&quot;1X&quot;) + salmeterol BID with the study medication (V3). They will&#xD;
      then undergo three 6-week periods of ICS reduction (V4, V5, V6), first to ¾ of the control&#xD;
      dose (&quot;0.75X&quot;), then ½ of the control dose (&quot;0.5X&quot;) and then ¼ of the control dose (&quot;0.25X&quot;),&#xD;
      each using salmeterol BID as concomitant medication. The ICS dosing and salmeterol will be&#xD;
      open-label. Criteria for treatment failure and discharge from the study will be an&#xD;
      established set of criteria that indicate reappearance of inadequate control of asthma or an&#xD;
      exacerbation of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the double-blind administration of oral study medication (V6), patients not&#xD;
      discharged from the study because of having met one of the criteria for inadequate control of&#xD;
      asthma will have their study medication discontinued, with subjects continuing to take&#xD;
      placebo capsules in addition to ¼ ICS plus salmeterol. They will then be followed for an&#xD;
      additional 6-week single-blind wash-out period with an interim contact by phone at 3 weeks to&#xD;
      determine the course of asthma control to determine the persistence of effect off of the&#xD;
      study medication (V7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures to be performed at V0 are informed consent, pregnancy test, complete physical&#xD;
      exam, spirometry, and bronchodilator response. The procedures to be performed at V1 are&#xD;
      spirometry, complete blood count, blood IgE and eosinophils, brief physical exam, EKG, and&#xD;
      genotyping. The following procedures will be performed at each of V2 through V7: brief&#xD;
      physical exam, spirometry, forced oscillometry, exhaled nitric oxide, asthma control&#xD;
      questionnaire, asthma-specific quality-of-life questionnaire, and sinusitis questionnaire. In&#xD;
      addition, allergy skin testing will be performed at V2, pregnancy tests at V2 through V6,&#xD;
      methacholine challenge at V2 and V3, and polymerase chain reaction for atypical organisms and&#xD;
      macrolide antibiotic resistance (nasal wash) at V2, V5, and V7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, children will maintain daily diary records of morning and evening symptoms, peak&#xD;
      expiratory flow rates, and rescue medication use.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        At Enrollment (V0):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 6-17 years at time of enrollment. A goal of 33% minority and 40% female subjects&#xD;
             will be incorporated in recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weighs at least 25 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asthma diagnosed by a physician and present for at least one year prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to severe persistent asthma:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients will be identified in the following general categories. The general&#xD;
                  principle is that patients will be uncontrolled on a relatively low dose of ICS&#xD;
                  that can be stepped-up, or controlled on a moderate or high dose of ICS that can&#xD;
                  be stepped-down.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  i) On low dose ICS with or without salmeterol and uncontrolled. This patient will&#xD;
                  be treated with budesonide and salmeterol to determine eligibility criteria. If&#xD;
                  the addition of salmeterol results in control of symptoms, the patient would be&#xD;
                  excluded from MARS. If control was not established on low dose budesonide and&#xD;
                  salmeterol, the dose of budesonide would be increased and entry criteria&#xD;
                  evaluated based on the algorithm in Figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  ii) On a dose of ICS equivalent to budesonide at 400 mcg per day with or without&#xD;
                  any other medication and uncontrolled. This patient will be treated with&#xD;
                  budesonide and salmeterol to determine eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  iii) On a dose of ICS equivalent to budesonide at 800 mcg per day with or without&#xD;
                  any other medication and controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  iv) On a dose of ICS equivalent to budesonide at 1600 mcg per day with or without&#xD;
                  any other medication and uncontrolled but not requiring prednisone acutely. These&#xD;
                  patients will be followed to see if they become well controlled with increased&#xD;
                  adherence or more careful monitoring of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Examples are given for Advair as this drug is a commonly used form of ICS and&#xD;
                  LABA:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  i) Patients on Advair 100/50 bid and inadequately controlled ii) Patients on&#xD;
                  Advair 250/50 bid and inadequately controlled iii) Patients on Advair 250/50 bid&#xD;
                  and well controlled for greater than 3 months and being considered for&#xD;
                  stepping-down to Advair 100/50 iv) Patients well controlled on Advair 100/50 bid&#xD;
                  + either montelukast or theophylline for greater than 3 months and being&#xD;
                  considered for stepping-down to Advair 100/50 bid alone v) Patients on Advair&#xD;
                  500/50 bid and well controlled for greater than 3 months and being considered for&#xD;
                  stepping-down to Advair 250/50 vi) Patients well controlled on Advair 250/50 bid&#xD;
                  + either montelukast or theophylline for greater than 3 months and being&#xD;
                  considered for stepping-down to Advair 250/50 bid alone&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients on an equivalent of budesonide 400 mcg, 800 mcg, or 1600 mcg per day&#xD;
                  with no symptoms, but with an FEV1 less than 80% predicted, will be enrolled as&#xD;
                  uncontrolled and observed closely for symptoms or low peak flows for 2 weeks. The&#xD;
                  rationale for enrolling these patients and observing them as &quot;uncontrolled&quot; is&#xD;
                  that patients with an FEV1 below the range of normal may be having symptoms&#xD;
                  and/or low peak flows that will become apparent under close observation after&#xD;
                  appropriate education. Note that a percent predicted value for FEV1 will be used&#xD;
                  only at the enrollment visit, with criteria for control and inadequate control&#xD;
                  during both run-in and during the double-blind portions of the study using the&#xD;
                  highest FEV1 value obtained during run-in for decisions prior to randomization&#xD;
                  and the FEV1 at randomization for decisions subsequent to that visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FEV1 at least 80% predicted if there is going to be step-down at enrollment or at&#xD;
             least 50% predicted if already suboptimally controlled historically and to be observed&#xD;
             for 2 weeks to define baseline symptoms. FEV1 measurements will be obtained&#xD;
             pre-bronchodilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate a bronchodilator response with an improvement in FEV1 of at least 12% or&#xD;
             airway responsiveness to methacholine with a PC20 less than 12.5 mg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Bronchodilator responsiveness testing will be done at Visit 0 (Enrollment) in all&#xD;
                  patients using 4 puffs albuterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Methacholine challenge will be done at Visit 1 (Step-up) in patients who did not&#xD;
                  respond to bronchodilator at Visit 0. Patients with a FEV1 less than 70%&#xD;
                  predicted or an upper respiratory infection at the time of Visit 1 will have a&#xD;
                  second bronchodilator challenge rather than a methacholine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Varicella immunization complete (unless the subject has already had clinical&#xD;
             varicella). If the subject needs varicella vaccine, this will be arranged with the&#xD;
             primary care physician and must be received prior randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to provide informed consent by the child's parent or guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonsmoker in the past year; in addition, no use of smokeless tobacco products in the&#xD;
             year prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        At Enrollment (V0):&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of other significant medical illnesses (cardiac, liver, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             endocrine, any seizure disorder except febrile seizure in infancy) that would place&#xD;
