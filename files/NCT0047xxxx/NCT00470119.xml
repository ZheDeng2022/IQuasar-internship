      RATIONALE: A low-calorie diet and/or exercise program may help lower an overweight or obese&#xD;
      postmenopausal woman's risk of developing breast cancer. It is not yet known whether a&#xD;
      low-calorie diet and/or exercise program are more effective than no diet or exercise program&#xD;
      in lowering an overweight or obese postmenopausal woman's risk of developing breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the effect of a low-calorie diet and/or&#xD;
      exercise program on risk factors for developing breast cancer compared with no diet or&#xD;
      exercise program in overweight or obese postmenopausal women.&#xD;

&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Participants are stratified according to body mass index&#xD;
      (&lt; 30 vs ≥ 30). Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (exercise program): Participants exercise 3 days per week under the supervision of&#xD;
           a physiologist and 2 days per week independently at home, for a total of 5 exercise&#xD;
           sessions (at least 45 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per session) weekly over 12&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (reduced-calorie diet): Participants meet with a nutritionist individually and in&#xD;
           small groups. Participants receive general information about diet and behavior&#xD;
           strategies such as self-monitoring, goal-setting, stimulus-control, problem-solving, and&#xD;
           relapse-prevention training. Participants learn to set a calorie goal and a fat gram&#xD;
           goal and how to achieve the goal calorie reduction. Meetings are held weekly during the&#xD;
           first 6 months of the diet program but taper off over the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III (exercise program and reduced-calorie diet): Participants meet with a&#xD;
           physiologist and a nutritionist, as in arms I and II, and exercise and diet accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm IV (control: delayed diet and exercise): Participants receive study materials on&#xD;
           healthy diet and exercise at the end of the 12-month study period. In addition,&#xD;
           participants are offered 2 months of group exercise training with a study physiologist&#xD;
           and 4 group meetings with a nutritionist to learn about weight loss techniques and&#xD;
           behavioral principles for achieving weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants undergo testing at baseline and periodically during study. Participants&#xD;
      undergo blood collection for evaluation of serum levels of sex and metabolic hormones (e.g.,&#xD;
      estrone, estradiol, testosterone, free testosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin,&#xD;
      radioimmunoassay and other immunoassays. Participants also undergo anthropometrics and body&#xD;
      composition measurements and mammographic density assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete questionnaires at baseline and at 6 and 12 months for assessment of&#xD;
      diet and exercise. Quality of life (QOL) is measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months using&#xD;
      the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form and the Impact of Weight on QOL questionnaire.&#xD;
      Information on health habits, medical history, family history of breast cancer, and&#xD;
      reproductive and menstrual history is also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINAL ACCRUAL: A total of 439 participants (118 in the caloric restriction arm, and 117 in&#xD;
      both the CR+Exercise, and exercise only arm; and 87 in control arm) were accrued for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
