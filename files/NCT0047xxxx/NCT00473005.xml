  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to improve the survival of metastatic breast patients, it is important to&#xD;
      investigate the use of novel therapeutic agents combined with known active agents in the&#xD;
      treatment of breast cancer. This is a phase I study evaluating the maximum tolerated doses&#xD;
      and toxicities of RAD001 in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer. RAD001 (INN: everolimus) is a novel macrolide, which is being developed as an&#xD;
      antiproliferative drug with applications as an immunosuppressant and anticancer agent. Phase&#xD;
      I trials in patients with solid tumors have shown that treatment with RAD001 is&#xD;
      well-tolerated with a minimal side effect profile. Capecitabine (Xeloda, Roche) is an oral&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine that was approved in 1998 for the treatment of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer. The all-oral regimen of RAD001 with capecitabine is an attractive approach as&#xD;
      the treatment of metastatic breast cancer has not yet proven to be curative. We also want to&#xD;
      find out what possible benefit this combination of drugs might have on treating your cancer.&#xD;
