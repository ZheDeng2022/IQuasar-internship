    <textblock>
      This study involves a drug called celecoxib, which is commonly prescribed for people with&#xD;
      arthritis. Arthritis is caused by inflammation of the joints or tissues. Inflammation also&#xD;
      occurs in the blood vessels that lead to your heart, and the purpose of this study is to see&#xD;
      if celecoxib can reduce the blood vessel inflammation associated with high cholesterol and&#xD;
      heart disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammation of the blood vessel wall is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Elevated&#xD;
      levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), as well as blood pressure are known to&#xD;
      be proinflammatory. Recent information suggests that acute ischemic events are associated&#xD;
      with exacerbations in inflammation. Some data suggest that aspirin use is associated with&#xD;
      suppression of markers of inflammation, and this response has been linked with improved&#xD;
      outcome. Similarly, HMG Co-A Reductase inhibitors clearly reduce adverse outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with atherosclerosis and recently, HMG Co-A Reductase inhibitor use has also been linked to&#xD;
      reduction in inflammation. Due to the strong association of atherogenesis and plaque&#xD;
      stability with inflammation, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, has been&#xD;
      evaluated as a potential tool for clinicians to assess cardiovascular risk, and has been&#xD;
      found to be highly correlated. There is also evidence to suggest that cyclooxygenase 2&#xD;
      (COX-2) enzyme is expressed in plaque at regions which are vulnerable to rupture.&#xD;
      Accordingly, this study is designed to investigate the potential reduction in vascular&#xD;
      inflammation from a specific COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, as measured by a reduction from&#xD;
      baseline of CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF-alpha). This is&#xD;
      a double blind, placebo controlled pilot study in hypertensive patients with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease and dyslipidemia, to evaluate the effect of celecoxib versus placebo on inflammatory&#xD;
      markers. Patients will receive study drug for three months.&#xD;
