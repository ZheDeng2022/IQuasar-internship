      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women whose mammograms show a lot of dense areas are more likely to develop breast cancer and&#xD;
      to have cancers that are missed by mammograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear why some factors lead to having dense breasts and why having dense breasts&#xD;
      increases the risk of developing breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine why some women s breasts look dense on mammograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine what types of cells and tissues make up dense areas of breasts and why these&#xD;
      tissues may be more likely to become cancerous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women between 40 and 65 years of age who have not had breast cancer or received medicines or&#xD;
      radiation for any type of cancer and who are scheduled to undergo a breast biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted at the University of Vermont, in collaboration with the NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of their medical records collected over the last 2 years by the Vermont&#xD;
           Mammography Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in a short telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and weight measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing of biopsy tissue collected for diagnosis or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Future contacts regarding health status for up to 10 years, including review of&#xD;
           additional mammograms, removed tissues, questionnaires and medical records collected by&#xD;
           the Vermont Mammography Registry during the 10-year study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also undergo the following optional procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide a mouthwash sample for genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide a blood sample to test for markers of dense mammograms or breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High breast density and aging are the strongest risk factors for sporadic breast cancer among&#xD;
      women. Although glandular epithelium contributes to mammographic density, non-epithelial&#xD;
      tissue components represent its major determinants: adipose tissue is radiolucent and fibrous&#xD;
      tissue is dense. The hypothesis is that epidemiologic factors associated with elevated breast&#xD;
      density alter the breast microenvironment (ME) (defined as all cells and structures&#xD;
      surrounding luminal glandular cells including: myoepithelial cells; basement membrane,&#xD;
      stromal fibroblast and myofibroblasts; endothelial cells and pericytes; inflammatory cells,&#xD;
      collagens, matrix proteins, growth factors, hormones, and other biochemical components) in a&#xD;
      manner that enhances dysregulated proliferation of breast epithelium and ultimately cancer.&#xD;
      Specifically, the Investigators propose that epidemiologic factors that lead to increased&#xD;
      exposure to hormones and inflammatory mediators alter the ME, leading to both increased&#xD;
      breast density and cancer. The critical importance of the ME in carcinogenesis is supported&#xD;
      by experimental and clinical data showing that epithelial abnormalities alone are generally&#xD;
      insufficient for cancer development without concurrent changes in the ME. The primary aim of&#xD;
      this pilot study is to demonstrate the feasibility of collecting the data needed to elucidate&#xD;
      the biologic mechanisms that mediate the substantial breast cancer risk associated with high&#xD;
      mammographic density. Specifically, the Investigators will develop, fine tune, and validate a&#xD;
      complex cross-sectional study protocol to collect risk factor data and biological specimens&#xD;
      (blood, buccal cells, tissue fluids, and tissue) required to discover mechanisms and&#xD;
      biomarkers that link high mammographic density (as measured quantitatively using computerized&#xD;
      methods) to breast cancer risk. They will enroll 250 women between the ages of 40 to 65 years&#xD;
      undergoing a radiologically guided biopsy at the University of Vermont, the largest center&#xD;
      within the Vermont Breast Cancer Surveillance System (VBCSS), to participate in this pilot&#xD;
      study of mammographic density.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for participation in the study are women, ages 40-65 years of age, who&#xD;
        are undergoing a radiologically-guided biopsy (stereotactic- ultrasound-guided). We will&#xD;
        NOT exclude subjects for current or past use of exogenous hormones; prior hysterectomy or&#xD;
        salpingoophorectomy or presentation with a breast mass. Although most biopsies are prompted&#xD;
        by a radiologic finding (typically abnormal calcifications or masses), some biopsies are&#xD;
        performed for symptoms that are unassociated with a radiologic finding, such as nipple&#xD;
        discharge, palpable mass, discomfort, etc. Elevated density per se is not a biopsy&#xD;
        indication. ALL women referred for radiologically guided biopsy, irrespective of the&#xD;
        indication, will be considered eligible for the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will EXCLUDE women who have a prior history of breast cancer, have had an EXCISIONAL&#xD;
        breast biopsy within one year, women who have implants in place, women taking tamoxifen or&#xD;
        raloxifene for chemoprevention and women who have received non-surgical treatments for&#xD;
        cancers of other organs.&#xD;
