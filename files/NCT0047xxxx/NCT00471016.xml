    <textblock>
      This project is a prospective, randomized controlled trial to improve the end of life&#xD;
      experience for homeless persons by facilitating the expression of their wishes and&#xD;
      enhancement of their dignity when facing serious illness, death, or the prospect of dying.&#xD;
      Our main hypothesis is that homeless persons will engage in this intervention and increase&#xD;
      rates of advance directive completion.&#xD;

      This project is a prospective, randomized controlled trial to improve the end of life&#xD;
      experience for homeless persons by facilitating the expression of their wishes and&#xD;
      enhancement of their dignity when facing serious illness, death, or the prospect of dying.&#xD;
      Our main hypothesis is that homeless persons will engage in this intervention and increase&#xD;
      rates of advance directive completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were recruited from Listening House, a drop-in center for homeless individuals&#xD;
      located in St. Paul, Minnesota and represent a convenience sample. Participants were required&#xD;
      to speak English, not be overtly intoxicated, and have been homeless during the previous six&#xD;
      months. The study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the&#xD;
      University of Minnesota. All participants who entered the study gave written and oral consent&#xD;
      for randomization and data measurement and screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruitment and consent, participants were randomized into two intervention arms,&#xD;
      minimal intervention (MI) and guided intervention (GI). All participants received educational&#xD;
      materials about advance directives and advance care planning, pre-intervention surveys, and&#xD;
      an advance care planning document, designated HELP, specifically designed for marginalized&#xD;
      populations to preserve autonomy and elicit preferences of EOL care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants completed a baseline written pre-test and survey. For this, they received&#xD;
      compensation of $5. Those randomized to the minimal intervention were provided the&#xD;
      opportunity to complete a HELP document if they so desired. Participants randomized to the GI&#xD;
      group were provided with the written instructions and tools and asked to return to meet with&#xD;
      investigators for one-on-one counseling and assistance in completion of the HELP document on&#xD;
      one of several days later during the week of enrollment. Three months after enrollment,&#xD;
      post-intervention evaluations were sought from both MI and GI subjects. There was no&#xD;
      financial incentive offered for completion of the HELP form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement The primary outcome of interest was the completion of a legally valid advance&#xD;
      directive, the HELP document, which was measured by inspection of HELP documents as well as&#xD;
      self-report. Secondary outcomes include knowledge, attitude, and behavior variables measured&#xD;
      through a questionnaire administered at baseline and at follow-up. Demographic information,&#xD;
      including education and living situations, was also collected at baseline.&#xD;
