  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are a major concern for the geriatric population and represent a significant public&#xD;
      health problem. Various interventions are being explored to improve balance and decrease&#xD;
      falls in the elderly. Success has been shown in some programs; various exercise interventions&#xD;
      place emphasis on strength, balance, or endurance exercises. Results reported in the&#xD;
      literature are still equivocal. Controversy exists as to optimal types of exercise, and the&#xD;
      optimum frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise. It is believed that the SpineForce&#xD;
      device, which places a unique combination of strength and balance demands upon the user, can&#xD;
      result in rapid increases in balance as compared to other rehabilitation programs. Gains in&#xD;
      balance have implications for geriatric populations as well as those seeking enhanced sports&#xD;
      performance and injury prevention. The Purpose of this study is to assess the SpineForce&#xD;
      device as a novel intervention in the treatment of balance disorders.&#xD;
