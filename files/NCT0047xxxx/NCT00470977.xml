  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravitreal&#xD;
      injections of ranibizumab in the treatment of AMD variants and other choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization (CNV) related conditions (Coats' disease, idiopathic perifoveal&#xD;
      telangiectasia, retinal angiomatous proliferation, polypoidal vasculopathy, pseudoxanthoma&#xD;
      elasticum, pathological myopia, multi-focal choroiditis, rubeosis iridis) using the incidence&#xD;
      and severity of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited forms of treatment are available that limit the loss of visual acuity. However, the&#xD;
      patients may not have any substantial improvement in acuity or function. Therefore there&#xD;
      remains a significant unmet need for therapeutic options managing the neovascularization and&#xD;
      its consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lucentis (ranibizumab) injection will be considered as an attempt to control the growth of&#xD;
      the abnormal vessels because of evidence suggesting that angiogenic factors, such as vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), play a role in the pathogenesis of neovascular non-AMD&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the study design is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 0.5 mg dose of Lucentis (ranibizumab), a commercially available preparation that is Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and labeled for intravitreal injection use for&#xD;
      neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In AMD variants and other CNV related conditions, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#xD;
      plays a role in the pathogenesis as in neovascular AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab delivers maximal concentration of the antibody fragment&#xD;
      to the vitreous cavity with minimal systemic exposure. The dosing schedule, based on&#xD;
      considerations of the half-life and the clinical response in patients with neovascularization&#xD;
      suggests that a 1-month interval is optimal.&#xD;
