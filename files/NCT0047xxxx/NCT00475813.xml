      Study compares the efficacy and safety of FLUTIFORM® with Seretide® in the treatment of mild&#xD;
      to moderate persistent asthma in pediatric subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study involving a 12 week treatment phase followed by a 6 month extension phase.&#xD;
      During the treatment phase subjects receive FLUTIFORM® or Seretide®. In the extension phase&#xD;
      all subjects receive FLUTIFORM®. Efficacy will be assessed by lung function tests and asthma&#xD;
      symptoms, sleep disturbance. Safety will be assessed by adverse events, vital signs, lab&#xD;
      tests and ECGs.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients between 4-12 years of age. Female patients must be&#xD;
             pre-menarche to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of mild to moderate reversible asthma for ≥ 6 months prior to the&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate a FEV1 of ≥60% to ≤80% of predicted normal values (Zapletal, 1977) during&#xD;
             the screening phase following appropriate withholding of asthma medications (if&#xD;
             applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No beta agonist use on day of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No use of combination asthma therapy on day of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed on day of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented reversibility of ≥ 15% in FEV1 during the screening phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate satisfactory technique in the use of the pressurized MDI and spacer&#xD;
             device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to enter information in the electronic diary (parental help is&#xD;
             acceptable for young children) and attend all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to substitute study medication for their pre study prescribed asthma&#xD;
             medication for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed parental consent obtained, and where possible informed assent from&#xD;
             the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life-threatening asthma within the past year. This category includes those patients&#xD;
             with a history of near-fatal asthma, a hospitalization or an emergency visit for&#xD;
             asthma or prior intubation for asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of systemic (injectable) corticosteroid medication within 1 month before the&#xD;
             Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of leukotriene receptor antagonist use, e.g. montelukast, within the past&#xD;
             week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current evidence or history of any clinically significant disease or abnormality&#xD;
             including uncontrolled coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or cardiac&#xD;
             dysrhythmia. 'Clinically significant' is defined as any disease that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the Investigator, would put the patient at risk through study participation, or&#xD;
             which would affect the outcome of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An upper or lower respiratory infection within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant, non-reversible, active pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive&#xD;
             pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive status.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have taken B-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine&#xD;
             oxidase inhibitors, astemizole (Hismanal), quinidine type antiarrhythmics, or potent&#xD;
             CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole within the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of medications that will have an effect on bronchospasm and/or pulmonary&#xD;
             function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current evidence or history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to test&#xD;
             medications or components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the Screening Visit (12 weeks if&#xD;
             an oral or injectable steroid).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in a clinical study.&#xD;
