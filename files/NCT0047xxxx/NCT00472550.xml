  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of 20 mg esomeprazole daily for one week on gastric emptying of 500&#xD;
      ml beer, the consecutive blood alcohol levels, the gastroesophageal reflux and plasma levels&#xD;
      of gastrin and CCK in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded manner in 16 healthy&#xD;
      male volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined taking of esomeprazole and beer will inhibit gastric emptying as compared to the&#xD;
      intake of beer alone. This will induce a delay of the ethanol absorption and of the&#xD;
      consecutive blood ethanol concentrations. Gastric acid secretion after beer will be reduced&#xD;
      after esomeprazole treatment. Therefore, gastroesophageal acid reflux will be reduced after&#xD;
      the combined taking. We speculate that gastrin, but not CCK plasma levels, will be increased&#xD;
      after the combined taking as compared to beer alone. Both, beer and PPIs, have stimulatory&#xD;
      effects on gastrin release. However, the secretion of CCK from duodenal CCK-cells is&#xD;
      inhibited when gastric emptying is prolonged.&#xD;

      Sixteen healthy, male and non-smoking volunteers will be enrolled in this study. The subjects&#xD;
      will be treated with placebo or with 20 mg esomeprazole daily for one week before gastric&#xD;
      emptying will be determined. The sequence of the tests (verum or placebo) will be randomised&#xD;
      in a cross over design. In each subject at most one test will be performed every 2 weeks to&#xD;
      ensure one week without treatment (wash-out-phase) between both experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All examinations will be performed in the afternoon. After a small breakfast in the morning&#xD;
      subjects fast for at least 8 hours. During the examination, all subjects are sitting slightly&#xD;
      leaned backwards. A double lumen nasogastric tube (Ch 14, Laboratories Pharmaceutiques Vygon,&#xD;
      Ecouen, France) will be positioned in the most dependent part of the stomach and a pH-probe&#xD;
      (F8/IR blue line, SME Medizintechnik, Weil am Rhein) will be positioned 5 cm above the lower&#xD;
      esophageal sphincter. 500 ml beer will then be instilled into the stomach over 5 min. Gastric&#xD;
      emptying will be determined every 10 min for 2 hours by ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria The trial can be stopped anytime by the volunteer without specified&#xD;
      reasons or by the investigator in case of incompliance of the volunteer or subsequent&#xD;
      incidence of exclusion criteria. In case of hypersensitive or allergic reaction against the&#xD;
      medication or side effects of the medication, such as urtication, angioneurotic edema,&#xD;
      vomiting, cardiovascular reaction (systolic blood pressure under 100 mm/Hg), paraesthesia,&#xD;
      confusion, bronchial spasm or fever, the study will also be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of withdrawal of volunteers, up to four additional volunteers can be recruited to&#xD;
      complete totalling 16 volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of safety Esomeprazole is a frequently administered drug in the therapy of&#xD;
      particularly gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis and gastric or duodenal ulcers. Side&#xD;
      effects are very rare, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, bloating, nausea, vomiting and&#xD;
      constipation are thereof the most frequent. The methods used in this study are clinical&#xD;
      routine procedures and imply -if used by skilful physicians as in this study - no risk for&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect side effects or complications the investigator is present in the examination room&#xD;
      during the whole study and blood pressure and heart rate are measured every 15 minutes.&#xD;
      Before the each study and during the introduction procedure a physical examination will be&#xD;
      performed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography Ultrasonography of the antrum and the fundus represents a highly reliable and&#xD;
      reproducible radiation-avoiding method for determination of gastric emptying [11-14]. To&#xD;
      determine gastric emptying of the proximal and distal stomach, we will use a curved array&#xD;
      scanner with a 3.25 MHz ultrasound transducer (Sonoline Sienna®; Siemens, Germany). We&#xD;
      determine emptying of the distal stomach by measuring the cross-sectional area of the antrum&#xD;
      at the level of the superior mesenteric vein and the aorta [12, 13]. The vessels are used to&#xD;
      standardize the position of the scans. This antral area is scanned before, immediately after&#xD;
      intragastrical application of the test solution and every 10 minutes for two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastic emptying of the proximal stomach will be measured immediately after the application&#xD;
      and every 10 min until the fundus is emptied completely using the following ultrasonographic&#xD;
      method: the transducer will be positioned in the epigastrium at the left subcostal margin and&#xD;
      tilted cranially. The maximal angle of view of the scanner is used to visualize as much of&#xD;
      the proximal stomach as possible. Two standardized sonographic image sections are chosen:&#xD;
      First, a sagital section with the left renal pelvis in a longitudinal projection, the left&#xD;
      lobe of the liver and the tail of the pancreas as internal landmarks. The transducer is then&#xD;
      rotated 90° clockwise to obtain an oblique frontal section where the left hemidiaphragm, the&#xD;
      top margin of the fundus, and the liver parenchyma serve as landmarks. A proximal gastric&#xD;
      area is outlined in the sagital section by tracing from the top margin of the fundus and 7 cm&#xD;
      downward along the axis of the stomach. The maximal diameter in the oblique frontal section,&#xD;
      kept within 7 cm along the axis of the proximal stomach, is chosen as the second measure.&#xD;
      Both measurements are combined to estimate an approximate volume of the fundus [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inner echogenic layer corresponding to the interface between the gastric content and the&#xD;
      mucosa of the gastric wall is outlined. The measurements were repeated twice and the mean&#xD;
      value is used. The areas of the antrum and the fundus and the diameter of the fundus are&#xD;
      traced by the internal calliper provided with the ultrasound instrument. All ultrasonographic&#xD;
      parameters will be measured twice, the mean of both measurements will be chosen to be&#xD;
      representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric half emptying time (t(1/2)) will determined separately for the fundus and the antrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma gastrin, plasma CCK and serum ethanol concentrations Blood samples (10 ml) will be&#xD;
      drawn at baseline and every 15 min after application of the test solution for 2 hours for the&#xD;
      determination of serum ethanol concentrations. Samples will be centrifuged immediately at 4°&#xD;
      C. The serum concentration of ethanol will be determined using the alcohol-dehydrogenase&#xD;
      method (Ethylalkohol, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The plasma concentrations&#xD;
      of gastrin will be measured by the Institute for Clinical Chemistry at the University&#xD;
      Hospital Mannheim by radioimmunassays (RIA) and that of CCK at the Universityhospital Basel&#xD;
      (Professor Ch. Beglinger, no round robin test certificate available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastroesophageal reflux The intraesophageal pH (5 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter)&#xD;
      will be recorded for 4 hours by GastroScan II (SME Medizintechnik, Sprendlingen). The correct&#xD;
      position of the tip of the pH-probe will be measured by pH-metry during the visit for the&#xD;
      screening examinations. The portion of intraesophageal pH&lt;4 and the DeMeester-Score&#xD;
      (frequency and duration of pH&lt;4) will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal complaints The volunteers mark additionally on a visual analogue scale (VAS&#xD;
      0-100) their intensity of fullness, bloating, heartburn and satiety before the ingestion of&#xD;
      beer and than in 10 min intervals for 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical significances for differences between gastric emptying&#xD;
      rates, blood alcohol concentrations and gastroesophageal reflux will be determined using&#xD;
      student´s t-test.&#xD;
