  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness for individuals over&#xD;
      fifty-five years of age that live in the industrialized world. It affects 5-10 million people&#xD;
      in the US and as many as 30 million worldwide. There are two forms of the disease, both of&#xD;
      which cause a loss of central vision. Approximately eighty-five percent of patients have the&#xD;
      less severe dry form that produces gradual but rarely complete vision loss. The remaining&#xD;
      fifteen percent have the severe wet, or exudative, form that causes rapid, disabling&#xD;
      blindness. Wet AMD is further characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a growth&#xD;
      under the macula of abnormal blood vessels originating from the choroidal capillary bed.&#xD;
      Research has linked chronic inflammation to both forms of AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only recently, unrestrained complement activation was identified in genetic studies to be one&#xD;
      of the key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AMD. It has also been demonstrated that&#xD;
      complement activation plays a crucial role in the development of CNV. Therefore, the use of&#xD;
      intravitreal complement inhibitors may be beneficial in participants subjects with&#xD;
      neovascular AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, uncontrolled, non-randomized, dose-escalating, pilot Phase I study will&#xD;
      provide initial safety and tolerability information on intravitreal complement inhibitor&#xD;
      (POT-4) therapy in AMD patients with subfoveal CNV.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understand and sign the IRB-approved informed consent document for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the study eye, diagnosis of exudative AMD defined by the presence of drusen larger&#xD;
             than 63 μm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the study eye, the presence of a choroidal neovascular lesion, either predominantly&#xD;
             or minimally classic or occult with no classic in nature, determined by the Digital&#xD;
             Angiography Reading Center (DARC) with the CNV defined by its fluorescein angiographic&#xD;
             (FA) features.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The lesion must contain some visible active CNV, but the active CNV need not be under&#xD;
             the fovea itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visual acuity of 20/60 or worse in the study eye as measured on an ETDRS chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Retinal photographs and angiography of sufficient quality, allowing assessment of the&#xD;
             macular area according to standard clinical practice, can be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Choroidal neovascularization in the study eye associated with other ocular diseases&#xD;
             such as pathologic myopia, ocular histoplasmosis or posterior uveitis, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Decreased vision, in the study eye, due to retinal disease not attributable to CNV,&#xD;
             such as nonexudative forms of AMD, geographic atrophy, inherited retinal dystrophy,&#xD;
             uveitis or epiretinal membrane, a vitelliform-like lesion of the outer retina (e.g.,&#xD;
             as in pattern dystrophies or basal laminar drusen), idiopathic parafoveal&#xD;
             telangiectasis, or central serous retinopathy. Participants who have any additional&#xD;
