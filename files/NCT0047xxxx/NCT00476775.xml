    <textblock>
      We propose a 2-arm, parallel group, randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of an&#xD;
      after school ethnic dance program plus a culturally-tailored, home-based screen time&#xD;
      reduction intervention to reduce weight gain (body mass index) among lower socioeconomic&#xD;
      status, pre-adolescent Latina girls. The control group will receive an &quot;active-placebo&quot;&#xD;
      information-based health education intervention. A total of 240 7-9 year old girls will be&#xD;
      randomized to the two conditions, and both interventions will last for the full 2-year period&#xD;
      of the study for each girl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Latina girls are at increased risk of obesity and obesity-related morbidities. However,&#xD;
      effective and generalizable obesity prevention programs for this rapidly growing population&#xD;
      are not available. After school ethnic dance programs are highly motivating, and an&#xD;
      innovative approach to providing a large &quot;dose&quot; of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for&#xD;
      Latina girls. After school programs may also indirectly reduce sedentary behavior and improve&#xD;
      diet. Dance is fun for pre-adolescent girls, it plays an important social and cultural role&#xD;
      in Latino communities, and after school dance classes are a potentially generalizable&#xD;
      &quot;environmental&quot; intervention strategy. Our past pilot studies and ongoing trials of ethnic&#xD;
      dance interventions demonstrate that (1) dance is a highly attractive and feasible form of&#xD;
      activity for pre-adolescent girls and (2) a dance intervention can result in reduced weight&#xD;
      gain (BMI) and increased fitness among girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Latina girls are also heavy consumers of screen-based media, television, videotapes/DVDs and&#xD;
      video games. Excessive screen time is considered one of the most modifiable causes of&#xD;
      childhood obesity. We propose a culturally-tailored, home-based screen time reduction&#xD;
      intervention, delivered by bilingual, Latina, Community Health Advisors (CHAs). Our prior and&#xD;
      ongoing studies demonstrate the feasibility and potential efficacy of (1) reducing children's&#xD;
      screen time to reduce weight gain and (2) providing home-based behavior change interventions&#xD;
      to low-income Latino families using CHAs. All interventions will be further developed,&#xD;
      revised, and pilot-tested with Latina girls and their families through formative research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      240 girls Latina girls will be recruited over 18 months from six public elementary schools&#xD;
      serving low-income Latino communities in northern CA. Measures will be collected in girls'&#xD;
      homes at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, including height and weight, waist circumference,&#xD;
      triceps skinfold thickness, blood pressure and resting heart rate, physical activity&#xD;
      monitoring by accelerometry, media use, 24-hour dietary recalls, weight concerns, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, school performance, sexual maturation, and demographics. Body Mass Index (BMI) is&#xD;
      the primary outcome measure. The primary outcome analysis will compare individual&#xD;
      trajectories of change in BMI in the treatment and control groups over the entire two-year&#xD;
      course of the trial, using random regression models. The study is powered (90%) to detect a&#xD;
      clinically-significant effect. Specific Aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the efficacy of a combined, after school ethnic dance and home-based screen time&#xD;
           reduction intervention to reduce weight gain (BMI) over 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary hypothesis: Compared to controls, girls in the treatment group will&#xD;
           significantly reduce their weight gain (BMI) over the two-year study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the effects of a combined, after school ethnic dance and home-based screen time&#xD;
           reduction intervention on secondary outcomes over two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary hypotheses: Compared to controls, girls in the treatment group will&#xD;
           significantly reduce their waist circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, systolic and&#xD;
           diastolic resting blood pressures, resting heart rate, television, videotape/DVD and&#xD;
           video game use, meals eaten with TV, daily dietary energy intake, percent of energy from&#xD;
           fat, weight concerns and depressive symptoms, and significantly increase their daily&#xD;
           physical activity, daily moderate to vigorous physical activity, liking for physical&#xD;
           activity, and school performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate potential demographic, cultural, psychological, and biological moderators&#xD;
           and mediators of intervention effects on BMI and secondary outcomes, to evaluate&#xD;
           correlates and risk factors for change in BMI and secondary outcomes, and to evaluate&#xD;
           intervention delivery variables and their relationships to outcomes.&#xD;
