      The propouse of this study is to evaluate some combined preventive measures, of easy&#xD;
      application in children under 6 years old as education, brush teeth, fluoride free tooth&#xD;
      paste,fluoridated tooth paste, professional cleaning and fluoride varnish application, to&#xD;
      determine between three groups of differents combined preventive measures, wich one is better&#xD;
      in reduting dental caries appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ho: Dental caries reduction percentage is larger or equal in the group with only&#xD;
           prevention education and Professional cleaning, than in the groups intercepted with&#xD;
           fluoride varnish or fluoride toothpaste.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ha: Dental caries reduction percentage is less in the group with only prevention&#xD;
           education and Professional cleaning, than in the groups intercepted with fluoride&#xD;
           varnish or fluoride toothpaste.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is a public health problem in any society. Even though caries prevalence has&#xD;
      decreased in many industrialized countries, dental caries in the early infancy still has high&#xD;
      prevalence in non developing countries. In Colombia as well Medellín, there are not data of&#xD;
      dental caries prevalence in children under 5 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fact that the official studies do not recognize this world tendency and are limited to&#xD;
      age groups over 5 years old, underestimate the disease as an early appearing process in life,&#xD;
      specially in underprivileged groups. When dental caries is not properly treated, it becomes a&#xD;
      risk factor for other systemic and infectious diseases. Early infant dental caries has been&#xD;
      strongly related with malnutrition in children under 6 years old; is has been proved that&#xD;
      once their dental problem is treated, weight and size are recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and implementation of prevention programs for preschool children must be a&#xD;
      priority.This study pretends evaluate some combined preventive measures of easy application&#xD;
      in children under 6 as education, brush teeth, fluoride free and fluoridated tooth paste,&#xD;
      professional cleaning and fluoride varnish application considering this an easy application&#xD;
      measure for this group of age, which eventually it could be more cost-effective than the&#xD;
      sealant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of doing new clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of fluoride varnishes&#xD;
      combined with other preventive measures, is supported in most of other studies have used a&#xD;
      non treated group or placebo as a control group.12 The evaluation of the non fluoride&#xD;
      toothpaste will give us an exact idea of the contribution of each of the preventive measures&#xD;
      in dental caries reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Colombia, there is not doubt that past preventive programs had a positive effect in dental&#xD;
      health of school children. However, preschool children have been out of these programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New programs should be carried on to educational establishment and infant care centres&#xD;
      without distinction of the type of social health insurance or coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study pretends to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutics measures like fluoride varnish&#xD;
      application and professional cleaning, which are characterized for their low cost and easy&#xD;
      application. In the first place, parents and children in the study will receive education&#xD;
      lecture, they will be provided with tooth brush and toothpaste with or without fluoride&#xD;
      depending the group assigned. At the same time the study pretends to generate knowledge that&#xD;
      contributes to minimize invasive and painful treatments in this group of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What effect has the inclusion of fluoride varnish and 500 ppm fluoridated toothpaste as&#xD;
      preventive measures complementary to oral health education and professional tooth cleaning in&#xD;
      reduction of dental caries in children under 5 years old?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons and Study group design: three groups will be randomly assigned to an experimental&#xD;
      group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group A: Dental health education with brush and 500 PPM fluoride tooth paste; with&#xD;
           professional cleaning each 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group B: Dental health education with brush and non fluoride tooth paste; with&#xD;
           professional cleaning each 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group C: Dental health education with brush and non fluoride tooth paste; with&#xD;
           professional cleaning each 6 months and topical fluoride varnish application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a random controlled double blind assay made in children with primary&#xD;
      dentition and 2.5 or 3.5 years old at the beginning, from socio-economic status 2 and 3 that&#xD;
      are attended in Su Salud IPS ( Service lender institution) at the Metropolitan area of&#xD;
      Medellín city with 3 years follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second part of the study pretends to measure presence of dental fluorosis in the permanent&#xD;
      dentition of the children that took part in the first assay. This proposal will be designed&#xD;
      in that moment.&#xD;
