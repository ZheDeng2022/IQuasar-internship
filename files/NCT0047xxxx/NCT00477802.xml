  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether intramuscular injections of&#xD;
      botulinum toxin type A (Botox®) in selected cervical muscles at antidystonic dosages can&#xD;
      reduce levodopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesias (LID) in the cervical region in adult patients&#xD;
      with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. It is hypothesized that the intramuscular injection of&#xD;
      antidystonic doses of botulinum toxin into cervical muscles will decrease the duration and&#xD;
      severity of LID in the cervical region in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;

      The study will follow a cross-over design to maximize statistical power and decrease biases&#xD;
      inherent to small samples as patients will become their own controls. After a baseline&#xD;
      assessment, patients will be randomized to receive either botulinum toxin or an equal amount&#xD;
      and distribution of normal saline (placebo). Patients will undergo reassessment of function&#xD;
      at one and four weeks after the initial and second session of injections. The second&#xD;
      procedure will occur, using the opposite treatment arm (Botox® or saline placebo), three&#xD;
      months after the first injection session. Doses of levodopa, dopaminergic agonists, and&#xD;
      antidyskinetic drugs if applicable, will be kept constant throughout the study. All study&#xD;
      assessments will be carried out at the time treatment is expected to cause the greatest&#xD;
      severity of LID.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have idiopathic PD (by standard clinical criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have persistence of LID despite optimization of anti-Parkinsonian&#xD;
             medication (duration of LID &gt; 1 [duration of at least 1-25% of the waking time] on&#xD;
             item 32 of the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have severity of LID &gt; 1 [mildly disabling] on item 33 of the UPDRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have a Mini-Mental State score of &gt; 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be willing and able to give consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are older than 75 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have a Parkinsonian syndrome that is unresponsive or weakly responsive to&#xD;
             levodopa (improvement &lt; 30%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who require concurrent use of warfarin or other anticoagulating agents.&#xD;
&#xD;

             evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known allergy or sensitivity to any of the components in the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Concurrent participation in another investigational drug or device study or&#xD;
             participation in the 30 days immediately prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any medical condition that may put the subject at an increased risk with exposure to&#xD;
             Botox including diagnosed myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, amyotrophic&#xD;
             lateral sclerosis, or any other disorder that might interfere with neuromuscular&#xD;
             function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Evidence of recent alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Infection or skin disorder at an anticipated injection site (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any condition or situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put the subject at&#xD;
             significant risk, confound the study results, or interfere significantly with the&#xD;
             subject's participation in the study.&#xD;
