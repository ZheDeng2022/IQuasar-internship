      The primary objective is to assess the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel administered&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of intraperitoneal hyperthermic docetaxel given at the time of second&#xD;
      look surgery following front-line normothermic intraperitoneal and intravenous&#xD;
      cisplatin/paclitaxel for patients with stage II and III ovarian carcinoma. The primary&#xD;
      objectives are to assess the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel administered&#xD;
      intraperitoneally with heat at this time and assess the toxicity and morbidity associated&#xD;
      with this treatment. Eligible patients will have had a complete clinical response to&#xD;
      front-line therapy.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had a complete clinical response (negative clinical examination,&#xD;
             CA125 and CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis) to front-line therapy for stage II/III&#xD;
             ovarian, primary peritoneal or Fallopian tube carcinoma. This will have included&#xD;
             initial surgery followed by combined IV/IP chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
             Patients must have had a minimum of three courses of IP therapy with both paclitaxel&#xD;
             and cisplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second surgery to be performed no more than 3 months from last course of initial&#xD;
             chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than 18 years and negative pregnancy if has child-bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  GOG performance status less than 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically fit for surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined in the protocol hepatic&#xD;
             function Total Bilirubin ULN AST and ALT and Alkaline Phosphatase must be within the&#xD;
             range allowing for eligibility. In determining eligibility the more abnormal of the&#xD;
             two values AST or ALT) should be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of docetaxel on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because taxanes are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have completed front-line therapy for ovarian cancer more than 3 months&#xD;
             prior to HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with stage IV disease including previous parenchymal liver disease, brain&#xD;
             metastasis or cytologically-confirmed chest metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to TaxotereÂ® or other&#xD;
             drugs formulated with polysorbate 80. History of allergic reactions attributed to&#xD;
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition used in this study in addition&#xD;
             to Taxotere.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than grade 2 peripheral neuropathy from prior chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, breast-feeding or known to be HIV positive&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or other conditions that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements should be excluded.&#xD;
