      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as ticilimumab (CP-675,206), can block tumor growth in&#xD;
      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor&#xD;
      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well ticilimumab (CP-675,206) works in treating&#xD;
      patients with stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the change in melanoma intratumoral infiltrates by cluster of differentiation&#xD;
           8 (CD8 positive) cytotoxic T lymphocytes in patients with stage IIIC or IV melanoma&#xD;
           treated with ticilimumab (CP-675,206).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effects of this drug on intratumoral immune effector cells and tumor cells&#xD;
           in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effects of this drug on circulating immune effector cells in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the gene expression profile of immune effector cells and tumor cells in&#xD;
           regressing and nonregressing tumors in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bank plasma from peripheral blood obtained from patients with regressing and&#xD;
           nonregressing tumors for future exploratory analysis of proteomic profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess additional evidence of antitumor activity of this drug, as measured by best&#xD;
           on-study response rate, in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the safety profile and tolerability of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain pharmacokinetic data to be used in a future meta-analysis of this drug's&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether the CTLA4 genotype influences the safety, immune response, and/or&#xD;
           efficacy of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the relationships between clinical response (i.e., efficacy or toxicity) and&#xD;
           tumor and/or blood ex vivo analysis in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ticilimumab (CP-675,206) IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      90 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood collection periodically during study for correlative pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK), pharmacogenetic, and pharmacogenomic analyses. Blood specimens are obtained for PK&#xD;
      measurement at baseline and periodically during study treatment for analysis by enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay. Blood specimens are also evaluated by pharmacogenetic assessment of&#xD;
      polymorphisms in CTLA4. Patients also undergo leukapheresis at baseline and at least once&#xD;
      between days 30-60 for biomarker analysis of immune cell activation (i.e.,biomarkers CD45RO,&#xD;
      CD45RA, HLA-DR, CCR5, CCR7, CD62L, CD69); Treg phenotype (i.e., CD4/CD25/GITR/intracellular&#xD;
      FoxP3); and Treg function. In HLA-A2.1 positive patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (PBMC) are analyzed for antigen-specific immune reactivity by MART-1, gp100, and tyrosine MHC&#xD;
      tetramer using enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. Plasma obtained during leukapheresis&#xD;
      is assessed for levels of circulating cytokines and chemokines. Some plasma is stored for&#xD;
      future proteomic profile analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients also undergo excisional or punch biopsy at baseline and between days 30-60 during&#xD;
      course 1. Tumor tissue samples embedded in paraffin are analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin and&#xD;
      immunohistochemical staining for several biomarkers, including biomarkers of immune cell&#xD;
      response (i.e., cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), and&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) and biomarkers of melanoma (i.e., S-100, MART-1, and/or&#xD;
      HMB45). Frozen tumor tissue samples are analyzed by gene chips and gene arrays for gene&#xD;
      expression profile and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for FoxP3. Minced&#xD;
      tumor tissue samples are analyzed by flow cytometry in nonadherent cells for HLA-DR (if&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are available) and by Braf sequencing in adherent cells (if&#xD;
      melanoma cells are available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Tumor Infiltration by Cluster of Differentiation 8 (CD8) Positive Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes</measure>
    <time_frame>pre treatment - post treatment at 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor infiltration of cluster of differentiation 4 and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD4+ and CD8+) cells (intratumoral and peritumoral) was assessed by immunohistochemistry of tumor tissue obtained through biopsy before and after administration of tremelimumab. Up to 10 randomly selected fields per sample were analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Change in Intratumoral Expression of the Proteins HLA-DR, CD45RO, Ki67 and FOXP3 and FOXP3&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>pre treatment - post treatment at 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>HLA-DR is a surface marker of T cell activation after exposure to CTLA4 blocking antibodies. CD45RO is a maker of prior cognate antigen-exposed T cells. Together they mark cells with a surface phenotype of T effector or T effector memory cells. Ki67 is a marker of cell proliferation. The protein FOXP3 is involved in the regulation of the development and function of regulatory T cells, and serves as a marker of this cell type. Intratumoral expression of HLA-DR, CD45RO, Ki67 and FOXP3 was assessed by immunohistochemistry of tumor tissue obtained through biopsy before and after administration of tremelimumab.</description>

    <description>T cell receptor (TCR) usage was analyzed in genomic DNA from peripheral blood from patients before and after treatment with tremelimumab. High-throughput deep sequencing of the TCR Vβ CDR3 (Complementarity - determining region 3) region was analyzed to better characterize the expansion and clonality of the T cell repertoire.&#xD;
The frequency of circulating invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) cell subsets were also characterized by flow cytometry in peripheral blood samples pre- and post-treatment. iNKT cells regulate the balance of Th1/Th2 immune responses.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the Protein Content in Peripheral Blood With an Increase in Proinflammatory Cytokines and Chemokines</measure>
    <time_frame>pre treatment - post treatment at 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Th17 cells are CD4+ cells that are potent inducers of tissue inflammation and autoimmunity. The levels of this T cell subset were assessed in peripheral blood from patients before and after administration of tremelimumab. Th17 cells were assessed since the major dose limiting toxicities are inflammatory and autoimmune in nature.&#xD;
In addition, the phosphorylation of signaling molecules downstream of the TCR and cytokine receptors was evaluated in peripheral blood cells from patients before and after treatment with tremelimumab using intracellular flow cytometry.&#xD;

        <description>HLA-DR is a surface marker of T cell activation after exposure to CTLA4 blocking antibodies. CD45RO is a maker of prior cognate antigen-exposed T cells. Together they mark cells with a surface phenotype of T effector or T effector memory cells. Ki67 is a marker of cell proliferation. The protein FOXP3 is involved in the regulation of the development and function of regulatory T cells, and serves as a marker of this cell type. Intratumoral expression of HLA-DR, CD45RO, Ki67 and FOXP3 was assessed by immunohistochemistry of tumor tissue obtained through biopsy before and after administration of tremelimumab.</description>

        <description>Th17 cells are CD4+ cells that are potent inducers of tissue inflammation and autoimmunity. The levels of this T cell subset were assessed in peripheral blood from patients before and after administration of tremelimumab. Th17 cells were assessed since the major dose limiting toxicities are inflammatory and autoimmune in nature.&#xD;
In addition, the phosphorylation of signaling molecules downstream of the TCR and cytokine receptors was evaluated in peripheral blood cells from patients before and after treatment with tremelimumab using intracellular flow cytometry.&#xD;
