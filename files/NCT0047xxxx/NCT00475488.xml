      Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)Surgery is commonly used to treat patients with coronary&#xD;
      artery disease (atherosclerosis) for the relief of angina (chest pain) and improve heart&#xD;
      muscle function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy veins or arteries, referred to as 'conduits' from elsewhere in the patient's body,&#xD;
      are grafted (attached) from the aorta to the coronary arteries, bypassing (via new routes)&#xD;
      coronary artery narrowings caused by atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and thereby&#xD;
      improving the blood supply to the myocardium (heart muscle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the years, a range of different veins and arteries from around the body have been used&#xD;
      to bypass diseased coronary arteries. Typically, internal thoracic arteries from behind the&#xD;
      breastbone and the saphenous veins from the legs are used for bypass. More recently, radial&#xD;
      arteries from the forearm have also been used to bypass coronary arteries that are diseased&#xD;
      (atherosclerotic). There is strong evidence to indicate that the left internal thoracic&#xD;
      artery stays open the longest (i.e. has the highest patency) and achieves the best health&#xD;
      outcomes. As a result, most cardiac surgeons use the left internal thoracic artery as their&#xD;
      first choice of conduit (vessel used to bypass the blocked artery). However, many patients&#xD;
      require multiple grafts and there is little evidence as to which grafts are the best conduits&#xD;
      to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that the radial arteries might function better than saphenous veins as&#xD;
      conduits. The Radial Artery Patency and Clinical Outcomes Trial(RAPCO) aims to compare&#xD;
      patency of the radial arteries with the right internal thoracic artery and also with the&#xD;
      saphenous vein.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Department of Cardiac Surgery at Austin Health is conducting a prospective randomised&#xD;
      trial, stratified into two separate sub-studies. The first compares the radial artery with&#xD;
      the right internal thoracic artery(as a free aorto-coronary graft) and the second comparies&#xD;
      the radial artery with a saphenous vein graft. Each patient was to be followed for 10 years&#xD;
      after their CABG surgery in order to assess both the pattern of graft survival over 10 years&#xD;
      and also to record major clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was first given approval by the Austin Health Human Research Ethics Committee on&#xD;
      August 18th,1995. Enrolment commenced in June 1996. Recruitment ceased in March 2005.&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to the control or experimental group, patients in both groups&#xD;
      received the left internal thoracic artery to the left anterior decending(LAD) and the study&#xD;
      graft as the second graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard measure for the comparison of conduits is through the use of post-operative&#xD;
      angiograms. These angiograms assess how patent (open) the grafts are, and also offer quality&#xD;
      assurance of the CABG surgery performed. To spread the graft patency end-points over the 10&#xD;
      years after CABG, patients undergo a second randomisation as to the time at which their graft&#xD;
      patency is to be assessed. The timing of the graft study coronary angiogram is weighted&#xD;
      towards the end of the 10 year period with the aim of having 10% at 1 year, 20% at 2 years,&#xD;
      20% at 5 years, 30% at 7.5 years and 30% at 10 years after CABG surgery. Clinical data is&#xD;
      systematically collected to determine those patients who experience heart attack, repeat&#xD;
      surgery, balloon angioplasty or death over subsequent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enrich the number of mid-study graft patency end-points a protocol amendment(July 19th,&#xD;
      2002) was approved allowing patients to be offered a selective coronary angiogram at the 5&#xD;
      year anniversary of their surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further protocol amendment(November 16th, 2006) allowed coronary and graft CT angiography&#xD;
      to be used optionally to replace selective angiography and also to offer all patients imaging&#xD;
      at 10 years, in addition to the original pre-specified, randomised time of imaging.&#xD;
