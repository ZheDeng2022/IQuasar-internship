  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the selective destruction of abnormal cells through light&#xD;
      activation of a photosensitiser in the presence of oxygen. These cells accumulate more&#xD;
      photosensitiser than normal cells. The photosensitiser generates reactive oxygen species upon&#xD;
      illumination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For skin diseases, there has been an increasing interest in using precursors of the&#xD;
      endogenous photosensitiser protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). The most commonly used precursors have&#xD;
      been 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its derivatives. The present test drug, Metvix®,&#xD;
      contains the methyl ester of ALA, which penetrates the lesions well and shows high lesion&#xD;
      selectivity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro studies of animal and human tissues have shown significant intracellular formation&#xD;
      of photoactive porphyrins after addition of Metvix®. The increased levels of photoactive&#xD;
      porphyrins induced cytotoxic effects in tumour cells after photoactivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare PDT with Metvix® cream to PDT with placebo cream in terms&#xD;
      of patient complete response rates based on histologically verified disappearance of the&#xD;
      lesions at 6 months after last treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to compare the two treatments in terms of histological and clinical&#xD;
      mean patient response weighted by the number of lesions within a patient, lesion response&#xD;
      rates across patients, clinical complete patient response, cosmetic outcome and adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;

      A patient will be randomised to PDT with Metvix® cream or PDT with placebo cream. All&#xD;
      eligible BCC lesions within a patient will get the same treatment. All patients will get two&#xD;
      consecutive treatments one week apart. At the 3-months follow-up visit, lesions with no&#xD;
      clinical response or progression will be surgically excised. Lesions with partial response&#xD;
      (50% or greater reduction on lesion area) will be re-treated, if they do not show complete&#xD;
      response three months later they will be surgical excised. Lesions with complete response&#xD;
      will be surgically excised 6 months after the first or second PDT cycle. All excised tissue&#xD;
      specimens will be histological examined.&#xD;
