  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label Phase II study evaluating the activity of Lenalidomide in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the results of primary therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma are generally excellent, between&#xD;
      10-20% of patients with advanced stage disease will not enter a complete remission (CR) and&#xD;
      between 20-30% of patients will relapse after completion of treatment. Salvage chemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has become&#xD;
      the treatment of choice in patients with relapsed or initially chemotherapy-refractory&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although high dose chemotherapy remains a curative option for the treatment of relapsed or&#xD;
      chemotherapy-refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma, up to 50% of patients will ultimately recur&#xD;
      post-stem cell transplant and will require further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thalidomide is an agent that has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      properties. Thalidomide has been shown to have activity in a number of solid and hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies, and has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. A dose escalation study of single-agent thalidomide has been performed in heavily&#xD;
      pre-treated patients in which two Hodgkin's patients were enrolled and did not respond to&#xD;
      treatment. Based on the NCI experience with vinblastine, we initiated a phase II trial&#xD;
      examining the combination of thalidomide and vinblastine in patients who were being treated&#xD;
      palliatively for Hodgkin's lymphoma. In a heavily pre-treated group of patients (70% of cases&#xD;
      having relapsed post-ASCT), a response rate of 40% to the combination was noted with median&#xD;
      duration of response of over nine months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) is a thalidomide derivative and the first-in-class novel&#xD;
      immunomodulatory agent that has more potent activity as well as a more favourable toxicity&#xD;
      profile than the parent compound. Based on the alterations demonstrated in various cytokines&#xD;
      and angiogenic markers in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, we feel that Lenalidomide's&#xD;
      immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic effects make this an ideal drug to study in this&#xD;
      lymphoma. This will be the first study to assess Lenalidomide in patients with Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma.This is a single arm, open-label phase II multi-centre study evaluating the single&#xD;
      agent activity of Lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is objective response rate (CR + CRu + PR) as determined by International Workshop&#xD;
      Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial treatment will consist of lenalidomide 25 mg PO daily given for 21 consecutive days&#xD;
      (days 1 - 21), with seven days off on a 28 day cycle.Patients with PR, CR or CRu, may&#xD;
      continue on therapy for 2 cycles past best response.Patients with PD at any time or those&#xD;
      with evidence of SD after cycle 4 of monotherapy will be eligible to receive treatment with&#xD;
      dexamethasone 40 mg PO daily on days 1 - 4 and 15 - 18 of a 28 day cycle while continuing&#xD;
      protocol treatment if they continue to meet the criteria of continuation on therapy.&#xD;
