      This study compared two different methods of restoring blood flow to the heart when there has&#xD;
      been a narrowing or blockage in the blood vessels that supply the heart. Currently there are&#xD;
      two different ways of restoring blood flow. One is heart surgery where a surgeon operates&#xD;
      directly on the heart, through an incision in the breast bone (sternum) and takes segments of&#xD;
      the patient's (non-essential) veins or arteries and then uses these to bypass blocked or&#xD;
      narrowed segments in the coronary arteries. This way additional blood can be &quot;piped&quot; into the&#xD;
      heart muscle wall. The second method is coronary angioplasty with stent implantation.&#xD;
      Coronary angioplasty is a non-surgical method performed under a local anaesthetic. During&#xD;
      angioplasty a special balloon is advanced to the site of a coronary narrowing, then inflated&#xD;
      to make it expand and this action removes the narrowing. This is a more simple and less&#xD;
      invasive than surgery but its value has been limited by a tendency for narrowings to&#xD;
      reoccur(restenosis) in the six months following the treatment. When this happens a repeat&#xD;
      procedure is often performed. To reduce the incidence of restenosis coronary stents are&#xD;
      implanted. These are tubular metal scaffold devices that are placed inside a coronary artery&#xD;
      at the site of a previous narrowing to help keep the artery open. These devices are usually&#xD;
      delivered on an angioplasty balloon and expanded into place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatments are equally effective at preventing death and subsequent myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and most doctors are happy to recommend either option. Angioplasty offers a more&#xD;
      simple initial procedure but with a chance of needing a repeat performance. Bypass surgery&#xD;
      represents a more significant initial undertaking with a longer recovery and convalescent&#xD;
      period but in most cases, provides good relief of symptoms. Patient preference plays an&#xD;
      important part in the decision process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bypass grafting is currently the therapy most frequently performed world-wide. Angioplasty&#xD;
      has a number of important advantages but the need for repeat procedures currently limits its&#xD;
      appeal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since these trials were performed there have been important advances in angioplasty&#xD;
      techniques. Prominent amongst these has been the development and use of Coronary Stents which&#xD;
      has been shown (in clinical trials) to reduce the need for repeat procedures after an initial&#xD;
      angioplasty. Consequently stent implantation is now in routine use world wide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If angioplasty is performed with coronary stent implantation then this may reduce the need&#xD;
      for repeat procedures and address the principal factor currently limiting the value of this&#xD;
      approach. If the results were found to be as good as with bypass grafting then patients could&#xD;
      benefit from a shorter hospital stay, a less traumatic operation and a shorter recovery&#xD;
      period. We therefore wish to compare the outcomes in patients treated with a) bypass grafting&#xD;
      or b) angioplasty with coronary stent implantation.&#xD;
