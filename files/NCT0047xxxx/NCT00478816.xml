             consent form after having received a detailed explanation of the study protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In good health as determined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. medical history,&#xD;
&#xD;

               3. clinical judgment of the Investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;

             vaccine;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to understand and comply with all study procedures and to complete study diaries,&#xD;
             can be contacted, and will be available for study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Receipt of another investigational agent within 4 weeks, or before completion of the&#xD;
             safety follow-up period in another study, whichever is longer, prior to enrollment and&#xD;
             unwilling to refuse participation in another clinical study through the end of the&#xD;
             study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who experienced any acute disease or infection requiring systemic antibiotic&#xD;
             or antiviral therapy (chronic antibiotic therapy for urinary tract prophylaxis is&#xD;
             acceptable) within the past 7 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who experienced fever (defined as axillary temperature ≥38.0°C) within 3 days&#xD;
             prior to Visit 1;&#xD;

             condom with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide), intrauterine device (e.g., IUD),&#xD;
             or monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for 6&#xD;

             following administration of any vaccine;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with known or suspected impairment/alteration of immune function, for&#xD;
             example, resulting from:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. receipt of immunosuppressive therapy (any corticosteroid therapy or cancer&#xD;
                  chemotherapy),&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. receipt of immunostimulants,&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. receipt of parenteral immunoglobulin preparation, blood products, and/or plasma&#xD;
                  derivatives within 3 months prior to Visit 1 or planned during the full length of&#xD;
                  the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. high risk for developing an immunocompromising disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Receipt of another vaccine within 3 weeks prior to Visit 1 or planned vaccination&#xD;
             within 3 weeks following the last study vaccination;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects with a history of (or current) drug or alcohol abuse that in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion would interfere with safety of the subject or the evaluation of&#xD;
             study objectives;&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects with any condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might&#xD;
             interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.&#xD;
