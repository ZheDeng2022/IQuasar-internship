  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to find out how well iron is absorbed when a newly developed form of&#xD;
      ferric pyrophosphate is added to a commercial apple juice drink.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Micronized dispersible ferric pyrophosphate (MDFP) is an iron compound that has been reported&#xD;
      to be highly bioavailable and likely to cause few sensory problems when added to food. It is&#xD;
      therefore a potentially effective iron additive for the food industry and is particularly&#xD;
      formulated for adding to liquids. A randomized cross-over trial will be undertaken to compare&#xD;
      the absorption of iron added to a commercial apple juice drink as MDFP with iron added as&#xD;
      ferrous sulphate. The null hypothesis is that absorption of iron added as MDFP is not&#xD;
      different to absorption from iron added as ferrous sulphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of 16 women (age 18-65) with iron stores at the lower end&#xD;
      of the normal range. This group will efficiently absorb bioavailable iron and will be&#xD;
      sensitive to differences in bioavailability between different forms of iron. Test drinks&#xD;
      containing added iron, labelled with stable isotopes of iron (Fe-57 or Fe-58), will be&#xD;
      consumed on two consecutive days. Iron absorption from the drinks will be determined using&#xD;
      the erythrocyte incorporation technique. A baseline blood sample will be taken prior to&#xD;
      consuming the test drinks and then a second blood sample will be taken 14 days after the last&#xD;
      test drink. Iron absorption will be calculated from the isotopic enrichment of the final&#xD;
      blood sample, assuming that 80% of absorbed iron is incorporated into red blood cells. The&#xD;
      order in which the volunteers will be given the MDFP or ferrous sulphate will be randomised.&#xD;
