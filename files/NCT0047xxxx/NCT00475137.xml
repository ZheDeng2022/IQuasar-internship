  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a medical condition characterized by feeling sad even when good things happen,&#xD;
      having low energy and motivation, and sometimes even experiencing suicidal thoughts. Bipolar&#xD;
      II Disorder is an illness in which periods of depression alternate with periods of abnormally&#xD;
      elevated mood, energy and activity, referred to as hypomania. After Major Depressive&#xD;
      Disorder, Bipolar II Disorder is the most common cause of depression. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      antidepressant medications, used alone, do not work as well in treating Bipolar depression as&#xD;
      they do in treating other kinds of depression. Lamotrigine is a medication which studies show&#xD;
      is effective in treating Bipolar depression. The investigators will determine if lamotrigine&#xD;
      works best to treat Bipolar II depression if it is used alone, or if it is taken with an&#xD;
      antidepressant. In the first part of our investigation, people with Bipolar II depression who&#xD;
      have not responded to an antidepressant will either add lamotrigine to their antidepressant,&#xD;
      or will stop the antidepressant and take lamotrigine alone. They will see the study doctor&#xD;
      for 6 visits over 8 weeks, and will answer questions about their depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      their overall health. The purpose of this study phase is to determine which treatment works&#xD;
      best to treat active Bipolar depression. In the second part of the study, people who have&#xD;
      responded to their assigned treatment may continue to receive it for another 44 weeks. They&#xD;
      will see the study doctor monthly, and will answer similar questions about their health.&#xD;
      Participants will also receive a physical examination and get a blood test three times during&#xD;
      the study. The purpose of the second phase is to ascertain which treatment is best at&#xD;
      preventing relapses of depression. The investigators hypothesize that people who take&#xD;
      Lamotrigine plus an antidepressant will recover from their depression more completely, have a&#xD;
      longer period of wellness, and have better quality of life compared to those taking&#xD;
      Lamotrigine alone.&#xD;

      PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine when added to antidepressant&#xD;
      medication, versus lamotrigine monotherapy, in the treatment and prevention of major&#xD;
      depression in patients with Bipolar II Disorder which has not responded to antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: Our primary hypothesis is that depressed patients with Bipolar II Disorder using&#xD;
      lamotrigine plus antidepressant, as compared to those using lamotrigine monotherapy, will&#xD;
      experience a greater decrease in their score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating&#xD;
      Scale, a standard measure of severity of depression. The investigators also hypothesize that&#xD;
      patients using lamotrigine in combination with antidepressant will have a greater survival&#xD;
      time without experiencing depressed, manic, or hypomanic episodes during maintenance therapy,&#xD;
      and an improved quality of life, compared to those receiving lamotrigine monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION: Bipolar Disorder is a severe and recurrent psychiatric illness which is&#xD;
      associated with high rates of mental health service utilization and functional disability.&#xD;
      15% - 20% of patients will complete suicide, the greatest rate of any psychiatric illness.&#xD;
      With a lifetime prevalence of 3% - 5%, over one million Canadians suffer from this&#xD;
      potentially disabling condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bipolar I Disorder is characterized by one or more manic or mixed episodes, frequently in&#xD;
      combination with episodes of depression. It has been well studied, and effective treatments&#xD;
      are available for the depressed, manic, and maintenance phases of this condition. Bipolar II&#xD;
      Disorder consists of periods of depression, plus one or more hypomanic (mild manic) episodes.&#xD;
      The depressed phase of Bipolar II illness is overwhelmingly responsible for its substantial&#xD;
      burden. Long-term follow-up studies demonstrate that patients experience depressive symptoms&#xD;
      almost 40 times more often than symptoms of hypomania, and that even mild depressive symptoms&#xD;
      are associated with significant functional impairment. Hypomanic episodes, conversely, are&#xD;
      generally short, infrequent, and do not significantly impair functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bipolar II Disorder has been under-recognized, primarily due to its frequent misdiagnosis as&#xD;
      Major Depressive Disorder. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that it is the most&#xD;
      common Bipolar phenotype, affecting up to 80% of people with Bipolar illness. Underestimation&#xD;
      of its prevalence has led to it being understudied. To date, no large randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials exclusively involving Bipolar II patients have been published. Clinical decisions&#xD;
      regarding the treatment of Bipolar II Disorder must therefore be extrapolated from research&#xD;
      on Bipolar I patients, or based on the results of small open label studies. Clinical trials&#xD;
      in Bipolar I samples show conclusively that mood stabilizing medications such as Lithium are&#xD;
      the optimal treatment, and that antidepressant therapy may potentiate a switch into mania, or&#xD;
      the development a rapid cycling course of illness. Several lines of evidence, however,&#xD;
      including genetic, family, and long-term follow-up studies, suggest that Bipolar II Disorder&#xD;
      is a distinct illness from Bipolar I Disorder. Making treatment decisions based on data from&#xD;
      Bipolar I patients may therefore be inappropriate. While some open-label studies support the&#xD;
      efficacy of mood stabilizing medications in Bipolar II Disorder, others suggest that Bipolar&#xD;
      II patients may respond to antidepressant monotherapy. Antidepressants may be less effective&#xD;
      in treating Bipolar II Disorder than Major Depressive Disorder, however, and Bipolar patients&#xD;
      are over-represented in the treatment refractory population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, combining an antidepressant and a mood stabilizing medication is a&#xD;
      commonly used approach to treating Bipolar II depression. Lamotrigine is a mood stabilizing&#xD;
      medication which has demonstrated efficacy in treating the depressed phase of Bipolar I&#xD;
      Disorder, though not all studies have produced positive results. Therefore, the current study&#xD;
      compares the efficacy and safety of the addition of lamotrigine to antidepressant medication,&#xD;
      versus a switch of antidepressant to lamotrigine monotherapy, in the treatment of Bipolar II&#xD;
      depression which has not responded to treatment with antidepressant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of lamotrigine in combination with antidepressant&#xD;
      medication, versus lamotrigine monotherapy, over 8 weeks in the treatment of major depression&#xD;
      in patients with Bipolar II Disorder. The investigators will also compare response and&#xD;
      remission rates for depressive symptoms on a commonly-used metric of depression severity;&#xD;
      effect on quality of life; level of patient acceptance; and safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      two treatment arms. A 44-week maintenance phase will assess the efficacy of the two treatment&#xD;
      arms in preventing episodes of depression, mania, and hypomania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHOD: This is a randomized, single-blind, parallel-group study comparing the&#xD;
      addition of lamotrigine to antidepressant medication, versus lamotrigine monotherapy, in the&#xD;
      treatment of Bipolar II major depression. Approximately 100 patients will be randomized.&#xD;
      During a screening phase, informed consent will be obtained, patient eligibility will be&#xD;
      assessed, and previous psychoactive medications will be discontinued for a period of at least&#xD;
      five half-lives. A baseline psychiatric assessment will be completed, including relevant&#xD;
      clinical scales, physical examination, and protocol-required laboratory investigations.&#xD;
      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and randomized to one of&#xD;
      the two treatment arms at the baseline visit. One study group will receive lamotrigine&#xD;
      100-400 mg daily plus antidepressant medication, while the other will receive lamotrigine&#xD;
      100-400 mg daily as monotherapy. Study visits will occur at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6,&#xD;
      and 8. Psychiatric status will be assessed by interview, and information regarding symptoms&#xD;
      of depression and hypomania will be specifically obtained using clinical scales. Overall&#xD;
      quality of life will be assessed at baseline and endpoint using a validated instrument.&#xD;
      Adverse events, including mood switch into mania or hypomania, will be enumerated. Study&#xD;
      endpoint will occur at week 8, or if the patient is withdrawn from the study due to&#xD;
      non-response, adverse events, or for other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the protocol-defined criteria for treatment response will be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to continue their assigned treatment during a 44-week maintenance study phase.&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed every 4 weeks during this study period. At each visit, information&#xD;
      will be collected regarding symptoms of depression, mania or hypomania, overall psychiatric&#xD;
      status, and adverse events. Medication adherence will be assessed at each visit. Assessment&#xD;
      of quality of life, physical examination, and laboratory measures will be performed at&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMARY: This is a 52 week study of the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine plus&#xD;
      antidepressant, versus monotherapy with lamotrigine, in the treatment of major depression in&#xD;
      patients with Bipolar II Disorder who have not responded to antidepressant treatment. The&#xD;
      study has 4 phases: screening, enrollment, and acute treatment, and maintenance treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder will be confirmed by clinical interview, according to&#xD;
      DSM-IV-TR criteria. Presence and severity of depressive symptoms will be assessed with the&#xD;
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Subjects with confirmed Bipolar II&#xD;
      Disorder,a MADRS score of at least 18, and no exclusion criteria, are eligible to participate&#xD;
      in the study. Subjects who provide written informed consent will enter the screening phase.&#xD;
      During the screening phase, demographic information including age, ethnicity, psychiatric and&#xD;
      medical history, family psychiatric history, and previous medication trials will be&#xD;
      collected. Vital signs and weight will be recorded, and blood work for hematology, serum&#xD;
      chemistry, fasting glucose, thyroid function, urinalysis, urine toxicology, and pregnancy&#xD;
      test, if appropriate, will be collected. A physical examination will be performed. Clinical&#xD;
      rating scales will be administered, including the MADRS, the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS),&#xD;
      and the Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) Severity and Change Scales.&#xD;
      Psychotropic medications not allowed under the protocol will be tapered and discontinued for&#xD;
      a period of at least 5 half-lives before the baseline visit. Subjects who continue to meet&#xD;
      inclusion criteria after the screening phase will be randomized to study medication at the&#xD;
      baseline visit. At the baseline visit, the above clinical rating scales will be&#xD;
      readministered. Quality of life will be measured with the Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to one of two study arms at baseline. Those in the first&#xD;
      treatment arm will be prescribed lamotrigine in addition to the antidepressant medication&#xD;
      they were prescribed prior to study entry. Subjects in the second treatment arm will&#xD;
      discontinue their antidepressants and will be prescribed lamotrigine monotherapy. Lamotrigine&#xD;
      will be initiated at 25mg daily for two weeks,then increased to 50mg daily for one week, and&#xD;
      then increased to 100 mg daily. The dose may then be adjusted upward or downward by 50-100mg&#xD;
      weekly, at the investigator's discretion, provided that it remains within the protocol&#xD;
      defined range of 100mg - 400mg daily. For subjects in the combination therapy arm,&#xD;
      antidepressant dose will remain constant throughout the study. Treatment will be prescribed&#xD;
      in an open-label fashion, but subjects will be assessed by an investigator who is blinded to&#xD;
      treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits for the acute treatment phase will occur at baseline, and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6,&#xD;
      and 8. At each visit, patients will undergo a review of study medications and other&#xD;
      treatments, including pill counts. Adverse events will be recorded. Presence and severity of&#xD;
      symptoms will be assessed at each visit via the MADRS, YMRS, and CGI-BP. Weight and vital&#xD;
      signs will be measured at each visit. At study endpoint, quality of life will be reassessed&#xD;
      with the QLESQ, and laboratory measures, including a serum pregnancy test, will be repeated.&#xD;
      Endpoint will be reached at study week 8, or if the subject or the investigator withdraws the&#xD;
      subject for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for the acute study phase will be change in severity of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, as determined by change in MADRS score from baseline to endpoint.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include rates of response to treatment (defined as 50% decrease in&#xD;
      MADRS score); remission rates (defined as MADRS score &lt;8); average time to response and&#xD;
      remission; induction of mania or hypomania, as measured by change in YMRS scores (with&#xD;
      hypomania defined as YMRS score &gt;10 to 15 and mania defined as YMRS &gt;16); rates of adverse&#xD;
      events, as measured by patient report, and changes in vital signs, weight, and laboratory&#xD;
      measures; improvement in quality of life, determined by change in QLESQ scores; and study&#xD;
      completion rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the criteria for remission at endpoint of the acute study phase will be&#xD;
      offered the opportunity to continue their assigned treatment for a 44 week maintenance phase.&#xD;
      The dosage of lamotrigine may be adjusted at the discretion of the investigator, but must&#xD;
      remain in the range of 100-400 mg daily. No adjustments may be made in antidepressant dose in&#xD;
      those subjects in the combination therapy arm. Study visits will occur every 4 weeks for 44&#xD;
      weeks. At each visit, MADRS, YMRS, and CGI-BP will be administered; weight and vital signs&#xD;
      will be measured; adverse events will be recorded; and review of medications and pill counts&#xD;
      will be performed. The QLESQ and laboratory measures will be repeated at endpoint. The&#xD;
      primary outcome for the maintenance study phase will be survival time until the emergence of&#xD;
      a depressed, manic, or hypomanic episode. Secondary outcome measures will include survival&#xD;
      time in the study until withdrawal for any reason; frequency and severity of side effects;&#xD;
      overall psychiatric status as determined by score on the CGI-BP; and quality of life,&#xD;
      determined by QLESQ score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental aspects of the study include the use of lamotrigine and antidepressants for the&#xD;
      treatment of depression in patients with Bipolar II Disorder, as neither medication is&#xD;
      approved for this use by Canadian health authorities. While random assignment of patients to&#xD;
      study groups may also be considered an experimental approach, both lamotrigine monotherapy&#xD;
      and the combination of lamotrigine and antidepressant medication are commonly used approaches&#xD;
      to treating Bipolar II Disorder in clinical practice.&#xD;
