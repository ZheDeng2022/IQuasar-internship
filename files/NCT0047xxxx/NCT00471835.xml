      RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the&#xD;
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage I or&#xD;
      stage II non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy&#xD;
           (SBRT) to the central lung region (peri-mediastinum) in patients with stage I or II&#xD;
           non-small cell lung cancer. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine local control and time to local progression in patients treated with this&#xD;
           regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the ability of peak standardized uptake values (SUV) for fludeoxyglucose F 18&#xD;
           (FDG)-PET scan, obtained shortly after SBRT (post-treatment), to predict local control&#xD;
           and time to progression in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the ability of maximum SUV for FDG-PET scan, obtained shortly after SBRT, to&#xD;
           predict long-term local control and time to progression in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the ability of peak SUV and max SUV for FDG-PET scan, obtained prior to SBRT,&#xD;
           to predict local control and time to progression in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the utility of PET/CT scan data in guiding treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if treatment with radiotherapy involving high biological doses with limited&#xD;
           treatment volume using these SBRT techniques achieves acceptable treatment-related&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) 3 times&#xD;
           within a 2-week time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of hypofractionated SBRT until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2&#xD;
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients undergo hypofractionated SBRT at the MTD as in phase I. In both&#xD;
           phases, patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT scans at baseline and at 12-16&#xD;
           weeks after completion of SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
             meeting the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Maximum T2 or T3 tumor size ≤ 5 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  T3 primary tumor must be limited to chest wall&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Primary tumor of any T stage must be within or touching the zone of the trachea&#xD;
                  or proximal bronchial tree, defined as a volume of 2 cm in all directions around&#xD;
                  the trachea and proximal bronchial tree (carina, right and left main bronchi,&#xD;
                  right and left upper lobe bronchi, intermedius bronchi, right middle lobe&#xD;
                  bronchus, right and left lower lobe bronchi)&#xD;
&#xD;

                       be within 2 cm of the esophagus&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with N1 (hilar) lymph nodes positive for malignancy based on size,&#xD;
                  fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-PET scan uptake, or biopsy are eligible if the N1&#xD;
                  lymph nodes are located such that they are contiguously within the same&#xD;

                       patient is eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If the biopsy is non-diagnostic, consideration should be given to repeat&#xD;
                       biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  If the repeat biopsy remains non-diagnostic or a biopsy is not&#xD;
                            feasible, then the patient is ineligible&#xD;
