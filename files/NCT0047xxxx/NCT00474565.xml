  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study relates to a new approach to coronary artery and coronary artery by-pass&#xD;
      graft imaging, and more particularly to computed tomographic angiography following an aortic&#xD;
      root injection of a low amount of contrast (up to 30 cc) via a percutaneously placed catheter&#xD;
      (Vanguard DX, Medrad Inc.) positioned in the aortic root.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to show the feasibility of Coronary artery CTA using aortic&#xD;
      root injection of contrast compared to the standard invasive cardiac catheterization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. The diagnosis via the&#xD;
      gold standard, cardiac catheterization, remains a time consuming, expensive, and invasive&#xD;
      procedure with some considerable risks. In addition, there is a significant risk due to&#xD;
      cumulative amount of iodinated contrast delivered (between 80 - 120 cc) in patients who have&#xD;
      abnormal renal insufficiency or at a high risk for developing contrast nephropathy. Cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization specifically involves arterial puncture with a needle, usually in the groin&#xD;
      or upper extremity, through which a guidewire is passed fluoroscopically to the ascending&#xD;
      aorta. A catheter is then inserted over the guidewire and subsequently, the guidewire is&#xD;
      removed and iodinated contrast is injected to opacify the aorta or coronary arteries. As&#xD;
      such, there are different kinds of catheters that are used to engage either the right or left&#xD;
      native coronary arteries or by-pass vein grafts. This procedure requires separate injections&#xD;
      into the coronary arteries or by-pass grafts which can induce arrhythmias, require over one&#xD;
      hour of procedural time, requires larger bore catheters, exposes the physician and patient to&#xD;
      ionizing radiation and subjects the patient with coronary artery disease to contrast induced&#xD;
      nephropathy, especially in cases requiring higher loads of iodinated contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the noninvasive techniques, the most common limiting factor when employing IV-enhanced CTA&#xD;
      is the underlying blood pool, which also enhances when contrast-enhanced protocols are&#xD;
      employed using a peripheral intravenous contrast injection route. This results in a frequent&#xD;
      obscuration of the native coronary arteries. Reproducible enhancement of the distal and&#xD;
      tributary anatomy is another pitfall with IV-enhanced coronary CTA. In addition, the amount&#xD;
      of contrast agent required is similar to that amount required during invasive coronary&#xD;
      angiography. As such, the method of the present study provides an imaging concept of the&#xD;
      coronary arteries employing a catheter device in conjunction with computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      imaging machine that will enable a reduction of the total amount of dye delivered to the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
