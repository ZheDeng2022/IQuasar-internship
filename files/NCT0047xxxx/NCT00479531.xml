    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if sequential compression devices (SCD) when worn&#xD;
      for an hour per day by patients suffering from Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) are helpful for&#xD;
      the improvement of the RLS symptoms and sleep.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a highly vexing problem manifested by sensory and motor&#xD;
      symptoms that disrupt sleep onset or sleep maintenance. RLS is the second most common sleep&#xD;
      disorder and occurs with an estimated prevalence of 10% in the general population. The sleep&#xD;
      disruption results in daytime symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and mood&#xD;
      changes. There are no consistently reliable treatment alternatives. There is an urgent need&#xD;
      for new, innovative treatment strategies because available pharmacological treatments often&#xD;
      stop working over time or are associated with unacceptable side effects. An effective&#xD;
      nonpharmacological treatment would be a highly attractive alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anecdotally, patients have reported that use of sequential compression devices (SCD)&#xD;
      prescribed for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis can have a positive effect on RLS&#xD;
      symptoms. Because this nonpharmacological alternative is available, safe, and affordable,&#xD;
      further investigation is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simply stated, the null hypothesis is that SCD therapy does not have an impact on RLS&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to wearing SCDs or sham SCDs for an hour each day prior to the&#xD;
      usual onset of the RLS symptoms. At baseline and at monthly follow-ups for 3 to 4 months,&#xD;
      participants will complete questionnaires to assess the severity of the RLS symptoms, their&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness, and the impact of the RLS on quality of life.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than 17 years with a reliable diagnosis of RLS in accordance with the&#xD;
             International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Revised Diagnostic and Coding Manual&#xD;
             of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age less than 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable medical conditions that may interfere with the requirements of the study (for&#xD;
             example uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, symptomatic asthma, congestive heart failure&#xD;
             with symptoms of pulmonary edema), and mental or physical limitations (including&#xD;
             dementia) that would preclude data collection on questionnaires or wearing the SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical conditions that would serve as exclusion criteria are those where&#xD;
             increased venous or lymphatic return is undesirable. These specific conditions are&#xD;
             known or suspected acute deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, severe congestive&#xD;
             heart failure, pulmonary edema, severe arteriosclerosis, active infection such as&#xD;
             gangrene, recent vein ligation or skin graft, or extreme deformity of the legs.&#xD;
