      The purpose of this study is to assess if follow-up telephone calls after colorectal surgery&#xD;
      affects a patient's satisfaction, the outcome of their surgery, and their quality of life. In&#xD;
      addition, readmissions, complications and emergency room visits can be tracked via these&#xD;
      telephone calls, ensuring optimal communication between patients and the surgical office.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Follow-up with patients after surgery is necessary to assess levels of rehabilitation, answer&#xD;
      questions and expresses an attitude of caring, as well as assist in marketing procedures for&#xD;
      the hospital or institution (Fallis, 2001). Surveillance after discharge from the hospital&#xD;
      may be difficult as most patients are no longer monitored by health care professionals. If&#xD;
      home health care is not required, the patient may not have contact with his/her doctor or&#xD;
      nurse until the follow-up appointment which frequently is 4- 6 weeks post surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence in the literature that telephone contact is beneficial for patients. The&#xD;
      strongest and most current evidence came from a meta-analysis by Meade (2004) on research&#xD;
      supporting phone calls post-operatively for hospitalized patients. This analysis provided a&#xD;
      significant and valid review of health care professionals providing this service, looking at&#xD;
      various patient populations and different hospital settings. 29 articles were published from&#xD;
      1981 to 2004 and reviewed to gather a compilation of research findings in this area.&#xD;
      Regardless of the design of the research, the findings suggest that follow-up phone calls to&#xD;
      patients after discharge provide invaluable opportunities to enhance practice in the&#xD;
      following areas: Appraisal and evaluation of patient education, Practice improvement trends,&#xD;
      Quality of care, Medication compliance and adherence to discharge instructions, Evaluation of&#xD;
      overall hospital performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no evidence specifically addressing telephone contact after discharge in the&#xD;
      colorectal surgery population which will be the basis of this study. Nurses providing&#xD;
      follow-up phone calls to patients in the early post operative phase may assist in preventing&#xD;
      or minimizing the effects of postoperative complications by reinforcing discharge&#xD;
      instructions, answering patients' questions, and assessing their concerns. Potential serious&#xD;
      complications may therefore be addressed early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess if follow-up telephone calls after surgery affects&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, surgical outcomes and quality of life in the early post-operative phase&#xD;
      after colorectal surgery. In addition, tracking of readmissions, complications and emergency&#xD;
      room visits via telephone calls can ensure communication between the patients and the&#xD;
      surgical office is optimal.&#xD;
