  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely-accepted that serum testosterone level and BMI (body mass index) representative&#xD;
      of the degree of obesity has negative correlation. Considering the fact that obesity is being&#xD;
      mentioned as a risk factor for development of prostate cancer as well as other various&#xD;
      life-threatening diseases (example: cardiovascular problems), the effect of BPH treatment&#xD;
      agents on BMI is a subject that should certainly be elucidated. Meanwhile, to our knowledge,&#xD;
      no prospective study has so far been performed on such issue in Asian population. Prior to&#xD;
      generating hypothesis of the effect of 5 alpha reductase inhibitor on BMI, the real effect of&#xD;
      5 alpha reductase inhibitor on BMI change in Korean BPH patients has to be observed in real&#xD;
      clinical practice. This study will test the effects of one-year medication of 5 alpha&#xD;
      reductase inhibitor on BMI among Korean men with BPH.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, 1-year follow-up, observational study. We are planning to enroll&#xD;
      100 Korean patients with BPH. At each visit, patients' height, weight, abdominal&#xD;
      circumference will be checked. Laboratory parameters including fasting glucose, HbA1c, serum&#xD;
      testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, estradiol, maximum flow rate&#xD;
      (measured by flowmetry) will be tested. Blood test will be performed twice (at baseline and&#xD;
      at the end of study). 5mL of blood will be needed at each time from one subject. And total&#xD;
      IPSS score will be evaluated after 1 year of treatment of 5 ARI. At every visit, use of above&#xD;
      prohibited medicines and other medications will be investigated. In addition, any surgical&#xD;
      procedures undertaken during study period will be asked and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects of study will be allocated into 3 separate groups. Group 1 will be those taking 5&#xD;
      alpha reductase inhibitor (dutasteride) only for 1 year. Group2 will be those who switch from&#xD;
      alpha blocker to dutasteride and take dutasteride for 1 year. Group 3 will be composed of&#xD;
      those taking both alpha blocker and dutasteride for 1 year.&#xD;

        &lt;10 ng/mL, and no evidence of prostate cancer (on a DRE or TRUS) among patients who visited&#xD;
        our clinic.&#xD;
