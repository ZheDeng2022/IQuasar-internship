      The purpose of this study determine whether the drug valganciclovir has a significant and&#xD;
      real benefit on the central core of symptoms experienced by patients who have high titers to&#xD;
      EBV and HHV-6 and are experiencing long-standing fatigue and cognitive impairment (CFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, to characterize a quantifiable biological marker in these patients that will&#xD;
      facilitate the identification of those likely to respond to valganciclovir and will make it&#xD;

      Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a clinically defined condition characterized by severe&#xD;
      disabling fatigue and a combination of symptoms that prominently features self-reported&#xD;
      impairment of concentration and short-term memory, sleep disturbances, and musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pain. Prevalence of CFS in the adult population is estimated to be 0.007% to 2.8%. No&#xD;
      pathognomonic signs or diagnostic tests for this condition have been yet validated in&#xD;
      scientific studies; in addition, no definitive treatments are clinically available. Suggested&#xD;
      etiologies of CFS include, but are not limited to: viral or bacterial infections,&#xD;
      endocrine-metabolic dysfunction, immunological imbalance, neurally-mediated hypotension and&#xD;
      depressioN. EBV and HHV-6 are among the viruses frequently thought as associated with CFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently encountered a group of patients at Stanford who were chronically infected with&#xD;
      human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), were suffering from debilitating&#xD;
      fatigue for at least one year and experienced a significant improvement in their fatigue and&#xD;
      cognitive symptoms following the administration of valganciclovir. Their antibody titers to&#xD;
      both viruses were high (median antibody titer for EBV viral capsid antigen was 1:2560 and for&#xD;
      HHV-6 IgG was 1:1280) despite the fact that some of them were known to have been infected&#xD;
      with EBV and HHV-6 for several years. We suspected that their symptoms could be the result of&#xD;
      an immune dysregulation triggered by high levels of replication of both EBV and HHV-6&#xD;
      (alterations in the immune system such as an aberrant cytokine profiles have been proposed as&#xD;
      the central abnormality in patients with CFS associated with other viruses such as parvovirus&#xD;
      B19. At the same time, we were familiar using valganciclovir in the context of several&#xD;
      clinical settings including its known indications for reactivation of viral infections in&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients. We were comfortable using valganciclovir (900 mg bid for three&#xD;
      weeks followed by 900 mg qd to complete 3 to 12 months of treatment) in patients with solid&#xD;
      and bone marrow transplants, cancer or other immunosuppressive disorders who had developed&#xD;
      CMV, EBV, or HHV-6 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that a long course (i.e. 6 months) of valganciclovir could effectively&#xD;
      decrease or stop ongoing viral replication of both EBV and HHV-6 and that this virological&#xD;
      effect could be translated in a clinical and laboratory benefit (i.e. decrease or resolution&#xD;
      of lymphadenopathy, reversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio abnormalities). We were surprised to see&#xD;
      that a dramatic recovery on the level of physical activity was also observed in the Stanford&#xD;
      patients (from a median of 10% of energy level for daily activities at baseline to 90% after&#xD;
      valganciclovir use). Of note, the drug has also been tried in patients in whom an improvement&#xD;
      on their level of physical activity has not been observed. The total number of patients&#xD;
      treated today is 30, 26 had &quot;elevated titers&quot; and 4 had &quot;low titers&quot;. Of the 26 patients with&#xD;
      &quot;elevated titers&quot;, 25 have had a dramatic recovery. Of the 4 patients with &quot;low titers&quot;, none&#xD;
      have responded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that our successful experience with valganciclovir in a subset of patients with&#xD;
      CFS at Stanford calls for a prospective study to exclude a placebo effect. We propose to&#xD;
      measure viral, immunologic, and genomic endpoints to assess whether there are objective and&#xD;
      measurable changes in these parameters and whether they correlate with clinical improvement.&#xD;
      Clinical improvement will be assessed by objective measurements of daily physical and&#xD;
      psychological activities. This will help to elucidate the possible role of HHV-6, EBV (or a&#xD;
      yet to be known virus) and/or an altered immune system as triggers for the symptoms&#xD;
      experienced by patients suffering CFS and to establish whether the drug valganciclovir does&#xD;
      reverse these abnormalities. This study may also shed light on a biomarker or profile of&#xD;
      biomarkers associated with (or diagnostic of) CFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be executing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of valganciclovir in patients experiencing chronic fatigue&#xD;
      syndrome with elevated antibody titres against Human Herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and Epstein-Barr&#xD;
      Virus (EBV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether the drug valganciclovir has a significant and real benefit on the&#xD;
           central core of symptoms experienced by patients who have high titers to EBV and HHV-6&#xD;
           and are experiencing long-standing fatigue and cognitive impairment (CFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize a quantifiable biological marker in these patients that will facilitate&#xD;
           the identification of those likely to respond to valganciclovir and will make it&#xD;
           possible to assess response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. All&#xD;
      patients will be given the active drug (20 patients) or placebo (10 patients) for 6 months&#xD;
      and followed for an additional 3 months. Patients on the placebo arm will take a&#xD;
      valganciclovir look-alike tablet that does not contain the active drug for the initial six&#xD;
      month period. Subsequently these patients will be offered a 6 month trial of valganciclovir&#xD;
      if at the end of the study (when the last enrolled patient reaches 9 months from initiating&#xD;
      therapy) it is clear that there is a benefit of valganciclovir therapy and patients have not&#xD;
      spontaneously improved.&#xD;
