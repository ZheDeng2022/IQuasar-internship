      ABSTRACT/EXECUTIVE SUMMARY BACKGROUND, SIGNIFICANCE &amp; RATIONALE: Between 10-20% of the more&#xD;
      than 6000 cases of spinal cord injury seen annually in the North America have the clinical&#xD;
      pattern of traumatic central cord syndrome (TCCS). These patients are usually older, most&#xD;
      likely have sustained a fall, and have incomplete spinal cord injury characterized by&#xD;
      dysesthetic and weak upper extremities. CT scan of the cervical spine in patients with TCCS&#xD;
      often shows disc/osteophytes complex superimposed on degenerative or congenital spinal&#xD;
      stenosis and MRI reveals signal changes at one or multiple skeletal segments. A minority of&#xD;
      these patients suffer from fracture/subluxations, however, this group of patients are younger&#xD;
      and have been involved in a more dynamic trauma. Since 1951, when Schneider et al reported&#xD;
      this syndrome, controversy has dominated its surgical management. The current &quot;Guidelines for&#xD;
      the Management of Acute Cervical Spine and Spinal Cord Injuries&quot; recommendations are only at&#xD;
      the level of options, since prospective outcome data are unavailable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: in acute traumatic central cord syndrome, surgical decompression of the spinal&#xD;
      cord within five days will result in more rapid motor recovery, than decompression 6 weeks&#xD;
      following injury. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM I: To compare American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Motor Scores after three&#xD;
      months post injury in patients with central cord syndrome operated on within five days of&#xD;
      injury to a similar group of patients operated on 6 weeks following injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM II: To compare functional outcome, health related quality of life and&#xD;
      posttraumatic syrinx size in patients with traumatic central cord syndrome operated on within&#xD;
      five days to a similar group of patients operated on 6 weeks following injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Single center prospective randomized study. PROCEDURE: In a two-year period thirty&#xD;
      patients with traumatic central cord syndrome and cord compression (15 patients in each&#xD;
      group) will be randomized to undergo surgical decompression either within the first five days&#xD;
      or at 6 weeks following spinal cord injury. ASIA motor, functional recovery and health&#xD;
      related quality of life between the two groups will be compared at admission, discharge from&#xD;
      rehab facility 3 months and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;

      JUSTIFICATION Between 10-20% of the more than 6000 cases of cervical spinal cord injury seen&#xD;
      annually in the North America have the clinical pattern of traumatic central cord syndrome&#xD;
      (TCCS) . These patients are usually older, most likely have sustained a fall, and have&#xD;
      incomplete spinal cord injury characterized by dysesthetic and weak upper extremities. CT&#xD;
      scan of the cervical spine in patients with TCCS often shows disc/osteophytes complex&#xD;
      superimposed on degenerative or congenital spinal stenosis and MRI reveals signal changes at&#xD;
      one or multiple skeletal segments. A minority of these patients suffer from&#xD;
      fracture/subluxations, however, these patients are younger and have been involved in a more&#xD;
      dynamic trauma. Since 1951, when Schneider et al reported this syndrome, controversy and&#xD;
      confusion has dominated its surgical management. The current &quot;Guidelines for the Management&#xD;
      of Acute Cervical Spine and Spinal Cord Injuries&quot; recommendations are only at the level of&#xD;
      options, since prospective outcome data are unavailable .&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past four decades, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms governing traumatic spinal cord injury including central cord&#xD;
      syndrome. Translation of kinetic energy, primarily through hyperextension and less often&#xD;
      fracture dislocations of cervical spine, usually involved with cervical spondylosis or&#xD;
      congenital spinal stenosis, results in anatomical compression of the spinal cord followed by&#xD;
      secondary insults which are time dependent and likely ischemic in nature. Microangiographic&#xD;
      studies of spinal cord in patients with cervical spondylosis have indicated deformation,&#xD;
      stretching and flattening of the spinal cord tracts as well as sulcal microvasculature, which&#xD;
      may be further jeopardized by traumatic hyperextension, resulting in axonal interruption,&#xD;
      swelling and vascular damage, predisposing to sustained spinal cord ischemia responsible for&#xD;
      clinical manifestations of central cord syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: in acute traumatic central cord syndrome, surgical decompression of the spinal&#xD;
      cord within 1-5 days will result in more rapid motor and functional recovery and results in a&#xD;
      better quality of life than decompression ~6 weeks following injury. To test this hypothesis,&#xD;
      we will pursue the following specific aims: SPECIFIC AIM I: To compare American Spinal Injury&#xD;
      Association (ASIA) Motor Scores after three and 12 months post injury in patients with&#xD;
      central cord syndrome operated on within 1-5 days of injury to a similar group of patients&#xD;
      operated on ~6 weeks (range 5-7 weeks) following trauma. SPECIFIC AIM II: To compare&#xD;
      functional outcome, health related quality of life and posttraumatic syrinx size three and 12&#xD;
      months after injury in patients with traumatic central cord syndrome operated on within 1-5&#xD;
      days to a similar group of patients operated on ~6 weeks (5-7 weeks) following injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN/PROCEDURE Our investigation will be single center prospective randomized pilot study.&#xD;
      Thirty conscious adult (&gt;17 years old) patients with clinically (conventional ASIA exam) and&#xD;
      radiologically (conventional MRI and CT of neck) proven cervical traumatic central cord&#xD;
      syndrome will be screened for this study. These patients are admitted to the University of&#xD;
      Maryland Medical System within 48 hours of their injury and are randomized (computer) into&#xD;
      two surgical groups. Study subjects are fully resuscitated, stable and eligible to sign&#xD;
      consent to go through the research process. None of these patients have radiologically overt&#xD;
      unstable cervical spine injuries or any injury requiring urgent surgical decompression and&#xD;
      stabilization. A computer designed random number generator will divide these patients into&#xD;
      two standard of care surgical groups: Early Surgical Decompression Group ((ESDG [odd #]))&#xD;
      will have surgery 1-5 days after trauma and the late surgical decompression group ((LSDG&#xD;
      [even #])) will be operated after a period of ~ 6 weeks (range 5-7 weeks). Unless medically&#xD;
      indicated to stay in an acute care facility, the LSD Group patients are discharged to a rehab&#xD;
      facility or home to be brought back for surgery. While in hard collar the latter group will&#xD;
      be studied with a CT of the neck at 3 weeks (designed as a research tool) in order to assure&#xD;
      no missed ligamentous injury resulting in glacial instability. If hidden instability is&#xD;
      discovered, depending on its severity, decompression and internal fixation may be performed&#xD;
      earlier than the proposed 6 weeks. Both groups will have detailed conventional medical,&#xD;
      neurological and radiological examination during their hospital stay and while in a rehab&#xD;
      center, at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months postinjury. All the studies will be clinically&#xD;
      conventional except MRI at 12 months post injury which is research related to measure the&#xD;
      size of spinal cord syrinx. While ready to be discharged from a rehab center and at 3 and 12&#xD;
      months post injury all these patients will have detailed research related functional studies&#xD;
      as depicted in study schedule in form of known outcome measures (Functional Independence&#xD;
      Measure, Spinal Cord Independence Measure, and Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury). In this&#xD;
      study there won't be a placebo or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PREHOSPITAL ,Trauma Resuscitation Unit (TRU) &amp; Emergency Department (ED) RESUSCITATION:&#xD;
           In a two-year period, all patients admitted to the STC TRU and UMMS EDs, within 48 hours&#xD;
           of their spinal cord injury, will be screened for evidence of acute traumatic central&#xD;
           cord syndrome (TCCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SCREENING: Patients with incomplete spinal cord injury and MRI evidence of spinal cord&#xD;
           compression and swelling are visited for a complete conventional American Spinal Injury&#xD;
           Association Neurological and Functional Classification of motor, and sensory deficits.&#xD;
           Those with ASIA Impairment Grades B, C and D/E and with the clinical picture of central&#xD;
           cord syndrome will be chosen for possible enrollment. Inclusion/Exclusion Check List is&#xD;
           by now complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RANDOMIZATION: We (PI or his designee) will use one of the computer programs to generate&#xD;
           random numbers in order to divide 30 patients into two groups of surgical candidates&#xD;
           (Nregnow/digital river Chicago IL 60695-0001). Odd numbers are used for early (1-5 days)&#xD;
           decompression and even numbers for late ((after 6 weeks[5-7 weeks])) decompression. The&#xD;
           software is set in such a manner so that only a single number is generated for a single&#xD;
           patient with a specific alphanumerical user code (CCSS3001-CCSS3030). Generation of a&#xD;
           random number is accomplished by the PI or his designee. Randomization is part of&#xD;
           research process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. TIMING OF DECOMPRESSION: Based on the feasibility studies of Tator et al in STASCIS&#xD;
           1(please see the res of protocol), we decided to set the timing of decompression at five&#xD;
           days (1-5 days) and six weeks (5-7weeks) in order to be able to capture most of the&#xD;
           eligible patients. Enrollment will be within 48 hours of the injury. If due to any&#xD;
           reason(s) (e.g. complications) a patient who is randomized for early surgery does not&#xD;
           get operated, still he is followed as &quot;an intent to treat patient&quot; and his/her outcome&#xD;
           will be analyzed. The same is true for a patient who is to have late surgery but due to&#xD;
           a specific reason his surgery is cancelled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. OPERATIVE INTERVENTION: Eligible patients with traumatic central cord syndrome, canal&#xD;
           compromise and spinal cord compression will be consented, and randomized into two&#xD;
           groups. Thirty patients (15 patients in each group) will undergo standard surgical&#xD;
           decompression of spinal cord either within the first five days or at 6 weeks following&#xD;
           spinal cord injury. Each of the 15 patients enrolled for late decompression will be kept&#xD;
           in hard collar while in a rehab facility and will undergo research related CT studies at&#xD;
           3 weeks post admission. If interim imaging studies indicate glacial translation, earlier&#xD;
           decompression and internal fixation may be considered. The choice of surgical technique&#xD;
           for decompression is standard of treatment at the Shock Trauma Center. Standard surgical&#xD;
           decompression of the spinal cord will be by a select group of Department of Neurosurgery&#xD;
           staff with full familiarity with cervical spine surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS: Before, immediately after and at 72 hours following surgery, at&#xD;
           discharge from acute care or rehab center, 6 weeks, 3, 6, and12 months post injury&#xD;
           patients will have complete conventional ASIA motor and sensory classification&#xD;
           examination. Patients enrolled in the early surgical group will stay in the critical&#xD;
           care or intermediate care unit, or the general floor until discharge to a rehabilitation&#xD;
           center. These patients will have conventional postoperative CT while inpatient, at 3 and&#xD;
           12 months post injury. A research related CT (at 3 weeks) is performed in late surgery&#xD;
           group in order to evaluate the stability of the sagittal plane of the cervical spine.&#xD;
           Conventional MRI is performed before and immediately following surgery in every patient&#xD;
           of the study and at 12 months (research related MRI) to evaluate the size of the spinal&#xD;
           cord syrinx. SF-36, Functional Independence Scale (FIM), Walking Index for SCI (WISCI),&#xD;
           Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), will be checked as an outcome measure research&#xD;
           instrument at discharge from rehab facility, at 3 months, and at 12 months following&#xD;
           injury in all patients. Patients randomized to have decompression at 6 weeks will have&#xD;
           external fixation with a hard collar and will be transferred to a rehabilitation center&#xD;
           or home for six weeks and then brought back for surgical decompression. Follow-up of&#xD;
           these patients will be identical to the early operative group.&#xD;
