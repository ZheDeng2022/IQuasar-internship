  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study we are studying the effects of the combination of lapatinib plus&#xD;
      Herceptin in subjects with breast cancer that has spread outside of the breast. We are also&#xD;
      studying whether positron emission tomography (PET/CT) scans can predict which participants&#xD;
      will benefit from the study treatment. Finally, we are studying genes and proteins in the&#xD;
      tumor tissue that may lead to sensitivity or resistance to Herceptin, and to the combination&#xD;
      of Herceptin plus lapatinib. Lapatinib is a compound that may stop cancer cells from growing.&#xD;
      Other research studies suggest that lapatinib in combination with Herceptin may help to&#xD;
      shrink or stabilize breast cancer.&#xD;

      -  Participants will be asked to undergo a biopsy of an area of the body where the cancer&#xD;
           has spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given a study medication-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle.&#xD;
           Each treatment cycle lasts four weeks during which time you will be taking lapatinib,&#xD;
           once per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive Herceptin once every week or once every 3 weeks through a&#xD;
           vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During all treatment cycles a physical exam will be performed and questions about the&#xD;
           participants general health will be asked. Blood tests including chemistry and&#xD;
           hematology will be performed to measure additional effect of the study drug and disease&#xD;
           status. Photographs may be taken of the tumor to assess the response of the tumor to&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scans will be repeated every 8 weeks to assess the effect of the study treatment on&#xD;
           the cancer. Either a MUGA scan or echocardiogram will be performed 8 weeks and 16 weeks&#xD;
           after the participant starts the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will remain on this research study for as long as they are benefiting from&#xD;
           the study treatment.&#xD;
