    <textblock>
      This is a study involving a 12 week treatment phase. During the treatment phase subjects&#xD;
      receive FLUTIFORM速 or Sertetide速. Efficacy will be assessed by lung function tests and asthma&#xD;
      symptoms, sleep disturbance. Safety will be assessed by adverse events, vital signs, lab&#xD;
      tests and ECGs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients at least 18 years or older (females less than one year&#xD;

             use adequate and highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study. A&#xD;
             highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in a low&#xD;
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as&#xD;
             sterilization, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs&#xD;
             (Intrauterine Device, hormonal), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of mild to moderate-severe reversible asthma for &gt; 6 months prior to the&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate a FEV1 of &gt;40% to &lt;80% for predicted normal values (EGKS normal values,&#xD;
             1983) during the screening phase following appropriate withholding of asthma&#xD;
             medications (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No beta agonist use on day of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No use of combination asthma therapy on day of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed on day of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented reversibility of &gt; 15% in FEV1 in the screening phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate satisfactory technique in the use of the pressurized MDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to enter information in the electronic diary and attend all study&#xD;
             visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to substitute study medication for their pre study prescribed asthma&#xD;
             medication for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             asthma or prior intubation for asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of systemic (injectable) corticosteroid medication within 1 month before the&#xD;

             including uncontrolled coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, or cardiac dysrhythmia. 'Clinically significant' is defined as any disease&#xD;

             participation, or which would affect the outcome of the study.&#xD;

             oxidase inhibitors, astemizole (Hismanal), quinidine type antiarrhythmics, or potent&#xD;
             CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole within the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of medications that will have an effect on bronchospasm and/or pulmonary&#xD;
             function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current evidence or history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to test&#xD;
             medications or components.&#xD;
