      The purpose of this study is to determine whether adalimumab (a TNF-alpha inhibitor) is&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of severe and acute sciatica.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sciatica and low back pain are common problems that lead to major costs in Western countries.&#xD;
      The presence of herniated disc is generally considered as the leading cause of sciatica.&#xD;
      However, recent findings indicate that the presence of this mechanism is not sufficient to&#xD;
      explain all the clinical signs of radiculopathy and that inflammatory mechanisms contribute&#xD;
      also to the pathophysiology of sciatica. Indeed, herniated discs contain large amounts of&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) which can induce acute and chronic inflammation and pain.&#xD;
      It has recently been demonstrated that TNF-alpha inhibitors (infliximab or etanercept) were&#xD;
      able to prevent the occurrence of pain in an experimental model of sciatica. In addition, two&#xD;
      independent preliminary studies have shown that patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors&#xD;
      had better evolution than an historical control group. This study has been designed to verify&#xD;
      the hypothesis that TNF-alpha has a major role in human sciatica and that anti-TNF-alpha&#xD;
      agents are interesting therapeutic approaches in severe sciatica.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female patients older than 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Episode of radicular pain in one lower limb for less than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Medical evaluation requiring hospitalisation because of pain or functional handicap&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients presenting a characteristic leg pain in the L3, L4, L5, or S1 territories&#xD;
             plus at least one of the following: :&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  positive straight-leg-raising test with an elevation of less than 70°&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  positive femoral stretched&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  clear clinical sign of nerve root involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  muscle strength deficiency or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  sensory disturbances in clear cut dermatome or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  lower limb reflex asymmetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Oswestry score greater than 50&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If there is a past history of radicular pain involving the same nerve root, a 6 months&#xD;
             interval free of leg pain is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A confirmed herniated disc on usual imaging techniques (CT scan or MRI) in the&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  If surgical procedure is required but is denied, either because of surgeon's&#xD;
                  decision or because of patient's fully informed decision, then this patient could&#xD;
                  be included in the protocol.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. The use of cortisone prior to the inclusion IS NOT an exclusion criteria&#xD;
