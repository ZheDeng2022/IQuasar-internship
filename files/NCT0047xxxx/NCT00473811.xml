      By improving glycemic control, many of the devastating complications of diabetes are to a&#xD;
      large extent preventable. The use of a low GI (glycemic index) diet to improve glycemic&#xD;
      control is relatively new and untested. However, a low GI diet may be a cost-effective&#xD;
      approach to preventing diabetes-related complications. The aim of this proposed 2-year study&#xD;
      is to gather pilot data on the feasibility of implementing a nutritionist-delivered low GI&#xD;
      intervention, to reduce dietary GI in patients with type 2 diabetes, and to compare it with a&#xD;
      nutritionist-delivered standard American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet intervention. Our&#xD;
      outcomes are recruitment and retention rates, as well as physiological measures (HbA1c, blood&#xD;
      lipids, blood pressure, and body mass index), dietary GI scores and acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Recruitment and retention rates for the low GI intervention will be satisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants in the low GI intervention group will show more favorable changes in&#xD;
           physiological measures than participants in the ADA diet group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants in the low GI group will be successful in lowering the GI of their diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants will find the intervention acceptable.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The glycemic index (GI) is a ranking of carbohydrate containing foods according to the rate&#xD;
      at which they raise blood glucose levels after eating. A recent meta-analysis of randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials (RCT) suggests that choosing low GI foods has a small but clinically useful&#xD;
      effect on medium-term glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, in most of&#xD;
      the reviewed RCTs, patients were fed experimental diets and therefore there is still&#xD;
      controversy over the applicability of GI in the clinical setting for management of diabetes.&#xD;
      In addition, there is no evidence that long-term consumption of a low GI diet will contribute&#xD;
      to improved glycemic control in people with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our ultimate goal for a future larger RCT is to evaluate the long-term effects of using low&#xD;
      GI diet in type 2 diabetics. The primary outcome variable of the future large trial will be&#xD;
      glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c), a measure reflecting average glycemic level during&#xD;
      the preceding 2-3 months. The proposed feasibility study will recruit 40 patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and will randomly assign them to one of two groups: a low GI nutrition education&#xD;
      group (low GI group) and a standard ADA dietary education group as the control group (ADA&#xD;
      group) (20 patients in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, the intervention phase will last 6 months and consist of an initial group&#xD;
      session, an individual session, and then four group counseling sessions. The follow-up phase&#xD;
      will be six months and consist of two group booster sessions, one at 8-months and another at&#xD;
      10-months. The low GI nutritional education will be primarily targeted at a low GI diet. The&#xD;
      focus is not on decreasing total carbohydrate intake, but rather encouraging patients to&#xD;
      substitute low GI foods for high GI foods. The dietary intervention will be based on a&#xD;
      patient-centered counseling model which has been demonstrated to facilitate health behavior&#xD;
      change. Data collection points coincide with two phases of the intervention. Assessments,&#xD;
      including demographics, anthropometric measurements, diet and physical activity recalls, and&#xD;
      clinical data, will be conducted at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months after randomization,&#xD;
      with blood samples collected at each interval. We will track response to recruitment,&#xD;
      adherence, and retention. Quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to assess&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this proposed 2-year study is to gather pilot data on the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing a nutritionist-delivered low GI intervention to reduce dietary GI in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes. Our outcomes are recruitment and retention rates, as well as&#xD;
      physiological measures (HbA1c, blood pressure, and body mass index), dietary GI scores and&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By improving glycemic control, many of the devastating complications of diabetes are to a&#xD;
      large extent preventable. The use of a low GI diet to improve glycemic control is relatively&#xD;
      new and untested. However, a low GI diet may be a cost-effective approach to preventing&#xD;
      diabetes-related complications. Testing the feasibility of such a program and its potential&#xD;
      impact would be an important step towards an RO1 application to the NIH.&#xD;
