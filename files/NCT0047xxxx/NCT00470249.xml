      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and gemcitabine, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving carboplatin together with&#xD;
      gemcitabine works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with anthracycline- and taxane-resistant&#xD;
           locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated with dose-dense carboplatin and&#xD;
           gemcitabine hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the overall toxicity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV&#xD;
      over 150 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 9 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In this non-randomized prospective trial, patients with human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that was anthracycline- and taxane-resistant were treated with carboplatin at a dose equivalent to an area under the concentration-time curve of 4.5 mg/ml.min on day 1 and gemcitabine 1500 mg/m2 on day 2 of every 2-week cycle. The primary end point was overall response rate.</intervention_model_description>
