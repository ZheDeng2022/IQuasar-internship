    <textblock>
      This study will examine the clinical, immunological and epidemiological effects of concurrent&#xD;
      infections with P. falciparum and W. bancrofti or M. perstans (the parasites that cause&#xD;
      malaria and filariasis) on the frequency and severity of malaria infection in children and&#xD;
      young adults in Mali, Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents of Tien gu bougou and Bougoudiana, Mali, who are between 1 and 20 years of age may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Participants with and without filarial infection will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline evaluation with medical history and physical examination, blood tests and stool&#xD;
           culture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief physical examinations weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests monthly for malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard treatment offered for anyone with malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for filarial infection at the beginning, midpoint and end of the&#xD;
           transmission season&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment for lymphatic filariasis is available through the National Program for the&#xD;
           Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis. There is no effective standard therapy for M.&#xD;
           perstans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment for other parasitic worm infections, if needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Residents of malaria-endemic regions are frequently exposed to a variety of other parasites&#xD;
      concurrently with malarial parasites. In Mali, lymphatic filariasis due to Wuchereria&#xD;
      bancrofti co-exists in several regions highly endemic for malaria, and co-infection is common&#xD;
      in the residents of these areas. Because of the chronicity of filarial infections and an&#xD;
      associated bias towards the development of an adaptive immune response dominated by Th2&#xD;
      cytokines, a pre-existing filarial infection has the potential to alter the immune response&#xD;
      towards incoming malarial parasites, clearance of which are considered to be dependent on a&#xD;
      robust Th1 response. This could, in turn, affect the clinical manifestations and outcomes of&#xD;
      malaria infection. Conversely, immune responses to filarial parasites may be modulated in the&#xD;
      presence of malarial parasites. In addition to sharing a human host, Plasmodium falciparum&#xD;
      and Wuchereria bancrofti are transmitted by the same mosquito vector, Anopheles gambiae, and&#xD;
      interaction between the two species in the vector may have important implications for&#xD;
      transmission of these two infections. The primary goals of this study are to determine the&#xD;
      effect of concurrent infections with P. falciparum and W. bancrofti parasites on the&#xD;
      prevalence and severity of malaria infection in children living in a Malian village&#xD;
      co-endemic for two parasites and to assess the effects of co-infection on the immune&#xD;
      responses to these two parasites over the course of the malaria transmission season. The&#xD;
      epidemiology of co-infection at the human and vector level will also be examined.&#xD;
