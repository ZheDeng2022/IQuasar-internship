      In order to assess more completely the levels of diabetes care delivered in Taiwan, we now&#xD;
      have nationally standardized performance measures that can evaluate quality of diabetes care&#xD;
      accurately and reliably. These performance measures were seriously reviewed and discussed in&#xD;
      the aspects of their practicability, feasibility and compliancy, through a series of&#xD;
      nation-wide consensus meetings by a number of multidisciplinary professionals of Taiwan&#xD;
      Diabetes Care Teams ( TDCTs ), before delivering into the clinical settings ( 10 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptually, these measures will enhance uptake of research into practice and may ultimately&#xD;
      improve diabetes care and clinical outcomes. Along with the serial developments mentioned&#xD;
      above, the BNHI ( the sole healthcare insurance organization in Taiwan ) has been fully&#xD;
      involved, from the very beginning, in the formation and development of these performance&#xD;
      measures which have totally been included in the development of the Diabetes Case Management&#xD;
      Program ( DCMP ) 2001 later on. The DCMP 2001 is a unique program that has been delivered&#xD;
      into the nation-wide clinical practices since Dec. 2001 in Taiwan. It has linked the quality&#xD;
      of diabetes care to the monthly income ( reimbursed from BNHI ) of the registered clinical&#xD;
      diabetes educators ( i.e., physicians, nurses and dietitians ) for enhancing and assuring the&#xD;
      complete implementation of these performance measures in diabetes care. It has been&#xD;
      recognized that a consensus on measures at national level could provide a method for&#xD;
      assessing care within and across healthcare settings while providing a meaningful mechanism&#xD;
      for quality improvement. In this proposal, we are going to develop the Diabetes Quality&#xD;
      Improvement Program ( DQIP ) based on the DCMP 2001 in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, we are going to establish the continuous diabetes quality monitoring system and&#xD;
      then to evaluate the (1) the lifestyles and eating habits and dietary compositions in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (2)The relationships between lifestyles and eating habits and dietary&#xD;
      compositions in diabesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is now a global epidemic; it is the fourth or fifth leading cause of death in most&#xD;
      developed and newly industrialized countries. People with diabetes mean a long-term condition&#xD;
      that deserves effective and efficient care throughout their lives. Complications caused by&#xD;
      diabetes, such as coronary artery and peripheral vascular diseases, stroke, diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy, amputations, renal failure and blindness are resulting in increasing disability,&#xD;
      reduced life expectancy and, even more apprehensive, enormous healthcare related expense for&#xD;
      virtually every society ( 1, 2 ). Diabetes is certainly one of the most challenging health&#xD;
      issues in the 21st century.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most recent epidemiological data suggested that the diabetes population in Taiwan has&#xD;
      reached one million ( 3 ). People with diabetes using the healthcare insurance regularly for&#xD;
      their diabetes care, however, were only 60 % of total diabetes population. Nevertheless, this&#xD;
      60 % of Taiwan diabetes population had already consumed more than 12 % of total national&#xD;
      annual healthcare expenditure in taking care of them. In fact, this diabetes population was&#xD;
      merely one- forties of Taiwan population as a whole. Even the worst thing was that more than&#xD;
      60 % of the whole yearly healthcare budget for taking care of diabetes had gone into the&#xD;
      treatment of diabetes-related complications ( 4,5 ). We have recently learned from some of&#xD;
      the prevention trials, such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial ( DCCT ) in type&#xD;
      1 diabetes and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) in type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      that effective and adequate performance of metabolic and blood pressure control in patients&#xD;
      with diabetes would be able to delay or even prevent the diabetes-related complications ( 6-8&#xD;
      ). These interventions, if broadly implemented, would help to improve the living quality of&#xD;
      diabetes patients, and as well as to consequently make the biggest gain out of healthcare&#xD;
      expenditure ( 9 ). In order to assess more completely the levels of diabetes care delivered&#xD;
      in Taiwan, we now have nationally standardized performance measures that can evaluate quality&#xD;
      of diabetes care accurately and reliably. These performance measures were seriously reviewed&#xD;
      and discussed in the aspects of their practicability, feasibility and compliancy, through a&#xD;
      series of nation-wide consensus meetings by a number of multidisciplinary professionals of&#xD;
      Taiwan Diabetes Care Teams ( TDCTs ), before delivering into the clinical settings ( 10 ).&#xD;
&#xD;

      improve diabetes care and clinical outcomes. Along with the serial developments mentioned&#xD;
