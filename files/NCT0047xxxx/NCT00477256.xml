      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine illness-related factors (i.e., severity of illness, quality of life rating)&#xD;
           as predictors or correlates of child adjustment to pediatric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine illness-related factors (i.e., severity of illness, quality of life rating)&#xD;
           as predictors of school reintegration (i.e., school attendance) in children with&#xD;
           pediatric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine a within-parent factor (i.e., parental stress) as a predictor or correlate of&#xD;
           child adjustment to pediatric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine a within-parent factor (i.e., parental stress) as a predictor or correlate of&#xD;
           school reintegration (i.e., school attendance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine a second within-parent factor (i.e., parental perception of child&#xD;
           vulnerability) as a predictor or correlate of child adjustment to pediatric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine a second within-parent factor (i.e., parental perception of child&#xD;
           vulnerability) as a predictor or correlate of school reintegration (i.e., school&#xD;
           attendance) in children with pediatric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To develop a statistical model by which relative contributions of each predictor&#xD;
           variable (i.e., severity of illness, quality of life, parental stress, parental&#xD;
           perception of child vulnerability), as well as their interrelatedness, can be understood&#xD;
           in relation to child adjustment. Exploration of each variable's contribution will affect&#xD;
           the schematic organization of the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine demographic variables as covariates in the primary analyses. The variables&#xD;
           include: child's age, gender, grade, ethnicity, diagnosis, time since diagnosis, type&#xD;
           and duration of treatment, and time since school reintegration.&#xD;

      Consent for Child Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PARTICIPATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete 3 paper-and-pencil questionnaires&#xD;
      that will be used to get information about your health status and overall well being. You&#xD;
      will be asked how you are feeling at this time, whether you worry a lot of the time, how&#xD;
      often you feel sad, and how physically active you are, such as with walking and running. The&#xD;
      study staff is also interested in knowing how well you are keeping up with school activities&#xD;
      and how often you attend school. Finally, your doctor will provide information about your&#xD;
      illness and describe how it may affect your participation at home or at school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are age 8 or above, it should take about 30-45 minutes to complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
      If you are between age 6 and 7, it should take about 10-15 minutes to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your parent or caregiver may be present while you complete your questionnaires. However, you&#xD;
      are encouraged you to give your own answers. The questionnaires may be completed in The&#xD;
      Children's Cancer Hospital clinic or elsewhere, and a research assistant will assist you, if&#xD;
      you need help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over once you have completed the 3 questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 106 children will take part in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent for Medical Staff Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child Adjustment to Pediatric Cancer and School Reintegration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to examine illness-related factors (such as severity of illness and quality&#xD;
      of life) as predictors or correlates of adjustment to pediatric cancer and predictors of&#xD;
      school reintegration (such as school attendance) of children with pediatric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete one, 7-item paper-and-pencil&#xD;
      measure that will be used to obtain information about your patient's current health status.&#xD;
      For example, the first question asks, &quot;On a Likert scale of 1 to 7, describe the degree of&#xD;
      impairment for this child.&quot; One (1) indicates &quot;Independent functioning, requires no&#xD;
      assistance,&quot; and 7 indicates &quot;Requires complete assistance.&quot; It should take about 2-5 minutes&#xD;
      to complete the measure in the clinic or your office, and it can be done during regular work&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be asked to describe information on the child's severity of illness. For&#xD;
      example, you will be asked to describe the degree of impairment, frequency of medical&#xD;
      procedures/hospitalizations, and your understanding of the child's participation in community&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over once you have completed the measure. Study&#xD;
      results will be published and mailed to each medical staff participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 24 medical staff members will take part in this&#xD;
      study. All will be enrolled in this study at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent for Parent or Caregiver Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child Adjustment to Pediatric Cancer and School Reintegration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn about illness-related factors (such as severity of illness and&#xD;
      quality of life) that may show how well children with cancer adjust to the disease and return&#xD;
      to a traditional school setting (by looking at school attendance, for example).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete 5 paper-and-pencil questionnaires&#xD;
      that will be used to get information about you and your child's health status. Questions will&#xD;
      be about your child's physical, emotional, and social functioning as well as how they are&#xD;
      functioning in school. You will be asked to rate how much of a problem you think your child&#xD;
      may be having in these areas. You will also be asked about how often difficult events have&#xD;
      occurred for you as a parent or caregiver of a child with cancer. These questionnaires should&#xD;
      take about 45 minutes to 1 hour to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Child's Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your child will also be asked to complete 3 paper-and-pencil questionnaires that will also be&#xD;
      used to get information about his or her health status, as well as his or her overall well&#xD;
      being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be present with your child while he or she is completing the questionnaires, if you&#xD;
      choose. However, you are encouraged to allow the child to complete the questionnaires on his&#xD;
      or her own so as not to influence the child's answers. A research assistant will be glad to&#xD;
      assist your child with his or her completion of the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location for Completion of Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires for both you and the child may be completed in a private consultation room&#xD;
      or examination room in The Children's Cancer Hospital clinic, or they may be completed&#xD;
      outside of the room or clinic and returned to study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they are completed outside of the room or clinic, you can hand deliver the questionnaires&#xD;
      to the clinic in an envelope, or you can mail them back to study staff in a postage-paid&#xD;
      return envelope that can be provided to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over once you have completed the 5 questionnaires.&#xD;
      You may receive a summary of the study's findings at the end of the study if you make this&#xD;
      request to the study researcher who gave the questionnaires to the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 106 parents or caregivers will take part in this&#xD;
      study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
