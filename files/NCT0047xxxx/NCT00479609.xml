    <textblock>
      Men with metabolic syndrome often have lower than normal testosterone levels and low&#xD;
      testosterone levels have been suggested to predispose for development of type2 diabetes. The&#xD;
      aim of the study is to evaluate if normalisation of serum testosterone levels in men with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (Abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and&#xD;
      pre-diabetes or overt type diabetes)improves sensitivity to insulin and improves the signs of&#xD;
      the metabolic syndrome&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background The metabolic syndrome constitutes a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease with increased morbidity and mortality. In essence the metabolic syndrome is referred&#xD;
      to as a concomitant occurrence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance&#xD;
      with insulin resistance and abdominal obesity. The presence of abdominal obesity seems to be&#xD;
      a key factor in development of the metabolic derangements that occur and is a part of all&#xD;
      different definitions that are currently used as diagnostic criteria's for the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. A number of studies have verified a serious prognosis for males (and females)&#xD;
      presenting with the abdominal obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term metabolic syndrome alludes to a common mechanism behind the development of the&#xD;
      different sings of this condition but so far the etiological interrelationship is not known.&#xD;
      In males with the metabolic syndrome low serum testosterone levels is a common finding and&#xD;
      data from some longitudinal studies suggest that low testosterone levels precedes the&#xD;
      development of abdominal obesity and seem to facilitate later development of hypertension,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. A few smaller studies have tested the hypothesis that&#xD;
      testosterone therapy may have a beneficial metabolic effect in males with the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome and implicated that low testosterone levels is a part of disease facilitating&#xD;
      factors in these males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current study The current study &quot;ARTinMMS&quot; is an interventional phase IV study in males&#xD;
      (30-70 years inclusive) with early stages of the metabolic syndrome defined as abdominal&#xD;
      obesity, glucose intolerance or overt type 2 diabetes defined according to the criteria's&#xD;
      suggested by the International Federation for Diabetes. The study is a 24 weeks randomized&#xD;
      placebo controlled parallel group multi-centre study where males with serum testosterone&#xD;
      levels below 12 nmol/L will be treated with testosterone/placebo (total duration of study&#xD;
      including follow-up visit 26-27 weeks). The primary endpoint of the study is assessment of&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity by measurement of fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels and&#xD;
      calculated according to the QUICKI formula. In addition glucose tolerance will be tested with&#xD;
      a standard oral glucose tolerance test as well as assessment of blood lipids and blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 176 males will be recruited and randomized for the study after a screening&#xD;
      procedure to verify eligibility for the study. Males who can participate must fulfil a series&#xD;
      of inclusion and exclusion criteria, which in addition to the metabolic syndrome and low&#xD;
      testosterone levels require HbA1c levels below 7,5%, stable blood pressure control and&#xD;
      cholesterol levels below 8 mmol/L. Medical treatment for these conditions are accepted but&#xD;
      diabetes treatment is limited to metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before entering into the study and during the study males will be followed with blood tests&#xD;
      and glucose tolerance assessment and physical examination. In all the study requires five&#xD;
      clinical visits, Base-line observations and randomization visit, two visits during the&#xD;
      treatment phase (after 12 and 23 weeks of therapy) and a follow-up visit after cessation of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few exploratory variables will be assess such as markers for changes in cholesterol&#xD;
      metabolism, adiponectin and all subjects in the study will be characterized with genotype&#xD;
      analysis of CAG repeat polymorphism of the androgen receptor. A subset of patients will be&#xD;
      examined with CT of the abdomen to assess eventual changes in intra abdominal fat mass and&#xD;
      liver attenuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety procedures involve assessment of the prostate (digital rectal examination and PSA&#xD;
      levels) and Hb levels at baseline and throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication Males enrolled in the study will be treated with daily application of 7,5 g&#xD;
      of a 1% testosterone hydroalcoholic gel (75 mg of testosterone applied on specified skin&#xD;
      sites) or a placebo gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time plan The study is planned to start in q2 2007 at 12 different centres, in Austria,&#xD;
      Germany and Sweden. Each centre is anticipated to recruit 10 -30 subjects during a 2 months&#xD;
      period. To facilitate recruitment newspaper advertising and web based eligibility screening&#xD;
      will be used if feasible. After an 1-3 weeks screening period eligible subjects are&#xD;
      randomized to active or placebo therapy. Two evaluations are made during the treatment phase&#xD;
      the first after 12 and the second after 24 weeks. Efficacy and safety assessments are&#xD;
      performed at these visits. Competitive enrolment is used after the first six weeks of the&#xD;
      recruitment period enabling all centres to recruit an up-front agreed number of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data capturing and laboratory routines A centralized internet based system will be used for&#xD;
      data capturing, communication with the study staff and automatic entry of laboratory data.&#xD;
      All laboratory analysis will be performed at or through a core laboratory (LFK in Kiel). A&#xD;
      paper CRF will be used for primary entry of patient data which are subsequently transcribed&#xD;
      into an electronic CRF. All study centres will be trained during the investigators meeting in&#xD;
      management of the data capturing system&#xD;
