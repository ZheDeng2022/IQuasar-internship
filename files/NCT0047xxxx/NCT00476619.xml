      Full Title: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Procrit for the Prevention of Acute Renal&#xD;
      Failure in Patients Receiving Intravenous Contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a one-time dose of intravenous erythropoietin&#xD;
      administration in the prevention or attenuation of contrast-induced acute renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To evaluate serum and urinary markers of renal injury, including KIM-1,&#xD;
      BMP-7, and TGF-b, along with other biomarkers, in subjects receiving intravenous contrast and&#xD;
      correlate their expression with clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, multi-centered, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial&#xD;
      of a one-time dose of EPO. Subjects will be followed for seven days or until hospital&#xD;
      discharge, whichever is longer. Total estimated study duration 3 years.&#xD;

      Adult subjects with or without diabetes mellitus Eligibility Criteria: undergoing intravenous&#xD;
      contrast administration for computerized axial tomography (CAT Scan) as inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be excluded if they have end-stage renal disease (on dialysis or peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis); any known history of acute renal failure; have hemoglobin ³ 12.0 g/dL; history of&#xD;
      use of erythropoietin replacement or transfusion within the prior 3 days; use&#xD;
      Glucophage/Metformin or Glucovance; are unable to give their written informed consent; have&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability; have uncontrolled hypertension; have any history of current&#xD;
      malignancy, where current malignancy is defined as subjects undergoing treatment with&#xD;
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy, subjects with known metastatic disease, and those with&#xD;
      terminal malignant disease; any history of MI, CVA, active angina or unstable angina within&#xD;
      the past three months ; are pregnant or lactating; allergic to intravenous contrast, iodine,&#xD;
      erythropoietin, mammalian-cell derived products, or human albumin; patients with seizure&#xD;
      disorders or have CT scan done as hospital outpatients.&#xD;
