    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose of XL844 in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine, how often it should be taken, and how well people with cancer tolerate the&#xD;
      combination of gemcitabine and XL844.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has a histologically confirmed advanced malignancy (solid tumor or&#xD;
             lymphoma) that is metastatic or unresectable, and for which standard curative or&#xD;
             palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective, and there are no&#xD;
             therapies known to prolong survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has disease that is assessable by tumor marker, physical, or radiologic&#xD;
             means.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject is ≥18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of ≤2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has adequate organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has the capability of understanding the informed consent document and has&#xD;
             signed the informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Sexually active subjects (male and female) must use medically acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. If a subject has received more than three prior regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy,&#xD;
             more than two biologic regimens, or more than 3000 cGy to &gt;25% of his or her bone&#xD;
             marrow, the investigator must discuss with the sponsor regarding subject suitability&#xD;
             before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The subject has had no other diagnosis of malignancy (unless non-melanoma skin cancer,&#xD;
             in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or a malignancy diagnosed ≥5 years ago, and has had&#xD;
             no evidence of disease for 5 years prior to screening for this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has received anticancer treatment (eg, chemotherapy, radiotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational agent, or hormones) within 14 days&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has not recovered to Grade ≤1 from adverse events (AEs) due to&#xD;
             investigational agents or other medications administered more than 30 days prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has received radiation to &gt;25% of his or her bone marrow within 30 days of&#xD;
             XL844 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has a primary brain tumor or known brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully&#xD;
             with the investigator or designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the components of the&#xD;
             XL844 formulation or gemcitabine.&#xD;
