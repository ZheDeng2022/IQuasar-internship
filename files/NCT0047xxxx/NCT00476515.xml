      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conversion of a positive donor specific cross-match to a living donor to a negative&#xD;
           cross-match thereby allowing successful renal transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transplant success or failure following the desensitization protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the effect of rituximab on the kinetics of donor specific antibodies&#xD;
           (DSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the effect of rituximab on the kinetics of B-cell subpopulations in&#xD;
           peripheral blood and/or secondary lymphoid organs (lymph node biopsies at time of&#xD;
           transplant, if available) in both responders and non-responders using flow cytometry&#xD;
           and/or immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Decrease in incidence of humoral rejection to less than 50 % at 1 year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with a donor specific antibody, a protocol of plasmapheresis and intravenous&#xD;
      immunoglobulin has been used to remove circulating antibodies and suppress antibody&#xD;
      production. While this therapy is effective at enabling transplantation, it has a reported&#xD;
      failure rate of 50% (Personal communication, Johns Hopkins' group); it is expensive (average&#xD;
      cost of protocol $55,000.00 does not include transplant surgery costs; personal&#xD;
      communication: Johns Hopkins' group) and may be fraught with infectious complications&#xD;
      particularly when combined with current immunosuppression protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no effective treatment protocol designed to desensitize end stage renal&#xD;
      disease patients with a high Panel of Reactive Antibodies (PRA) (i.e., &gt;70%). Patients with&#xD;
      elevated PRA levels have a longer median organ waiting time when compared to those with lower&#xD;
      PRA. Patients with elevated PRA have decreased allograft survival when compared to controls.&#xD;
      It has been reported that 50% of cadaveric kidneys transplanted into high PRA recipients&#xD;
      (&gt;20%) suffered of rejection within 6 months of transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiologically, an elevated PRA or a donor specific antibody is acquired through the&#xD;
      sensitization of the host against major histocompatibility antigens (HLA) following multiple&#xD;
      blood transfusions, prior pregnancy or organ transplantation. The constant levels of anti-HLA&#xD;
      antibodies are maintained through the persistent stimulation of naïve and memory B-cells by&#xD;
      these antigens. The number of patients with a high PRA and/or donor specific antibodies is&#xD;
      expected to increase as more patients with failed kidney transplants are entering the waiting&#xD;
      list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although initially introduced for the treatment of neoplasms, the humoral immunosuppressant&#xD;
      effects of Rituximab have been shown to have clinical significance. In an attempt to&#xD;
      understand the humoral immunosuppressant effects of Rituximab Gonzalez-Stawinski et al.,&#xD;
      reported the effects of the monoclonal on a de-novo and memory humoral immune response. Their&#xD;
      work showed that Rituximab interferes with both primary and secondary humoral responses by&#xD;
      eliminating B-cells prior to antigen exposure thus interfering with differentiation into&#xD;
      antibody secreting cells and specific antibody production (Gonzalez-Stawinski)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enthusiasm for these data resulted in small, single center experiences using Rituximab in the&#xD;
      post-transplant and pre-transplant settings. Post-transplantation, Becker et al. utilized&#xD;
      Rituximab as rescue therapy in 4 kidney transplant patients who developed acute humoral&#xD;
      rejection. These patients had failed conventional rescue therapy (high dose intravenous&#xD;
      steroids, and plasmapheresis with IVIg), but transplants were salvaged by a single dose of&#xD;
      Rituximab (375mg/M2) as demonstrated by improvements in creatinine clearances. Also in a&#xD;
      post-transplant setting, Samaniego et al. successfully utilized Rituximab in a small&#xD;
      population of highly sensitized renal transplant patients with positive donor specific&#xD;
      crossmatch who failed the standard plasmapheresis and IVIg protocol. Pre-transplantation,&#xD;
      Vieira et al were able to reduce the concentrations of anti-HLA antibodies after the&#xD;
      administration of a single dose of Rituximab. Fifty percent of these patients had their PRA's&#xD;
      decrease by nearly 40% of baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these small clinical reports, Rituximab has been an effective humoral immunosuppressant&#xD;
      that eliminates the cell population responsible for anti-HLA antibody production by virtue of&#xD;
      the modulation of naïve or memory B-cells prior to/or during HLA stimulation. However, the&#xD;
      effect of a schema of multiple doses of Rituximab on donor specific crossmatch is yet to be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
