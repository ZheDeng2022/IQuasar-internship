      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to complete a cost analysis of the different methods used for&#xD;
      clubfoot treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term objective: To explore the experience of British Columbia Children's Hospital&#xD;
      (BCCH) with costs and outcomes related to the various forms of clubfoot management since 1984&#xD;
      to present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term objective: To use the information gathered in this project and apply it to future&#xD;
      studies in the clubfoot research program and to do a complete cost-benefit analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The hypothesis of the study is that the BCCH clubfoot treatment program has&#xD;
      better outcomes in terms of reduced financial costs than the traditional surgical management.&#xD;

      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who were diagnosed and treated for idiopathic clubfoot at BCCH between January&#xD;
      1984 and present are eligible for the study. Patients whose clubfoot is a secondary diagnosis&#xD;
      to another disorder (mal-position, neuromuscular disorder and chromosomal abnormality) are&#xD;
      excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using information gathered from literature review and interviews with several of the&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeons at BCCH the most common treatment methods for clubfoot and the ones that&#xD;
      are and have been in use in BCCH were identified. Six treatment methods were then described&#xD;
      in detail. These treatment methods are: comprehensive release, posterio-medial release,&#xD;
      posterior release, Kite-method, Ponseti-method and BCCH-method. From all different&#xD;
      treatment-steps possible &quot;units&quot; were designed. The units that were designed are: initial&#xD;
      consult, clinic visit, consult physiotherapist, consult occupational therapist, OT-splint,&#xD;
      consult orthotist, X-ray, Boots and Bars, AFO by orthotist, custom orthotic, shoes, surgery,&#xD;
      cast applied during surgery, surgery second foot, surgery extra, anaesthesia extra 1-3,&#xD;
      daycare surgery, overnight stay in hospital, gastrosoleus defunctioning using Botox, Botox,&#xD;
      gait analysis and non-clubfoot related hospital encounter. Per unit there are more treatment&#xD;
      &quot;options&quot; available. For example in the unit &quot;clinic visit&quot;, there are 18 options, such as&#xD;
      clinic visit, clinic visit with manipulation and casting using plaster of paris below knee,&#xD;
      clinic visit with manipulation and casting using plaster of paris above knee, clinic visit&#xD;
      with manipulation and casting using 3-M soft cast below knee. Within the unit &quot;X-ray&quot; there&#xD;
      are 3 options such as unilateral X-ray of the foot, bilateral X-ray of the foot, X-ray of the&#xD;
      pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More units were designed that are not part of the treatment, but do have their impact on the&#xD;
      costs concerning the treatment and therefore have to be considered. These units are: number&#xD;
      of persons traveling, days away form home, lost wages, air transportation, ground transport,&#xD;
      mileage, accommodation and meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these units, together with patient demographics (patient ID, last name, first name,&#xD;
      gender, hometown and distance to BCCH) and intervention type (one of the 6 treatment-regimes&#xD;
      that the patient fits in) formed the database, which was set up in the Microsoft Excel&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients that are eligible for this study were identified using the hospital data&#xD;
      retrieval system. The patient's hospital medical records will be collected and chart review&#xD;
      will be performed. Patient data will be entered into the database, using one line for every&#xD;
      visit (either as an inpatient or as an outpatient) to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costing Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct costs: A detailed breakdown of all &quot;parts&quot; constituting the units was performed.&#xD;
      Costing information on all these parts was then obtained using a great variety of sources,&#xD;
      including the MSP-billing book, personal communication with a pharmacy- representative and&#xD;
      interviews with nursing representatives, an expert in the financial department and experts in&#xD;
      the decision support department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General overhead costs: The general overhead costs will be determined using information from&#xD;
      the decision support services and from the Orthopaedic department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: It is a cost analysis between the different methods of orthopaedic treatment&#xD;
      for clubfoot. Statistical analysis will be completed on all continuous variables. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be completed using SAS Statistical Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).&#xD;
