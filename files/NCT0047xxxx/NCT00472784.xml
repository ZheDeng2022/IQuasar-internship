      OBJECTIVE: 1. To study tissues from spinal cord injured patients with noncompliant bladders&#xD;
      as well as neurologically intact patients with normal bladder compliance, analyzing both&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative neural efferent receptors, collagen, and smooth muscle contents,&#xD;
      using RT-PCR and electron microscopy. 2. To explore the possible shift in bladder neural&#xD;
      architecture after SCI from beta to alpha-adrenergic receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN: 25 spinal cord injury patients who underwent cystoscopic procedures will be&#xD;
      included in this study. 25 control patients without spinal cord injury and already scheduled&#xD;
      for urologic procedures will also be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY: Study patients will undergo flexible or rigid cystoscopy as well as selective&#xD;
      cold cup biopsies of the posterior and lateral walls, and trigonal area of the bladder.&#xD;
      Control patents will undergo cystoscopy and selected bladder biopsies preceding their&#xD;
      scheduled urologic procedures. Tissue samples will be frozen for later EM and RT-PCR analysis&#xD;
      of collagen, smooth muscle, and efferent adrenergic receptor content and subtype. Hemostasis&#xD;
      will be achieved with a cautery electrode. Criteria of exclusion include active urinary tract&#xD;
      infection identified by preoperative urinalysis, or the presence of suspicious lesions seen&#xD;
      during cystoscopy. Suspicious areas will be biopsied and the patient will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be given a preoperative dose of Rocephin 1g IM as well as a postoperative 3-day&#xD;
      course of Cipro 500 mg BID. Control patients will be given standard perioperative&#xD;
      prophylactic/empiric therapy as indicated for their urologic procedure. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed in 1-2 weeks to evaluate their postoperative course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINDINGS: Total number of subjects enrolled: 43. 12-03: To date we have not encountered any&#xD;
      problems with the study and health wise the subjects have done fine. No adverse events have&#xD;
      been reported. Preliminary Results: The tissue is currently being analyzed - mRNA by&#xD;
      microchip analysis and the data is still being worked on to look for correlations in genes up&#xD;
      or down regulation versus the morphological EM findings previously reported.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-five (25) spinal cord injury patients, as part of their annual cystoscopic screening&#xD;
      for squamous cell carcinoma, will be included in this study. Approximately twenty-five (25)&#xD;
      control patients without spinal cord injury and already scheduled for cystoscopic procedures&#xD;
      (transurethral resection of the prostate TURP for benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH,&#xD;
      transurethral resection of low-grade superficial bladder tumor TURBT, or lithotripsy of&#xD;
      urinary stones) will be included in this study. Enrollment of additional patients is&#xD;
      necessary to increase the statistical power to demonstrate significant difference between the&#xD;
      study and control groups. Preliminary results revealed that electron microscopy was accurate&#xD;
      at differentiating neurogenic detrusor muscle from normal. There was a strong trend towards&#xD;
      increased type I/type III collagen expression in SCI patients versus normal, but recruitment&#xD;
      of more patients is necessary to demonstrate unequivocally a statistical difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo flexible or rigid cystoscopy as well as selective cold cup biopsies of&#xD;
      the posterior and lateral walls, and trigonal area of the bladder. Bladder mapping (diagram&#xD;
      attached) will be performed to document specific areas biopsied. Tissue samples will be&#xD;
      frozen for later RT-PCR analysis of collagen, smooth muscle, and efferent adrenergic receptor&#xD;
      content and subtype. No anesthesia will be required in the SCI study patients. Control group&#xD;
      patients will undergo anesthesia as indicated by their TURP or cystoscopic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemostasis will be achieved with a cautery electrode. Criteria for exclusion include active&#xD;
      urinary tract infection identified by preoperative urinalysis. Patients with low-grade&#xD;
      superficial bladder tumor, which has a classic cystoscopic appearance, is no longer excluded&#xD;
      from the study since directed cold cup bladder biopsies at sites away from the visible tumor&#xD;
      (obtained from the posterior, both lateral walls, as well as the trigone of the bladder) is&#xD;
      now considered standard of care to rule out occult carcinoma-in-situ (CIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic perioperative antibiotics will be employed. Patients will be followed in 1-2&#xD;
      weeks to evaluate their postoperative course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual cystoscopy in spinal cord injured patients to screen for squamous cell carcinoma as&#xD;
      well as preoperative cystoscopy in TURP, TURBT, and lithotripsy candidates is considered&#xD;
      standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective bladder biopsies of normal appearing bladder mucosa and muscle are included as part&#xD;
      of this study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients will be given a preoperative dose of Rocephin 1 gm IM as well as a&#xD;
      postoperative 3-day course of Cipro 500mg BD. Control patients will be given standard&#xD;
      perioperative prophylactic/empiric therapy as indicated for their scheduled cystoscopic&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients will be scheduled for two visits. The first visit as part of their annual&#xD;
      exam, to include cystoscopy, and bladder biopsies, will last approximately one hour. The&#xD;
      second visit, two weeks later, will examine the patient's postoperative course. This visit&#xD;
      will last approximately 15 minutes. Control patients will undergo cystoscopy and selected&#xD;
      bladder biopsies preceding their already scheduled cystoscopic surgery.&#xD;
