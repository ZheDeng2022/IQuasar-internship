      This study will collect fluid and tissue specimens from the lungs and nose of healthy people&#xD;
      and people with a history of lung infections. The specimens will be examined for differences&#xD;
      between the two groups that may be associated with susceptibility to certain infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people with a history of lung infections between 18 and 75&#xD;
      years of age who are followed at NIH may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treadmill exercise stress test (for people over 45 years old with a history of chest pain or&#xD;
      ECG abnormalities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy: The subject s nose and throat are numbed with lidocaine and a sedative is given&#xD;
      for comfort. A thin flexible tube called a bronchoscope is advanced through the nose or mouth&#xD;
      into the lung airways to examine the airways carefully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid collection during the bronchoscopy using one of the following methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bronchoalveolar lavage: Salt water is injected through the bronchoscope into the lung&#xD;
           and immediately suctioned out, washing off cells lining the airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bronchial brushings: A brush-tipped wire enclosed in a sheath is passed through the&#xD;
           bronchoscope and a small area of the airway tissue is gently brushed. The brush is&#xD;
           withdrawn with some tissue adhering to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endobronchial biopsies: Small pinchers on a wire are passed through the bronchoscope and&#xD;
           about 1 to 2 millimeters of tissue is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasal scrape: A small device is used to scrape along the inside of the nose to collect&#xD;
           some cells.&#xD;

      This research protocol involves one or more of the following procedures in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      and patients with known or suspected predisposition to respiratory infection who are enrolled&#xD;
      in National Institutes of Health (NIH) protocols: 1) Adults only: bronchoscopy with sampling&#xD;
      of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and epithelial cells in healthy adult volunteers and&#xD;
      patients; 2) Adults and Children: sputum induction for collection of sputum specimens; 3)&#xD;
      Adults and Children: nasal mucosal biopsies and brushings for sampling of epithelial cells;&#xD;
      4) Adults and Children: measurement of nasal nitric oxide production; 5) Adults and children:&#xD;
      collection of exhaled breath condensate; 6) Adults and children: measurement of nasal&#xD;
      potential difference; 7) Adults and children: exhaled aerosol mask sample collection. The&#xD;
      cellular and acellular samples will be separated, and stored or transferred to the&#xD;
      appropriate laboratories investigating these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alveolar macrophages are the predominant (greater than 95%) cell type present in the lavage&#xD;
      of normal subjects. Alveolar macrophages play a central role in the initiation and&#xD;
      propagation of lung inflammation by releasing cytokines (i.e., interleukin-1, tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor) and chemokines (i.e., interleukin-8, monocyte chemotactic protein, macrophage&#xD;
      inflammatory protein) that activate other resident cells and recruit inflammatory cells to a&#xD;
      local nidus of inflammation. Airway epithelial cells are known to release a variety of&#xD;
      mediators as well. Thus, the interaction of cells with mediators generated by alveolar cells&#xD;
      and bronchial epithelial cells during acute inflammation is a key element in the initiation&#xD;
      of pulmonary inflammatory responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), bronchial brushings, and mucosal biopsies are standard&#xD;
      diagnostic techniques done through the bronchoscope to obtain samples of alveolar and&#xD;
      bronchial specimens for diagnosis of infection, malignancy, or non-infectious inflammation.&#xD;
      Nasal mucosal scrape biopsy is a minimally invasive method of obtaining airway epithelial&#xD;
      cells to diagnose disorders of airway clearance associated with abnormal cilia (hair-like&#xD;
      structures on airway lining cells). Sputum induction is a routinely performed procedure to&#xD;
      facilitate the collection of respiratory secretions (mucus) through stimulation of cough with&#xD;
      inhalation of an aerosolized concentrated salt-water solution. Exhaled breath condensate is&#xD;
      simply collected by breathing normally through a plastic tube inserted into a chilled&#xD;
      cylinder. Nasal potential difference is performed by placing a small needle under the skin of&#xD;
      the forearm that is connected to a salt solution bridge and resting a small catheter on the&#xD;
      surface of the nose through which various salt solutions are dripped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to analyze bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, airway epithelial&#xD;
      cells, sputum, and exhaled breath specimens and bedside physiologic measurements from healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and from patients who acquire respiratory infections to look for differences in&#xD;
      immune function and to discover new pathways of infectious disease susceptibility. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that studying cellular responses to infection and inflammatory markers released&#xD;
      from these cells will further our understanding of human susceptibility to respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five hundred fifty subjects (250 healthy volunteers and 300 patients) will undergo one or&#xD;
      more of the following: 1) bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings,&#xD;
      endobronchial biopsies; 2) nasal mucosal scrape and/or brush biopsies; 3) sputum inductions&#xD;
      4) exhaled breath condensate to obtain specimens for in vitro investigations and comparisons&#xD;
      of both the cellular and acellular components. Bedside measurements 5) nasal nitric oxide&#xD;
      production and 6) nasal potential difference 7) exhaled aerosol mask sample collection may be&#xD;
      done to assess epithelial cell functions in real-time.&#xD;
