      The principal aim of this project is to investigate reports of developing artemisinin&#xD;
      resistance in Cambodia using an integrated in vivo - in vitro approach to examine recent&#xD;
      alarming reports of treatment failures with advanced combination therapies along the&#xD;
      Thai-Cambodian border, which could have major impact on the malaria situation in the affected&#xD;
      areas as well as the rest of the malaria-endemic world.&#xD;

      A total number of 90 volunteers with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to be treated with either artesunate monotherapy for 7 days or the combination of&#xD;
      quinine and tetracycline over 7 days (following the 2nd line national treatment guideline of&#xD;
      the national malaria control program) at a ratio of 2:1. The study design will be based on&#xD;
      the WHO recommendations for the 'Assessment and Monitoring of Antimalarial Drug Efficacy for&#xD;
      the Treatment of Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria' (WHO, 2003). Study participants will be&#xD;
      otherwise healthy malaria patients (adult men and non-pregnant women aged 18 to 65 years)&#xD;
      with uncomplicated falciparum malaria recruited in Battambong Province, Cambodia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The artesunate will be administered orally (a single dose of 200 mg per day) over a total&#xD;
      duration of 7 days (Directly Observed Therapy). Quinine (30 mg/kg/day) plus tetracycline (25&#xD;
      mg/kg/day) will also be administered over 7 days in split dose every 8 hours following the&#xD;
      national treatment guidelines of Cambodia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be admitted to the hospital for the duration of study drug administration or&#xD;
      until all signs and symptoms of malaria have disappeared, whichever comes first. Thereafter&#xD;
      until Day 21 patients have to remain in a malaria-free environment (such as Sampov Luon or Ta&#xD;
      Sanh) either in the hospital or in a living facility provided at the study site where the&#xD;
      patients will be supervised by study personnel. After Day 21 they will be followed as&#xD;
      outpatients until Day 28 with a scheduled follow-up visit on Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro drug sensitivity assays will be performed from samples on inclusion and in case of&#xD;
      recrudescence. Drug levels will be measured in the artesunate arm on the first and last day&#xD;
      of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary clinical outcome is cure (Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response - ACPR) on&#xD;
      Day 28. Secondary outcome measures are time until parasite, fever, and gametocyte clearance&#xD;
      (PCT, FCT, and GCT). Parasite genotyping will be used to distinguish recrudescences from&#xD;
      reinfections by PCR. Subjects will be monitored for clinical adverse events throughout the&#xD;
      study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn on the day of admission (before initiating therapy) for in vitro drug&#xD;
      sensitivity testing and for PCR (markers of drug resistance and to distinguish recrudescence&#xD;
      from reinfection by genotyping). Malaria smears will be prepared up to 4 times a day until&#xD;
      parasite clearance and on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28 or whenever symptoms consistent with malaria&#xD;
      appear. Plasma samples for determining drug levels will be obtained on the first and last day&#xD;
      of therapy. Over the entire study, up to approximately 64 ml of blood may be drawn by&#xD;
      venipuncture. Study participation for each individual will be 28 days.&#xD;

          -  Acute symptomatic falciparum malaria infection as determined by malaria smear with a&#xD;
             parasite density of 100 to 100,000 asexual parasites/uL as determined on the screening&#xD;
             smear with fever (defined as &gt;=37.5ÂºC), or reported history of fever within the last&#xD;
