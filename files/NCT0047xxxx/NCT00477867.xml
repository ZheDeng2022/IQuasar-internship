      RATIONALE: Gathering information about patients with ovarian cancer over time may help&#xD;
      doctors learn more about a patient's use of medical services and the cost of these services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is collecting information about the patient's health and use of&#xD;
      medical resources over time in patients with stage III ovarian cancer receiving paclitaxel&#xD;
      and cisplatin on clinical trial GOG-172.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility of collecting data on medical resource utilization and costs&#xD;
           incurred in the care of patients with stage III ovarian cancer treated with intravenous&#xD;
           (IV) paclitaxel and cisplatin vs IV paclitaxel, intraperitoneal (IP) paclitaxel, and IP&#xD;
           cisplatin on a randomized, controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility of collecting data on resource utilization incurred outside&#xD;
           GOG institutions through the use of patient diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the work load required to collect this data, in terms of mean number of hours&#xD;
           required to complete medical resource utilization forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Data on medical resource units consumed (including length of hospital stay, length&#xD;
      of time using operating room, units of drugs and blood products administered, number of&#xD;
      diagnostic tests received, and number of physician visits needed) are collected on all&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed prior to randomization on clinical trial GOG-172, prior to the&#xD;
      fourth course of chemotherapy, after the sixth course of chemotherapy, and at 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months after the sixth course of chemotherapy. Patients complete diaries throughout treatment&#xD;
      with chemotherapy and for 12 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected are used for analysis of economic impact, quality of life, neurotoxicity, and&#xD;
      sociologic characteristics associated with these treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.&#xD;
