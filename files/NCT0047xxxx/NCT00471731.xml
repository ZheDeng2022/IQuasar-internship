  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature ovarian failure (POF) is known to be associated with an increased risk of ocular&#xD;
      surface disease (dry eye), likely due to the reduction of both estrogens and androgens seen&#xD;
      in this condition. From preliminary data, we suspect that women with Turners syndrome (45,&#xD;
      XO), a genetic abnormality that affects sex hormone levels, are also at increased risk of&#xD;
      ocular surface disease. Comparing POF and TS women may allow us to distinguish different&#xD;
      mechanisms for ocular surface disease, due to the different etiologies of hormonal (estrogen&#xD;
      and androgen) alterations posed by POF and TS.&#xD;
