      Objective: To compare outcomes in cesarean section patients undergoing bladder flap versus&#xD;
      none. Hypotheses: Operative time will be reduced with the elimination of a bladder flap&#xD;
      during cesarean delivery and intra-operative and post-operative morbidity will not be&#xD;
      significantly different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &gt;= 35 wks gestation undergoing cesarean delivery will be randomized to bladder flap&#xD;
      vs. none. Primary outcome is operative time (start to delivery); secondary outcomes include:&#xD;
      injuries, EBL, intra-operative and post-operative complications,pain medication, hospital&#xD;
      stay duration.&#xD;

      1. Title A Randomized Controlled Trial of Bladder Flap vs. None in Cesarean Section&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background (This section should be used to provide a rationale for the conduct of the&#xD;
           study. Refer to existent or preliminary studies as necessary) The standard of care in&#xD;
           performing cesarean delivery is to perform a bladder flap in the procedures.1 The&#xD;
           creation of a bladder flap essentially allows a surgeon to create a space between the&#xD;
           uterus and the bladder so that he/she has better access to the lower portion of the&#xD;
           uterus where a low transverse incision can be made. This procedure involves making a&#xD;
           superficial incision into the peritoneum, or the cell lining of the abdominal cavity,&#xD;
           and the moving the bladder down and away from the lower portion of the uterus. A&#xD;
           retractor or a bladder blade is then inserted into this space to hold the bladder away&#xD;
           from the uterus (see Appendix A).2 Use of the bladder flap in cesarean delivery dates&#xD;
           back to 1878 in the pre-antibiotic era,3 and theoretically, the bladder flap allows&#xD;
           better access to the low portion of the uterus while decreasing risk of bladder injury&#xD;
           and infection. However, several recent but small studies suggest the inclusion of the&#xD;
           bladder flap confers no advantage and may actually contribute to greater morbidity&#xD;
           postoperatively. 4-5 Additionally, the incidence of bladder injuries is 0.3%, and most&#xD;
           injuries resulted during the formation of the bladder flap.6 The evidence from these&#xD;
           studies are limited by the inclusion of other modifications in surgical procedures and a&#xD;
           lack of replication of results, respectively. Thus there is insufficient evidence to&#xD;
           either support or reject the inclusion of bladder flaps in cesarean deliveries (Evidence&#xD;
           grade C).7-8&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Specific Objectives (Enumerate the objectives and nature of the measured end-points.&#xD;
           Justify the use of surrogate clinical end-points as necessary)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To compare outcomes in cesarean section patients undergoing bladder flap versus none.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Study design (Explicate the nature of the study - observational vs experimental.&#xD;
      Differentiate between cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional and randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials. For the latter, provide sufficient supporting justification for the experimental arm.&#xD;
      If it is a placebo-controlled trial, please state whether clinical equipoise exists between&#xD;
      the placebo and experimental arm.) Randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total operating time (continuous) and Time of delivery to end of surgery (continuous)&#xD;
      Estimated blood loss (continuous) Post operative fever (categorical) Bladder injury&#xD;
      (categorical) Pre- and post-operative pain medication (continuous) and Analog pain scale&#xD;
      (continuous)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Subject Selection (Include an enumeration of inclusion and exclusion criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAHEC patients presenting for delivery at Mission Hospitals requiring a cesarean section&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Exclusion Cesarean section All vaginal deliveries&#xD;
&#xD;
      ≥ 35 weeks gestation &lt; 35 weeks gestation Able to provide consent for medical treatment&#xD;
      Urgent cesarean section Unable to provide consent for medical treatment Medical complications&#xD;
      prohibitive of bladder flap Medical complications prohibitive of no bladder flap&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Statistical methods, data analysis and interpretation (Include the factors considered in&#xD;
      determining an appropriate sample size) Sample size of 100 per group based on an estimated&#xD;
      mean difference of 5 minutes on total operating time (study arm 45±12.5 vs. bladder flap arm&#xD;
      50±12.5; Power=080; alpha=0.05; two-tailed).4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per protocol analysis utilizing analysis of variance or for continuous variables and chi&#xD;
      square analysis of categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Study Procedures (Describe the chronological flow of the study, using schematic diagrams&#xD;
      as necessary. Distinguish clearly between treatment-related [medically-indicated] and&#xD;
      research-related procedures the subject will undergo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All OB patients presenting at L&amp;D for delivery will be approached for informed consent.&#xD;
      consenting patients for whom a cesarean delivery is medically indicated will be randomized to&#xD;
      bladder flap vs. none. Patients unable to consent for medical treatment or not wishing to&#xD;
      consent for the project will be excluded. Consenting patients for whom a cesarean is&#xD;
      medically indicated will be randomly assigned to bladder flap vs. by previously allocation of&#xD;
      subject number. Patients will undergo assigned procedure unless excluded at the discretion of&#xD;
      the surgeons who determine the alternate procedure is medically indicated. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing the assigned procedure will have all data extracted from hospital medical records&#xD;
      and entered into SPSS for a per-protocol analysis.&#xD;
