  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the response rate to TPI 287 in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer who have had one prior taxane regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, 2-stage Simon design, Phase 2 study of TPI 287 in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer. All patients must have received&#xD;
      prior taxane therapy. Up to 80 patients will be enrolled and stratified based on duration of&#xD;
      cumulative exposure to a single prior taxane regimen. A single taxane regimen is considered&#xD;
      to he a taxane or taxane containing therapy administered on a defined schedule with no more&#xD;
      than 2 months' interruption between treatments, and total exposure will be assessed by the&#xD;
      number of months on that schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One stratum (up to 40 patients) will consist of patients who have had over 3 months (up to a&#xD;
      maximum of 10 months) exposure to a taxane regimen, who then have documented progression of&#xD;
      disease (initially taxane sensitive). The second stratum (up to 40 patients) will consist of&#xD;
      patients considered primarily resistant to taxanes who have had documented progressive&#xD;
      disease as best response after exposure to a single taxane regimen for less than or equal to&#xD;
      3 months. Patients may have received prior hormonal therapy and/or bisphosphonates and may&#xD;
      continue on these therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage of the trial, 22 patients in each stratum will be treated with TPI 287&#xD;
      intravenously every 21 days. If 1 or fewer patients in either stratum demonstrate a response&#xD;
      in this first stage, the trial will be discontinued for that stratum. Otherwise, an&#xD;
      additional 18 patients in the stratum showing 2 or more responses will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      second stage of the study. If 4 or fewer patients demonstrate a response in the total study&#xD;
      population in either stratum from stages 1 and 2, then the drug will not be considered of&#xD;
      interest in prostate cancer for patients as defined in that stratum.&#xD;
