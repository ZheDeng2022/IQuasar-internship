      The aim of this project is to measure the effect of Coca-Cola and Diet Coke, relative to&#xD;
      mineral water, on non-haem iron absorption. The results from this study will quantify any&#xD;
      enhancing effect of Coca-Cola or Diet Coke on non-haem iron absorption and will be of use to&#xD;
      the Coca-Cola Company and the scientific and nutrition community in evaluating the&#xD;
      nutritional value of these products.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previous studies have suggested that Coca-Cola may enhance absorption of non-haem iron. A&#xD;
      randomized cross-over trial will be undertaken to compare the absorption of iron added to a&#xD;
      pizza meal consumed with either Coca-Cola, Diet Coke or mineral water. Pizza containing added&#xD;
      iron, labelled with an iron stable isotope (Fe-58), will be consumed for lunch on two&#xD;
      consecutive days with either a Coca-Cola, Diet Coke or mineral water drink. Iron absorption&#xD;
      from the pizza will be determined using the erythrocyte incorporation technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline blood sample will be taken prior to consuming the first test meal (pizza + drink&#xD;
      1) and after approximately 15 days, a second fasting blood sample will be taken prior to&#xD;
      consumption of a second set of test meals (pizza + drink 2). Iron isotope enrichment of the&#xD;
      blood sample will be used as a baseline for the second set of test meals and to calculate&#xD;
      absorption from the first set of test meals. A third blood sample will be taken after&#xD;
      approximately 30 days and the iron isotope enrichment will be used as a baseline for the&#xD;
      third set of test meals (pizza + drink 3) and to determine absorption from the second set of&#xD;
      test meals. At about 45 days a final blood sample will be taken to determine absorption from&#xD;
      the third set of test meals. Iron absorption will be calculated from the isotopic enrichment&#xD;
      in blood, assuming that 80% of absorbed iron is incorporated into red blood cells. Absorption&#xD;
      of iron consumed with Coca-Cola and Diet Coke will be compared with iron absorption when&#xD;
      consumed with mineral water. The order in which the volunteers will be given the drinks will&#xD;
      be randomised.&#xD;
