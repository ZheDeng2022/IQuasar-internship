    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether an experimental drug called&#xD;
      AMD3100 used in combination with another medication called G-CSF is safe and can help to&#xD;
      increase the amount of blood stem cells (called CD34+ stem cells) found in the peripheral&#xD;
      blood of patients with Fanconi anemia. While AMD3100 has been used successfully in adult&#xD;
      volunteers and cancer patients, it has not been used in children or patients with Fanconi&#xD;
      anemia and in only a few children with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fanconi anemia is a rare genetic disease. Most Fanconi anemia patients eventually develop&#xD;
      bone marrow failure, a condition in which the bone marrow no longer produces red blood cells&#xD;
      (to carry oxygen), white blood cells (to fight infection), and platelets (to help blood&#xD;
      clot). The only successful treatment for patients with Fanconi anemia with bone marrow&#xD;
      failure is bone marrow transplantation. However, this treatment has many risks and is not&#xD;
      available to all patients with Fanconi anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD34+ cells include stem cells found in the bone marrow or peripheral blood which are capable&#xD;
      of making the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. CD34+ stem cells can be&#xD;
      collected from bone marrow or peripheral blood and purified using an experimental device&#xD;
      called the CliniMACS. However, most Fanconi anemia patients do not have enough CD34+ stem&#xD;
      cells in their bone marrow or peripheral blood to be collected using standard methods that&#xD;
      work well in children and adults who don't have Fanconi anemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fanconi anemia is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome comprised of progressive bone marrow&#xD;
      failure, congenital anomalies and a predisposition to malignancy. The heterozygote rate in&#xD;
      the United States may be as high as 1 in 300. The mean age for the onset of aplastic anemia&#xD;
      is approximately eight years. Although improved supportive care has prolonged the survival of&#xD;
      these patients from only a few years from the diagnosis of bone marrow failure, the mean age&#xD;
      of death is still approximately 24 years of age. Most patients die from complications of bone&#xD;
      marrow failure including bleeding, or infection, or from malignancy or complications of stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation. In a recent 20 year review of patients in the Fanconi anemia registry,&#xD;
      the actual risk of developing leukemia or other cancers was approximately 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of Fanconi anemia initially rested upon finding the combination of bone marrow&#xD;
      failure with congenital anomalies. These anomalies include cafe au lait spots and/or hypo&#xD;
      pigmentation of the skin, short stature, upper limb malformations (often involving the thumb&#xD;
      or radius), renal and gastrointestinal abnormalities, microcephaly, and characteristic facies&#xD;
      with a broad nasal base, epicanthal folds, narrow set and small eyes and micrognathia. The&#xD;
      bone marrow failure is characterized by slow progression to severe bone marrow aplasia and&#xD;
      pancytopenia, stress erythropoiesis with fetal features including macrocytosis, elevated&#xD;
      hemoglobin F, and i antigen expression. Attempts to culture bone marrow progenitors in vitro&#xD;
      from patients with Fanconi anemia demonstrates decreased numbers of myeloid and erythroid&#xD;
      colonies (CFU) consistent with clinical bone marrow failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fanconi anemia cells appear to have a defect in DNA repair that leads to increased&#xD;
      spontaneous chromosomal breakage. This feature increases the susceptibility of Fanconi anemia&#xD;
      cells to DNA bifunctional cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C and diepoxybutane (DEB).&#xD;
      The diagnosis of Fanconi anemia now relies upon detecting increased chromosomal breakage&#xD;
      after in vitro treatment with DEB. 11 Similarly, cells cultured from patients with Fanconi&#xD;
      anemia display increased susceptibility to the cytotoxicity of mitomycin C. More recently,&#xD;
      cells from patients with Fanconi anemia have been demonstrated to display G2 phase&#xD;
      prolongation/arrest, increased sensitivity to toxicity by oxygen, defective p53 induction and&#xD;
      increased apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fanconi anemia can be classified into at least thirteen complementation groups by somatic&#xD;
      cell hybrids. The complementation is based upon correction of the chromosomal sensitivity to&#xD;
      cross-linking agents in hybrid cells. Twelve independent genes have been cloned and&#xD;
      characterized within these 13 complementation groups. A loss of function in any of these&#xD;
      genes including FANC A, B, C, D2, E, F, G, J, L, M, N, and FANC D1 (which is BRCA2) can cause&#xD;
      Fanconi anemia. However, complementation groups A, C, and G account for approximately 80-85%&#xD;
      of patients with Fanconi anemia in the United States. Discrete mutations in these genes have&#xD;
      been identified in families with the disorder. Expression of the complementary cDNA gene in&#xD;
      the respective Fanconi anemia cells in vitro corrects the increased chromosomal breakage from&#xD;
      DEB and the increased sensitivity to mitomycin C. Expression of gene products in bone marrow&#xD;
      progenitors from patients with Fanconi anemia increases survival in in vitro assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatment for Fanconi anemia relies upon hematological support in the form of red&#xD;
      blood cell and platelet transfusions. Aplastic anemia will transiently respond to androgen&#xD;
      therapy in 50% of children. G-CSF has also been utilized in published studies from our own&#xD;
      group to improve the number of myeloid cells in the peripheral circulation. Bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation has cured some patients of their bone marrow failure; however, there appears&#xD;
      to be more toxicity to the conditioning regimens and there may be increased numbers of solid&#xD;
      tumors post transplant compared to patients without the disorder. Survival five years after a&#xD;
      matched sibling transplant now exceeds 65% and after an unrelated donor transplant 30%. More&#xD;
      recent studies in unrelated donor transplant for Fanconi anemia at Cincinnati Children's&#xD;
      Hospital and the University of Minnesota have reported survival rates approaching those&#xD;
      observed in matched sibling donor transplants. However, graft failure resulting in death&#xD;
      remains a major obstacle. The availability of sufficient numbers of (previously purified and&#xD;
      cryopreserved) autologous HSC for re-infusion after graft failure may prevent this&#xD;
      complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, gene therapy approaches are being pursued, but to date, there is no evidence for&#xD;
      cure with this approach in humans, although correction has been reported in murine models.&#xD;
      These studies are hampered by the fact that mouse knockouts of FA genes do not develop&#xD;
      spontaneous aplastic anemia and thus are not phenocopies of the human disease. Thus in&#xD;
      previously reported mouse-studies, gene therapy approaches required ablative total body&#xD;
      irradiation of the recipient mice to ensure engraftment of the gene corrected stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An obvious limitation of Fanconi anemia hematopoietic stem cell gene transfer is that the&#xD;
      necessary target for genetic manipulation, the hematopoietic stem cell (or its surrogate,&#xD;
      CD34+ cell) is progressively lost during the development of aplastic anemia. Thus at the time&#xD;
      of severe aplasia and the greatest need for treatment, target stem cells for genetic&#xD;
      modification are deficient. Collection of a meaningful number of HSC prior to the onset of&#xD;
      aplastic anemia for eventual use in a therapeutic gene therapy trial will be explored in the&#xD;
      study outlined here. Key questions remaining are whether corrected HSC from Fanconi anemia&#xD;
      patients will engraft after autologous re-infusion without any cyto-reductive treatment of&#xD;
      the recipient and, if engrafted, whether the corrected cells will demonstrate a proliferative&#xD;
      advantage over uncorrected stem cells.&#xD;
