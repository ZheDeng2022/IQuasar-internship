    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically-confirmed advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients must be refractory to standard therapy or have a tumor for which no&#xD;
             therapy with clinical benefit exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have evidence of disease progression if they received a prior therapy.&#xD;
             This includes development of new lesions or an increase in preexisting lesions on bone&#xD;
             scintigraphy, CT, MRI or by physical examination. Patients in whom the sole criterion&#xD;
             for progression is an increase in a biochemical marker, e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen&#xD;
             (CEA), or an increase in symptoms, are not eligible, with the exception of the&#xD;
             biochemical marker PSA (prostate specific antigen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No radiotherapy, treatment with cytotoxic agents, or treatment with biologic agents&#xD;
             within the 4 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this study (6 weeks for mitomycin&#xD;
             or nitrosoureas). Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxicities of any&#xD;
             prior treatment with cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy or other anti-cancer modalities&#xD;
             (returned to baseline status as noted before most recent treatment). Patients with&#xD;
             persisting, stable chronic toxicities from prior treatment ≤ grade 1 are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All non-prostate cancer patients need to be at least 2 weeks off any hormonal therapy.&#xD;
             Prostate cancer patients need to be maintained with castrate levels of testosterone&#xD;
             and at least 2 weeks off any non steroidal anti-androgen, diethylstilbestrol, or&#xD;
             ketoconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 2 weeks must have elapsed from any prior surgery .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets&#xD;
        ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 x&#xD;
        institutional upper limit of normal creatinine within 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥50&#xD;
        mL/min/1.73 m² for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation and must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 1&#xD;
             week prior to beginning treatment on this trial. Pregnant and nursing patients are&#xD;
             excluded because the effects of the combination of Abraxane and Satraplatin on a fetus&#xD;
             or nursing child are unknown. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. Sexually active men must also use appropriate contraception method and&#xD;
             should not father a child while receiving therapy during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be able to understand and sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are less than 4 weeks from chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or have not&#xD;
             recovered from any adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known active brain metastases. Patients with treated brain metastases&#xD;
             are eligible if they have received radiation to the brain or surgery, more than 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to enrollment onto this study, and do not have progression of their&#xD;
             central nervous system disease radiologically or clinically. Such patients should be&#xD;
             off steroids for a minimum of two weeks prior to the first dose on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the investigational agents may&#xD;
             have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are ineligible because these patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy and the potential&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interaction between antiretroviral therapy and the investigational&#xD;
             agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of certain medications that inhibit the liver microsomal enzyme CYP3A4&#xD;
             and CYP2CA8/9 may result in increased levels of Satraplatin and/or Abraxane. This&#xD;
             increase may be clinically relevant because toxicities are related to dose and&#xD;
             exposure. Therefore, all herbal and alternative medications should be discontinued&#xD;
             while on study, these include: Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal), Uncaria tomentosa&#xD;
             (cat's claw), Echinacea angustifolia roots, trifolium pratense (wild cherry),&#xD;
             matricaria chamomila (chamomile), and Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice), dillapiol, and&#xD;
             naringenim. No concomitant use of the following drugs is allowed: cyclosporine,&#xD;
             diltiazem, ketoconazole, rifampin, fluconazole, delavirdine, nicardipine,&#xD;
             pioglitazone, and sulfonamides, St Johns Wort. Consumption of grapefruit juice is&#xD;
             prohibited during the study. Patients will be asked as to which medicines (traditional&#xD;
             or herbal) they are taking at every study visit. If possible, these medications and/or&#xD;
             all herbal medicines should not be restarted until 72 hours after the last drug dose&#xD;
             on study.&#xD;
