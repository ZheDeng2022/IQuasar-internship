  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the central cause&#xD;
      of cervical cancer. Indeed, certain oncogenic types of HPV can infect the cervix (part of the&#xD;
      uterus or womb). This infection may go away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is&#xD;
      called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of&#xD;
      the cervix. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals has developed a HPV vaccine against the oncogenic&#xD;
      types HPV-16 and HPV-18 formulated with the AS04 adjuvant (control vaccine) and is also&#xD;
      evaluating novel HPV vaccines formulations. This study will evaluate a novel GSK Biologicals'&#xD;
      HPV vaccine (GSK1674330A) in terms of safety and immunogenicity compared to the control&#xD;
      vaccine. There will be different levels of blinding in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep&#xD;
      2007.&#xD;
