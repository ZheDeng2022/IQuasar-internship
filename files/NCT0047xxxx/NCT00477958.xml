      RATIONALE: A study that assesses the ability of older patients to think, learn, remember,&#xD;
      make judgments, and carry out daily activities may help doctors plan treatment for older&#xD;
      patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying an assessment tool in older patients with cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether a geriatric assessment tool can predict toxicity to chemotherapy,&#xD;
           defined as grade 3 or 4 toxicity, hospitalization, dose delay or reduction, or&#xD;
           discontinuation of chemotherapy due to toxicity, in elderly patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the longitudinal impact of cancer and chemotherapy treatment on geriatric&#xD;
           assessment parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients undergo assessments of functional status using the Timed Up and Go&#xD;
      Assessment (measures physical mobility) and Karnofsky Physician-Rated Performance Rating&#xD;
      Scale; and cognition using the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test. These&#xD;
      assessments are performed by healthcare personnel. Body mass index and the percentage of&#xD;
      unintentional weight loss and the number of falls in the past 6 months are also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients also complete the following self-administered questionnaires: Instrumental&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living (measures level of functioning and need for services); Activities&#xD;
      of Daily Living (measures higher levels of physical functioning); Karnofsky Self-Reported&#xD;
      Performance Rating Scale (related to survival and clinically significant illness); Physical&#xD;
      Health Section of the Older American Resources and Services Questionnaire (measures&#xD;
      comorbidity and the impact on daily activities); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale;&#xD;
      Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Activity Limitations Measure (measures the impact of&#xD;
      cancer on patients' social functioning); and MOS Social Support Survey Emotional/Information&#xD;
      and Tangible Subscales (measures perceived availability of social support).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients then begin planned chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of chemotherapy (or a maximum of 12 months from study entry), patients&#xD;
      undergo assessments and complete self-administered questionnaires as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 750 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
