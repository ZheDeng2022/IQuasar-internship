      Examine the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in subjects with symptoms of bladder&#xD;
      overactivity due to pure detrusor instability or sensory urgency. Subjects in study will be&#xD;
      permitted to escalate or de-escalate between 80 mg/day and 120 mg/day in consultation with&#xD;
      the investigator and based on their adverse events.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have predominant symptoms of bladder overactivity defined as meeting&#xD;
             both of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. bothersome urinary urgency (the sensation of the urgent need to void for fear of&#xD;

                  urinary incontinence (UUI; the involuntary loss of urine preceded by urgency) for&#xD;
                  a minimum of 3 consecutive months prior to study entry&#xD;

               2. abnormal frequency of micturition (an average voiding interval of 2 hours or less&#xD;
                  [2] during waking hours) as confirmed by at least two days of recording on the&#xD;
                  screening dairy collected at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  the opinion of the investigator, requires investigation or intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any active cardiac ischemic condition, including myocardial infarction within 6&#xD;
                  months prior to study entry&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have any condition, limitation, disease, or abnormal laboratory value that could, in&#xD;
