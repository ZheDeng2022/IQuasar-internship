    <textblock>
      The phospholipids of mammalian spermatozoa possess a distinctive fatty acid composition with&#xD;
      high proportion of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The lipid composition is a major&#xD;
      determinant of the membrane flexibility and sperm motility required for proper fertilization.&#xD;
      It also influences the sperm plasma membrane's fluidity, chilling sensitivity and&#xD;
      thermotropic lipid phase transition (LPT) and these parameters determine our ability to&#xD;
      cryopreserve these cells. Our hypotheses is that by providing dietary supplementation of&#xD;
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids an improvement of sperm parameters (number, motility,&#xD;
      viability) can be achieved. We also expect alteration spermatozoal plasma membrane fatty acid&#xD;
      composition, making it more chilling resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental methodology: 1) Characterize fatty acid composition of the spermatozoa of normal&#xD;
      and abnormal spermatozoa by gas chromatography. 2) Characterize sperm plasma membrane LPT by&#xD;
      FTIR spectrometer. 3) Run a randomized double-blind, placebo controlled, crossed-over dietary&#xD;
      fatty acid supplementation pilot trial in human sub-fertile patients. Large scale trial will&#xD;
      follow, if justified. In both trials sperm characterization of each participant will be&#xD;
      conducted before, during and following the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subfertile males will benefit greatly if their sperm parameters can be improved and&#xD;
      cryopreserved while ensuring enhanced post-thawing survival. We believe that changing the&#xD;
      fatty acid composition of sperm plasma membrane by simple dietary means will open the way to&#xD;
      improve the fertility of those that needs it the most.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The phospholipids of mammalian spermatozoa possess a distinctive and highly unusual fatty&#xD;
      acid composition, the most unique feature of which is a very high proportion of long chain&#xD;
      (C20-22) highly polyunsaturated fatty acyl groups. In most mammals, docosahexaenoic acid&#xD;
      (DHA; 22:6,n-3) is the dominant polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) although, in several&#xD;
      species, docosapentaenoic acid (22:5,n-6) is also a major component 2. The lipid composition&#xD;
      is a major determinant of the membrane flexibility required for the characteristic flagella&#xD;
      movement of spermatozoa and for the fusogenic properties of the membranes associated with the&#xD;
      acrosome reaction and fertilization. In addition, it has been demonstrated that lipid-derived&#xD;
      mediators are involved in various signal transduction mechanisms that regulate spermatozoa&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sperm motility was therefore closely correlated with fertility, yet factors controlling sperm&#xD;
      motility in humans are not fully understood 12. The amount of PUFA, mainly DHA, and to a&#xD;
      lesser extent eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), was showed to be positively associated with sperm&#xD;
      motility and essential for optimal fertility. The reduction in the amount of DHA in sperm&#xD;
      lipids have been correlated with reduced sperm concentration, sperm progressive motility and&#xD;
      the proportion of cells with normal morphology. In asthenozoospermic (poor sperm forward&#xD;
      motility), the levels of DHA (and total PUFA) was found to be lower than in normozoospermic&#xD;
      individuals despite similar serum fatty acid composition 18. Broiler spermatozoa rich in EPA&#xD;
      or DHA or both showed significantly increased fertility following artificial insemination&#xD;
      (AI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chilling injury to mammalian gametes has been described as the irreversible damage that&#xD;
      occurs upon cooling to low, but non-freezing, temperatures. Several studies suggested that&#xD;
      chilling injury is the major limiting factor for successful gamete cryopreservation. Other&#xD;
      studies suggested that membranes are the primary sites for structural and functional chilling&#xD;
      injury in sperm and oocytes. Additionally, membrane chilling injury is dependent on the&#xD;
      biochemical and biophysical properties of membranes. The plasma membrane thermotropic lipid&#xD;
      phase transition (Tm) from the fluid liquid crystalline phase to the more rigid gel phase is&#xD;
      associated with chilling injury. When membrane lipids undergo lipid phase transition (LPT),&#xD;
      fluidity decreases and the structure and functioning of the membrane change. As a result, the&#xD;
      membrane permeability increases and the cells are damaged. The temperature at which Tm occurs&#xD;
      is greatly affected by the fatty acid composition of the membrane. Membranes consisted of&#xD;
      lipids with multiple unsaturations or short carbon chains are more fluid at low temperatures.&#xD;
      The ability of the spermatozoal plasma membrane to resist structural damage during&#xD;
      cryopreservation may therefore be related to its fatty acids composition and the strength of&#xD;
      the bonds between membrane components 38. It was shown, for example, that spermatozoa of&#xD;
      Asian elephants, which are more chilling sensitive than African elephant sperm, contain lower&#xD;
      concentration of PUFA in their membranes and are especially poor in DHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several ways to change the chilling sensitivity and Tm in mammalian gametes.&#xD;
      Spermatozoa can spontaneously interact with liposomes as was described in several studies.&#xD;
      Previous work suggested that phospholipids adsorbed on to the sperm cells, which were then&#xD;
      cooled to 4oC, increased the chilling resistance of the sperm cells from bovine, ram and&#xD;
      elephant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between dietary components and reproduction is well established. Follicular&#xD;
      maturation, ovulation and oestrus in the female, and libido and fertility in the male, might&#xD;
      all be adversely affected by undernutrition. Men with infertile semen were found to consume&#xD;
      less omega-3 fatty acids than fertile men, and a significant correlation was established&#xD;
      between the consumption of alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) on the one hand and sperm&#xD;
      concentration and progressive motility on the other hand. In boar, the output of the&#xD;
      accessory glands, but not the output of spermatozoa by the testes, was affected by the&#xD;
      reduced feed intake and is likely to reflect a suppression of androgen secretion. Various&#xD;
      reports showed that enrichment of diet with PUFA can alter the biophysical properties or&#xD;
      reproductive performance of mammalian and avian sperm and oocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and expected significance of the research Male patients arriving at the male&#xD;
      fertility clinic frequently suffer from one or more of the following: asthenozoospermia (low&#xD;
      progressive motility), teratozoopermia (abnormal morphology) and/or oligozoospermia (low&#xD;
      sperm count), collectively known as O.T.A It is assumed that by supplementing the diet of&#xD;
      such patients with omega-3 PUFA, an improvement of these parameters can be achieved. Since&#xD;
      the number of normal cells in all such patients is limited, omega-3 PUFA supplementation may&#xD;
      confer the needed change to the sperm plasma membrane, making these cells more resistant to&#xD;
      chilling injury during preservation. This will provide us with a mean to ascertain that more&#xD;
      of the normal cells will survive the freezing and thawing processes involved in&#xD;
      cryopreservation. By achieving that we will be able to make sure that enough normal cells&#xD;
      will be available for fertilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the hypothesis of this study is proved correct, it will mean that by a simple dietary mean&#xD;
      we will be able to improve reproduction in those that needs it the most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive description of the methodology and plan of operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Experimental design: The experiment will be a randomized double-blind, placebo&#xD;
           controlled, crossed-over trial. The experiment will start with a pilot which will be&#xD;
           conducted on 20 participants, all of which are out-patients at the male fertility clinic&#xD;
           of the Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. The pilot is expected to be&#xD;
           followed by a large scale trial in a similar design (without the &quot;cross-over&quot; part).&#xD;
           Both pilot and large scale trial will seek and obtain the approval of the Helsinki&#xD;
           committee of the Shaare Zedek Medical Center prior to their initiation. All participants&#xD;
           will be asked to sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Basic spermatozoa database: For general information on human spermatozoa, fresh and&#xD;
           frozen samples of normal and subfertile males will be analyzed for total lipids fatty&#xD;
           acids composition by gas chromatography. All samples will be evaluated for basic sperm&#xD;
           quality characteristics according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines 66.&#xD;
           Samples will then be separated from the seminal plasma and stored till fatty acid&#xD;
           composition analysis. Determination of the lipid phase transition temperatures by the&#xD;
           FTIR spectrometer on fresh samples will also be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dietary supplementation: At the beginning of the trial each participant will be provided&#xD;
           with 120 capsules of either placebo or commercially available omega-3 fatty acids. The&#xD;
           capsules will be consumed in the following manner: 2 capsules daily during the first&#xD;
           week, 3 capsules per day during the second week and starting on the third week, 4&#xD;
           capsules per day till all are consumed. At this point there will be a break of 4 weeks&#xD;
           before switching between the groups and resuming the same protocol once again. During&#xD;
           the entire period each participant will also be provided with vitamin E pills as&#xD;
           anti-oxidant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. During and post-experimental sperm characterization: Each of the participating patients&#xD;
           will provide 5 samples during the dietary supplementation pilot experiment: Once at the&#xD;
           beginning of the trial, once in the middle of each of the two segments (see dietary&#xD;
           supplementation paragraph for details), once at the cross-over point and once at the end&#xD;
           of the trial. All samples will be analyzed in the same way as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Lipid phase transition determination: Approximately 10 of the participants in the pilot&#xD;
           trial will be requested to provide additional samples at the cross over point and at the&#xD;
           end of the trial for the determination of the lipid phase transition temperatures by the&#xD;
           FTIR spectrometer. These participants will be selected based on their sperm fatty acid&#xD;
           composition at the beginning of the trial so as to cover as wide range of compositions&#xD;
           as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Large scale trial: After analyzing the results of the pilot trial, a decision will be&#xD;
           made if there is indication to proceed with a large scale trial. Assuming the results&#xD;
           will indicate such a need, a large scale trial will be conducted. Experimental design&#xD;
           will be randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The number of participating&#xD;
           patients will be determined at the time the decision to proceed with such a trial will&#xD;
           be made. At that time a decision will also be made what other male fertility clinics&#xD;
           from additional medical centers to invite to participate.&#xD;
