      The goal of the clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of nelarabine&#xD;
      when given as a continuous infusion to patients with a lymphoid malignancy that has not&#xD;
      responded to, or has come back after treatment with chemotherapy. The safety of this drug&#xD;
      will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nelarabine is designed to interfere with DNA (the genetic material of cells) and stop the&#xD;
      growth of rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of nelarabine based on when you joined this study. Up to 8 dose levels of nelarabine&#xD;
      will be tested. Three (3) to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first&#xD;
      group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will&#xD;
      continue until the highest tolerable dose of nelarabine is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive nelarabine as a non-stop infusion through a needle or catheter in your vein&#xD;
      on Days 1-5 of each 4 - 6 week cycle. You will remain in the hospital for this infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive ondansetron or a similar drug by vein over about 30 minutes before you&#xD;
      receive nelarabine. This is given to help prevent nausea. You will also take ondansetron or a&#xD;
      similar drug by mouth every 12 hours for the next 7 days as needed. If you are still having&#xD;
      nausea, you will be given additional drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are not allergic, you may receive allopurinol by mouth on Days 1-10 of Cycles 1.&#xD;
      Allopurinol is given to help reduce the risk of too much uric acid in the blood. If the level&#xD;
      of uric acid in the blood is too high, you may receive additional drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may also be given drugs to help reduce the risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1 only, blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) testing 1 hour before, then again 2, 4, 6, and&#xD;
      between 10-18 hours after the study drug infusion. PK testing measures the amount of study&#xD;
      drug in the body at different time points. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in&#xD;
      your body may affect the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Cycle 1 only, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK and PD&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking and about any transfusions you may have&#xD;
           had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of your lymph nodes, spleen, and liver will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test the levels of antibodies and T-cells (a&#xD;
           type of white blood cell) in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time each week, or more often if the study doctor thinks it is needed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After every 3 cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking and about any transfusions you may have&#xD;
           had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of your lymph nodes, spleen, and liver will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a neurological exam (tests to check the functioning of your nerves,&#xD;
           including tests of your balance and reflexes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the number of T-cells in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have NHL, you will have CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to receive nelarabine for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your&#xD;
      best interest. You will no longer be able to receive the study drug if the disease gets worse&#xD;
      or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Nelarabine, given as an injection, is FDA approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of refractory or relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T lymphoblastic&#xD;
      lymphoma. The use of nelarabine as a continuous infusion is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 35 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             cell lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma which has been&#xD;
             previously treated with autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Continued from #1:T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, large granular lymphocyte leukemia,&#xD;
             mycosis fungoides / Sezary syndrome or peripheral T-cell lymphoma which has been&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Patients must have adequate marrow function (neutrophils &gt;/= 0.5x10^9/L and platelets&#xD;
             &gt;/= 50x10^9/L) unless cytopenias are deemed due to disease.&#xD;
