  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of steady-state concentrations of&#xD;
      TMC435 150mg q.d. (once a day) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of escitalopram 10 mg&#xD;
      q.d., and vice versa. Steady state is a term which means that the drug has been given long&#xD;
      enough so that the plasma concentrations will remain the same with each subsequent dose.&#xD;
      TMC435 is being investigated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics (pk) means how the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream, distributed in the&#xD;
      body and eliminated from the body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TMC435 is being investigated for treatment of chronic HCV infection, in combination with&#xD;
      Peg-IFN (pegylated interferon) and RBV (ribavirin). Peg-IFN plus RBV are currently an&#xD;
      accepted methods for treating HCV. Treatment with Peg-IFN plus RBV for HCV infection is&#xD;
      associated with a high rate of depression. The results of this study will provide dosing&#xD;
      recommendations for coadministration of TMC435 and escitalopram in HCV-infected patients.&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, open-label (both participant and investigator know the name of the&#xD;
      medication) , randomized (study medication assigned by chance), crossover trial in 18 healthy&#xD;
      participants to investigate the pharmacokinetic interaction between escitalopram and TMC435,&#xD;
      both at steady state. Steady state is a term which means that the drug has been given long&#xD;
      enough so that the plasma concentrations will remain the same with each subsequent dose. The&#xD;
      participants will receive three treatments (treatment A-B-C) in a randomized order. In&#xD;
      Treatment A, participants will receive TMC435 150 mg q.d. In Treatment B, participants will&#xD;
      receive escitalopram 10 mg q.d. In treatment C, participants will receive escitalopram 10 mg&#xD;
      q.d. and TMC435 150 mg q.d. All treatments will be administered for 7 days and with food.&#xD;
      There will be a washout period (a period where no treatment will be taken in view of having&#xD;
      all the medication eliminated from the body before starting a new treatment) of at least 10&#xD;
      days between last intake of study medication in one session and first intake of study&#xD;
      medication in the subsequent session. Pharmacokinetic profiles of the two compounds will be&#xD;
      measured through blood samples taken at regular intervals during the study and safety and&#xD;
      tolerability will be assessed during the study period and in follow-up. Safety and&#xD;
      tolerability evaluations will be recorded at regular intervals throughout the trial period.&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples, electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs (blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate) will be taken at screening, before medication intake on days 1 and 7 and on Day 8 in&#xD;
      each session and at the 2 follow up visits at 1 week and 4-5 weeks after last dose of drug in&#xD;
      the last session. A physical examination will be performed at screening, on day -1 (= day&#xD;
      before day of first medication intake in each session) and during the 2 follow up visits. On&#xD;
      the morning before first medication intake (in the first session only) a blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken to examine your CYP2C19 genes, which are responsible for the production of enzymes that&#xD;
      determine the breakdown of drugs in your body. The results of this study will provide dosing&#xD;
      recommendations for coadministration of TMC435 and escitalopram in HCV-infected patients.&#xD;
      Participants will receive in treatment A TMC435 150 mg q.d., in treatment B participants will&#xD;
      receive escitalopram 10 mg and in treatment C participants will receive escitalopram 10 mg&#xD;
      q.d. + TMC435 150 mg q.d. All treatments will be administered for 7 days and with food.&#xD;
