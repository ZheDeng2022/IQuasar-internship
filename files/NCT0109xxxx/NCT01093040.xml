        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects aged 20 through 55 years at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;

             procedure taking place&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No significant abnormality on clinical examination or medical history (excluding&#xD;
             atopic skin signs, symptoms and history)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (no clinically significant abnormalities)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis results within the laboratory reference&#xD;
             ranges or deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A negative screen for drugs of abuse and alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following reproductive criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females(of child bearing potential) must have a negative pregnancy test prior to the&#xD;
             dose of investigational product and, unless surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy), has a sterile male&#xD;
             partner, or at least 2 years postmenopausal, or practices abstinence; must use 2&#xD;
             effective methods of avoiding pregnancy (including oral, transdermal, or implanted&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, female condom with spermicide, diaphragm&#xD;
             with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, or use of a condom with spermicide by&#xD;
             the sexual partner) for 21 days prior to randomization, and must agree to continue&#xD;
             using such precautions until 3 months after dosing with the investigational product;&#xD;
             cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible&#xD;
             physician. A negative pregnancy test is required both at screening and prior to&#xD;
             dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males, unless surgically sterile, must use two effective methods of birth control with&#xD;
             a female partner and must agree to continue using such contraceptive precautions from&#xD;
             21 days prior to randomization until 3 months after dosing with the investigational&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Japanese subjects. To be considered as 'Japanese', both of the subject's parents, and&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Previously received monoclonal antibody, or a similar related protein, that might&#xD;
             sensitize subjects to CAT-354 or to any component of the investigational product&#xD;
             formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of an active infection within 4 weeks prior to screening, or evidence of&#xD;
             clinically significant active infection, including ongoing chronic infection&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of any medication (prescription or OTC) excluding hormonal contraception within 14&#xD;
             days (or 5-half lives, whichever is longer) of Day 1 dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Involvement in another study of investigational medicinal product; within 2 months of&#xD;
             the start of this study (Day 1) for small molecules, within 3 months of the start of&#xD;
             this study for antibodies, or 5 half lives of the previously administered&#xD;
             investigational product, whichever is the longer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any blood donation or significant loss of blood within 56 days of study initiation or&#xD;
             plasma donation within 7 days of study initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
