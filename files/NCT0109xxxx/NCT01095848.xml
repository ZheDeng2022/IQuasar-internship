  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer has a high mortality rate even among those who obtain complete&#xD;
      remission after surgery and chemotherapy. In prostate cancer, hormonal therapies including&#xD;
      androgen ablation may control the disease for variable lengths of time but progression will&#xD;
      invariably occur. There is also a high rate of relapse in breast cancer patients who have&#xD;
      four or more positive axillary lymph nodes and in cases of resected metastatic disease.&#xD;
      Immune therapies such as therapeutic vaccination may prolong remissions in these cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many different therapeutic vaccines have been evaluated in these diseases in phase 1, 2 and&#xD;
      even phase 3 trials. Much has been learned about the principals of applying immune-based&#xD;
      therapies and specifically the types of patients that may be most likely to mount an&#xD;
      effective immune response. Cancer vaccines may have their greatest impact earlier in the&#xD;
      disease course or in situations with minimal residual disease. Most recently an overall&#xD;
      survival benefit was documented in prostate cancer patients with an immunotherapy based&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ImmunoVaccine Technologies Inc. (IVT) is developing a therapeutic vaccine against various&#xD;
      solid cancers based on a patented vaccine delivery and enhancement platform. The antigens&#xD;
      included in DPX-0907 were identified using an innovative antigen discovery platform to&#xD;
      identify proprietary signature antigens actually presented on the surface of tumor cells and&#xD;
      therefore capable of stimulating a cellular immune response in the patient. One or more of&#xD;
      the peptide antigens are expected to be expressed in the types of tumors included in this&#xD;
      trial. The peptide antigens proposed for DPX-0907 have been previously included in a phase I&#xD;
      study in a different vaccine formulation at Duke University. No vaccine-induced autoimmune&#xD;
      events were reported. These encouraging results suggest that the autoimmune potential of&#xD;
      these cancer-specific peptide antigens is limited. IVT's DepoVax™ (DPX) lipid-based&#xD;
      formulation was designed to enhance the speed, strength and duration of the cellular immune&#xD;
      response. This formulation in combination with tumor targeting antigens has produced&#xD;
      favorable safety and cellular immune responses in preclinical studies. These parameters will&#xD;
      be studied in this phase I trial.&#xD;
