      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab-labeled PET, may help&#xD;
      doctors to plan a better treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This pilot trial is studying copper Cu 64-tetra-azacyclododecanetetra-acetic acid&#xD;
      (DOTA)-trastuzumab-labeled positron emission tomography (PET) in women with human epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the dose of pre-administered cold antibody that optimizes image quality of&#xD;
      64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET without increasing the radiation dose to the heart in women with&#xD;
      metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether tumor uptake on 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET correlates with tumor&#xD;
      expression of HER2 in women with metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Perform an exploratory analysis of the relationship between uptake on&#xD;
      64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET, HER2 overexpression, and inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a part one dose-determining study followed by a part two study. PART ONE: Patients&#xD;
      are randomized to 1 of 3 dose levels. Patients undergo a PET scan 24-48 hours after injection&#xD;
      of 64 Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab. PART TWO: Patients undergo a PET scan 24-48 hours after injection&#xD;
      of 64 Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab at the optimal dose as determined in part one of the study.&#xD;
