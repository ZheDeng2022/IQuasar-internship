  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sevoflurane is currently being used in more than 100 countries worldwide with an estimated&#xD;
      100 million operations having been performed using sevoflurane as a general anesthetic. After&#xD;
      the expiry of the patent on sevoflurane as a pharmaceutical drug, a generic product&#xD;
      (Sevofran®; Hana pharmacy, Co. Ltd, Seoul, Korea) has been launched. The aims of this study&#xD;
      were to investigate the efficacy (mean minimum alveolar concentration), recovery&#xD;
      characteristics (time to recovery of consciousness (ROC) and recovery, and BIS values at ROC&#xD;
      and orientation), and safety (incidence and severity of adverse events) of generic&#xD;
      sevoflurane in patients undergoing elective surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly allocated to experimental group (generic sevoflurane) and active&#xD;
      comparator group (original sevoflurane). Once in the operating room, patients were monitored&#xD;
      with electrocardiography, non invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry (Datex-Ohmeda S/5,&#xD;
      Planar Systems, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA) and BIS (Aspect 2000, Aspect Medical Systems, Inc.,&#xD;
      Newton, MA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl (2 μg/kg) and propofol (2mg/kg). When patients were&#xD;
      unconscious, original or generic sevoflurane was administered. Tracheal intubation was&#xD;
      facilitated by administering rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. The lungs of the patients were then&#xD;
      ventilated with oxygen in air (1:2), and the ventilation rate was adjusted to maintain the&#xD;
      end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure between 35 and 45 mmHg. The concentrations of&#xD;
      carbon dioxide, sevoflurane, and oxygen were measured continuously using an infrared&#xD;
      anesthetic gas analyzer (Datex-Ohmeda S/5, Planar Systems, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA), which&#xD;
      was calibrated before anesthesia for each patient using a standard gas mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inspired concentration of sevoflurane was adjusted to maintain BIS values &lt; 60 and stable&#xD;
      haemodynamics (systolic arterial pressure (SAP) &gt; 80 mmHg and heart rate (HR) &gt; 45&#xD;
      beats/min). Also, it was titrated to prevent signs of inadequate anesthesia (sweating, facial&#xD;
      flushing, movement and swallowing, HR &gt; 90 beats/min without evidence of hypovolemia, and a&#xD;
      15 mmHg increase in SAP, compared with baseline SAP). Fentanyl 1 μg/kg was given if needed to&#xD;
      resolve of signs of inadequate anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentration of compound A, formaldehyde, and methadone were measured at preset interval:&#xD;
      30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 min after administration of sevoflurane. Blood and urine samples&#xD;
      were taken at preset interval for analyzing concentration of inorganic fluoride: 1 hr after&#xD;
      administration of sevoflurane and every 2 hr during maintenance of anesthesia.&#xD;

    <description>Minimum alveolar concentration was determined by end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations. Mean MAC was calculated as following equation,&#xD;
