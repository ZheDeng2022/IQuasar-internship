    <textblock>
      This study will measure the brain activity of adolescent substance abusers while they make&#xD;
      decisions about their preferences to receive smaller, immediate rewards versus larger delayed&#xD;
      rewards. The investigators expect that patterns of brain activity while engaged in this&#xD;
      decision making task will predict response to treatment among adolescent substance users. The&#xD;
      investigators expect to use the results of this study to develop more effective treatments&#xD;
      for adolescent substance abuse&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the role of adolescent neurodevelopment in adolescent substance abuse&#xD;
      treatment outcomes. The development and evaluation of adolescent substance abuse treatments&#xD;
      rarely includes consideration of varying cognitive capacities and their neural&#xD;
      representations as determinants of individual variation in treatment response. This proposed&#xD;
      R21 project would address this gap by identifying associations among decision making,&#xD;
      task-related neural processing, and treatment outcome among adolescents participating/have&#xD;
      participated in two randomized clinical trials for adolescent substance abuse. Increasing our&#xD;
      understanding of neural processes that underlie decision making in adolescent marijuana and&#xD;
      alcohol users would inform the development of future intervention and prevention efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This complementary project draws subjects from two studies investigating&#xD;
      contingency-management (CM) based treatments &quot;Behavioral Treatment of Adolescent Marijuana&#xD;
      Abuse&quot; (DA015186), and &quot;Family Based Contingency Management for Adolescent Alcohol Abuse&quot;&#xD;
      (AA016917). Both trials compare a unique CM intervention that involves an abstinence-based&#xD;
      reinforcement program to a standard, state of the art cognitive behavioral intervention.&#xD;
      Analyses would be performed separately for the two samples, with hypotheses tested first&#xD;
      using the Marijuana sample, and assessed for replication/specificity using the Alcohol&#xD;
      sample. The proposed project would explore novel neurobiological predictors of response to CM&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents recruited into the Marijuana Trial (n=69; 23 per treatment arm) and the Alcohol&#xD;
      Trial (n=54; 27 per treatment arm) during the period of this R21 project would participate in&#xD;
      a single neuroimaging session as soon after the intake session as possible, within 7 to 30&#xD;
      days. During the neuroimaging session, adolescents would make intertemporal choice decisions&#xD;
      in a Delay Discounting task regarding gains of $100 and $1,000. Preliminary data from the&#xD;
      Marijuana trial demonstrates significant association between performance on this behavioral&#xD;
      delay discounting task and abstinence achieved during treatment over and above the&#xD;
      significant effect of treatment condition. The investigators seek to understand the neural&#xD;
      processes that underlie performance on this laboratory task, and the degree to which&#xD;
      variation in these neural processes relates to and predicts adolescent substance abuse&#xD;
      treatment outcomes. The conceptual framework for the proposed project is based on the&#xD;
      neuroeconomics of addiction in general, and the competing neural systems hypothesis in&#xD;
      particular (Bechara, 2005a; Bickel, et al., 2007; Daw, et al., 2005; Jentsch &amp; Taylor, 1999).&#xD;
      This behavioral choice hypothesis postulates a biased competition between an &quot;impulsive&quot; (or&#xD;
      ''reflexive&quot;) neural system (including the striatum, amygdala, ventral pallidum, and related&#xD;
      structures) and the &quot;executive&quot; (or &quot;reflective&quot;) neural system (including the prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex) in understanding patterns of suboptimal decision making among substance-dependent&#xD;
      individuals. An overarching hypothesis is that differing responses to distinct treatment&#xD;
      approaches (CM vs. CBT) are partially determined by the pattern of activation or functional&#xD;
      connectivity within and across these competing neural systems. These project hypotheses would&#xD;
      be tested by the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the degree to which performance on a laboratory delay discounting task&#xD;
           correlates with activity in impulsive and/or executive neural systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the degree to which performance on a laboratory delay discounting task and&#xD;
           neural processing predict adolescent substance abuse treatment outcome over and above&#xD;
           the effects of treatment condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore interactions between response to CM and delay discounting-related neural&#xD;
           processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this proposed exploratory/developmental project would importantly contribute to&#xD;
      the understanding of the role of neural processing in adolescent substance-abuse treatment&#xD;
      processes and outcome. Specifically, this study has the potential to reveal relations among&#xD;
      decision making, neural processing, and treatment outcomes, including the role of patterns of&#xD;
      neural activation on response to contingency management among adolescent substance abusers.&#xD;
      Results will have implications for future research on adolescent neurodevelopment and&#xD;
      adolescent substance abuse treatment. The potential to use neuroscience findings to better&#xD;
      understand and improve treatment outcomes in substance-abusing adolescents will have strong&#xD;
      public health impact.&#xD;
