    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate a surgical procedure (operation) that reroutes lumbar&#xD;
      to sacral nerves in the spinal column to improve the bladder's ability to empty properly in&#xD;
      patients born with Spina Bifida.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spina Bifida (a congenital defect of the spinal cord), causes nerve damage and a loss of&#xD;
      sensation and muscle function below the waist resulting in bowel and bladder dysfunction.&#xD;
      Patients cannot urinate or are constantly wet, and this continues throughout life causing&#xD;
      major quality of life and health problems. Clean intermittent catheterization (draining urine&#xD;
      from the bladder with a tube) is usually needed to empty the bladder properly. Medications&#xD;
      are routinely required to alleviate high urinary tract pressures that can cause irreversible&#xD;
      kidney damage, where dialysis or kidney transplant is the only way to sustain life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Chinese urologist developed a novel procedure to connect a functioning, healthy lumbar&#xD;
      spinal nerve to the sacral nerve that controls the bladder. Hundreds of these procedures have&#xD;
      been done in China. The end result is the creation of a new reflex where the bladder can be&#xD;
      emptied by scratching or stimulating the skin (over the hip or thigh) supplied by that spinal&#xD;
      nerve root. The Chinese physician had reported that of 92 SCI patients, 88% regained bladder&#xD;
      control within one year after the nerve rerouting surgery and in 110 children with spina&#xD;
      bifida, the reported success was 87% at one year. However, in China rigorous follow up is&#xD;
      challenging, therefore much is still unknown about how the nerves regenerate post surgery,&#xD;
      complications and results occurring in the first year in particular, and the potential role&#xD;
      that central nervous system remodeling may play in achieving successful outcomes. Beaumont&#xD;
      urologists were the first in the US to perform this surgery on children with spina bifida.&#xD;
      Our preliminary data are very promising, and in 9 subjects at 12 months post procedure, 7/9&#xD;
      subjects could void either voluntarily or by stimulating the new reflex mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current project aims to expand upon our pilot experience to conduct a larger and more&#xD;
      rigorous study to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed somatic-autonomic&#xD;
      reflex pathway procedure in gaining bladder and bowel control in patients with spina bifida.&#xD;
      We will also collaborate with and train investigators at another site(s) to determine the&#xD;
      training needed to achieve similar safety and effectiveness outcomes, and evaluate possible&#xD;
      methods to stimulate the new reflex to improve bladder emptying. Achieving the aims outlined&#xD;
      in this multicenter proposal will help firmly establish the procedure as safe and effective,&#xD;
      and revolutionize the treatment of bladder and bowel dysfunction in patients with spina&#xD;
      bifida in the US.&#xD;
