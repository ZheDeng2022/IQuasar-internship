  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy subjects will receive NRL001 or placebo once daily for 14 days. The four treatment&#xD;
      groups, shown below, will each consist of 12 subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1; Nine subjects will receive a dose of 7.5 mg NRL001 in a 2 g suppository and three&#xD;
      will receive matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2; Nine subjects will receive a dose of 10 mg NRL001 in a 2 g suppository and three&#xD;
      will receive matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3; Nine subjects will receive a daily dose of 12.5 mg NRL001 in a 2 g suppository and&#xD;
      three will receive matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4; Nine subjects will receive a daily dose of 15 mg NRL001 in a 2 g suppository and&#xD;
      three will receive matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing of each group will be completed prior to the next group being dosed. Dose&#xD;
      escalation will be dependent on a positive assessment of the safety profile of the preceding&#xD;
      group by the Safety Monitoring Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetics of NRL001 will be determined on Days 1, 7 and 14. Pharmacodynamics will&#xD;
      be examined using a three lead Holter monitor at screening and at intervals throughout the&#xD;
      study period. Adverse events, vital signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory parameters will be&#xD;
      collected, tabulated, reviewed and recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
