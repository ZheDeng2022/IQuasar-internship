  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1144814 is a potent, insurmountable antagonist at human neurokinin-1 (NK1) and&#xD;
      neurokinin-3 (NK3) receptors with the potential to treat multiple symptom domains of&#xD;
      schizophrenia and be an efficacious antidepressant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be an open label, randomised, three-way cross-over study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a new tablet formulation of GSK1144814 and to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of food on single oral doses of GSK1144814 in healthy male and female&#xD;

      GSK1144814 is a potent, insurmountable antagonist at human neurokinin-1 (NK1) and&#xD;
      neurokinin-3 (NK3) receptors with the potential to treat multiple symptom domains of&#xD;
      schizophrenia and be an efficacious antidepressant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be an open label, randomised, three-way cross-over study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a new tablet formulation of GSK1144814 and to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of food on single oral doses of GSK1144814 in healthy male and female&#xD;
      (non-child bearing potential) subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a Screening visit (up to 30 days before the first dosing session),&#xD;
      three dosing sessions each separated by a maximum of at least 6 days washout, and a Follow up&#xD;
      visit (7 to 14 days after the last dose of study medication). Each subject's participation in&#xD;
      the study will be approximately 12 weeks Sixteen subjects will be enrolled to provide a&#xD;
      minimum number of 12 evaluable subjects. The doses to be administered will be 100 mg and&#xD;
      200mg in the fasted state, and 100mg following a high fat breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the unit on Day 1 of each dosing session and will remain in the&#xD;
      unit until 48 hours after dosing. Pharmacokinetic samples will be taken for up to 72 hours&#xD;
      post dose. The duration of both in patient stay and PK sampling may be subject to change&#xD;
      depending on emerging safety and PK results. Dosing will be in the morning approximately the&#xD;
      same time for all sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      GSK1144814. Pharmacokinetic objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of&#xD;
      single oral doses of GSK1144814 administered as a tablet formulation in healthy male and&#xD;
      female subjects and to evaluate the effect of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      GSK1144814 tablet following single dose administration of GSK1144814 to healthy male and&#xD;
      female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single&#xD;
      oral doses of GSK1144814 tablet formulation in fed and fasted states.&#xD;

             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac&#xD;
             monitoring. A subject with a clinically significant abnormality or laboratory&#xD;
             parameters significantly outside the reference range for the population being studied&#xD;
             may be included only if the Investigator and the and the GSK Medical Monitor agree&#xD;
             that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not&#xD;
             interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;

        ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea&#xD;
        (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]&#xD;
        greater than 40 mIU/mL and oestradiol less than 40 pg/mL [less than 140 pmol/L] is&#xD;

             Evidence of serious suicide risk may include any history of suicidal behavior and/or&#xD;
             any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a positive pre study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that&#xD;
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,&#xD;
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive pre study hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C virus&#xD;
