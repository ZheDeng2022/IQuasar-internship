    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well first-line treatment of bevacizumab, carboplatin, and&#xD;
      paclitaxel work in treating participants with stage III- IV ovarian, primary peritoneal and&#xD;
      fallopian tube cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin&#xD;
      and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving&#xD;
      bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel as first-line treatment may work better at treating&#xD;
      ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether patients with newly diagnosed ovarian, primary peritoneal, and&#xD;
      fallopian tube cancers when treated with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and weekly paclitaxel can&#xD;
      tolerate at least 4 cycles of therapy regardless of delay or dose modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with carboplatin and weekly paclitaxel in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers, as&#xD;
      measured by progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the response rate in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers when treated with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the predictive value of a set of angiogenic genes whose expression correlates&#xD;
      with progression-free survival of patients with epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or&#xD;
      fallopian tube cancer treated with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and weekly paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the relationship among cytokines/chemokines, angiogenesis factors, novel&#xD;
      targets of interest and clinical outcome including tumor response and progression-free&#xD;
      survival in patients treated with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and weekly paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days 1, 8 and 15 and&#xD;
      carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Beginning course 2, participants also receive&#xD;
      bevacizumab IV over 1.5 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients with borderline epithelial ovarian tumor (formerly &quot;tumors of low malignant&#xD;
             potential&quot;) or recurrent invasive epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian&#xD;
             tube cancer treated with surgery only are not eligible. Patients with a prior&#xD;
             diagnosis of a borderline tumor that was surgically resected and who subsequently&#xD;
             develop an unrelated, new invasive epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or fallopian&#xD;
             tube cancer are eligible, provided that they have not received prior chemotherapy for&#xD;
             any ovarian tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity&#xD;
             or pelvis are excluded. Prior radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and&#xD;
             neck, or skin is permitted, provided that it was completed more than three years prior&#xD;
             to registration, and the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor&#xD;
             including neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for their ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian&#xD;
             tube cancer are excluded. Patients may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for&#xD;
             localized breast cancer, provided that it was completed more than three years prior to&#xD;
             registration, and that the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have received any targeted therapy (including but not limited to&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Patients who are currently participating or planning to participate in an experimental&#xD;
             drug study other than a Genentech-sponsored bevacizumab cancer study or who are&#xD;
             receiving other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with synchronous primary endometrial cancer, or a past history of primary&#xD;
             endometrial cancer, are excluded, unless all of the following conditions are met:&#xD;
             Stage not greater than IB; no more than superficial myometrial invasion, without&#xD;
             vascular or lymphatic invasion; no poorly differentiated subtypes, including papillary&#xD;
             serous, clear cell or other FIGO Grade 3 lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. With the exception of superficial basal cell and superficial squamous (skin) cell,&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix and other specific malignancies as noted above,&#xD;
             patients with other invasive malignancies who had (or have) any evidence of the other&#xD;
             cancer present within the last five years or whose previous cancer treatment&#xD;
             contraindicates this protocol therapy are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with acute hepatitis or active infection that requires parenteral&#xD;
             antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or untreated bone fracture. This&#xD;
             includes a history of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation within 6&#xD;
             months prior to Day 1. Patients with granulating incisions healing by secondary&#xD;
             intention with no evidence of fascial dehiscence or infection are eligible but require&#xD;
             weekly wound examinations until closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with active bleeding or pathologic conditions that carry high risk of&#xD;
             bleeding, such as known bleeding disorder, coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic&#xD;
             anticoagulation), or tumor involving major vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of hemoptysis (&gt;/=1/2 teaspoon of bright red blood per episode) within 1 month&#xD;
             prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with history or evidence upon physical examination of CNS disease, including&#xD;
             primary brain tumor, seizures not controlled with standard medical therapy, any brain&#xD;
             metastases, or history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA, stroke), transient ischemic&#xD;
             attack (TIA) or subarachnoid hemorrhage within six months of the first date of&#xD;
             treatment on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease. This includes: 1)&#xD;
             Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic &gt; 140 mm Hg or diastolic &gt; 90 mm Hg; 2)&#xD;
             Myocardial infarction or unstable angina &lt; 6 months prior to registration; 3) New York&#xD;
             Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure; 4) Serious&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication. This does not include asymptomatic, atrial&#xD;
             fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. (continued from no. 13) CTCAE Grade 2 or greater peripheral vascular disease (at least&#xD;
             brief (&lt;24 hrs) episodes of ischemia managed non-surgically and without permanent&#xD;
             deficit); Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy;&#xD;
             Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, requiring surgical repair or&#xD;
             recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other&#xD;
             recombinant human or humanized antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Patients with clinically significant proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by urine&#xD;
             protein:creatinine (UPCR) ratio &gt;/= 1.0 at screening. The UPCR has been found to&#xD;
             correlate directly with the amount of protein excreted in a 24 hour urine collection.&#xD;
             Specifically, a UPCR of 1.0 is equivalent to 1.0 gram of protein in a 24 hour urine&#xD;
             collection. Obtain at least 4 ml of a random urine sample in a sterile container (does&#xD;
             not have to be a 24 hour urine). Send sample to lab with request for urine protein and&#xD;
             creatinine levels [separate requests].&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. (continued from no. 17) The lab will measure protein concentration (mg/dL) and&#xD;
             creatinine concentration (mg/dL). The UPCR is derived as follows: protein&#xD;
             concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Patients with or with anticipation of invasive procedures as defined below: Major&#xD;
             surgical procedure within 28 days of initiating bevacizumab or major procedures&#xD;
             anticipated during the course of the study. This includes, but is not limited to&#xD;
             abdominal surgery (laparotomy or laparoscopy) prior to disease progression, such as&#xD;
             colostomy or enterostomy reversal, interval or secondary cytoreductive surgery, or&#xD;
             second look surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. (continued from no. 19) Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding&#xD;
             placement of a vascular access device, within 7 days prior to the first date of&#xD;
             bevacizumab therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Patients with ECOG Performance Grade of 3 or 4&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Patients who are pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or nursing. Use of effective means&#xD;
             of contraception (men and women) in subjects of child-bearing potential. To date, no&#xD;
             fetal studies in animals or humans have been performed. The possibility of harm to a&#xD;
             fetus is likely. Bevacizumab specifically inhibits VEGF, which is responsible for&#xD;
             formation of new blood vessels during development, and antibodies can cross the&#xD;
             placenta. Therefore, bevacizumab should not be administered to pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. (continued from no. 22) Subjects will be apprised of the large potential risk to a&#xD;
             developing fetus. It is not known whether bevacizumab is excreted in human milk.&#xD;
             Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, bevacizumab should not be administered&#xD;
             to nursing women. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use contraceptive&#xD;
             measures during study therapy and for at least six months after completion of&#xD;
             bevacizumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Patients under the age of 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Patients who have received prior therapy with any anti-VEGF drug, including&#xD;
             bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Patients with clinical symptoms or signs of gastrointestinal obstruction and who&#xD;
             require parenteral hydration and/or nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Patients with medical history or conditions not otherwise previously specified which&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator should exclude participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
