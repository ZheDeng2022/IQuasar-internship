        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnosis of HCC is made either by histological examination of tumor tissue or imaging&#xD;
        evidence of a typical space-occupying lesion in the liver together with a serum AFP&#xD;
        concentration of above 500 ng/ml (normal value, 10 ng/ml) in a known carrier of hepatitis B&#xD;
        or C, or AFP above 400 ng/ml in non Hepatitis B or C carrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with unresectable HCC that is not amenable to liver transplantation nor local&#xD;
             ablative technique and who are not suitable for any conventional systemic therapy&#xD;
             (including sorafenib and chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Child-Pugh Class C liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Scores of 10-15 points).&#xD;
             Patients with Child-Pugh Class A or B liver cirrhosis who are not eligible for&#xD;
             conventional therapy or other clinical trials or who refuse conventional therapy are&#xD;
             included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life Expectancy of at least 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients should have anti-HBc antibodies tested if HBs Ag is negative. If anti-HBc&#xD;
             is positive, HBV DNA detection should be performed to determine viral load. An&#xD;
             undetectable Hep B DNA level (DNA levels &lt; 12 IU/ml) in the presence of a positive Hep&#xD;
             B core total antibody would indicate no active hepatitis infection and the subject&#xD;
             would still be eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;21 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status ECOG 0 - 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L Platelets &gt; 50 x 109/L Haemoglobin &gt; 9.0g/dl Total&#xD;
        bilirubin &lt; 51umol/L (3 mg /dL) AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt; 5 X institutional ULN Creatinine &lt;&#xD;
        1.5 ULN INR &lt;1.7 or prothrombin time (PT) &lt;4 seconds above ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not received any local or systemic treatment in the last 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to swallow oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of C versicolor on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason, woman of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of prior malignancy that is distinct in site and histology&#xD;
             from HCC except non-melanoma skin cancer. Any cancer curatively treated more than 3&#xD;
             years prior to entry is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, intractable ascites that could not be controlled by medical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior use of C versicolor or Yunzhi for HCC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are using other chinese herbal therapies concurrently or on any other&#xD;
             investigation agents for treatment of their cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known of history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of active hepatitis B/C flare.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection&#xD;

             requirements. Patients with severe depression or psychiatric disorders will be&#xD;

          -  Known alcohol and/or substance abuser that may interfere with the subject's&#xD;

             must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within the 14 days prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment and must be willing to use adequate contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients suffering from autoimmune disease, patients on concomitant long-term&#xD;
             immunosuppressant therapy and those scheduled to receive bone marrow transplants&#xD;
