    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to assess the swallowability of uncoated and film-coated 200 mg&#xD;
      etravirine tablets in HIV-1 infected patients. In addition, comparisons between a single 200&#xD;
      mg tablet versus two 100 mg formulations will be made. The outcome of the trial will aid in&#xD;
      making decisions about the future commercial 200 mg formulation.&#xD;

      This trial is designed to elicit the swallowability of two formulations of 200 mg tablets of&#xD;
      etravirine (ETR). The trial will allow the assessment of the swallowability of the 200 mg&#xD;
      uncoated tablet, the 200 mg film-coated tablet and make comparisons between these tablets and&#xD;
      with the current commercially available 100 mg (uncoated) tablets. The trial will be&#xD;
      performed in HIV-1 infected patients who are currently taking etravirine (ETR) at a total&#xD;
      daily dose of 400 mg (four 100 mg tablets, as whole tablets orally) as part of an&#xD;
      antiretroviral regimen with virologic suppression (&lt; 50 copies/mL for at least three months).&#xD;
      The trial includes only patients who are already taking etravirine since these patients will&#xD;
      have pill taking experience and will also have experience with the commercially available 100&#xD;
      mg tablet formulation. A minimum of 45 patients will be included in the trial to assure a&#xD;
      sample representative of the HIV-1 infected population. Patients will be given a single dose&#xD;
      of the etravirine (ETR) uncoated 200 mg tablet in the morning, and then complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire related to that intake. Within 30 minutes, they will be administered the coated&#xD;
      200 mg formulation, followed by a questionnaire. Assessments of the 200 mg tablets will be&#xD;
      made in a single-blinded fashion. As the patient will be administered two 200mg tablets in&#xD;
      the morning, he/she does not need to take an evening dose on the day of these assessments.&#xD;
      The questionnaire will be used to assess swallowability of the 200 mg formulations and of&#xD;
      their current 100 mg tablets, and will also evaluate patient preferences. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up for safety and tolerability for one week due to the short duration the patient&#xD;
      will be on study treatment; it will be difficult to distinguish between Adverse Events (AEs)&#xD;
      resulting from their current etravirine (ETR) intake (four 100 mg tablets) versus the study&#xD;
      intake (two 200 mg tablets). A single dose of an etravirine uncoated 200 mg tablet in the&#xD;
      morning, followed by completion of a questionnaire related to that intake. Within 30 minutes,&#xD;
      patients will be administered the coated 200 mg formulation, again followed by a&#xD;
      questionnaire. Maximum 2 weeks screening, 1 day treatment, 1 week follow up. Total duration&#xD;
      of participation is 2 weeks maximum.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must be postmenopausal for at least 2 years, OR be surgically sterile (have had&#xD;
             a total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation/bilateral tubal clips&#xD;
             without reversal operation, or otherwise be incapable of becoming pregnant), OR be not&#xD;
             heterosexually active for the duration of the study or have a vasectomized partner&#xD;
             (confirmed sterile) OR if of childbearing potential and heterosexually active, be&#xD;
             practicing a highly effective method of birth control (as specified below) before&#xD;
             entry, and agree to continue to use a highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
             throughout the study. Women with tubal ligation are required to use one contraceptive&#xD;
             method (Note: A male and female condom should not be used together due to risk of&#xD;
             breakage or damage caused by latex friction)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All women must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at other visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control (i.e., male condom&#xD;
             with either female intrauterine device, diaphragm, cervical cap or non-estrogen&#xD;
             hormonal based contraceptives) and to not donate sperm during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed an informed consent document indicating that they understand&#xD;
             the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in&#xD;
             the study&#xD;

             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active clinically significant disease (e.g., pancreatitis, cardiac dysfunction) or&#xD;
             findings during screening of medical history, laboratory or physical examination that,&#xD;
             in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the patient's safety, ability to&#xD;
             swallow, or outcome of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding female patient&#xD;
