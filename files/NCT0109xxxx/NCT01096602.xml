  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) arises from leukemia stem cells that are difficult to&#xD;
      eradicate and serve as a reservoir for disease relapse following chemotherapy. A promising&#xD;
      area of investigation is the development of immunotherapeutic approaches that stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system to recognize leukemia stem cells as foreign and eliminate them. The purpose of&#xD;
      this research study is to determine the safety of the Dendritic Cell AML Fusion Vaccine (DC&#xD;
      AML vaccine) after participants have achieved a remission with chemotherapy. In this clinical&#xD;
      trial, patients are treated with a tumor vaccine alone following standard of care&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The DC AML vaccine is an investigational agent that tries to help the immune&#xD;
      system to recognize and fight against cancer cells. It is hoped that DC AML vaccine will&#xD;
      prevent or delay the disease from coming back.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      -  On this study participants will receive the DC AML vaccine and GM-CSF 4-8 weeks after&#xD;
           completion of chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). GM-CSF is a drug that&#xD;
           stimulates white blood cells and is given with the DC AML Vaccine in an effort to&#xD;
           enhance the effect of the vaccine. Participants will receive 2-3 doses of the vaccine at&#xD;
           4 week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will undergo the following procedures: Isolation of tumor cells by&#xD;
           either bone marrow biopsy or blood draw; Initial chemotherapy for AML with standard&#xD;
           therapy; Leukopheresis (collection of white blood cells from the blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will also have blood tests, a physical exam, and an electrocardiogram&#xD;
           prior to each dose of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four weeks following the final vaccination, participants will undergo a skin test called&#xD;
           &quot;delayed-type hypersensitivity&quot; (DTH). This is an injection of the tumor cells under the&#xD;
           skin to measure how the immune system responds. The tumor cells are broken up and&#xD;
           irradiated to prevent their growth.&#xD;
