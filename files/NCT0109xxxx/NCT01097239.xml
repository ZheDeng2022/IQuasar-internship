  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre pilot trial to establish the feasibility and role of endoluminal HIFU&#xD;
      in patients with locally advanced cancer within the pelvis that is either primary or&#xD;
      recurrent and with all available current therapy inappropriate and/or exhausted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to make a preliminary assessment of efficacy &amp; dosage for evaluation in a&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial. Whilst efficacy data are limited in a small feasibility study;&#xD;
      radiological, biochemical and histopathological analysis of the patient and patient&#xD;
      specimens, along with quality of life questionnaires (QoL), will be used to provide&#xD;
      preliminary measures of efficacy in this patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These analyses will allow examination of the biochemical, metabolomic and histological&#xD;
      changes associated with HIFU treatment in cancer within the pelvis.&#xD;

      CURRENT TREATMENT OF LOCALLY ADVANCED PELVIC CANCER Colorectal cancer This is a common&#xD;
      condition with about 40,000 new cases a year in the United Kingdom. The optimal multimodality&#xD;
      management of stage III &amp; IV rectal cancer remains an increasing challenge. There is a high&#xD;
      risk of local recurrence and poor survival has been reported for patients treated by surgery&#xD;
      alone. About 20% of patients may present with locally advanced tumours, which are partially&#xD;
      or totally fixed (T3/T4). Until recently there have been no widely accepted and validated&#xD;
      methods of defining preoperatively either locally advanced rectal cancer or unresectable&#xD;
      disease. The use of pre-operative pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict the&#xD;
      likelihood of achieving an R0 resection (Beets-Tan et al 2001, Brown et al 2003) has resulted&#xD;
      in improved selection. Pre-operative chemoradiotherapy can downstage locally advanced&#xD;
      tumours, and result in higher resection rates being achieved with reduced risk of local&#xD;
      recurrence (Bosset et al 1993, Rich et al 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gynaecological cancers Treating other advanced pelvic malignancies including vaginal,&#xD;
      ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers is similarly challenging. Disease recurrence at the&#xD;
      site of surgical resection or adjacent lymph nodes can also preclude further curative&#xD;
      options, due to chemotherapy resistance, reaching maximum safe radiotherapy limits or&#xD;
      unsuitable surgical options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed that High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) may become another modality of&#xD;
      treatment in locally advanced or unresectable pelvic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY Colorectal cancer This is the third most common cause of&#xD;
      cancer and cancer death in both men and women (40,000 cases and just under 16 000 deaths per&#xD;
      year in the UK). Worldwide, there are approximately 1 million cases and 500 000 deaths per&#xD;
      annum. Primary treatment is usually surgical with, in appropriate cases, adjuvant or&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant therapy currently including radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy or a&#xD;
      combination. Unfortunately, the overall survival of locally advanced disease is at best 50%.&#xD;
      Many patients who have residual, refractory or recurrent rectal cancer experience serious&#xD;
      morbidity from local tumour invading and destroying adjacent tissues including bone, nerves&#xD;
      (sacrum), bladder and the skin. These interfere severely with normal daily activities,&#xD;
      especially bowel function and cause great distress in terms of pain, with many patients&#xD;
      requiring permanent palliative colostomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gynaecological cancers Other advanced pelvic malignancies can be equally problematic to&#xD;
      manage successfully. Annually in the UK, approximately 250 vaginal cancer, 7000 ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, 8000 endometrial cancer and 3000 cervical cancer diagnoses are made, with some being&#xD;
      incurable at the time of presentation. Treatment options include surgery, hormonal therapy,&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination, although palliative patients can often be left&#xD;
      with debilitating symptoms including severe pain and fistula formation, compromising their&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a method of accurately delivering ablative&#xD;
      ultrasound (US) generated high temperatures non-invasively or endo-luminally focused to&#xD;
      specific areas in the body using imaging (ultrasound or MR) guidance. Intracavitary or&#xD;
      endo-luminal (also called transrectal) HIFU has been appraised by the National Institute for&#xD;
      Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the treatment of prostate cancer. It is currently used for&#xD;
      primary prostate cancer; there is also evidence it may be effective in treating&#xD;
      post-radiotherapy prostate cancer recurrence. Short and medium term data demonstrate that&#xD;
      HIFU may be equivalent to some current prostate cancer therapies but with reduced morbidity&#xD;
      and length of stay. As the prostate and rectum are adjacent there is now a natural evolution&#xD;
      to translate the success in prostate to the adjacent rectum/other pelvic structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a large unmet clinical need for new treatments for patients with residual or&#xD;
      progressing local pelvic cancer (such as rectal in origin as well as other pelvic&#xD;
      malignancies) in whom all current therapies are exhausted. Intracavitary HIFU offers such a&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial cohort of 20 patients will be offered intracavitary HIFU using the Sonablate 500&#xD;
      (Sonacare Medical, Charlotte, NC, USA) intra-luminal device (at different, escalating energy&#xD;
      doses) under general anaesthetic with monitoring for toxicity and ablative efficacy using pre&#xD;
      and post-treatment Imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As none of the intracavitary devices have yet been used in rectal, vaginal, ovarian,&#xD;
      endometrial, cervical or pelvic lymph node tumours directly (but have been used in the rectum&#xD;
      to treat prostate cancer), it is important that to gauge the levels of energy and resultant&#xD;
      cancer tissue destruction from a variety of different treatment energies. In this manner, the&#xD;
      first phase of this trial is equivalent to the 'dose escalation' phase of a drug trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the optimum energy levels, safety and treatment protocol are known, a further 30&#xD;
      patients will be treated in Phase II. Patients will undergo MR Imaging pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment to objectively assess the tumour and will complete quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires, pain scores, and functional questionnaires. Survival data will be documented.&#xD;
      Post-treatment imaging will be performed at between 3-4 weeks, as within this time frame the&#xD;
      ablative effect (a necrotic area) as seen in prostate cancer treated by HIFU, will become&#xD;
      clearer providing useful data for the Phase I element.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will run in two stages: the end of the first phase (for regulatory requirements) is&#xD;
      defined as 30 days from the date that the last patient has completed trial therapy. The&#xD;
      non-interventional follow-up stage will then commence in which patients are followed up for a&#xD;
      minimum of 6 months or death.&#xD;
