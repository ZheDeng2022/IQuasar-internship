  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used for over 40 years to treat neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      Various clinical studies have shown a beneficial effect of SCS on pain in patients with&#xD;
      Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS). Since more than 2 years the 8-contact points Octad lead&#xD;
      has been used and replaced the 4-contact points Quad lead. Even though it seems that eight&#xD;
      electrodes has potential advantage over the four electrodes in case of lead migration or&#xD;
      disease progress, no clinical data have been published on the effectiveness of SCS using the&#xD;
      octopolar epidural lead. The Octad study intents to assess the effectiveness and technical&#xD;
      performance of SCS with the Octad® lead for treatment of chronic pain. This study is not set&#xD;
      up as a comparison study between the Octad lead and other SCS leads, such as the Quad lead,&#xD;
      because the Octad lead is used in most eligible FBSS patients as the standard of care lead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intends to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. evaluate the effectiveness of SCS with the Octad® lead on chronic pain in Failed Back&#xD;
           Surgery Syndrome patients after 12 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. collect safety data for SCS with the Octad® lead in patients with refractory chronic&#xD;
           pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) for pain control has already a history of more than&#xD;
      40 years. In SCS, a lead is positioned in the epidural space on the dorsal aspect of the&#xD;
      spinal cord so as to produce stimulation induced paraesthesia in the painful area. During the&#xD;
      last decades many articles have been published, clearly indicating the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of SCS with quadripolar leads in the pain management of chronic neuropathic pain, and&#xD;
      in particular Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS). Randomized controlled trials demonstrated&#xD;
      that compared with re-operation, SCS provides effective pain relief for at least 3 years and&#xD;
      compared with conventional non-surgical neuropathic pain management for at least 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, SCS-related complications can occur, that can be divided into surgical complications&#xD;
      and hardware complications. The hardware technology has substantially improved over the&#xD;
      years. Moreover, electrodes have become smaller in shape and easier to navigate through the&#xD;
      epidural space; and finally, internal pulse generators have new programming capabilities and&#xD;
      a longer battery life span. All these technological developments led to the application of&#xD;
      minimally invasive percutaneous stimulation trials for a variety of patients with chronic&#xD;
      neuropathic pain. Turner et al performed a meta-analysis of spinal cord stimulation for&#xD;
      failed back surgery syndrome publications and reported hardware complications of 24% lead&#xD;
      migration, 7% lead failure and 2% pulse generator failure. While this analysis evaluated&#xD;
      studies using older hardware systems, there is first evidence that the rate of these&#xD;
      complications is lower currently with new systems. In the recently published PROCESS paper,&#xD;
      also using quadripolar electrodes, long term follow-up showed that hardware complications&#xD;
      were 14%: lead migration, 3% lead failure and no pulse generator failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, patients with radicular pain to the lower extremities respond better to spinal&#xD;
      cord stimulation than patients with isolated axial low back pain. However, a few studies have&#xD;
      shown that axial low back pain in combination with bilateral leg pain, also respond well to&#xD;
      spinal cord stimulation. Both four (e.g. quadripolar Quad lead) and eight (e.g. octapolar&#xD;
      Octad® lead) electrodes were shown to be effective in treatment of low back and lower&#xD;
      extremity pain, with no apparent advantage of one system over the other. In the recent&#xD;
      PROCESS study publication, the reduction of SCS on low-back pain was not-statistically&#xD;
      significant when compared to baseline. Even though it seems that eight electrodes may have&#xD;
      the potential advantage in case of lead migration or disease progress, no clinical data have&#xD;
      been published on the effectiveness of SCS using the octopolar epidural lead. The Octad study&#xD;
      is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, interventional study designed to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness and technical performance of SCS with the Octad® lead for treatment&#xD;
      of chronic pain. This study is not set up as a comparison study between the Octad lead and&#xD;
      other SCS leads, such as the Quad lead, because the Octad lead is used in most eligible FBSS&#xD;
      patients as the standard of care lead.&#xD;
