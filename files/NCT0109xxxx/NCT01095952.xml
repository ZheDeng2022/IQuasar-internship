      The aim of this multi-center research study is to evaluate the performance (primary purpose)&#xD;
      and safety of a new algorithm aimed at controlling ventricular rate (VR) during rapidly&#xD;
      conducted atrial fibrillation (AF) by delivering AV node stimulation (AVNS) from the atrial&#xD;
      lead placed at a septal position, and designed with the purpose of reducing inappropriate&#xD;
      shocks. Additional purposes include the assessment of a possible application of AVNS aimed at&#xD;
      allowing prolonged control of VR during AF and reducing AF symptoms, and evaluation of&#xD;
      implantation data on selective placement of the atrial lead in postero-septal right atrium.&#xD;
      About 37 patients will be followed for half a year.&#xD;
