      Introduction: Cholemia and bacterial translocation with portal endotoxemia are integral in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of obstructive jaundice (OJ). There is sufficient experimental data about&#xD;
      hemodynamic and histopathologic consequences of OJ. On the contrary, pathologic information&#xD;
      of renal changes in patients with OJ is still lacking. Therefore; the primary objective of&#xD;
      this prospective study is to demonstrate the specific histopathologic changes in kidneys of&#xD;
      patients with short-term biliary tract obstruction receiving a standard perioperative medical&#xD;
      treatment protocol.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty consecutive patients with biliary obstruction were included. Fluid replacement,&#xD;
      prevention of biliary sepsis and portal endotoxemia were mainstays of the perioperative&#xD;
      treatment protocol. Fluid and electrolyte balance was maintained by twice daily body weight&#xD;
      calculations, central venous pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) monitoring . Renal&#xD;
      function was assessed by glomerular filtration rate estimation via MDRD-7 formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney biopsy evaluation was focused on tubular changes, thrombotic microangiopathy,&#xD;
      endothelial damage and peritubular capillary (PTC) dilatation with or without C4d staining.&#xD;
      Fresh frozen sections were evaluated with immunoflourescence (IF)microscopy for glomerular&#xD;
      IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite those favourable figures, dilatation of peritubular venules and acute tubular&#xD;
      necrosis were demonstrated synchronously in all cases. C4d staining in PTC and arterioles and&#xD;
      thrombotic microangiopathy were entirely absent in the study group. Immune complex deposits&#xD;
      in peritubular capillaries and in glomeruli were not detected. Three patients had isolated&#xD;
      glomerular C4d deposition without accompanying thrombotic microangiopathy and IgG, IgA, IgM,&#xD;
      C3, and C1q staining of glomerular capillaries in IF microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This study is the first in the literature to address the histopathologic changes&#xD;
      that occur in humans with short-term biliary obstruction. ATN and venous dilatation was&#xD;
      observed in all biopsies, without exception, despite the maintenance of strict volume control&#xD;
      in all patients. The adequacy of volume control may not be implicated in those results;&#xD;
      rather a possible mechanism related to untrapped endotoxin in the gut lumen or systemic&#xD;
      circulation might lead to prolonged peritubular capillary dilatation and hypoperfusion with&#xD;
      synchronous acute tubular necrosis . Absolute recovery of renal function in all patients and&#xD;
      the demonstration of solitary ATN with no microvascular-glomerular-interstitial inflammation&#xD;
      or injury, suggests that the perioperative treatment regime in this study is fairly&#xD;
      efficacious in short-term OJ.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Between January 2009 and January 2010, twenty consecutive patients with an equal&#xD;
             distribution of biliary obstruction type (10 malignant and 10 benign) were included&#xD;
             into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients over 60 years of age or those with a history of co-morbid cardiac disease&#xD;
             were initially evaluated by echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with an ejection fraction rate &lt;50% and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter&#xD;
             (LVDD) over 52 mm. were excluded from the study because of the already existing left&#xD;
             ventricular dysfunction compromising the optimisation of fluid replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history and serologic evidence of acute/chronic parenchymal kidney or&#xD;
             liver disease were also excluded.&#xD;
