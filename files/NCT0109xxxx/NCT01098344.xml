      RATIONALE: MK0752 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Giving MK0752 together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving MK0752&#xD;
      together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and to see how well it works in treating patients&#xD;
      with stage III or IV pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose of MK0752 in combination with gemcitabine&#xD;
           hydrochloride in patients with unresectable stage III and IV pancreatic cancer. (Phase&#xD;
           I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the time to disease progression and 6 months and 1-year survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the percentage of change in CA19-9 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess target inhibition of MK0752 in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the feasibility of measuring MK0752 levels in tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish relationships between measures of tumor expression of molecular target and&#xD;
           objective tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of MK0752 in plasma when administered with and&#xD;
           without gemcitabine hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of MK0752 and gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients receive oral&#xD;
      MK0752 on days -14, -7, 1, 8, 15, and 22 in course 1 only and on days 1, 8, 15, and 22&#xD;
      beginning in course 2 and for all subsequent courses. Treatment with MK0752 and gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride repeats every 28 days* for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *The first course is 42 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo biopsy of tumor at baseline and on day -7. Tumor samples are analyzed to&#xD;
      determine Notch pathway inhibition via IHC and qualitative RT-PCR analysis and for MK0752&#xD;
      concentrations. Hair follicle (from the head) samples are collected at baseline and on day -7&#xD;
      to determine Notch pathway inhibition via RT-PCR. Blood samples are collected periodically to&#xD;
      determine changes in CA 19-9 levels and MK0752 concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 28 days and then every 2&#xD;
      months for 1 year. Patients will then be followed up as part of their normal clinic visits&#xD;
      for up to one year after the last patient was treated on the study.&#xD;
