      This interdisciplinary multi-level study moves the research in asthma health disparities from&#xD;
      descriptive studies of individual constructs and contexts to testing an integrated,&#xD;
      multi-factorial model among Latino families and children with asthma. The investigators seek&#xD;
      to gain a more thorough understanding of the interaction of individual characteristics,&#xD;
      cultural and experiential factors, social-environmental context, and healthcare system&#xD;
      factors on parents' illness representations, use of CAM and controller medications, and&#xD;
      children's asthma health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a one-year longitudinal, multi-site (Phoenix, AZ and Bronx, NY) study among&#xD;
      samples of Mexican (N=300) and Puerto Rican (N=300) parents and children aged 5-12 who have&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: Are there differences in illness representations between Mexican and Puerto Rican&#xD;
      parents due to social and contextual factors (i.e., acculturation, education, parental age,&#xD;
      poverty, child's illness duration, household members with asthma, and parent-healthcare&#xD;
      provider relationship)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: Are disparities in asthma control between Mexican and Puerto Rican children due to&#xD;
      differences in parents' treatment decisions (CAM and controller medication use) and changes&#xD;
      in illness representations over a one year period after controlling for the effects of&#xD;
      acculturation, social and contextual factors, environmental triggers, and advice received&#xD;
      from others?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Racial and ethnic disparities in asthma health outcomes have been increasing in the United&#xD;
      States. These disparities are so striking that researchers and public health officials have&#xD;
      issued a call for action to understand why this is occurring. Compared with non-minority&#xD;
      children, minority children use controller medication less often, have less continuity of&#xD;
      care, and visit emergency departments more frequently. Especially noteworthy has been the&#xD;
      increasing prevalence of asthma among Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) children. Individuals&#xD;
      of Mexican and Puerto Rican origin constitute 73% of the Latino population in the U.S. and&#xD;
      although these two groups share similar historical origins and cultural values, significant&#xD;
      heterogeneity exists. Researchers have tended to study Latinos as a single group but recent&#xD;
      descriptive asthma research has confirmed differences among Latino subgroups related to&#xD;
      prevalence, mortality and morbidity, illness beliefs, and asthma healthcare practices. Puerto&#xD;
      Rican children exhibit the highest rates of asthma prevalence and mortality among all ethnic&#xD;
      groups while Mexican children have the lowest rates. Asthma disproportionately affects Puerto&#xD;
      Rican children: the adjusted odds ratio for lifetime diagnosis compared to non-Latino white&#xD;
      children is 2.33. Genetic, environmental, healthcare system and provider factors cannot&#xD;
      totally explain the difference in outcomes between these two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not well examined is the role that culture, acculturation, and illness representations (the&#xD;
      way the parent interprets health and illness which influences how he/she manages the child's&#xD;
      asthma) may play in parents' asthma treatment decisions and ultimately, children's asthma&#xD;
      control. Parental illness representations may account for the differences in the use of&#xD;
      complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), inhaled or oral corticosteroids, and&#xD;
      leukotriene antagonists that have been observed between Puerto Rican and Mexican families.&#xD;
      Acculturation may also play a role in asthma health outcomes. Less-acculturated Mexican&#xD;
      families, even if they have known risk factors for poor health outcomes, have better outcomes&#xD;
      than more acculturated families. Emerging evidence suggests that acculturation has opposite&#xD;
      effects for Puerto Rican versus Mexican children with asthma. U.S. birthplace and higher&#xD;
      acculturation among Mexican children is associated with greater risk for asthma and wheezing,&#xD;
      while higher acculturation may be protective for Puerto Rican children in terms of diagnosis&#xD;
      of asthma and medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The past three decades have seen a shift in approaches to studying health and illness&#xD;
      behavior from disease-oriented medical models to integrated bio-psycho-social models. The&#xD;
      factors leading to asthma health disparities between Mexican and Puerto Rican children are&#xD;
      complex and not well understood. Illness representations, the associated treatment decisions&#xD;
      (CAM and controller medication use), and the influence of acculturation on these processes,&#xD;
      are three factors requiring additional scrutiny. The Common Sense Model of Illness&#xD;
      Representation is an integrated model that takes into account environmental, social, and&#xD;
      cultural factors as well as patients' beliefs about health and illness. Because parents are&#xD;
      the gatekeepers for their children's healthcare and ultimately make the final treatment&#xD;
      decisions, it is parents' representation of their children's illness that influences&#xD;
      treatment decisions and children's asthma health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before developing interventions that target asthma health disparities among this diverse&#xD;
      group of Latino families, it is necessary to gain a more thorough understanding of the&#xD;
      interaction of individual characteristics, cultural and experiential factors,&#xD;
      social-environmental context, and healthcare system factors. The investigators also need to&#xD;
      examine how the interaction of these factors impacts parents' illness representations, use of&#xD;
      CAM and controller medications, and children's asthma health outcomes. This innovative study&#xD;
      moves the research from descriptive studies of individual constructs and contexts to testing&#xD;
      an integrated, multi-factorial model. Targeted interventions, aimed at reshaping illness&#xD;
      representations, can be developed and implemented to integrate the family's ethnomedical&#xD;
      belief system (medical system based on the cultural beliefs of specific ethnic groups) into&#xD;
      the biomedical model. The proposed interdisciplinary multi-level study will address gaps in&#xD;
      the evidence base and expand the framework for assessing disparities in asthma health&#xD;
      outcomes among Latino children. This will be a one-year longitudinal, multi-site study among&#xD;
      samples of Mexican and Puerto Rican parents and children aged 5-12 who have asthma. This age&#xD;
      range was selected because children in this age group typically have not assumed daily&#xD;
      control for managing their asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this study will contribute to the knowledge base on the similarities and&#xD;
      differences that exist between Mexican and Puerto Rican families regarding asthma illness&#xD;
      beliefs and management strategies, and how acculturation influences these factors. Healthcare&#xD;
      providers, regardless of their practice setting, can best treat children with asthma if they&#xD;
      understand what beliefs parents hold about what causes asthma, the nature of asthma symptoms,&#xD;
      its course of action (chronic versus episodic), medications and alternative therapies used in&#xD;
      treatment, and expectations for symptom resolution. If parents' beliefs are discordant with&#xD;
      the HCPs' beliefs and are not addressed when devising the management plan, there is increased&#xD;
      risk for nonadherence. Healthcare providers would also do well to educate themselves as to&#xD;
      what CAM therapies parents are using to treat their children's asthma. By doing so, they can&#xD;
      then take the lead in eliciting information on CAM use during their contacts with parents to&#xD;
      ensure safety when these therapies are used, to educate parents about the advantages and&#xD;
      disadvantages of individual CAM therapies, to provide culturally competent care, and to&#xD;
      improve adherence to the prescribed medication regimen. If parents feel that they are part of&#xD;
      the decision-making process regarding treatment of their children's asthma, they may be more&#xD;
      likely to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen. Healthcare providers have an&#xD;
      opportunity to intervene at the individual level to effect changes aimed at improving&#xD;
      adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen through improved communication, education (both&#xD;
      parents and themselves), and partnership with the families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: A presentation of the theoretical underpinnings and conceptual model&#xD;
      for the study is presented here to provide a framework for the discussion of the literature&#xD;
      review. The Common Sense Model (CSM) of Illness Representation provides the theoretical&#xD;
      framework for investigating the disparities in asthma control through the pathways of&#xD;
      parental IR and the use of CAM and controller medications. The model describes a cognitive&#xD;
      processing system that includes situational stimuli (perception of the child's symptoms),&#xD;
      objective representation of the health threat (illness representation) with its treatment&#xD;
      decisions (CAM and controller medication use) and appraisal of the outcomes (asthma control)&#xD;
      for the success or failure of those treatment decisions. The model contains a feedback loop&#xD;
      with IRs potentially changing over time as the parent gains experience with managing their&#xD;
      child's asthma. The three tenets of this model are that the parent is an active problem&#xD;
      solver; the IR is the central cognitive construct that drives the parents' treatment decision&#xD;
      and appraisal of the outcomes; and IRs are individualized and may not be in agreement with&#xD;
      medical facts. The processes of IR, treatment decision, and appraisal of outcomes are shaped&#xD;
      by the parent's prior history managing their child's asthma, personality traits, and social&#xD;
      and cultural contexts. The social and cultural contexts in which an individual lives play an&#xD;
      important role in illness representations in two ways:&quot;1) culture provides the labels for&#xD;
      categorizing the events/symptoms that define illness and ensures culturally common views of a&#xD;
      given disease or illness; and 2) culture provides social and personal contacts that the&#xD;
      parent then uses in constructing the IR and also in developing the action plan for coping&#xD;
      with the disease threat.&quot; Prior experience with their child's asthma management generates&#xD;
      stored memories about the success or failure of the chosen treatment strategy, which can&#xD;
      influence how the parent perceives the child's symptoms for the current episode and that&#xD;
      treatment decision. There are five distinct attributes of illness representations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. identity - the disease label and the somatic symptoms the parent associates with the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cause - the parent's ideas about what causes the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. consequences - the parent's perceived short and long term effects of the disease, and&#xD;
           the physical, social, emotional, and economic consequences of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. time-line - the parent's expectations about disease duration: acute, chronic, or&#xD;
           episodic/cyclical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. controllability - the parent's ideas about cure or recovery either through their own&#xD;
           actions or medical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: This will be a longitudinal study of parental illness representations and CAM and&#xD;
      controller medication use among a diverse sample of 300 Latino families (primarily Mexican&#xD;
      and Puerto Rican) of children with asthma aged 5-12. This age range was selected because&#xD;
      children in this age group typically have not assumed daily control for managing their&#xD;
      asthma. We will use a structured interview with parents, conduct a short interview with the&#xD;
      children, obtain objective measures of lung function from the children, and review children's&#xD;
      medical records. Interviews and child assessments will be conducted at five time periods:&#xD;
      enrollment, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after enrollment, for a total data collection period of&#xD;
      12 months. This assessment schedule will allow us to capture seasonal variations in the&#xD;
      children's asthma symptoms as well as conform to the recommendation by NAEPP that children on&#xD;
      daily controller medications have follow-up visits every 3 months. Medical record&#xD;
      abstractions will take place at the 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Sample and Setting: To ensure diverse representation of Latino families and healthcare&#xD;
      settings, the sample will be recruited from two school-based health clinics and one clinical&#xD;
      practice site in Phoenix, AZ, and two inner-city hospital asthma clinics in the Bronx, NY. A&#xD;
      multisite study is warranted because neither site alone has sufficient numbers of both&#xD;
      Mexican and Puerto Rican families to conduct this research independently. It is also&#xD;
      preferable that interviews and assessments be conducted simultaneously among these two&#xD;
      populations to minimize seasonal variations in asthma symptom severity and control and to&#xD;
      maximize standardization of survey administration across time and samples. Approximately 300&#xD;
      families will be recruited and enrolled from the asthma/allergy and general pediatric clinics&#xD;
      and ER at Jacobi Medical Center and North Central Bronx Hospital (N= 150), Phoenix Children's&#xD;
      Hospital Breathmobile (N= 75), and the two school-based health clinics in Phoenix (N= 75).&#xD;
      These clinical partner sites provide adequate populations of inner-city, poor Mexican and&#xD;
      Puerto Rican children with asthma to recruit the study sample, thus we anticipate no problems&#xD;
      recruiting and enrolling 300 families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescreening: Approximately 400 parents and children with asthma aged 5-12 years old will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study if they meet the eligibility criteria below. Our previous&#xD;
      research studies yielded refusal rates ranging from 15% to 30%. We have assumed a&#xD;
      conservative 20% refusal rate, which will yield approximately 300 families agreeing to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria: a) The child must be between 5 and 12 years of age, b) have a diagnosis&#xD;
      of asthma (described below) as obtained from the child's medical record, c) the family is&#xD;
      Latino (English or Spanish speaking) as self-identified by the primary caregiver, d) the&#xD;
      child has no other significant pulmonary conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis), e) the&#xD;
      participating parent has primary or at least equal responsibility for the day-to-day&#xD;
      management of the child's asthma, and f) no cognitive learning disability that could&#xD;
      interfere with the parent's or child's (as determined by parents' report) ability to&#xD;
      comprehend the interview questions. All of the recruitment sites have computerized data&#xD;
      systems that allow participant identification by diagnosis, age, and ethnicity. If no&#xD;
      documentation of a diagnosis of asthma is found in the medical record but asthma is&#xD;
      suspected, the potential participant will be offered an appointment for a bronchodilator test&#xD;
      for the child. Prior to the test date, the potential participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      withhold short-acting β2- agonist medications (e.g., albuterol), caffeine, medicines and&#xD;
      drinks containing methylxanthines (e.g., root beer), long-acting bronchodilator medications&#xD;
      (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol), and combination agents (e.g., Advair, Symbicort) for 24&#xD;
      hours. Herbal preparations (e.g., kanpo, ding chan tang) and over-the-counter medications&#xD;
      (e.g., Primatene™ mist) affecting pulmonary function will also be restricted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple Children in One Family: It will be explained to the primary caregiver that only one&#xD;
      child may participate in this study. If more than one child meets the criteria and is&#xD;
      interested, the RA will put the names of those children who are interested into a hat and&#xD;
      randomly pull one name out of the hat to identify who will be the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT: The goal will be to enroll the parent who assumes primary or at least equal&#xD;
      responsibility for the day-to-day management of the child's asthma. Written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained by the RNA from the parent for (a) conducting the parental interview, (b)&#xD;
      abstracting pre-identified data from the child's medical record data, and (c) obtaining&#xD;
      permission to interview the child and have the child perform the spirometry maneuver. Verbal&#xD;
      assent from the child to complete the interview and spirometry maneuver will also be obtained&#xD;
      by the RNA. Subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at&#xD;
      anytime, that nonparticipation will not affect their or their children's healthcare, and that&#xD;
      their names will not appear on study materials. We will use a unique 4-digit number to code&#xD;
      their data and provide confidentiality. All consent and assent materials will be available in&#xD;
      English and Spanish. Parents will decide which language they prefer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL MODELS AND METHODS OF ANALYSIS: Eligible participants who decline to participate&#xD;
      will be compared with those enrolled on demographic characteristics to check for sample bias.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to identify the distribution of data and total instrument&#xD;
      scale scores for each of the study surveys. Means and standard deviations will be examined&#xD;
      for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. Linear regression (SAS)&#xD;
      will be used to examine Aim 1 of the study. A growth model with time varying covariates&#xD;
      (using MPlus) will be used to examine Aim 2 of this study. Growth modeling allows for&#xD;
      examination of individuals over time on one or more outcome variables (e.g., IRs, treatment&#xD;
      decisions, and asthma control). Random effects are specified in the model to capture&#xD;
      individual differences in development. MPlus uses a multivariate approach and maximum&#xD;
      likelihood estimation for this type of model. The time scores for the slope growth factor are&#xD;
      fixed to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to define a linear growth model with equidistant time points. The&#xD;
      zero time score for the slope growth factor defines the intercept growth factor, the&#xD;
      coefficients of the intercept growth factor are fixed at one, the residual variances of the&#xD;
      outcomes are estimated and allowed to be different across time, and the residuals are not&#xD;
      correlated. Illness representations, CAM, and controller medication use are time varying&#xD;
      variables in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data reduction: Psychometric analyses will be conducted for the AIRS©, C-ACT, P-CASCL/CASCL&#xD;
      scales separately for each ethnic group to determine if the factor structure (construct&#xD;
      validity), internal consistency (reliability), and external validity is replicated from the&#xD;
      original instrument across these Latino subgroups. Internal consistency for all scales will&#xD;
      be assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Factor analyses will be conducted specifying varimax&#xD;
      rotation and a minimum eigenvalue of 1. External validity for the AIRS© instrument will be&#xD;
      assessed by testing the hypotheses from the original development work which showed that&#xD;
      scores on the AIRS© instrument differed by ethnicity, education, and poverty and that it&#xD;
      differentiated children on an appropriate versus suboptimal medication regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing Data: We recognize the drawback of only analyzing cases with complete data. Our&#xD;
      primary strategy will be to minimize attrition to the greatest extent possible. Growth models&#xD;
      allow for missing data on the dependent variable using full maximum likelihood (FIML) methods&#xD;
      which assume that the data are missing at random and that dependent variable scores tend to&#xD;
      be correlated with the previous measure from earlier data collection points. When predictor&#xD;
      variables are missing, the investigators will use multiple imputation. For the multiple&#xD;
      imputations, the investigators will utilize a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to impute&#xD;
      enough data to have a monotone missing data pattern. Once the investigators have a monotone&#xD;
      missing data pattern, the investigators will employ imputation approaches appropriate for the&#xD;
      type of data (continuous, dichotomous, or low frequency count data). We will perform&#xD;
      sensitivity analyses to ensure that results are similar under various assumptions.&#xD;
      Ultimately, the investigators will determine whether imputation is valid and has sufficient&#xD;
      added value with our data to justify the complexity involved in reporting these analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-normal Distributions: Full attention will be given to the distributional properties of&#xD;
      variables and to regression diagnostics. We will employ negative binomial error assumptions&#xD;
      and make adjustments for outlying data points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Aim #1: Are there differences in illness representations between Mexican&#xD;
      and Puerto Rican parents due to social and contextual factors (i.e., acculturation,&#xD;
      education, parental age, poverty, child's illness duration, household members with asthma,&#xD;
      and parent-healthcare provider relationship)? Ethnicity (0=Mexican 1=Puerto Rican) and&#xD;
      healthcare setting (1=school-based 2=Breathmobile 3=hospital-based) will be entered as&#xD;
      classification factors in the regression model with the above covariates to examine&#xD;
      differences in the total AIRS© score as well as the individual subscale scores. The&#xD;
      interaction of acculturation and ethnic group will be included to assess the potential&#xD;
      mediation effect of acculturation on IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: Are disparities in asthma control between Mexican and Puerto Rican children due to&#xD;
      differences in parents' treatment decisions (CAM and controller medication use) and changes&#xD;
      in illness representations over a one year period after controlling for the effects of&#xD;
      acculturation, social and contextual factors, environmental triggers, and advice received&#xD;
      from others?&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a maximum of 5 observations on each subject in the sample (over the 5 time&#xD;
      periods). The primary interest is in the regressions of asthma control on time of assessment.&#xD;
      The model includes these regressions with the parameters assumed to be fixed; these fixed&#xD;
      regressions will be specified separately by ethnic group. The test of homogeneity of these&#xD;
      regressions will be a primary research interest. Non-homogeneity of these regressions would&#xD;
      suggest ethnic group differences in the relationship between time and asthma control.&#xD;
      Individual regressions of asthma control on time for each subject will also be included in&#xD;
      the model. These regressions will be random because they are associated with levels of a&#xD;
      random factor (subjects). They can be regarded as deviations from the overall fixed&#xD;
      regression. Henderson202 discusses methods for random regressions and the assumptions&#xD;
      regarding them; the analysis of mixed models (fixed and random effects) of this type, and&#xD;
      tests of homogeneity of regressions in mixed models. Because the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the level of acculturation could potentially influence the results, it will be included&#xD;
      as a covariate in the model. Following conventions outlined by Kline,Byrne,and Cudeck &amp;&#xD;
      Browne,our criteria for assessing adequacy of fit will be: chi-square to df ratio of less&#xD;
      than 2, comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) at or above .90, and a root&#xD;
      mean square error approximation (RMSEA) at or below .08.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination of Mediation. We will examine mediation in models with structural equations,&#xD;
      testing the significance of direct and indirect effects and their equality. Testing will be&#xD;
      by the delta method or bootstrapping. While tests involving indirect effects are of primary&#xD;
      interest, the investigators will in some cases carry out a priori tests reflecting&#xD;
      Mackinnon's recommendations. Mediation will be tested through first showing that X (e.g.,&#xD;
      ethnic group) is associated with both M (e.g., illness representation) and Y (e.g., treatment&#xD;
      decision). Second, a path model is estimated by simultaneously regressing (a) Y on M and X,&#xD;
      and (b) M on X. This will be repeated specifying X=illness representation, M=treatment&#xD;
      decision, and Y=asthma control. The paths from X to M and from M to Y must each be&#xD;
      statistically significant by this criterion, in addition to the significance of the indirect&#xD;
      effect. If the path from X to Y drops to zero, full mediation is suggested. Partial mediation&#xD;
      is suggested to the extent that X still predicts Y with the mediator(s) simultaneously&#xD;
      entered. These first-stage tests also result from the model estimation used for testing the&#xD;
      indirect effect. In that model estimation, the investigators use full information methods&#xD;
      (e.g., FIML) unless there is clear indication that OLS is adequate. Henderson and Ceci&#xD;
      describe delta-test methods for moderation and mediation.&#xD;
