  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment of uterine fibroid&#xD;
      using the ExAblate 2000 system was performed in 2001. Since then, more than 5000 treatments&#xD;
      were done in more than 60 different hospitals around the world. The experience accumulated in&#xD;
      this novel treatment was collected by InSightec and implemented into software and hardware&#xD;
      updates, clinical tips and guidelines, all aimed to improve the clinical results and their&#xD;
      durability, while maintaining a high level of safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on extensive clinical experience and our internal research and development effort goals&#xD;
      toward continuous improvement in ExAblate treatment safety and performance, limited changes&#xD;
      have been made to the current ExAblate system. This modified ExAblate system version is&#xD;
      designated as the ExAblate 2100 UF V2 system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modifications are believed to improve system's friendliness to the user, without&#xD;
      introducing new risks or other issues of safety of the device, and should not have any&#xD;
      negative impact on the safety or technical efficacy of the treatments for patients.&#xD;
