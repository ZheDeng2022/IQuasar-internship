    <textblock>
      Nutritional insufficiency is defined as an inadequate amount of nutrition due to decreased&#xD;
      food/caloric intake, often due to an eating disorder, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia.&#xD;
      Often when re-feeding these chronically malnourished patients, they can experience changes in&#xD;
      their mood and/or body image, metabolic abnormalities and functional aberrations of their&#xD;
      gastrointestinal system described as re-feeding syndrome, which all can adversely effect&#xD;
      their recovery. In our pilot study, we are attempting to determine whether adjustments in the&#xD;
      amounts of energy dense foods, such as fat, in the current inpatient protocol meal plans will&#xD;
      lead to a change in the hospital stay duration, alter their recovery by affecting vital&#xD;
      signs, weight or need for supplemental feeds or medications, effect gastrointestinal&#xD;
      re-feeding syndrome symptoms (bloating, gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, diarrhea,&#xD;
      abdominal pain), and/or effect their perceived body image or cause any changes in their mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether a higher amount of fat calories per day within a normal range in a&#xD;
           Nutritional Insufficiency patient's diet will lead to a shorter inpatient hospital stay&#xD;
           duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether a higher amount of fat calories per day within a normal range in a&#xD;
           Nutritional Insufficiency patient's diet will lead to less gastrointestinal re-feeding&#xD;
           syndrome symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether a higher amount of fat calories per day within a normal range in a&#xD;
           Nutritional Insufficiency patient's diet will effect their body image and/or alter their&#xD;
           mood.&#xD;

      A randomized, double blind pilot study; physicians and patients will be blinded as to which&#xD;
      treatment group they will be placed, nutrition therapists will perform randomization and&#xD;
      placement into each treatment group for this research study, along with the development of&#xD;
      daily meal plan as they typically do when not involved in this study, and therefore they will&#xD;
      not be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be placed into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control: Intake 35-50 grams of fat per day between meals and snacks - this is the&#xD;
           typical amount used within our current inpatient re-feeding meal plan, still within a&#xD;
           healthy range as it is at the lower end of normal, which given that these patients&#xD;
           typically consume a &quot;low fat&quot; diet prior to admission that this amount has been the&#xD;
           standard of care for treatment thus far, if they require any supplemental feedings for&#xD;
           incomplete meals it will be with the standard lower fat content supplements&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment: Intake &gt; 50 grams of fat per day between meals and snacks - still within a&#xD;
           healthy range as it is at the higher end of normal, if they require any supplemental&#xD;
           feedings for incomplete meals it will be with a higher fat content supplement as&#xD;
           dictated by the nutrition therapists&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instruments - questionnaires distributed and collected on the initial day of admission,&#xD;
      on every third day of inpatient stay and on the day of discharge by the nutrition therapists.&#xD;
      Due to the lack of research on this method of treatment, there are no questionnaires which&#xD;
      have been tested for validity and reliability; therefore we have created our own, which we&#xD;
      plan to assess during this pilot study. We also plan to follow-up with the patient and&#xD;
      parent(s) at 1 month post-discharge (+/- 1 day) to assess how their re-feeding treatment has&#xD;
      been going, along with to assess how they feel and ask about any symptoms they are&#xD;
      experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests and procedures - all patients with Nutritional Insufficiency/Eating Disorders admitted&#xD;
      to the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital follow the Nutritional Insufficiency Protocol,&#xD;
      with all screening tests and inpatient evaluation and follow-up occurring regardless of&#xD;
      whether they are involved in the current pilot study. As per protocol, these patients will be&#xD;
      on strict bed rest with a 24 hour companion supervising the patient at all times, especially&#xD;
      monitoring intake and timing of completion of all meals, snacks and/or supplements. It is&#xD;
      also standard per protocol that they receive Neutra-phos which is a potassium phosphate and&#xD;
      sodium phosphate supplement, twice daily for the initial 5 days of treatment. The screening,&#xD;
      daily inpatient evaluation, and study questionnaire distribution will be completed on&#xD;
      admission, every 3 days, and at discharge&#xD;
