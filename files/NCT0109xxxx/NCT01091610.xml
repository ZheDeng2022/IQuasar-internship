  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ambulance personnel often work in a dangerous environment and work related injuries of&#xD;
      emergency medical staff have repeatedly been documented. However, only case reports are&#xD;
      published and no data exist about the incidence and type of work related injuries of&#xD;
      ambulance personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to assess the incidence (number of new injuries per 100'000&#xD;
      emergency missions or per 1'000 flying hours) and type of work related injuries among&#xD;
      prehospital emergency personal. The secondary aims are to identify risk factors associated&#xD;
      with work related injuries and to compare the risk of injury to other groups of professionals&#xD;
      such as hospital nurses, policemen or fire-fighters.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff of emergency medical missions is at high risk of work-related injuries. Over 8 % of&#xD;
      emergency medical staff have been reported to be victims of work-related injuries, leading to&#xD;
      a time away from work of 9.4 %. Others have reported a rate of 5 - 25 accidents per 100'000&#xD;
      flight hours or 55 per 100'000 road ambulance transports. A ten year retrospective analysis&#xD;
      of US public roadways identified 331 accidents with 405 fatalities and 838 injuries. Speed of&#xD;
      work, unknown work surroundings, difficult working conditions such as poor lighting and tight&#xD;
      work environment may all contribute to injuries. While mishaps and unintentional injuries&#xD;
      cause most incidents, frank assaults pose additional threats to medical staff. In the US the&#xD;
      injury rate for EMS workers are higher than rates reported by the department of labour for&#xD;
      any other industry. Most commonly reported injuries include strains and sprains, however,&#xD;
      permanent disabilities and fatal injuries have been reported. Even though the medical&#xD;
      profession's first duty is to do no harm, innocent bystanders have repeatedly been victims of&#xD;
      ambulance crashes. In fact, one study reported a greater burden of injury on persons not in&#xD;
      the ambulance. While emergency medical work pose some intrinsic risks to patients and&#xD;
      workers, several risk factors have been identified which are associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of incapacitating or fatal injuries, e.g., positioning in the rear of an ambulance or&#xD;
      improper restrains, younger EMS professionals and sleeping problems and while on&#xD;
      non-emergency travels. Inadequate restrains pose a particular risk in paediatric emergency&#xD;
      transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No data for work-related injuries have been reported for prehospital medical crew in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to assess the incidence (number of new injuries per 100'000&#xD;
      emergency missions or per 1'000 flying hours) and type of work related injuries among&#xD;
      prehospital emergency personal. The secondary aims are to identify risk factors associated&#xD;
      with work related injuries and to compare the risk of injury to other groups of professionals&#xD;
      such as hospital nurses, policemen or fire-fighters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) in Switzerland, including ground, air and&#xD;
      water-related ambulance services. All certified ambulance services for air, traffic and water&#xD;
      accidents are eligible for participation and will be contacted and invited to participate.&#xD;
      Additional supporting rescue companies such as rescue squad of the Swiss Alpine Club or of a&#xD;
      ski resort as well as lay rescuers will not be included in the analysis. All accidents on&#xD;
      medical missions of a prolonged period are analysed. Depending on the available data in the&#xD;
      different ambulance services, the study period may extend from at least one year up to a&#xD;
      maximum of 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidents are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an unintentional (i.e. accident) or intentional (i.e. assault) injury during an&#xD;
           emergency medical mission leading to leave from work, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  EMS personal,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  innocent bystanders or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  additional injuries to patients transported;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a needle stick injury, even if it will not lead to a leave from work;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a leave from work due to a severe psychological distress during an emergency mission,&#xD;
           e.g. death of a child&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical reasons (e.g. common flu, chronic back pain) resulting in leave from work are not&#xD;
      considered as incidents and will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of injury will be stratified according to the KABCO classification as suggested&#xD;
      previously (K: killed, A: incapacitating injury, B: non-incapacitating injury, C: possible&#xD;
      injury, O: no apparent injury).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidents will be analysed according to parameters related to an ambulance organisation, type&#xD;
      of emergency mission and injuries to patients, EMS personal and innocent bystanders. Since&#xD;
      the prevalence of accidents or near misses is expected to be low, a large number of emergency&#xD;
      missions of a large time span must be investigated. To allow a timely analysis, data will be&#xD;
      gathered retrospectively. The data of the victims (cases, i.e. ambulance worker) will be&#xD;
      collected anonymously. Cases will be identified using the accident number (Schadennummer) and&#xD;
      the UVG (Unfallversicherungsgesetz) insurer. Personal data will thus be anonymous at the&#xD;
      study centre in Bern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data evaluation and statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a first step the total incidence of work-related injuries (number of new injuries divided&#xD;
      by number of missions or divided by number of flying hours) will be determined as primary&#xD;
      endpoint among street, air and sea ambulance services in Switzerland. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors, i.e. secondary endpoints, will be analyzed using univariable and multivariable&#xD;
      multilevel linear regression models with three levels: 1. ambulance organization, 2.&#xD;
      ambulance mission and 3. victim. Possible risk factors may include for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ambulance organization:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  type of ambulance organization, (ground, air, sea)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  geographical region of the ambulance organization (German, French, Italian-romansch&#xD;
                speaking region of Switzerland)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  rural - urban setting&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  hospital association of ambulance service&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  number of collaborators at ambulance service&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  number of missions per year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mission:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  time of day&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  weekday&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  time of year&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  weather conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  duration of mission&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  type of accident (unintentional accident, assault, psychological &quot;injury&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  phase of mission (during approach, on site of accident, on way to hospital, during&#xD;
                hand-over / on hospital ground, on way home)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  type of mission (primary mission, i.e. direct approach to accident, secondary&#xD;
                mission (interhospital transfer).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  with / without special signal, i.e. signal and lights&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Victim associated:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age at the time of accident&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  gender&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  years of on the job experience&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  role during the accident-related rescue mission (driver, paramedic, pilot,…),&#xD;
                position at time of accident (driver compartment, patient compartment,…)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  part-time, fulltime employment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  number of mission per collaborator and per year&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  patient characteristics (patient to be transported suffered additional injury,&#xD;
                patient escort e.g. parent of child-patient, member of rescue team, bystander)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  degree of injury (deceased, permanent injury, non-permanent injury, possible&#xD;
                injury, uninjured)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  duration of leave from work&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  position at the time of accident (driver compartment, patient compartment, outside&#xD;
                vehicle, in / on other vehicle)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  innocent bystander&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  patient to be transported&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second step the comparison with other professional groups, e.g. hospital nurses,&#xD;
      policemen or fire-fighters will be performed. The data of the first step will allow to&#xD;
      perform a sample size calculation for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
