  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodic ventilation that includes CHEYNE Stokes ventilation is a pathological pattern&#xD;
      characterized by alternating periods of hyperpneas and apnea-hypopneas. It occurs generally&#xD;
      during sleep, at high altitude and in hypoxic conditions in healthy subjects, and in some&#xD;
      diseases like congestive heart failure. One study conducted on an animal model suggested that&#xD;
      baclofen, a drug already used against spasticity in humans, could also be effective against&#xD;
      periodic ventilation. The goal of the study is therefore to assess this hypothesis on&#xD;
      hypoxia-induced periodic ventilation in healthy subjects during sleep.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodic ventilation, often called CHEYNE Stokes ventilation, results from a dysfunction of&#xD;
      the mechanisms of the control of breathing. In this type of ventilation, alternating periods&#xD;
      of hyperventilation and apneas and/or hypoventilation replace the normal regular pattern of&#xD;
      breathing. Periodic ventilation occurs preferentially during sleep. It is responsible for&#xD;
      decreases in arterial saturation in oxygen and for sleep fragmentation. There is currently no&#xD;
      consensual treatment but non-invasive nocturnal mechanical ventilation is often used to bring&#xD;
      the ventilatory pattern back to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodic ventilation occurs in various conditions, the most frequent being cardiac failure.&#xD;
      It also occurs in healthy subjects exposed to hypoxia or at high altitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of periodic breathing remains poorly understood. Our hypothesis regarding&#xD;
      the mechanisms of this abnormal ventilatory pattern is based on comparative physiology.&#xD;
      Periodic ventilation is indeed the usual ventilatory pattern of many lower vertebrates.&#xD;
      Moreover, even isolated in VITRO, the tadpole brainstem still produces a periodic ventilatory&#xD;
      rhythm, characterized by clusters of ventilatory discharges. In this model, the agonist of&#xD;
      the GABA-B receptor, the baclofen, transforms the periodic pattern into a regular one. Of&#xD;
      note, the baclofen is already used in the treatment of some human diseases, especially&#xD;
      against spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the research project assumes that periodic ventilation in humans results&#xD;
      from a neural reconfiguration of the networks that command breathing, leading them to produce&#xD;
      an ancestral behavior. It also assumes that the baclofen woul reverse this phenomenon as it&#xD;
      does in the model of the tadpole isolated brainstem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the project is therefore to assess the effect of baclofen on hypoxia-induced&#xD;
      periodic ventilation in healthy subjects during sleep. This is thus a pathophysiological&#xD;
      study that aimed at demonstrating a concept before a possible clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is pathophysiological study, conducted in healthy volunteers only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will sleep in hypoxic conditions, with a level of hypoxia similar to the one&#xD;
      that is found at an altitude of 4000-4500 meters. A this altitude, the partial pressure of&#xD;
      oxygen is approximately 90-100 mmHg. The hypoxic atmosphere will be created in a tent with an&#xD;
      hypoxic generator (EVEREST Summit Hypoxic Generator, Hypoxic Systems, New York, NY, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic signals and the movements of the chest&#xD;
      and of the abdomen will be recorded with a portable polysomnograph. The electromyogram of the&#xD;
      chin and the ELECTRO Oculogram will also be recorded. These signals will permit to identify&#xD;
      the sleep stages. The subjects will ware a face mask connected to a pneumotachometer for the&#xD;
      recording of the ventilatory flow. Gas will also be sampled to measure the end tidal partial&#xD;
      pressure of CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be enrolled after they will have given written informed consent. The&#xD;
      subjects will be asked about their medical history and physical examination will be&#xD;
      performed. Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and pulmonary function tests will also be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be asked not to sleep the night before each recording in hypoxic conditions&#xD;
      (the hypoxic sessions). The recordings will be performed either during a nap in the afternoon&#xD;
      or at night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first hypoxic session will be performed to identify the subjects who will develop periodic&#xD;
      ventilation. Only those who will exhibit periodic ventilation during sleep will continue the&#xD;
      study. They will be prescribed either baclofen or placebo (double blind, randomized). The&#xD;
      posology will be progressively increased (over approximately 10 days) to reach 20 mg 3 times&#xD;
      a day, during 3 to 5 days. A second hypoxic session will be performed under this treatment.&#xD;
      Then the posology will be decreased over 3 days and a complete weaning will be performed&#xD;
      during 5 to 10 days. The same protocol will be repeated, either with baclofen or placebo&#xD;
      (depending of the previous run) and a third hypoxic session will be performed. The posology&#xD;
      will then be decreased over 3 days and the study will be considered ended for the subject&#xD;
      after 2 more days of complete weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum duration of the study for one subject will be 63 days.&#xD;
