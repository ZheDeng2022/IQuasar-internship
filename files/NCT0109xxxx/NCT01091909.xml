      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical healing after dental extraction and the&#xD;
      occurrence of surgical complications in patients with type 2 diabetes and compare with&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients or control, taking into account laboratory data such as blood count,&#xD;
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA1) and immunological profile of the patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been established in scientific literature that patients with diabetes have a greater&#xD;
      predisposition to oral complications and that oral infections may compromise their metabolic&#xD;
      control. There is scant clinical evidence of a relationship between diabetes and an increased&#xD;
      risk of infection after dental extractions. To our knowledge, no prospective longitudinal&#xD;
      studies have been designed to prove this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical healing after dental extraction and the&#xD;
      occurrence of surgical complications in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes and compare with&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients, taking into account laboratory data such as blood count, glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin (HbA1) and immunological profile of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ninety patients shall be prospectively studied, divided into 3 groups: Group 1 will consist&#xD;
      of 30 patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetics patients, group 2 will consist of 30&#xD;
      controlled type 2 diabetics patients and group 3 composed of 30 non-diabetic patients&#xD;
      (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo extraction of erupted teeth, always carried out by the same dentist&#xD;
      (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete medical history and laboratory tests will be conducted for all patients including:&#xD;
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA1), fasting glucose, complete blood count, platelets, prothrombin&#xD;
      time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM), CD3, CD4,&#xD;
      CD8, testing of complement (C3, C4), dihydrorhodamine (DHR) oxidation, phagocytosis index&#xD;
      test and neutrophil chemotaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, blood pressure and plasma glucose by finger prick will be measured&#xD;
      again. Surgery characteristics will be recorded, such as: length of surgery time from&#xD;
      anesthesia to sutures, whether forceps and/or lever were used, the need to use a flap&#xD;
      approach, the number of vials of anesthetic used, and intra-ligament anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical assessment of healing will take place 3, 7, 21, and 60 days after surgery and&#xD;
      will be performed by the same dentist who perform the surgeries (KSF), blinded to the group&#xD;
      of the patient and laboratory exams. On these days, the region will be examined, photographed&#xD;
      and will be applied to the Visual Analogic Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 60 after surgery, the postoperative period will be classified as: 1) no complications&#xD;
      or 2) with complications, according to Cheung et al 2001. The following situations will be&#xD;
      considered as complications after dental extraction:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acute infection of the alveolus: pain, erythema, edema, purulent discharge and fever;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acute inflammation of the alveolus: pain, inflamed alveolar tissue, absence of pus and&#xD;
           fever;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dry socket: persistent pain and exposure of the alveolar bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All this clinical information will determine the post-operative quality regarding the healing&#xD;
      time and occurrence of infection and inflammation of the alveoli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be statistically analyzed in order for us to understand the pattern of healing and&#xD;
      occurrence of complications after dental extraction in the studied groups. The data analyzed&#xD;
      will include hematological data, immunological profile and the glycated hemoglobin of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>Postoperative complications included the following signs and symptoms: edema; erythema; alveolar bone exposure; halitosis; trismus; fever; cellulitis; Ludwig's angina; loss of appetite; malaise; itching; moderate pain (as assessed by a visual analog scale); and unpleasant taste.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Delayed wound healing</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 7, 21, and 60 postoperative days</time_frame>
    <description>According to the literature, the dental alveolus is filled with blood clot and fibrin at 3 days after dental extraction; on postoperative day 7, the alveolus is filled with granulation tissue; on postoperative day 21, wound epithelialization is complete; and on postoperative day 60, alveolar bone formation can be observed on a dental radiographic image. Delayed wound healing was defined as a delay in any of the aforementioned events.</description>
