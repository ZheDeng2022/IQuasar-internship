    <textblock>
      This open-label pilot study will select subjects who are inadequate responders to&#xD;
      methotrexate. These subjects will receive certolizumab subcutaneously on a monthly basis for&#xD;
      six months. The study is attempting to determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is lymphatic flow altered in the extremities of RA patients with an inflamed knee?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is resolution of synovitis associated with a restoration of lymphatic flow and lymph&#xD;
           node volume following therapy with certolizumab?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can Doppler ultrasound be used to detect and follow alterations of lymph node size?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten RA subjects with unilateral knee synovitis, who have not responded to methotrexate, will&#xD;
      be recruited from our early RA Clinics. Following enrollment, the subjects will have a&#xD;
      technetium sulfur colloid scan performed on both lower extremities followed by a baseline 3&#xD;
      Tesla contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (3T CE-MRI) study and Doppler US on the&#xD;
      involved knee as described below. The overall disease activity will be determined by the DAS&#xD;
      28 and activity in the involved knee with the RAOS instrument; an outcome measure that&#xD;
      quantifies the degree of tenderness, swelling and function in monoarthritis. The subjects&#xD;
      will then receive 18 weeks of certolizumab and three of the ten subjects will undergo repeat&#xD;
      technetium sulfur colloid scans. To test our hypotheses, we will select three responders&#xD;
      based on the RAOS response. We will select only three of the 10 for repeat nuclear studies&#xD;
      because this number of subjects will allow us to test our hypothesis without the need to&#xD;
      perform the scan on all the subjects. All ten subjects with have 3T CE-MRI, Doppler US and&#xD;
      clinical evaluations performed at the 18 week time point. The subjects will continue on&#xD;
      certolizumab for a total of 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sulfur Colloid Technetium Scan. A nuclear radiology technician will inject 0.25cc of&#xD;
      technetium sulfur colloid into the first through third web spaces of the feet in both lower&#xD;
      extremities. In healthy controls the transit time from the feet to the aortic bifurcation is&#xD;
      about 30 minutes. The transit time of the tracer will be measured in both lower extremities&#xD;
      at the knee, inguinal ligament and at the aortic bifurcation. Images will be obtained with a&#xD;
      nuclear camera according to standard protocol serially over the first hour and delayed images&#xD;
      acquired in 4 to 6 hours if necessary. Three subjects who have responded to certolizumab will&#xD;
      have the scan repeated at 18 weeks as outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3T CE-MRI. Two radiologists will independently quantify LN volume and CE of all nodes in the&#xD;
      popliteal area from the MRI. These radiologists will also quantify the extent of synovial&#xD;
      inflammation, cartilage erosion and bone marrow edema via the RA MRI scoring system (RAMRIS).&#xD;
      Consensus findings will be reached and the volume and CE for each node identified together&#xD;
      with the RAMRIS will be entered into a database for this study. At the end of the study, we&#xD;
      will assess the trend of anti-TNF therapy on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The number of detectable LN in the popliteal fossa&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mean LN volume for detectable LN&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mean LNCE for detectable LN&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. LNcap for detectable LN&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. RAMRIS, by plotting the change over 8 weeks for each knee independently as we have&#xD;
           previously described for anti-TNF effects on bone marrow edema in PsA subjects. The&#xD;
           relationship between LN and clinical response to therapy will be assessed from deriving&#xD;
           the significance of the correlation coefficient (x2) of LNcap vs DAS28 respectively, as&#xD;
           we have done for bone marrow edema vs. DAS28 in PsA subjects on anti-TNF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doppler US. Ultrasound examinations of PLN will be obtained at baseline and 18 weeks after&#xD;
      anti-TNF therapy as follows. All US examinations will be performed by a rheumatologist (RT)&#xD;
      certified in musculoskeletal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be examined sonographically for the presence of inflammatory changes in the&#xD;
      knee joint. The involved knee will be examined sonographically for the presence of the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effusion. A distension of pre-femoral and suprapatellar fat pads of &gt;4.8 mm will be&#xD;
           noted as an effusion in the suprapatellar recess of the knee joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Synovial thickening. Hypoechoic, often nodular or villous appearing tissue within the&#xD;
           suprapatellar recess that is distinct from the hyperechoic capsular structures and&#xD;
           prefemoral and suprapatellar fat pads will be noted as synovitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Synovial hyperemia. If proliferative synovial tissue is identified, this tissue will be&#xD;
           examined with Doppler ultrasound for the presence of increased blood flow. This will be&#xD;
           defined as the presence of color pixels in such synovial tissue that appear in&#xD;
           synchronicity with the subject's pulse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all subjects, affected joints will be examined with gray scale and Doppler ultrasound.&#xD;
      Affected joints will be examined sonographically for the presence of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effusion in a joint will be defined as a hypoechoic area within the hyperechoic joint&#xD;
           capsule. Such anechoic intra-articular fluid will be displaceable by pressure of the US&#xD;
           probe. This helps distinguish joint fluid from intra-articular hyaline cartilage, which&#xD;
           is also anechoic to hypoechoic in appearance but is not displaceable by pressure of the&#xD;
           probe. The distension of the joint capsule will be measured using sonographic calipers.&#xD;
           This distension will be compared with normal values to assess the degree of effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Synovial thickening. The synovial lining cells are only one to three cell layers strong&#xD;
           in an unaffected joint, so intra-articular, hypoechoic proliferative synovial tissue can&#xD;
           be readily distinguished sonographically from more hyperechoic capsular structures.&#xD;
           Thickening, if present, will be measured using sonographic calipers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Synovial hyperemia. If synovial thickening is detected, this tissue will be examined&#xD;
           sonographically for the presence of Doppler flow as a measure of hyperemia and&#xD;
           inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Bony erosions. Erosions will be defined as breaks in the cortical bony contour seen in&#xD;
           two perpendicular planes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dimensions of all the PLN that can be imaged and cataloged for longitudinal analysis.&#xD;
      Synovitis and erosions will also be scored by ultrasound before and after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Technetium sulfur colloid scan&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The primary outcome measure for this study is the transit time from foot to the&#xD;
                umbilicus (T3) after injection of radioisotope in the limb with the inflamed knee&#xD;
                compared to the transit times (T3) in the extremity of the uninflamed knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secondary outcome measures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  the transit times from the foot to the knee (T1) and inguinal ligament (T2) of&#xD;
                     the radioisotope in both lower extremities&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Intensity of counts (intensity/area of interest) in the knee, inguinal&#xD;
                     ligament and umbilicus in both lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Change in transit times and tracer intensity in the three sites after 12 weeks&#xD;
                     of certolizumab treatment in the involved extremity (3 subjects only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MRI (secondary):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The amount of contrast enhancement and volume of the draining PLN will be analyzed&#xD;
                before and 18 weeks after treatment with certolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The amount of synovitis, joint effusion, erosion and bone marrow edema will be&#xD;
                quantified using the RAMRIS scoring system before and 18 weeks after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Doppler ultrasound (secondary):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Number of detectable LN in the popliteal fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Mean LN size (maximum area).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Secondary measures: synovitis, joint effusion, erosions, and blood flow will also&#xD;
                be assessed in the involved joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Degree of tenderness (0-3) with subject visual analogue scale (VAS) and swelling&#xD;
                with MD VAS (0-3) of the inflamed before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Rheumatoid Arthritis Outcome Score (RAOS)before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Disease Activity Score (DAS 28) score to assess overall joint response to therapy&#xD;
                with certolizumab&#xD;
