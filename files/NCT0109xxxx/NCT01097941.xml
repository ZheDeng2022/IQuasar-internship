    <textblock>
      A total of 51 children between the ages of 4 and 9 will be randomized to receive a two dose&#xD;
      schedule of either licensed live attenuated A/California/07/09 influenza vaccine (LAIV) or&#xD;
      licensed inactivated A/California/07/09 influenza vaccine (IIV) or IIV followed by LAIV&#xD;
      separated by 28 days. Children with prior vaccination or natural infection with novel H1N1&#xD;
      influenza will be excluded. Randomization will be stratified by pre-existing HAI titers to&#xD;
      the previous winter's seasonal H1N1 A/Brisbane/57/07 reference virus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a randomized, prospective, open-label evaluation of the&#xD;
      clinical tolerability, vaccine virus shedding, and serum and mucosal antibody response to&#xD;
      vaccination with either live monovalent novel H1N1 influenza vaccine (LAIV) or monovalent&#xD;
      inactivated novel H1N1 influenza vaccine (IIV) in healthy children between the ages of 4 and&#xD;
      9 years. Children will be screened for antibody to A/Brisbane/57/07 (H1N1) and&#xD;
      A/California/07/09 (H1N1) prior to randomization. Children with evidence of prior exposure to&#xD;
      the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus will be excluded. Those with antibodies to A/Brisbane/57/07&#xD;
      (H1N1) will be stratified by preexisting antibody. Vaccine will be administered on days 0 and&#xD;
      28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of vaccination will be assessed using symptoms collected by parents for 7 days after&#xD;
      each dose of vaccine. Serum will be obtained prior to and on day 28 following each dose of&#xD;
      vaccine and assessed for antibody by HAI, ELISA, B-cell ELISPOT and neutralization&#xD;
      techniques. Nasal secretions will be obtained by nasal aspiration prior to and on day 28&#xD;
      after each dose and assessed for HA-specific IgA antibody by ELISA. Nasal swabs will be&#xD;
      obtained on days 2, 4, and 7 after each dose of live vaccine and assessed for the presence&#xD;
      and magnitude of vaccine virus shedding of the live attenuated vaccine by rtRT-PCR and TCID50&#xD;
      on MDCK cells.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  has any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the&#xD;
             subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the&#xD;
             requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a known human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
