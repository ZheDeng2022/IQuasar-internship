    <textblock>
      The Control Study for the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain&#xD;
      (MAPP) Research Network has been established to focus on a broader approach to the study of&#xD;
      Interstitial Cystitis (IC)/Painful Bladder Syndrome (PBS) in men and women, and Chronic&#xD;
      Prostatitis (CP)/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) in men, than previously undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with no Urologic Pelvic Pain Syndromes as well as participants with specific&#xD;
      conditions (Fibromyalgia (FM), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome&#xD;
      (CFS)) are being recruited for the Trans-MAPP Control Study. These participants will act as a&#xD;
      reference/control group for the Trans-MAPP Epidemiology &amp; Phenotyping (EP) Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with many chronic pain disorders, IC and CP are poorly understood, and treatment is often&#xD;
      not helpful. The goal of this study is to better understand how pain is felt in people with&#xD;
      IC or CP. The MAPP Control Study is an observational study that will enroll participants from&#xD;
      6 Discovery Sites and 3 Satellite Sites across the U.S. The investigators will ask questions&#xD;
      and gather information about the health and life of the participants for research purposes.&#xD;
      The investigators hope that this study will lead to improvement in the treatment of IC and&#xD;
      CP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trans-MAPP Control participants will only need to complete one study visit to collect&#xD;
      baseline data and biospecimens. Potential participants will be scheduled for an eligibility&#xD;
      screening session. Following screening, potentially eligible participants will complete a&#xD;
      baseline phenotyping session, and biospecimen collections, which together are expected to&#xD;
      take approximately 2.5 hours to complete. Participants will be provided with breaks as needed&#xD;
      during the clinic visit.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        The Trans-MAPP Control Study population will include adult participants, at least 18 years&#xD;
        of age, with no urological chronic pelvic pain syndromes. These participants will fall into&#xD;
        two categories: Healthy Controls and Positive Controls.&#xD;

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The eligibility criteria for both healthy controls and positive controls are based on the&#xD;
        same set of criteria for the Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (UCPPS) participants in&#xD;
        the Trans-MAPP EP Study, with exception of additional criteria to exclude chronic pelvic&#xD;
        pain symptoms and criteria to identify the co-morbid syndromes for the positive controls.&#xD;
        All entry criteria are shown below; those specific to either healthy or positive control&#xD;
        participants are so indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
