      Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive either injections of Xeomin in 0.9% NaCl or NaCl&#xD;
      alone. Xeomin will be reconstituted with 2 mL of NaCl 0.9 which will give a final&#xD;
      concentration of 5 U of botulinum toxin A per 0.1 mL. The area affected will be injected with&#xD;
      0.1 mL at each 1-2 cm2 for a maximum total dose of 200 units. Patients will be evaluated at&#xD;
      Weeks 8, 12, 18 and 24. An unblinded pharmacist or designee will prepare placebo and Xeomin&#xD;
      injections. Patients will be unblinded at the end of the week 12 visit. After unblinding (at&#xD;
      week 12) patients who were randomized to placebo will receive Xeomin while patients initially&#xD;
      randomized to Xeomin will not be injected. All patients will be seen for follow-up visits at&#xD;
      Weeks 18 and 24. Efficacy in reducing pruritus will be measured with a 10 cm visual analogue&#xD;
      score. This will be performed at Day 0, Week 8, Week 12, Week 18 and Week 24. Efficacy will&#xD;
      also be measured by measuring the area of the hyperpigmented zone on the back. Safety will be&#xD;
      evaluated with adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Notalgia paresthetica is a common sensory neuropathy, affecting mainly the interscapular area&#xD;
      especially the T2-T6 dermatomes. The characteristic symptom is pruritus on the upper back. It&#xD;
      is occasionally accompanied by pain, paresthesia, hyperesthesia and a well circumscribed&#xD;
      hyperpigmentation of the affected area. The correlation of notalgia paresthetica localization&#xD;
      with corresponding degenerative changes in the spine suggest that spinal nerve impingement&#xD;
      may be a contributing cause. Topical treatments such as corticosteroids, menthol, capsaicine&#xD;
      and pramoxine are usually not very effective. Patients are very affected in their daily&#xD;
      activities by this chronic condition and usually disappointed by the current available&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent publication reports success in treating 2 patients with notalgia paresthetica with&#xD;
      botulinum toxin A. In both cases a complete response for pruritus was noted. The major&#xD;
      limitations of this publication are the small number of cases (two) and the fact that there&#xD;
      was no control. The mechanism of action of botulinum toxin A in nostalgia paresthetica has&#xD;
      not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However the beneficial effects of botulinum toxin A on other diseases causing pruritus and&#xD;
      pain has previously been reported. Botulinum toxin A has been shown to prevent the release of&#xD;
      substance P, a well known mediator involved in pain and itch, and this may explain its&#xD;
      efficacy in pruritic diseases. This proposal plans to study the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      botulinum toxin A (Xeomin) for the treatment of notalgia paresthetica in a randomized placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial. Botulinum toxin A prevents the release of neuromediators such as&#xD;
      acetylcholine. Botulinum toxin A has been used for many years to treat various disorders&#xD;
      including blepharospasm, spasmodic torticollis, post stroke spasticity of the upper limbs,&#xD;
      strabismus, palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis and wrinkles. This study will use Xeomin, a&#xD;
      purified botulinum clostridium neurotoxin A that has recently been approved by Health Canada.&#xD;
      Xeomin is currently approved for the treatment of blepharospasm, spasmodic torticollis and&#xD;
      post stroke spasticity of the upper limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent publication reported success in treating two patients with notalgia paresthetica&#xD;
      with botulinum toxin A. In both cases a complete response of pruritus was noted. One patient&#xD;
      was still symptom free after 18 months while the other patient had a mild resurgence of&#xD;
      pruritus at 18 months. The major limitations of this publication are the small number of&#xD;
      cases (two) and the fact that there was no control. The current proposal plans to study the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin A for the treatment of notalgia paresthetica in a&#xD;
      randomized placebo controlled trial. In this study Xeomin will be reconstituted and used&#xD;
      according to the approved Canadian Product Monograph.&#xD;
