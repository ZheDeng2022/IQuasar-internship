  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smokers with schizophrenia have more difficulties quitting smoking than smokers without a&#xD;
      mental disorder. Varenicline (Champix) is a new stop smoking medication with a unique&#xD;
      mechanism of action. It is a nicotine-like drug which is not addictive and not associated&#xD;
      with the health risks of tobacco smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Varenicline (VAR) binds to sites in the brain called nicotine receptors that play an&#xD;
      important role in nicotine dependence. People with schizophrenia have difficulties in&#xD;
      concentrating and remembering. Scientists believe that people with schizophrenia use smoking&#xD;
      to remedy their cognitive problems. We will test VAR to see if it improves cognitive problems&#xD;
      in smokers with schizophrenia in comparison to non-mentally ill smokers to determine whether&#xD;
      people with schizophrenia get direct benefit from this nicotine-like drug. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that VAR (in comparison to a placebo) will reduce aspects of cognitive impairment in smokers&#xD;
      and nonsmokers with schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is characterized by deficits in neurocognitive function, including executive&#xD;
      function, attention, and spatial and verbal memory. Central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors&#xD;
      (nAChR) are dysregulated in schizophrenia. It has been shown that neurocognitive deficits in&#xD;
      schizophrenia improve by administration of nicotine, nicotinic agonists or cigarette smoking.&#xD;
      Hence, it is believed that cigarette smoking may remedy cognitive deficits in schizophrenia&#xD;
      and in fact some persons with schizophrenia may be &quot;self-medicating&quot; with tobacco to counter&#xD;
      such cognitive problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence rates of cigarette smoking in persons with schizophrenia are higher than in&#xD;
      the general population (58-88% vs. 25% respectively). This population also has a nicotine&#xD;
      dependence rate of around 80 % and a high relapse rate after smoking cessation. Additionally&#xD;
      the leading cause of medical problems and death in people with schizophrenia is tobacco&#xD;
      addiction. Research that addresses the problem of smoking in schizophrenia is of great&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Varenicline (VAR), an α4β2 nAChR partial agonist, approved for smoking cessation, mimics the&#xD;
      effect of nicotine by stimulating nAChRs, and releasing sufficient dopamine in order to&#xD;
      reduce craving and withdrawal effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will follow four groups of subjects (N=40) that will receive neuropsychological&#xD;
      and psychiatric testing in three consecutive sessions (smoking satiation, abstinence and&#xD;
      reinstatement) separated by at least one week over 3 weeks. The groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. cigarette smokers with schizophrenia (N=10),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. non-smokers with schizophrenia (N=10),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. healthy cigarette smoking controls (N=10),&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. non-smoking controls (N=10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will be age- and sex- matched. Pre-treatment with varenicline (VAR) or placebo&#xD;
      will start on Day 1 of each test session will be as follows: 1) 0.0 mg/day 2) 0.5 mg twice&#xD;
      daily 3) or 1 mg twice daily for 3 days. Testing days will be separated by at least 1 week&#xD;
      apart to rule out medication carry-over effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If nicotinic acetylcholine receptors can be stimulated resulting in more dopamine release and&#xD;
      improved neurocognitive function without inducing deleterious health effects it may be of&#xD;
      benefit to persons with schizophrenia who smoke tobacco.&#xD;
