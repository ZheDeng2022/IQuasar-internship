  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus when it leaves the cells in the liver is bound to a type of fat. An&#xD;
      component of grapefruit could block this fat and thus lower the amount of virus in the blood&#xD;
      stream. We propose that treatment with this ingredient, called naringenin, could be used to&#xD;
      block this fat and HCV in persons infected with hepatitis C.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hepatitis C virus is actively secreted by the liver of infected patients while bound to&#xD;
      very low density lipoprotein (vLDL). The grapefruit flavonoid naringenin could be used to&#xD;
      block vLDL secretion and lower the circulating viral titer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with naringenin will block vLDL and HCV secretion in persons infected with HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single-dose of naringenin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the changes in circulating HCV titers during the transition from a fasted to&#xD;
           fed state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the changes in circulating HCV titers after administration of the grapefruit&#xD;
           flavonoid naringenin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study effects of naringenin on vLDL secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm, cross over study where placebo is administered during a transition from&#xD;
      a fasted to a fed state, then the protocol is repeated with a single dose of naringenin plus&#xD;
      cyclodextrin, using the previous measurements as his/her own control&#xD;
