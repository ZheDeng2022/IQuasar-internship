  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if GE reflux events are associated with&#xD;
      increasing levels of pepsin in spit samples. Pepsin is a special protein called an &quot;enzyme&quot;&#xD;
      that is made only in your stomach. It is not normally found in your throat. Pepsin breaks&#xD;
      down food proteins that you eat to form nutritional building blocks that your body can use to&#xD;
      grow. An enzyme is a substance that helps break down proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is very common in infants and children, but can result&#xD;
      in serious health problems if not accurately diagnosed. The investigators currently do not&#xD;
      have a definitive test to be used as a standard for diagnosing pediatric GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of pepsin, an enzyme normally produced only in the stomach, has been used as a&#xD;
      non-invasive way to detect gastric aspiration (reflux of stomach fluid into the airway) in&#xD;
      both adults and children, but using pepsin to detect reflux has not been tested. Since pepsin&#xD;
      should not be present in the normal esophagus and respiratory tract, but is always present in&#xD;
      reflux fluid from the stomach, the investigators believe that the more GE reflux the&#xD;
      investigators detect, the higher the levels of pepsin the investigators see in the fluid&#xD;
      collected from the mouth. If patients do not have GE reflux, but have swallowing problems&#xD;
      alone in which food or liquid goes into the airway, the investigators expect that these&#xD;
      patients will have no pepsin in the fluid collected from their mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test these hypotheses by measuring pepsin levels from mouth fluid and&#xD;
      comparing them with the number of GE reflux events the investigators find using the&#xD;
      pH/impedance (MII (multichannel intraluminal impedance)) test. Since the investigators are&#xD;
      interested in pepsin levels for all types of reflux - acid and non-acid -the investigators&#xD;
      will study children whether or not they are on acid blocking medicines. The investigators&#xD;
      will also look at pepsin levels in patients whose pH/MII is normal, but have aspiration alone&#xD;
      that the investigators find on a modified barium swallow (MBS) study. The investigators will&#xD;
      measure pepsin levels in healthy children with no reflux symptoms and no swallowing problems&#xD;
      as the investigators controls. The investigators anticipate that this study will show a&#xD;
      positive correlation between GE reflux events and the presence of oropharyngeal pepsin, which&#xD;
      may allow us to use pepsin as a way to test for reflux.&#xD;
