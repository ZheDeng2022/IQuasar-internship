      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Image (MRI) guided focal prostate cancer laser thermal ablation in males, ages&#xD;
      40-80 with biopsy confirmed early clinical stage prostate cancer (T1c or T2a) with an&#xD;
      identifiable lesion on mutliparametric MRI, with a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) of &lt;&#xD;
      15ng/ml, who have not yet undergone pelvic radiation or hormonal deprivation therapy.&#xD;

      This is a single center, single arm, open-label study to evaluate the safety and feasibility&#xD;
      of MRI guided focal prostate cancer laser ablation in patients with a focus of prostate&#xD;
      cancer who has not yet received treatment for their cancer. Patients fulfilling the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and having none of the clinical exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study&#xD;
      after they (or their legal representative) have signed the informed consent form. No control&#xD;
      group will be utilized and all patients will receive MRI guided FLA for their focal prostate&#xD;
      cancer. As part of the screening process, patients will provide a medical history and undergo&#xD;
      a physical examination, including a digital rectal examination (DRE). At the first visit,&#xD;
      patients will also be given a copy of the informed consent, and a copy of quality of life and&#xD;
      performance questionnaires to assess urinary, rectal, and erectile functions (IPSS&#xD;
      questionnaire for urinary, IIEF5 questionnaire for erectile function, for all). MR imaging at&#xD;
      visit 2 will serve to determine if a single site of prostate cancer can be localized. At&#xD;
      visit 3, 12 cores transrectal us guided prostate biopsy will confirm yet again that this is a&#xD;
      unilateral, unifocal histologically proven tumour in the site recognized on the MRI. On&#xD;
      preoperative examination (visit 4) - blood and urine samples will be taken prior to&#xD;
      procedure. Visit 5 - the focal treatment will be performed under regional or general&#xD;
      anesthesia, or conscious sedation, (as determined by the anesthesiologist) in the TGH&#xD;
      research 1.5T MRI suite. MR guided FLA procedure is similar to MR guided brachytherapy, with&#xD;
      fibers and probes inserted transperineally outside the bore of the MR and then the patient is&#xD;
      moved inside the bore to verify position before deploying the laser. The treatment is&#xD;
      expected to last 2-3 hours, and patients expected to have no pain during the whole procedure.&#xD;
      Laser ablation will be monitored using MR thermometry14, 15.An MRI scan will be done&#xD;
      immediately after the ablation, as initial assessment for ensuring complete treatment of the&#xD;
      target volume, as well as ensuring that treatment does not extend to critical structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The size and location of the lesion will be compared to the planned target volume and the&#xD;
      proximity of the lesion to the urethra and rectum. If the lesion does not encompass the&#xD;
      target volume, and is still a safe distance from either critical structure, FLA may be&#xD;
      continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 3, 7, 30, and 120 following the procedure, patients will be assessed for clinical&#xD;
      signs of urinary, rectal, and erectile complications and will complete validated&#xD;
      self-assessment tools on these functions. Free/Total PSA will be monitor on visit -1 and&#xD;
      after the treatment on day 7, 30 and 120, in order to try to understand the effect of FLA on&#xD;
      PSA. Four months after the focal procedure, a further 12 cores biopsy, plus 2 cores aimed to&#xD;
      the ablated lesion will then be preformed to verify the oncological effectiveness of the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
