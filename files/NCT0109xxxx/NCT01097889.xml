  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supplementary feeding programs for children with moderate acute malnutrition have been&#xD;
      implemented in developing countries using treatment foods with minimal or no evidence of&#xD;
      their effectiveness. Fortified peanut paste is a popular new treatment food for children with&#xD;
      severe and moderate malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To investigate the relative effectiveness of two non-identical therapeutic foods&#xD;
      in children with moderate malnutrition by comparing differences in performance indicators&#xD;
      (i.e. recovery rates), recovery times, and change in weight-for-height z-scores in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed research project will evaluate the relative effectiveness of two non-identical&#xD;
      treatment foods for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition in children&#xD;

      This research protocol will be embedded as a component of the UN World Food Programme (WFP)&#xD;
      -supported Supplementary Feeding programmes in Ethiopia. The proposed study is a prospective&#xD;
      cluster-randomized equivalence trial that will compare the relative effectiveness of two&#xD;
      feeding interventions in four woredas (districts). Research will be implemented in two&#xD;
      comparable woredas (one with CSB and one with RUSF), in two different areas in Sidama zone&#xD;
      that represent different livelihood zones, main source of crop income, and level of food&#xD;
      insecurity&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All children 6 to 60 months of age who are identified as malnourished based on MUAC&#xD;
             measurements with WFH ≥70 to &lt;80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with WFH &lt; 70% or presenting with bilateral pitting oedema (they will be&#xD;
             referred to therapeutic feeding programme).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with any illness or clinical condition that prevents them from safely&#xD;
             ingesting either supplementary foods. A child is medically assessed upon admission for&#xD;
             any complicated clinical condition (oedema, malaria, vomiting, chronic diarrhea,&#xD;
             infections, appetite, etc) that would require medical care and those children will be&#xD;
             referred to the therapeutic feeding programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All children transferred from the therapeutic feeding programme directly into the&#xD;
             supplementary feeding programme - however they will not be included in the research&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with WFH &gt; 80% but MUAC 110 to 120 mm- they will be admitted to SFP however&#xD;
             will not be included in the research study.&#xD;
