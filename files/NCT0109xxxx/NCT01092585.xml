      Tesetaxel is an orally administered chemotherapy agent of the taxane class. This study is&#xD;
      being undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tesetaxel administered as second-line&#xD;
      therapy to patients with advanced melanoma and normal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).&#xD;

    <description>Tesetaxel capsules will be administered orally once every 21 days until the patient meets a withdrawal criterion or initiates nonstudy therapy for melanoma. The duration of protocol therapy will not exceed 12 months.&#xD;
In Cycle 1, a flat dose of 40 mg will be administered to patients of relatively normal weight. For patients who weigh at least 25% below their ideal body weight, a flat dose of 35 mg will be administered. For patients who weigh at least 25% above their ideal body weight, a flat dose of 45 mg will be administered. Dose escalation by 5 mg in Cycle 2 and an additional 5 mg in Cycle 3 is permitted provided protocol-specified criteria are met.</description>
