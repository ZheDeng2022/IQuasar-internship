      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response of an&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One approach to developing a preventive HIV vaccine includes the use of a prime-boost vaccine&#xD;
      strategy. This type of strategy involves two vaccines, given sequentially at different time&#xD;
      points. The goal is to stimulate different parts of the immune system and enhance the body's&#xD;
      overall immune response to HIV. In this study, participants will receive two HIV vaccines 3&#xD;
      months apart. Heterologous-insert prime-boost vaccine regimens, which use the same gene from&#xD;
      different HIV-1 subtypes, may be more effective than traditional homologous insert&#xD;
      prime-boost vaccine regimens at eliciting immune responses directed at epitopes that are&#xD;
      highly prevalent, possibly leading to a more effective immune system response to the vaccine.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous-insert&#xD;
      prime-boost HIV vaccine regimen that uses inserts from different HIV-1 subtypes and different&#xD;
      adenovirus vectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected people. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of five study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will receive the recombinant adenovirus serotype 35 (rAd35) Env A vaccine at&#xD;
           baseline and the recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) Env A vaccine at Month 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will receive the rAd35 Env A vaccine at baseline and the rAd5 Env B vaccine at&#xD;
           Month 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 will receive the rAd35 Env A vaccine at baseline and at Month 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4 will receive the rAd5 Env A vaccine at baseline and at Month 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 5 will receive the rAd5 Env A vaccine at baseline and the rAd5 Env B vaccine at&#xD;
           Month 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All vaccines will be injected into the upper arm. At both vaccination study visits,&#xD;
      participants will undergo a physical exam, a medical and medication history review, a blood&#xD;
      and urine collection, and questionnaires. Participants will receive counseling on HIV risk&#xD;
      reduction and pregnancy prevention. After receiving the vaccine, participants will remain in&#xD;
      the clinic for at least 30 minutes for observation and monitoring of side effects. For 3 days&#xD;
      after each vaccination, participants will record their temperature and side effects in a&#xD;
      symptom log. In addition to the vaccine study visits, other study visits will occur at Week&#xD;
      2, two weeks after the Month 3 visit, and at Months 4, 6, and 9, at which time various study&#xD;
      procedures will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by study researchers once a year for 5 years for follow-up&#xD;
      safety monitoring. Safety monitoring will not involve visiting a clinic except if a&#xD;
      confirmatory HIV test is needed. Questions will assess health and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability, as well as the&#xD;
      ability, of a heterologous-insert prime-boost vaccine regimen using env inserts from&#xD;
      different HIV-1 clades to increase T-cell responses. In addition, this study is evaluating&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a heterologous-insert prime-boost and vector prime-boost vaccine regimen&#xD;
      at increasing T-cell responses. The study will also compare the degree of polyfunctionality&#xD;
      of insert specific T cells after vaccination within heterologous and homologous vector&#xD;
      vaccine regimens.&#xD;
