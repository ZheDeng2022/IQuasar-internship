    <textblock>
      This trial is enrolling patients who are already being seen at OHSU weight loss clinic or&#xD;
      have been referred for clinical reasons by their physician to the OHSU weight loss clinic and&#xD;
      are going to have a esophageal manometry that would be paid for by their insurance company&#xD;
      for clinical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients undergoing weight loss surgery investigators plan to study the effect of&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure during a esophageal manometry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be invited to be in this research study because they are being considered for&#xD;
      weight loss (bariatric) surgery that is being paid for by their insurance company. As part of&#xD;
      the preparation for surgery, subjects will have a test called manometry that measures&#xD;
      pressure in the esophagus (food pipe). For this test, a tube will be lowered down one nostril&#xD;
      into the food pipe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) reduces reflux in people&#xD;
      with or without sleep apnea as well as in people with reflux. The investigators are trying to&#xD;
      understand how this occurs. This research study will add about 10 additional minutes to the&#xD;
      clinic visit. The investigators expect about 50 subjects to be in the study at OHSU. Outcomes&#xD;
      will be measured at 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for esophageal manometry and motility studies prior to their bariatric&#xD;
      surgery will be given a study flyer at the bariatric clinic. A list of the patients who are&#xD;
      interested in participating in the study will be given to one of the study investigators. A&#xD;
      study investigator will call these patients to explain the study, assess their interest in&#xD;
      participation, and review their eligibility for entrance into the study. Assessment of&#xD;
      eligibility will be done by asking for medical history over the phone as well as by&#xD;
      requesting access to their medical record to ensure the patients do not meet exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. After review of the patient's clinical history verbally and through review of the&#xD;
      medical record, informed consent will be signed at their manometry appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo the manometry procedure. After finishing the procedure, when the&#xD;
      catheter would normally be withdrawn after the procedure, it will remain in place for the&#xD;
      study. A CPAP mask will be placed over the subject's nose. CPAP blows air in the nose with a&#xD;
      mild pressure. The air pressure will be slowly increased while pressure in the esophagus is&#xD;
      being recorded. As done with the regular manometry, the subject will be asked to swallow&#xD;
      small amounts of water during the test. The test will be completed in 10 minutes. The CPAP&#xD;
      and the tube will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a questionnaire prior to the manometry about gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
