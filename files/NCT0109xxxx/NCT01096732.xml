  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is looking at the effect of a new drug called GDC-0449 in patients with&#xD;
      cancer of the pancreas. Laboratory studies have shown that this drug blocks a process in&#xD;
      pancreatic cells thought to be involved in cancer development and spread. This process is&#xD;
      called the 'Hedgehog signalling pathway'. As yet, it is unclear whether blocking hedgehog&#xD;
      signalling will directly affect the tumour cells themselves or the surrounding normal tissue.&#xD;
      Understanding this distinction will help improve treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      Patients will be offered to participate in this research study if they have localised&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery. In the period between diagnosis and surgery&#xD;
      the investigators do not normally treat patients, however in this trial the investigators&#xD;
      will ask patients to take GDC-0449 during the approximately two weeks until the day of&#xD;
      surgery. All patients that enter this study will have undergone a diagnostic biopsy of the&#xD;
      pancreatic tumour and the investigators will collect a second sample of the tumour at&#xD;
      surgery. The main question of this study is whether the investigators can detect a change in&#xD;
      hedgehog signalling in the normal tumour surrounding tissue. Furthermore the investigators&#xD;
      will look very carefully whether this treatment is safe for patients. All problems before and&#xD;
      after surgery will be carefully documented and the investigators have defined strict rules to&#xD;
      stop the study if the investigators observe serious problems.&#xD;
