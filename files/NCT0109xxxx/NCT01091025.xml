  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) has risen significantly as patients'&#xD;
      survival improves. Early diagnosis of CFRD is crucial to prevent the unnecessary&#xD;
      deterioration of lung function and nutritional status, both of which affect the patient's&#xD;
      overall survival. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT) is the accepted method for detecting&#xD;
      CFRD. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust guidelines (2004) recommend that patients with CF over the&#xD;
      age of twelve years should be screened annually. Most hospitals use an annual OGTT.&#xD;
      Performing OGTT on all CF patients is inconvenient and may not be cost effective, as patients&#xD;
      have to starve overnight and need to spend an extra 2 hours in the hospital in addition to&#xD;
      all the other annual review tests. In our centre, a selective approach is used. If patients&#xD;
      have an abnormal random blood glucose and /or abnormal glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c)&#xD;
      and/or symptoms of hyperglycaemia or unexplained weight loss then an OGTT will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the clinical efficiency in the screening for CFRD in the two different&#xD;
           methods: i)a selective approach , ii)an unselected annual OGTT for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the cost effectiveness of the two approaches in the screening for CFRD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CFRD affects 30% of all patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) by the age of twenty-five. Early&#xD;
      diagnosis of CFRD is crucial to prevent the unnecessary deterioration of pulmonary function&#xD;
      and nutritional status, both of which affect the patient's overall survival. The selective&#xD;
      approach takes less patient time and is less expensive. If it is equally accurate it should&#xD;
      be used routinely. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the accepted method for&#xD;
      detecting CFRD and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust guidelines recommend that patients with CF over&#xD;
      the age of twelve years should be screened annually. Yung et al, questioned this approach and&#xD;
      argued that performing OGTT on all CF patients is inconvenient and may not be cost effective,&#xD;
      as patients have to starve overnight and need to spend an extra 2 hours in the hospital in&#xD;
      addition to all the other annual review tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a selective approach in performing OGTTs in the screening for CFRD will be&#xD;
      used; this includes the use of a combination of clinical and biochemical criteria that of&#xD;
      abnormal random blood glucose and /or abnormal glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and/or&#xD;
      symptoms of hyperglycaemia, or weight loss.&#xD;

    <description>Patients identified for OGTT based on the selective approach by the two independent reviewers will be compared.&#xD;
Patients will form two groups:&#xD;
i)those identified as needing OGTT, ii)those on whom they considered it unnecessary&#xD;
The results of the two groups will then be compared with the data obtain from OGTT to which the two reviewers were 'blinded'</description>
