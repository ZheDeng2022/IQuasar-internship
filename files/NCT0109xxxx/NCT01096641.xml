      Postcancer fatigue is a severe and invalidating problem, impairing quality of life. About 20&#xD;
      to 40% of the patients remain fatigued, at least one year after successful cancer treatment.&#xD;
      Fortunately, there is an effective treatment for postcancer fatigue; cognitive behavior&#xD;
      therapy. However, no cause for postcancer fatigue has been identified yet. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to identify factors that (partly) cause postcancer fatigue to improve the&#xD;
      theoretical understanding of fatigue and to improve the diagnostics of fatigue, predict&#xD;
      therapy outcome, and facilitate other treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, disease-free fatigued cancer patients, who finished treatment for cancer at&#xD;
      least one year and maximally ten years ago, will be approached for this study. They will be&#xD;
      compared to non-fatigued patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, a baseline assessment will take place. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brains will&#xD;
      be performed to assess brain volume and magnetic resonance spectroscopy will be performed to&#xD;
      measure the concentrations of specific substances in the brains. Changes in the volume of&#xD;
      parts of the brains have been observed in (non-cancer) patients with the chronic fatigue&#xD;
      syndrome (CFS), in comparison with healthy controls. In addition, abnormal concentrations of&#xD;
      specific substances have been observed in patients with CFS compared to healthy controls. To&#xD;
      assess muscle fatigue, a two-minute endurance test of the upper arm will be administered at&#xD;
      maximal voluntary contraction. Next to differences in the brains, CFS patients showed&#xD;
      (central) muscle fatigue. A maximal exercise test on a bicycle will be performed to assess&#xD;
      physical fitness. Physical activity in fatigued cancer survivors is decreased, compared to&#xD;
      healthy controls. It is not known whether physical deconditioning originated during the&#xD;
      cancer treatment is the reason why these patients are still less active. In addition,&#xD;
      patients and controls will wear an actometer for two weeks to register baseline daily&#xD;
      physical activity and for an additional 5 days after the maximal exercise test, to assess the&#xD;
      effect of exercise on the daily physical activity. Finally, patients and controls will&#xD;
      complete standardized questionnaires and will perform neurological/psychological tests, like&#xD;
      a reaction time test and a short time memory task, at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the non-fatigued and the fatigued patients will be compared at baseline. For&#xD;
      the non-fatigued participants, the study will be finished after the baseline measurements.&#xD;
      The fatigued participants will start with cognitive behavior therapy immediately after the&#xD;
      baseline measurements or after 6 months, depending on the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the therapy, after six months, or after 6 months of waiting for cognitive&#xD;
      behavior therapy, a second assessment will take place, comparable to the baseline&#xD;
      measurements. These results will be compared with the baseline situation to analyze the&#xD;
      effect of cognitive behavior therapy on the (possible) causes of postcancer fatigue.&#xD;

      Fatigue after curative treatment for cancer is a severe and invalidating problem. 20-40% of&#xD;
      disease-free cancer patients mention fatigue as a frequent complaint, impairing quality of&#xD;
      life. In search for (neuro)physiological factors determining fatigue, our centre has recently&#xD;
      demonstrated the presence of morphological differences in the brains of non-cancer patients&#xD;
      with the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) compared with healthy volunteers. Both in patients&#xD;
      with CFS and in fatigued patients with neuromuscular diseases we showed that fatigue has a&#xD;
      central neurophysiological component (so-called central activation failure). Others have&#xD;
      shown that chronic fatigue is associated with altered brain metabolism. Studies with proton&#xD;
      MR spectroscopy (1H MRS) have demonstrated a higher choline to creatine ratio in the brains&#xD;
      of chronically fatigued patients. This suggests increased cell membrane turnover. Also&#xD;
      reduced levels of N-acetylaspartate-creatine ratio (NAA/Cr) in the right hippocampus have&#xD;
      been observed in these patients, which suggests a decrease in functional axons. Finally,&#xD;
      elevated ventricular lactate was observed, which suggests changes in brain glucose&#xD;
      metabolism. Actigraphy has shown that actual physical activity in fatigued cancer survivors&#xD;
      is decreased compared to healthy controls. It is not known whether physical deconditioning&#xD;
      originated during the actual cancer treatment is the reason why these patients are still less&#xD;
      active. Until now no other (neuro)physiological factors have been identified explaining&#xD;
      fatigue in cancer survivors. Recently we have shown that Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      especially designed for fatigued cancer patients is an effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To identify and measure (neuro)physiological factors of fatigue in fatigued cancer&#xD;
      survivors and to determine the role of these factors in the maintaining of fatigue. The&#xD;
      identification of (neuro)physiological factors of persistent fatigue can help to improve the&#xD;
      diagnostics of fatigue, predict therapy outcome and facilitate other treatment options.&#xD;
      Finally, if (neuro)physiological characteristics of fatigue can be influenced by CBT it will&#xD;
      enhance our understanding of the mechanism causing fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions: 1) What are characteristic (neuro)physiological factors of fatigue in&#xD;
      disease-free cancer patients? 2) To which degree can these factors be influenced by Cognitive&#xD;
      Behaviour Therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: In this explorative study fatigued disease-free cancer patients (n=57), who finished&#xD;
      treatment for cancer at least one year and maximally ten years ago, will be approached for&#xD;
      this study and asked for informed consent. They will be compared to age and sex matched&#xD;
      non-fatigued patients (n=21). First, a base-line assessment will take place, which includes&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to assess brain&#xD;
      morphology and brain metabolites, respectively. To assess peripheral and central fatigue a&#xD;
      two-minute endurance test will be administered at maximal voluntary (isometric) contraction&#xD;
      (MVC). During the test changes in EMG and force indicate peripheral fatigue, while central&#xD;
      fatigue is studied by the twitch interpolation technique. A maximal exercise test will be&#xD;
      performed to assess physical fitness and deconditioning. At baseline patients will also be&#xD;
      given an actometer which will register daily activity during two weeks. Further, the&#xD;
      actometer will register daily activity up to five days after the maximal exercise test.&#xD;
      Finally, at baseline patients will fill out a standardized questionnaire, including the&#xD;
      Checklist Individual Strength and a self-observation list to assess fatigue severity. Then,&#xD;
      the fatigued patients start immediately with Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT). At the end of&#xD;
      the therapy, after 6 months, a second assessment will take place in this group of patients.&#xD;
      The assessment consists of the same measurements as at baseline. The results will be compared&#xD;
      with the baseline situation to analyze the effect of CBT on the (neuro)physiological&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance of this study: Fatigue long after treatment for cancer is a frequently occurring&#xD;
      problem, which has important consequences for quality of life in these patients.&#xD;
      Identification of characteristic (neuro)physiological factors of fatigue in disease-free&#xD;
      cancer patients may not only serve a theoretical understanding of this invalidating&#xD;
      condition, but may also provide an objective biological marker that could support the&#xD;
      diagnosis and follow-up of treatment. The identification of (neuro)physiological factors&#xD;
      which play a role in fatigue after cancer may aid in the early recognition of patients who&#xD;
      are at risk for developing fatigue and may lead to early intervention and/or different&#xD;
      treatment strategies.&#xD;
