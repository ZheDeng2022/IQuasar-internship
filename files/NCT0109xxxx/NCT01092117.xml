    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to determine whether the Ovation Abdominal Stent&#xD;
      Graft System is a safe and effective method of treating abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA's) in&#xD;
      those patients considered to be suitable candidates for open surgical repair.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II prospective, consecutive enrolling, non-randomized multi-center clinical&#xD;
      evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft System when&#xD;
      used in the treatment of patients with AAA (Treatment Group) as compared to a performance&#xD;
      goal (Control Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 study patients will be enrolled at up to 40 institutions. An additional 100 study&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the continued access phase.&#xD;

    <measure>The primary safety endpoint is defined as the proportion of subjects who experience a Major Adverse Event within 30 days of the initial procedure. The primary effectiveness endpoint is proportion of subjects that achieve Treatment Success.</measure>

    <description>The secondary safety endpoints are:&#xD;
Mortality rates at 30 days and 12 months&#xD;
AAA related mortality at 30 days and 12 months&#xD;
Major Adverse Events (MAE) through 12 months&#xD;
AAA rupture through 12 months&#xD;

The secondary effectiveness endpoints will be evaluated through 12 months:&#xD;
Technical success, defined as successful delivery and deployment of one aortic body and two iliac limbs.&#xD;
Freedom from Type I &amp; III endoleaks&#xD;
Freedom from stent graft migration&#xD;
Freedom from AAA enlargement&#xD;
Freedom from loss of device integrity&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Maximum diameter of aneurysm exceeds 1.5 times the transverse dimension of an&#xD;
