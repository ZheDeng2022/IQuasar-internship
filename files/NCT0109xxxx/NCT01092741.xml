      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve low levels of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) ratios of B-cell antigen receptor&#xD;
      (Bcr-Abl)/Bcr (molecular CR) in a significant proportion of patients after 12 months of&#xD;
      higher doses (800 mg daily) of Gleevec therapy To increase the proportion of patients&#xD;
      achieving a complete cytogenetic response in patients with Ph-positive chronic phase CML&#xD;
      using initial higher dose Gleevec therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the durations of PCR negativity, cytogenetic response, hematologic control, and&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze differences in response rates and in prognosis within different risk groups and&#xD;
      patient characteristics&#xD;

      Treatment: Imatinib mesylate is a new oral medication that blocks a protein that is&#xD;
      responsible for CML&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on this study will take 400 mg of imatinib twice daily (morning and evening). If you&#xD;
      have side effects, the dose may be lowered. If you are taking less than 800 mg of imatinib,&#xD;
      you can take your dose once per day or divided in two doses. Imatinib mesylate should be&#xD;
      taken with a large glass of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing 3 to 12 months of therapy, response to imatinib mesylate will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Treatment may be continued for up to 20 years, or as long as it is judged best to control the&#xD;
      leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update June 2010:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests are recommended 2 times per year. Your doctor will discuss with you how often you&#xD;
      should have blood tests. Bone marrow will be done if your doctor thinks it is necessary to&#xD;
      check your disease. You must return to M. D. Anderson at least once every year. You may not&#xD;
      need a bone marrow test every visit, but you will have blood drawn to measure the amount of&#xD;
      disease you have. If the leukemia cannot be found for 2 years or longer on the blood test&#xD;
      called PCR which is done to measure the amount of disease you have, your doctor may talk to&#xD;
      you about stopping treatment with imatinib. If you and your doctor decide to stop your&#xD;
      therapy, you will have a blood test for PCR done every 3 to 6 months. You do not need to&#xD;
      return to M. D. Anderson to have this blood test done. You may have the blood taken by your&#xD;
      local doctor and mailed to M. D. Anderson. If the leukemia is found again by the PCR blood&#xD;
      test, your doctor may recommend that you restart treatment with imatinib. You may decide to&#xD;
      stay on treatment with imatinib even if your PCR blood test does not show any sign of&#xD;
      leukemia for 2 years or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The FDA has authorized the use of imatinib mesylate for&#xD;
      patients with CML. It is the dose of imatinib mesylate being used that is investigational. A&#xD;
      total of 50 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>CR Rate = Number participants out of total treated with complete cytogenetic response. Complete Hematologic Remission (CHR) - normalization &gt;4 weeks of bone marrow (less than 5% blasts) &amp; peripheral blood with white blood count (WBC)&lt;10x10^9/L &amp; no peripheral blasts, promyelocytes or myelocytes, disappearance of all signs &amp; symptoms of disease. Partial Hematologic Response (PHR) = CHR except persistence of immature cells (myelocytes, metamyelocytes), or splenomegaly &lt;50% of pretreatment, or thrombocytosis &gt;450x10^9/L but &lt;50% of pretreatment. Complete hematologic remission further classified according to suppression of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) by cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH): a) No cytogenetic response - Ph positive 100% of pretreatment value; b) Minor cytogenetic response - Ph positive 35-90% of pretreatment value; c) Partial cytogenetic response - Ph positive 1-34% of pretreatment value; d) Complete cytogenetic response - Ph positive 0%.</description>
