      RATIONALE: Midostaurin may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Midostaurin may help azacitidine kill more cancer cells by making the cancer cells&#xD;
      more sensitive to the drug. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and&#xD;
      best dose of midostaurin when given together with azacitidine and to see how well it works in&#xD;
      treating elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safe and tolerable dose of midostaurin in combination with azacitidine in&#xD;
      patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. (Phase I) II. To describe the toxicity profile of&#xD;
      the combination of midostaurin and azacitidine in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.&#xD;
      (Phase I/II) III. To determine the complete and partial response rate and rate of hematologic&#xD;
      improvement of midostaurin and 5-azacitidine in untreated acute myelogenous leukemia. (Phase&#xD;
      I/II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe pharmacokinetics of oral midostaurin given in combination with azacitidine on&#xD;
      a day 8-21 schedule. (Phase I/II) II. To correlate treatment response with FLT3 mutational&#xD;
      status in a descriptive fashion. (Phase I/II) III. To assess overall survival of patients&#xD;
      from initiation of midostaurin-azacitidine toxicities. (Phase I/II) IV. To determine median&#xD;
      disease-free survival of the regimen in untreated patients. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe signaling in CD117+ committed myeloid precursors in whole blood and bone&#xD;
      marrow samples before and during treatment. (Phase I/II) II. To measure in vivo FLT3&#xD;
      inhibition using plasma inhibition assay (PIA) and Flt ligand (FL) levels in patients&#xD;
      enrolled on this trial before and during treatment. (Phase I/II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of midostaurin followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes on days 1-7 and&#xD;
      midostaurin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 8-21. Courses repeat every 28 days for up&#xD;
      to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
