  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to evaluate S-MRCP, in comparison to direct pancreatic function, to&#xD;
      measure pancreatic exocrine function in patients who have symptoms suspicious for&#xD;
      insufficiency. We hypothesize that S-MRCP imaging parameters will correlate well with the&#xD;
      direct pancreatic exocrine functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection offers the only hope of cure for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. While&#xD;
      perioperative mortality rates have declined in recent years, pancreatic resection is still&#xD;
      associated with significant postoperative malnutrition, maldigestion, and glucose&#xD;
      intolerance, mostly as a result of pancreatic insufficiency. Quantifying individual&#xD;
      pancreatic function remains a challenge, but is essential in improving the survival and&#xD;
      quality of life of pancreatic cancer patients. Secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP) has recently emerged as a widely-accepted noninvasive&#xD;
      technique to assess morphological changes in pancreatic ducts, as well as functional&#xD;
      secretory capacity of the gland. The aim of our study is to evaluate S-MRCP as a means to&#xD;
      evaluate for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. This will be a prospective study of twelve&#xD;
      patients who have undergone pancreatic resection and who have symptoms of abdominal pain,&#xD;
      steatorrhea or weight loss. We will be comparing quantitative parameters of S-MRCP (maximal&#xD;
      change in pancreatic duct diameter and volume before and after secretin administration) with&#xD;
      endoscopic pancreatic function testing (maximal bicarbonate concentration in duodenal&#xD;
      aspirate after secretin administration).&#xD;

    <description>Twelve patients will undergo S-MRCP, at a dose of 0.2 ucg/kg per exam. Secretin, provided by the Repligen Corporation, will be administered by IV bolus injection over 30 seconds followed by a 30 second saline flush. The maximum dose of secretin will be 18.5 ucg.</description>
