  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women sexual hormones (i.e. estrogen) are involved in the regulation of substrate utilization&#xD;
      and storage. Being under oral contraception (OC) may conduct to metabolic and hormonal&#xD;
      modifications, but results are confused regarding the impact on substrate utilization. In the&#xD;
      present study, the aim is then to explore the effect of hormonal status on substrate&#xD;
      utilization during sous-maximal exercise, comparing women with and without OC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesised that women under OC have a lower Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) at exercise&#xD;
      than women without contraception underlying a greater reliance on fat oxidation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      24 healthy young women (12 with OC and 12 without any contraception) will complete a maximal&#xD;
      test on an ergometer cycle to obtain their maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max).Their body&#xD;
      composition will be assessed by DXA. They will be asked to complete 3 experimental sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a first session the volunteers will remain inactive, and only a breakfast will be&#xD;
      offered. During the second session, a breakfast will be offered and they will have to&#xD;
      complete a sub-maximal exercise set at 60% of their VO2max 3 hours after breakfast. And the&#xD;
      third session will consist in the realisation of exercise on fast state. Those three sessions&#xD;
      will be realized in a randomized order. Several blood (catheter) and salivary samples will be&#xD;
      collected during the three sessions, throughout the experimental day.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Substrate utilization will be the main outcome under study.For each volunteer, it will be assessed during exercise (between 12h and 12h45) for the 2 experimental conditions with exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>during exercise (between 12h and 12h45)</time_frame>
    <description>Substrate utilization:&#xD;
The Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) that corresponds to carbon dioxide production divided by oxygen consumption (VCO2/VO2) will be used to determine the energetic substrate used during exercise. This RER will be obtained, in continuous, thanks to an indirect calorimetric system composed of a breath by breath gas analyzer. A RER closed to 0.7 illustrates lipid utilization while carbohydrate use will correspond to a RER that reached 1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The hormonal regulation involved in substrate utilization. It will be assessed during the 3 experimental conditions during all the experimental day: - Breakfast + exercise - Exercise alone - Breakfast alone</measure>
    <time_frame>before (8h, 8h45), during (12h, 12h20, 12h30, 12h45) and after exercise (13h15, 13h45; 14h45)</time_frame>
    <description>The hormonal regulations involved in the substrate utilization will be assessed thanks to blood samples collected before, during and after exercise.&#xD;
At each blood collection, the nurses will collect a EDTA tube (5ml) used to assess free fatty acid and glycerol; and 2 heparin ones (2*5ml) to assess 17β-œstradiol, progesterone, triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, glucose, insulin, growth hormone, IGF-I, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, adrenaline, noradrenaline, Atrial Natriuretic Peptide, and C-Reactive Protein.</description>
