      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of Endotrol Tube compared to&#xD;
      the conventional endotracheal tube in conjunction with the GlideRite stylet (Verathon Medical&#xD;
      Inc, USA) during videolaryngoscopy assisted endotracheal intubation using a McGrath (Aircraft&#xD;
      Medical Ltd., and distributed in the US by LMA North America, Inc.) video laryngoscope or a&#xD;
      GlideScope (Verathon Medical Inc, USA). The investigators hypothesize that using the Endotrol&#xD;
      tracheal tube, (Covidien, Colorado, USA) is safer and more efficacious than using the&#xD;
      conventional endotracheal tube during McGrath video laryngoscope and/or GlideScope aided&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that endotracheal intubation is performed on some 8 million patients per year&#xD;
      in the United States. Of these endotracheal intubations, approximately 80% are performed by&#xD;
      direct laryngoscopy with transoral placement of the endotracheal tube (ET) into the trachea.&#xD;
      There is fairly uniform reporting of the incidence of failed intubation in the literature; it&#xD;
      occurs in approximately 0.05% or 1:2230 of surgical patients and in approximately 0.13% to&#xD;
      0.35%, or 1:750 to 1:280, of the obstetric patients.1,2 The incidence of unsuspected&#xD;
      difficult intubation is estimated to be higher at 3%. One factor that contributes to&#xD;
      difficult intubation is poor visualization of the airway. Video laryngoscopes are a&#xD;
      relatively new edition to the armamentarium of airway devices available to the airway&#xD;
      manager. Although these instruments are more expensive than traditional direct laryngoscopes,&#xD;
      they offer several advantages that may justify their expense. Although some clinicians may&#xD;
      espouse the routine use of video laryngoscopy, most providers reserve it for anticipated&#xD;
      difficult situations or as &quot;plan B&quot; after failed intubation by direct laryngoscopy (DL).&#xD;
      There are several advantages of a video intubation technique as compared to direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy. The video laryngoscopes have been shown to provide superior views to&#xD;
      traditional laryngoscopy as well as in difficult intubations.3-5 Video intubation techniques,&#xD;
      by allowing tracheal intubation monitoring, have been shown to improve the safety of the&#xD;
      procedure and increase intubation success. The GlideScope consists of a digital camera,&#xD;
      called a video baton, which fits into a plastic laryngoscope blade and a light source on the&#xD;
      side to provide a video image of airway structures on a screen, which can be conveniently&#xD;
      located directly in front of the anesthesiologist. The GlideRite rigid stylet conforms to the&#xD;
      GlideScope blade angulation, which,eliminates the need to manually shape the stylet to fit&#xD;
      down the airway and improves maneuverability in endotracheal tube placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that several reports have been published describing trauma to the upper&#xD;
      airway (anterior tonsillar pillar, soft palate) during intubation with video laryngoscopes.&#xD;
      Recently, several reports using endoflex tube (which is similar to the endotrol tube) showed&#xD;
      that there is considerable usefulness in normal direct laryngoscopy and video laryngoscopy&#xD;
      (using glidescope) as well. The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of Endotrol Tube (Covidien, Colorado, USA) compared to the conventional endotracheal tube in&#xD;
      conjunction with the GlideRite stylet during videolaryngoscopy assisted endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INSTRUMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      McGrath Video Laryngoscope (MVL) - A video-based system for tracheal intubation that utilizes&#xD;
      a video camera embedded into a &quot;camera stick&quot;. The resulting video image is displayed on a&#xD;
      small color Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) attached to the top of the handle of the device,&#xD;
      which can be adjusted to obtain the best view. The unit is powered with a single&#xD;
      easily-replaced AA battery and features a single electronic control: an on/off switch located&#xD;
      on the top of the unit. The device is available with an adjustable curved MAC blade (sizes 3&#xD;
      to 5). Also,the device features a sterile disposable transparent blade sheath preventing&#xD;
      cross infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GlideScope Video Laryngoscope (GVL)- The GlideScope was commercially introduced in 2001. The&#xD;
      1- piece handle and blade is made of medical- grade plastic. It has a vertical profile of&#xD;
      14.5 mm, a midblade bend of 50-60 degrees, and a video camera with a light-emitting diode&#xD;
      housed toward the distal end of the blade. The image captured by the camera is transferred by&#xD;
      the attached cable to a color liquid crystal display (LCD). A heating element covers the&#xD;
      camera lens and ensures effective antifogging after the device has been turned on for 15- 30&#xD;
      seconds. The blades can be sterilized and reused, and are available in 3 sizes: large&#xD;
      (adult), midsize (pediatric), and small (neonatal). As the image is transferred to the LCD&#xD;
      display, anesthesiologists are able to view key anatomical landmarks at the earliest possible&#xD;
      time, facilitating navigation. Also, in cases requiring external laryngeal manipulation, the&#xD;
      assistant can see the effect of the maneuver on the monitor simultaneously with the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist for quicker, more efficient intubation. Endotrol Tracheal Tube (ETT)&#xD;
      (Covidien, Colorado, USA) - A sterile, single lumen, disposable ET with a built- in flexing&#xD;
      mechanism with a standard 15 mm connector. The tube provides directional tip control via an&#xD;
      operator- activated ring loop and incorporates a self- sealing valve with attached pilot&#xD;
      balloon. The ETT is specifically designed for use in cases where difficult intubation can be&#xD;
      aided with directional tip control. Due to the Hi-Lo cuff design, the ETT is acceptable for&#xD;
      oral/nasal intubation of the trachea for anesthesia and in cases where the intubation&#xD;
      duration is expected to be more than 24 hours or unpredictable. The special way to hold the&#xD;
      ETT is to place the thumb of the right hand against the end of the 15 mm connector and the&#xD;
      index finger in the ring loop. Pulling on the ring loop causes the tip to turn anteriorly&#xD;
      towards the tracheal opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. General Study Design- The study will include a total of 60 patients. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into 2 groups and 2 subgroups in each group, through a computer generated&#xD;
      randomization schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group A (N= 30) will be intubated using MVL and patients in group B (N= 30) will&#xD;
      be intubated using GVL. Patients in each group will be divided into 2 subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (N= 30) - Subgroup A1 (N=15) - Patients will be intubated using Endotrol Tracheal&#xD;
      Tube without stylet (Covidien, Colorado, USA). Subgroup A2 (N= 15) - Patients will be&#xD;
      intubated using styletted endotracheal tube the Gliderite (Teleflex Medical, Hudson RCI/&#xD;
      Sheridan/ HBT). Group B (N= 30) - Subgroup B1 (N=15) - Patients will be intubated using&#xD;
      Endotrol Tracheal Tube without stylet (Covidien, Colorado, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Subgroup B2 (N= 15) - Patients will be intubated using styletted endotracheal tube the&#xD;
      Gliderite (Teleflex Medical, Hudson RCI/ Sheridan/ HBT). In the operating room, standard&#xD;
      monitoring devices will be applied including a pulse oximeter, 3 lead (at least), ECG and&#xD;
      blood pressure cuff; the latter could be invasive or non-invasive depending on the nature of&#xD;
      the surgery. Baseline measures of BP, pulse, oxygen saturation, and CO2, will be made. The&#xD;
      time will be noted before any sedation or anesthesia is administered. Vital signs will be&#xD;
      recorded every minute from the time that induction of anesthesia is begun until five minutes&#xD;
      after the patient has been intubated, and then at five-minute intervals thereafter for&#xD;
      fifteen minutes. General anesthesia will be induced by bolus administration of propofol&#xD;
      (2mg/kg) and fentanyl (1mcg/kg), and maintained with an inhalational agent. Rocuronium (0.6&#xD;
      mg/kg) will be administered to provide muscle relaxation and a mixture of sevoflurane or&#xD;
      isoflurane and nitrous oxide will be utilized for maintenance of anesthesia once the ability&#xD;
      to mask ventilate is confirmed. The lungs will be mechanically ventilated with a semi-closed&#xD;
      circle system to maintain an end-tidal CO2 near 35 mmHg. Patients' lungs will be ventilated&#xD;
      via anesthesia mask 100% oxygen until the patient is completely relaxed. All investigators&#xD;
      will be trained based on manufacturer recommendations and each resident will perform at least&#xD;
      3 intubations with McGrath laryngoscope and 3 intubations with Cobalt GlideScope (total of 6&#xD;
      intubations) prior to enlisting any patients for the study. The CA-2 and CA-3 residents will&#xD;
      be performing the intubations. The external neck pressure may be applied by an assistant in&#xD;
      an attempt to improve exposure of the larynx. The ease of intubation will be recorded in&#xD;
      terms of the number of attempts (measured as either the reinsertion of the blade or&#xD;
      endotracheal tube) and the intubation time (time the laryngoscope blade enters the mouth&#xD;
      until 1st capnograph breath) will be recorded. If more than 2 attempts were needed, a third&#xD;
      attempt can be made with the device used in the other group. If still unsuccessful, the&#xD;
      direct laryngoscopy/ flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy will be performed to intubate the&#xD;
      trachea and the case will be deemed a failure. The subjective level of difficulty (from 0 =&#xD;
      Extremely Easy to 5 = Extremely Difficult) in the performance of intubation will also be&#xD;
      recorded. An alternative technique will be used in case the intubation fails. 1. Use of the&#xD;
      Glideride stylet if using an Endotrol tracheal tube, if the Endotrol tracheal tube is not&#xD;
      able to get towards the cords. 2. Use of a regular stylet instead of the Glideride especially&#xD;
      with McGrath if Glideride not able to help with intubation 3. Use of macintosh or miller&#xD;
      appropriate blade with styletted or Endotrol tube if intubation with videolaryngoscope is&#xD;
      difficult 4. Use of LMA or similar device in case intubation is difficult with any of the&#xD;
      previous devices and application of a difficult airway protocol. B. Measurements- We will&#xD;
      record morphometric characteristics of all patients. The quality of the airway will be&#xD;
      evaluated using the Mallampati and Wilson scoring system, thyromental scoring system of&#xD;
      Patil, interincisor gap distance, neck mobility and sternomental distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the anesthesiologist will provide a personal, subjective opinion of a possible&#xD;
      difficult intubation. Intubation: We will measure the time and number of attempts required&#xD;
      for successful endotracheal intubation in each group. An attempt is defined as an attempt at&#xD;
      placement of an ET through the glottic opening and into the trachea. Removal/reinsertion of&#xD;
      the laryngoscope or the switching of the laryngoscopist will constitute as a new attempt. The&#xD;
      subjective level of difficulty (0-5) in the performance of intubation will also be recorded.&#xD;
      Once an optimal positional has been confirmed, position of the ET will not be further&#xD;
      altered. Degree of irritation: Following intubation in either group, the appearance of&#xD;
      oropharynx, pharynx, epiglottis, and arytenoids will be checked. The presence of abrasions,&#xD;
      bleeding, redness, perforation or other signs of tissue or dental injury will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be adult surgical candidates age 18-80, ASA I- III, presenting for elective&#xD;
      surgery who require general anesthesia. Patients will be chosen if it is determined that&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation is required. Patients will be excluded if they are considered so&#xD;
      difficult (i.e. Mallampatti IV, &lt; 2 FB or 4 cm mouth opening), that an awake fibreoptic&#xD;
      intubation should be performed. ASA IV and V patients will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT METHODS/ INFORMED CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician investigators will interview all potential subjects to determine if subjects are&#xD;
      suitable for the study. Both English and Spanish speaking subjects will be enrolled for the&#xD;
      study. Written consent will be obtained by an anesthesiology resident or research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information recorded on the anesthetic records will be kept strictly confidential and all&#xD;
      data will be kept in a data logbook locked in the office of the principal investigator. We&#xD;
      will record patients only by study code number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be compared using two- tailed paired t- tests, repeated measures of ANOVA, or&#xD;
      Fisher Exact test, as appropriate. Results will be presented as means ± SD. P &lt; 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
