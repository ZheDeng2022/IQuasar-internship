      This study is sponsored by Genzyme Japan K.K. The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Clofarabine (JC0707) intravenously administered&#xD;
      to Japanese adult patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) at 20, 30, and 40 mg/m2/day on a 5-day dose schedule.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center study of Clofarabine administered to Japanese&#xD;
      patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who are relapsed/refractory or elderly untreated&#xD;
      AML for whom standard induction chemotherapy is unlikely to be of benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 will receive 20 mg/m2/day of Clofarabine once daily for five consecutive days,&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will receive 30 mg/m2/day, and Cohort 3 will receive 40 mg/m2/day. Patients will&#xD;
      receive one cycle as a rule. However, if there is evidence of some hematologic response after&#xD;
      one cycle of treatment with Clofarabine, patients may receive up to a maximum of three&#xD;
      cycles. If patients fail to achieve CR or CRp after two cycles of treatment with Clofarabine,&#xD;
      further dosing for such patients should be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three patients constituting a cohort will receive Clofarabine and will then be assessed for&#xD;
      dose limiting toxicities (DLT) at Cycle 1. If none of these three patients develops DLT, the&#xD;
      next cohort will be introduced. If one of them develops DLT, three new patients will be added&#xD;
      to the cohort, so that six patients in total are included in the tolerability assessment. In&#xD;
      this case, treatment of the next cohort is allowed only in the case the number of patients&#xD;
      who develop DLT is still one in this six-patient cohort. If two of the six patients develop&#xD;
      DLT, however, the tolerability is ruled out. However, if two DLTs are observed at the&#xD;
      20mg/m2/day dose cohort, new patients will be enrolled at cohort -1 15mg/m2/day; and if no&#xD;
      more than one of six patients in the cohort develop DLT, it will be considered as the last&#xD;
      cohort for this study.&#xD;
