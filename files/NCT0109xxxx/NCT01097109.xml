    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine if somatic dysfunctions of the pelvis, sacrum and lower lumbar&#xD;
      spine have an effect on weight bearing. Our subjects are young, healthy subjects without&#xD;
      recent soft tissue or osseous injury, a less than predetermined leg length discrepancy or&#xD;
      OMM/chiropractic treatment. Their leg lengths will be measured; weight-bearing will be&#xD;
      measured using a specialized scale and somatic dysfunctions diagnosed to determine if any&#xD;
      correlation exists.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Most sources claim that in individuals with leg length discrepancies, they tend to place more&#xD;
      weight through the shorter lower extremity.1,2 Few cases state that the opposite is true.3&#xD;
      Many health care practitioners diagnose leg length discrepancies. Osteopathic physicians who&#xD;
      practice with Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM) will also diagnose leg length&#xD;
      discrepancies. They use testing to evaluate whether a leg length discrepancy is structural or&#xD;
      functional. A structural leg length discrepancy is associated with shortening of bony&#xD;
      structures.4 The structures affected can be due to congenital defects, which result in&#xD;
      possible structural shortening of the tibia or femur, slipped capital femoral epiphyses&#xD;
      (SCFE), or congenital dislocation. Other causes of structural leg length discrepancies&#xD;
      include post total hip replacement, infections, tumors, paralysis, and trauma, including&#xD;
      fractures where the gross length of a limb is altered.4 A structural leg length discrepancy&#xD;
      can be most accurately assessed by physically measuring the distance between the anterior&#xD;
      superior iliac spine (ASIS) and medial malleolus.4 The most reliable method of diagnosing a&#xD;
      structural short leg is through full body radiographs. 6 A functional leg length discrepancy&#xD;
      is a result of altered mechanics of the lower extremities. It is thought that a functional&#xD;
      short leg occurs secondarily to a rotated pelvis caused by joint contractures and/or axial&#xD;
      misalignments, including scoliosis.4 In osteopathic literature; functional leg length&#xD;
      discrepancies are also thought to be the result of altered positions of the pelvis and&#xD;
      sacrum. It is also thought in osteopathic philosophy that the position of the fifth lumbar&#xD;
      vertebra affects the position of the sacrum. Therefore dysfunction of L5 will change the&#xD;
      position of the sacrum such that a functional short leg is created.2(p.780-782) A common&#xD;
      cause of functional leg length discrepancies diagnosed by osteopathic physicians is that of&#xD;
      sacral base unleveling.5 The way in which a leg length discrepancy causes unleveling of the&#xD;
      sacrum is through the femoral head of the longer leg driving the pelvis into a posterior&#xD;
      rotation via forces placed through acetabular contact. Then the pelvis will typically rotate&#xD;
      forward in attempts to lengthen the shorter leg, causing the sacral base to become unlevel.5&#xD;
      In addition, the sacral base tilts toward the side of the short leg.6 Standing postural&#xD;
      x-rays, which outline sacral declination, are often used by chiropractors and osteopathic&#xD;
      physicians to diagnose functional leg length discrepancies.6 Another way that functional leg&#xD;
      length discrepancies are confirmed is through the supine to long sitting test, which tests&#xD;
      for the presence of innominate rotations that may affect leg length as the cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no research known to support the presence of somatic dysfunctions, leg length&#xD;
      discrepancies and altered weight bearing through lower extremities secondary to this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is common practice among osteopathic physicians who utilize OMM to diagnose&#xD;
      musculoskeletal somatic dysfunctions of the pelvis, sacrum and lumbar spine. All these&#xD;
      findings can contribute to low back pain. Therefore, it is the common practice of these&#xD;
      physicians to diagnose leg length discrepancies, as it may ultimately result in low back&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatic dysfunction in osteopathic nomenclature is defined as 'impaired or altered function&#xD;
      of related components of the somatic (body framework) system: Skeletal, arthrodial and&#xD;
      Myofascial structures, and related vascular, lymphatic and neural elements'.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are specific somatic dysfunctions that lead to leg length differences. These effects&#xD;
      include the sacral base tilting toward the side of the short leg, a low iliac crest on the&#xD;
      short leg side, a forward rotation of the innominate on the shorter side and/or a posterior&#xD;
      rotation of the innominate on the side of the longer leg as a compensatory measure. The&#xD;
      lumbar spine will develop a convexity toward the side of the short leg.6 Their definitions&#xD;
      are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anteriorly rotated innominate: Entire innominate appears to be rotated anterior in relation&#xD;
      to the opposite innominate. The ASIS will be more inferior or caudad and PSIS will be more&#xD;
      superior or cephalad.2(776-778), 6 Posteriorly rotated innominate: Entire innominate appears&#xD;
      to be rotated posterior in relation to the opposite hip bone. The ASIS will be more superior&#xD;
      or cephalad and the PSIS more inferior or caudad.2(776-778), 6 Superior shear of the&#xD;
      innominate: ASIS, PSIS and pubic ramus is more superior or cephalad than the opposite&#xD;
      side.2(776-778), 6 Inferior shear of the innominate: ASIS, PSIS and pubic ramus is more&#xD;
      inferior or caudad than the opposite side.2(776-778), 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      The way that osteopathic physicians determine the side of the somatic dysfunction is through&#xD;
      the ASIS compression test. This is defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASIS compression test: Test for lateralization of somatic dysfunction of the sacrum,&#xD;
      innominate or pubic symphysis. A posterior compression normally produces a palpatory sense of&#xD;
      'give' or 'resilience' as the innominate glides slightly posterior at the sacroiliac joint on&#xD;
      that side. Somatic dysfunction of the pelvis on the side of compression produces resistance&#xD;
      to the test determining the side of lateralization which is analogous to the determining the&#xD;
      dysfunctional side. This is interpreted as a positive ASIS compression test.2(777)&#xD;
      Individuals who have suffered from any type of osseous or soft tissue traumatic injuries in&#xD;
      the last three months do not make suitable subjects for an evaluation of somatic&#xD;
      dysfunctions' effects on weight bearing. Neither do individuals who have suffered from any&#xD;
      type of osseous or soft tissue injuries in the lower extremity joints (knee, ankle, hip) in&#xD;
      the last twelve months. As stated earlier, leg length discrepancies may be a result of&#xD;
      trauma. Individuals who have suffered traumatic injuries within the last three months may&#xD;
      exhibit antalgic or compensatory postures which may displace weight bearing more through one&#xD;
      lower extremity than the other.7 This will ensure that the treatment population will be as&#xD;
      homogenous as possible and will improve reliability of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who have suffered lower extremity injuries in the last twelve months may also&#xD;
      exhibit altered weight bearing distribution through the lower extremities. This may be&#xD;
      something, depending on the chronicity of the problem, which alters weight bearing for an&#xD;
      extended period of time which may vary depending on the person.7 Therefore, excluding&#xD;
      individuals who have suffered lower extremity trauma in the last twelve months will also be&#xD;
      excluded from the study to allow for more homogenous characteristics of our sample&#xD;
      population. The time constraints of three and twelve months respectively were deemed as the&#xD;
      exclusion times purely from anecdotal and clinical experience with lower extremity injury&#xD;
      from the principal investigator and his colleagues.&#xD;
