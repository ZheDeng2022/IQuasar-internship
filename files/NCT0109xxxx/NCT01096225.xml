      The primary immunogenicity objective is to assess the antibody response and T-cell response&#xD;
      of split-virion inactivated A (H1N1) vaccine. Participants will include up to 20 healthy&#xD;
      persons of age 20 and older who have no history of novel influenza H1N1 2009 infection in&#xD;
      latest 3 months or novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination. This is a randomized study in&#xD;
      healthy males and non-pregnant females, aged 20 years and older. All subjects will be&#xD;
      stratified into 1 dose group (15mcg per dose), and will receive intramuscular influenza H1N1&#xD;
      vaccine. The H1N1 vaccine will be administered at Day 0 and Day 21. On Day 0, Day 10, Day 21,&#xD;
      Day 28, Day 35 and Day 42 after first vaccination (Day 0), the immunogenicity testing will be&#xD;
      manipulated. The antibody response of immunogenicity testing will be hemagglutination&#xD;
      inhibiting (HAI) on serum. The T-cell response will be interferon-gamma ELISPOT assay and&#xD;
      Tetramer staining using PBMCs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2009, a novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus was identified as a significant cause of&#xD;
      febrile respiratory illnesses in North America. It rapidly spread to many countries around&#xD;
      the world, which soon meets the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for a pandemic. Data&#xD;
      from several clinical trails with the split-virion inactivated S-OIV vaccine suggest that the&#xD;
      vaccine stimulated strong specific antibody against S-OIV. However, the is no T-cell response&#xD;
      data after the vaccination. In addition, we do not know S-OIV specific cellular immunity&#xD;
      level of the population. These facts indicate the need to assess both the antibody response&#xD;
      and T-cell response after the vaccination of the split-virion inactivated S-OIV vaccine. The&#xD;
      primary immunogenicity objective is to assess the antibody response and T-cell response of&#xD;
      split-virion inactivated A (H1N1) vaccine. Participants will contain only one age group,&#xD;
      including up to 20 healthy persons of age 20 and older who have no history of novel influenza&#xD;
      H1N1 2009 infection in latest 3 months or novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination. This is a&#xD;
      randomized study in healthy males and non-pregnant females. All subjects will be stratified&#xD;
      into 1 dose group (15mcg per dose), and will receive intramuscular influenza H1N1 vaccine.&#xD;
      The H1N1 vaccine will be administered at Day 0 and Day 21. On Day 0, Day 10, Day 21, Day 28,&#xD;
      Day 35 and Day 42 after first vaccination (Day 0), the immunogenicity testing will be&#xD;
      manipulated. The antibody response of immunogenicity testing will be hemagglutination&#xD;
      inhibiting (HAI) on serum. The T-cell response will be interferon-gamma ELISPOT assay and&#xD;
      Tetramer staining using PBMCs.&#xD;
