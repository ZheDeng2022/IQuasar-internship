      This is a research study to see if a new drug called bortezomib is useful to treat multiple&#xD;
      myeloma in people who are newly diagnosed, and have not yet received treatment for their&#xD;
      disease. VELCADE® (bortezomib) for Injection is a drug under development by Millennium&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site study which will enroll up to 50 patients with multiple myeloma&#xD;
      who have not had prior treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to starting treatment individuals will be evaluated to determine if they are eligible&#xD;
      to participate in the study. There are certain prestudy test that are required: physical&#xD;
      exam, blood tests, ECG, chest x-ray, skeletal survey, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to&#xD;
      confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma and to determine baseline health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning each treatment cycle and at the end of the study, patients will have protein&#xD;
      studies (including blood and urine) to see if they are responding to the treatment. Before&#xD;
      each weekly treatment cycle patients will also have blood tests for red and white blood cells&#xD;
      and platelets, and blood chemistry tests for electrolytes, kidney and liver function, calcium&#xD;
      and blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may receive up to 6 cycles of treatment. At the end of the study, individuals who&#xD;
      have responded to treatment will be seen every two months to check for disease progression.&#xD;

    <description>Bortezomib is administered at a dose of 1.6mg/m2 IV push over 3 to 5 seconds. Treatment is administered once a week for four weeks followed by one week off. This 5 week period is considered a treatment cycle. Dexamethasone is also administered at a dose of 40mg daily on day of and day after each dose of Bortezomib, with a dose reduction to 20mg on the same schedule if the patient cannot tolerate the higher dose of dexamethasone. The study duration for a given subject will be approximately 30 weeks.</description>
