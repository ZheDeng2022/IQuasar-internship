      The purpose of this study is to compare two continuous glucose sensors, one placed&#xD;
      subcutaneous (under the skin) and one placed intradermal (in the skin) over 12-14 hours.&#xD;

      This was a single site, non-randomized study. The study consisted of a screening visit (Visit&#xD;
      1), during which the subject was consented and the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      confirmed, an experimental intervention (Visit 2) and a follow-up visit (Visit 3). The&#xD;
      experimental intervention was based on an initial glucose clamp involving a basal intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) insulin infusion and IV insulin boluses plus IV glucose infusion / IV glucose boluses as&#xD;
      required to maintain euglycemic, hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic plateaus respectively in 41&#xD;
      subjects with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes. At the end of hour five of the study the glucose&#xD;
      clamp was discontinued and subjects given a standardized meal to stimulate a hyperglycemic&#xD;
      excursion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject participated in one experimental intervention. During the glucose clamp&#xD;
      intervention, the subject's blood glucose was continuously monitored either by means of the&#xD;
      Biostator or by frequent venous blood glucose measurements based on a standard lab method&#xD;
      (YSI STAT2300 analyzer), and measured by means of the BD Technologies test devices, and the&#xD;
      Medtronic Guardian CGM. Once the clamp was discontinued the Biostator was discontinued as&#xD;
      well. During the unclamped period and meal the subjects BG was monitored via the YSI Glucose&#xD;
      Analyzer, the BD CGM sensor and the Medtronic Guardian CGM.&#xD;
