      RATIONALE: Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above&#xD;
      normal body temperature. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitomycin C and epirubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Biological therapies, such as bacillus&#xD;
      calmette-guerin (BCG) and interferon alfa, may stimulate the immune system in different ways&#xD;
      and stop tumor cells from growing. It is not yet known whether giving hyperthermia together&#xD;
      with mitomycin C is more effective than giving BCG or standard therapy as second-line therapy&#xD;
      in treating patients with recurrent bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well hyperthermia given together&#xD;
      with mitomycin C works compared with BCG or standard therapy as second-line therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with recurrent bladder cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether hyperthermia in combination with mitomycin C versus bacillus&#xD;
           Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or standard therapy as second-line therapy is effective in&#xD;
           patients with recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer following induction or&#xD;
           maintenance therapy with BCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare disease-free survival time in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare complete response rate at 3 months in patients with carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
           treatments, quality of life, cost, and cost-effectiveness in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess biomarkers of response to standard and investigational treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presence of&#xD;
      carcinoma in situ (yes vs no), prior bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy (induction vs&#xD;
      maintenance), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (experimental): Patients receive intravesical mitomycin C over two 30-minute&#xD;
           instillations per session, and bladder hyperthermia (42 +/-2°C) is delivered in&#xD;
           combination with each instillation. The suspension is maintained in the bladder for up&#xD;
           to 2 hours. Treatment repeats once a week for 6 weeks followed by a 6-week rest period.&#xD;
           Patients who are disease-free proceed to maintenance therapy consisting of one&#xD;
           instillation of mitomycin C with bladder hyperthermia every 6 weeks for 1 year and then&#xD;
           once every 8 weeks for 1 year. Patients who are disease-free at 24 months may continue&#xD;
           treatment at the discretion of the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (control): Patients receive 1 of the following treatment regimens depending on&#xD;
           prior BCG treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Second course of BCG therapy (patients who failed previous induction BCG): Patients&#xD;
                receive intravesical BCG (1 instillation) once a week for 6 weeks. The suspension&#xD;
                is maintained in the bladder for up to 2 hours. Patients then receive maintenance&#xD;
                therapy consisting of BCG once a week for 3 weeks in months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24.&#xD;
                Patients who are disease-free at 24 months may continue treatment at the discretion&#xD;
                of the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Standard therapy (patients who failed previous maintenance BCG): Patients receive&#xD;
                standard therapy for BCG failure as defined by their treating centers. Standard&#xD;
                therapy may include intravesical BCG alone, intravesical mitomycin C alone,&#xD;
                intravesical epirubicin hydrochloride alone, or intravesical BCG in combination&#xD;
                with interferon alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergo cystoscopic surveillance with or without a biopsy every 3 months for 2&#xD;
      years. Urine, blood, and tissue samples are collected periodically for biomarker laboratory&#xD;
      studies. Patients complete quality of life questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-BLS24, QLQ-C30, and&#xD;
      EQ5D) at baseline, at 12 weeks, and at 6, 9, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then&#xD;
      every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
