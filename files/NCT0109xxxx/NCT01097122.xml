      This study hypothesize that radius subjecting to mechanical loading may affect excitability&#xD;
      of alpha motor neuron innervating muscle, based on its bone mineral density or bone mineral&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 voluntaries are planned to include in this study. Vibration will be applied the&#xD;
      right forearm. Muscle electrical activity will be measured on ipsilateral and contralateral&#xD;
      flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle at rest as EMGrms by surface electromyography (EMG). The&#xD;
      rest-EMGrms will be measured at before and during vibration. An increase in muscle electrical&#xD;
      activity at rest indicates an increase in motor neuron pool activation. The right distal&#xD;
      radius bone mineral content (BMC) and density will be measured by dual energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The right radius bone mineral density (BMD) and BMC will be evaluated by bone densitometer&#xD;
      (GE-LUNAR DPX PRO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor unit potentials will be measured by electromyography at left flexor carpi radialis.&#xD;
      Neurotrac ETS device will be used.&#xD;

      A functional cooperation exists between bones and skeletal muscles. Bones work together with&#xD;
      muscles as a simple mechanical lever system to produce body movement. One of the important&#xD;
      functions of bones is to exert resistance against gravity in order to carry the body. In&#xD;
      order to carry out their mechanical functions, bones need to have considerable resistance to&#xD;
      deformation under load. It is well-known that muscle activity (i.e., exercises) improves the&#xD;
      resistance of bone to mechanical loading, and that it is also important for treating and&#xD;
      preventing osteoporosis. Resistance and impact training have been shown to induce bone&#xD;
      formation and/or prevent bone resorption. Skeletal muscles have positive effects on bone&#xD;
      structure and function. Can bones have an effect on muscle activity? There is only one study&#xD;
      about the effect of bones on muscles. In this study, it was shown that bones may affect&#xD;
      muscle strength gain in healthy young adult males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibration has a strong osteogenic effect. Vibration-induced bone formation is neuronally&#xD;
      regulated. Vibration can also effectively enhance muscle strength and power. Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that vibration increases muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity. But, it has not&#xD;
      been reported whether bone has an effect on the increase in muscle EMG activity caused by&#xD;
      vibration or not. The aim of this study was to determine whether radius bone exposed to&#xD;
      cyclic mechanical loading affects muscle electrical activity of contralateral untrained m.&#xD;
      flexor carpi radialis in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
