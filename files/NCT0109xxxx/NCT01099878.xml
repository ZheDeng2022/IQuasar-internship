      The aim of this study is to determine whether a short-term of FES assisted cycling in stroke&#xD;
      patients can reduce the muscle tone of the affected leg immediately and the influence the&#xD;
      postural control of the subjects.&#xD;

      Patients with stroke frequently results in secondary complications of the neuromuscular&#xD;
      system. For post-stroke patients, varying deficits in sensation, muscle strength, muscle tone&#xD;
      and associated reaction in the paretic limbs often affect the activities of daily living.&#xD;
      Cycling exercise is commonly suggested to improve cardiovascular fitness and functional&#xD;
      mobility in patients with stroke. (Janssen, 2008; Holt, 2001; Potempa 1995) Cycling exercise&#xD;
      requires less balance capacity and exercise intensity can be controlled. The kinematic&#xD;
      patterns of cycling are very similar to that of walking that is one of the most important&#xD;
      motor functions to recover in a stroke patient (Ferrante, 2008). Others studies have reported&#xD;
      that repetitive passive movement of spastic muscle can increase range motion and reduce&#xD;
      stiffness of hypertonic joints in stroke patients (Bressel, 2002; Yeh, 2007). Above studies&#xD;
      (Bressel, 2002; Yeh, 2007) suggest leg cyclic movement may be a possible therapeutic modality&#xD;
      to reduce hypertonia that is one of the factors disturbed the functional activities for&#xD;
      stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of functional electrical stimulation (FES) is usually used in physical&#xD;
      therapy to assist the paretic limb to perform functional tasks (5-7). The previous studies&#xD;
      reported the functional tasks of hemiplegic hands are improved after electrical stimulation&#xD;
      treatment (Wu, 2006; Santos, 2006). FES has also been used to improve the walking ability of&#xD;
      subjects with stroke (Bogataj, 1989; Yan, 2005; Salm, 2006). Clinical studies on central&#xD;
      motor neuroplasticity also support the role of goal-oriented, repetitive, active movement in&#xD;
      the therapy of paretic limbs to enhance motor recovery and relearning in stroke patients.&#xD;
      (Ferrante, 2008) In the first half of the 1980s, FES was applied during cycling exercise on&#xD;
      the paretic legs of people with spinal cord injury (SCI). The beneficial effects of cycling&#xD;
      exercise via FES have evidenced increases in muscle strength and endurance, increases in bone&#xD;
      density, suppression of spasticity, improvement of cardiopulmonary function, and many other&#xD;
      physiological and psychological effects of benefit for SCI patients (Donaldson et al., 2000;&#xD;
      Gfohler and Lugner, 2000; Gfohler et al., 2001). Recently, similar FES assisted cycling&#xD;
      devices have also been used for stroke patients (Janssen, 2008; Ferrante, 2008). They&#xD;
      reported that FES assisted training provided increased aerobic capacity and functional&#xD;
      performance for them. However, in one study (Janssen, 2008) the functional performance was&#xD;
      evaluated by clinical scales which do not reflect the changes on the affected limb influenced&#xD;
      by the training exercise. It is worthwhile to realize the effects on the affected leg and the&#xD;
      changes on postural control after the FES-cycling training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new FES-cycling device (Figure.1), modified from our previous prototype (Chen, 2004), was&#xD;
      used in this study. This device combines FES with a cycling system equipped with ankle-foot&#xD;
      orthoses. The FES stimulates the quadriceps and hamstring when the affected leg sweeps past a&#xD;
      specific angle. The aims of this study were to determine whether a short-term of FES-cycling&#xD;
      program in stroke patients can reduce the muscle tone of the affected leg immediately and&#xD;
      influence the postural control of the subjects.&#xD;
