  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of pessary therapy, with and without Solifenacin&#xD;
      (Vesicare), on symptoms of over active bladder and bladder function in women with overactive&#xD;
      bladder symptoms and pelvic organ prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis, HO: Reduction of anterior vaginal wall prolapse and treatment with&#xD;
      solifenacin does not improve overactive bladder symptoms more than reduction of anterior&#xD;
      vaginal wall prolapse and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate hypothesis, HA: Reduction of anterior vaginal wall prolapse and treatment with&#xD;
      solifenacin does improve overactive bladder symptoms more than reduction of anterior vaginal&#xD;
      wall prolapse and placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) affects approximately half of all women over age 501. The most&#xD;
      common type of POP is anterior vaginal wall prolapse. Symptoms associated with POP include:&#xD;
      voiding dysfunction, defecatory dysfunction and vaginal bulge symptoms. Treatments for pelvic&#xD;
      organ prolapse include among other options, vaginal pessary or surgery. Several studies have&#xD;
      documented improved vaginal bulge symptoms in women treated with a pessary2,3,4; however,&#xD;
      data are sparse regarding the effect of pessaries on lower urinary tract symptoms,&#xD;
      specifically with regard to over active bladder symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overactive bladder, observed in approximately 40% of women 50 years of age or older, is very&#xD;
      common in women with pelvic organ prolapse. Two retrospective studies have shown improvement&#xD;
      in women with overactive bladder symptoms following treatment with a vaginal pessary. One&#xD;
      study (using a non-validated questionnaire) found that, at two month follow-up, patients&#xD;
      successfully fitted with a pessary experienced a reduction in slightly less than half of&#xD;
      their urge incontinence symptoms.5 A second study (using the Sheffield pelvic organ prolapse&#xD;
      symptom questionnaire), revealed that 4 months after insertion of a pessary, 38% of patients&#xD;
      experienced reduced urinary urgency, and 29% experienced reduced urge urinary incontinence6.&#xD;
      Despite these data, many women stop using a pessary secondary to complaints of increased&#xD;
      urine incontinence. More information is needed on pessary therapy impact on bladder function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will prospectively evaluate women with pelvic organ prolapse and overactive&#xD;
      bladder symptoms treated with either&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a pessary and solifenacin, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a pessary and placebo. We will assess the effects of these therapies on overactive&#xD;
           bladder symptoms over the course of the 14-week study.&#xD;

    <description>Using the PFDI and PFIQ and a standardized medication response questionnaire to assess each subject's response to either the placebo or the solinefacin at Week 6 and Week 14, we will evaluate the effect of these therapies on subjects' bladder symptoms over the course of the study.</description>

    <description>There will be a two-week pessary run-in prior to randomization. If the subject completes the run-in period with no adverse reactions to the pessary, she will come in to the office for a randomization visit. She will be randomized to receive either 5 mg/day (one 5 mg tablet QD) of placebo or 5 mg/day (QD) of solifenacin for 12 weeks. At the end of week 6, patients will be assessed in the office. A standardized medication response questionnaire will be used to assess each subject's response to either the placebo or the solifenacin 5 mg. If the response is not adequate, the dose will be increased. Women whose symptoms have not improved since baseline will have their medication or placebo doses increased to 10 mg daily.</description>
