    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) (either at&#xD;
             initial diagnosis or at recurrence).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NPC associated with EBV infection, determined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NPC occurred in association with a raised serum titre of IgA to EBV viral capsid&#xD;
                  antigen (VCA) in a patient living in an area of high incidence of EBV+&#xD;
                  undifferentiated NPC, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The presence of EBV has been confirmed in the tumour by immunohistochemistry for&#xD;
                  EBV antigens or in situ hybridization for EBV early RNA (EBER), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NPC with persistent or recurrent disease occurs in the context of an elevated&#xD;
                  circulating EBV genome level&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic NPC that have residual EBV DNA&#xD;
             following completion of conventional therapy (chemotherapy or radiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with residual masses at the site(s) of previous disease that are not&#xD;
                  progressing and for whom no standard therapy is currently appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with residual or recurrent disease that is low volume, that is causing&#xD;
                  minimal or no symptoms and for whom no standard therapy is currently appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease must be not amenable to potentially curative radiotherapy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completion of standard therapy for malignancy at least 4 weeks before trial entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent and the ability of the patient to co-operate with treatment&#xD;
             and follow up must be ensured and documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential are eligible, provided they have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test prior to enrolment and agree to use appropriate medically approved&#xD;
             contraception during the study up to six months after the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients must agree to use appropriate medically approved contraception during&#xD;
             the study up to six months after the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or major surgery received within 4 weeks of trial entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known chronic active infection with Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or Human Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current active skin diseases requiring therapy (psoriasis, eczema etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of anaphylaxis or severe allergy to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to eggs or egg products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous myeloablative therapy followed by an autologous or allogeneic haematopoietic&#xD;
             stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had a splenectomy or splenic irradiation, or with known splenic&#xD;
             dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving current immunosuppressive medication, including corticosteroids (inhaled&#xD;
             steroids are acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatment. Exceptions to this are alopecia or&#xD;
             certain Grade 1 toxicities which in the opinion of the Investigator should not exclude&#xD;
             the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make&#xD;
             the patient a good candidate for the clinical trial.&#xD;
