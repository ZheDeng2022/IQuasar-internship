  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with both hypertension and diabetes have a higher chance of developing heart and&#xD;
      arterial problems that could be reduced with anti-coagulant therapy. Valsartan (Diovan), an&#xD;
      FDA approved angiotensin-II receptor antagonist (blocker) clinically indicated for the&#xD;
      treatment of essential hypertension is known to inhibit platelet activity in both an in vitro&#xD;
      and ex vivo setting. Aliskiren (Tekturna) is a recently FDA-approved potent direct renin&#xD;
      inhibitor which is also an effective anti-hypertensive agent in patients with&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate hypertension and which, in vitro, modulates antithrombin III in plasma.&#xD;
      Therefore, in addition to being clinically approved anti-hypertensive medications, combining&#xD;
      these two agents will potentially target both primary hemostasis (platelets) and&#xD;
      anticoagulant (antithrombin-III is a cornerstone substrate for heparin) properties to exert&#xD;
      their anti-thrombotic efficacy simultaneously. This combination strategy may not only improve&#xD;
      hypertension management, but also improve vascular outcomes in high-risk diabetic population&#xD;
      via favorable effects on anti-thrombotic activity. Importantly, there have been no&#xD;
      significant additional safety concerns of using the combination of aliskiren and valsartan.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that valsartan 160 mg/daily in combination with aliskiren&#xD;
      150-300 mg/daily for 4 weeks will favorably affect blood levels of&#xD;
      platelet/coagulation/fibrinolytic biomarkers (ie, diminish platelet activity, and enhance&#xD;
      antithrombin III potency) when compared with monotherapy with aliskiren 150mg/daily in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 objectives in the index study. • The primary objective is to determine how&#xD;
      therapy with valsartan (160mg/daily) in combination with aliskiren (150-300mg/daily) over&#xD;
      four weeks affects platelet/coagulation/fibrinolytic biomarkers in recently diagnosed&#xD;
      hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, this is an exploratory study,&#xD;
      our current knowledge is based on in vitro and ex vivo evidence for valsartan, but only on in&#xD;
      vitro aliskiren data. There are no data on antithrombotic biomarkers currently available for&#xD;
      the combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To define whether combination therapy is superior over monotherapy with aliskiren with&#xD;
      regard to the improvement of hemostatic biomarkers (platelet aggregation, expression of GP&#xD;
      IIb/IIIa, and plasma levels of antithrombin-III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized 1:1, two arm, single-blind, single-site, parallel group, post-marketing&#xD;
      comparison study of the effects on antithrombotic biomarkers of aliskiren 150-300mg/day alone&#xD;
      vs combined treatment with aliskiren 150-300mg/day plus valsartan 160mg/day over a four week&#xD;
      primary treatment period. An optional four week extension phase may be offered pending&#xD;
      assessment of the antithrombotic biomarker assays at week four.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups (25 patients each), for a total of 50, recently diagnosed hypertensive patients&#xD;
      with previously diagnosed mild to moderate type 2 diabetes will constitute the proposed study&#xD;
      population. The diagnosis of diabetes will be made based on the American Diabetes Association&#xD;
      criteria, such as random plasma glucose &gt;200 mg/dL with or without symptoms of hyperglycemia&#xD;
      (polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia) and weight loss, or fasting plasma glucose &gt; 126 mg/dL, to&#xD;
      be determined at least twice. Patients will qualify if they are insulin-free, treated with an&#xD;
      oral antiglycemic agent,(metformin only) and/or managed on diet alone for no less than 30&#xD;
      days and have adequate glucose control at the time of their Screening Visit.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. The diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus will have been determined by the following&#xD;
             Criteria, as characterized by recurrent or persistent hyperglycemia, and diagnosed by&#xD;
             demonstrating any one of the following.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fasting plasma glucose level at or above 126 mg/dL but less than 250 mg/dL on&#xD;
                  more than one determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Plasma glucose at or above 200 mg/dL two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load as&#xD;
                  in a glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Symptoms of hyperglycemia and casual plasma glucose at or above 200 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1C) at or above 6.5 but below 8.5%. (This&#xD;
                  criterion was recommended by the American Diabetes Association in 2010).&#xD;

          2. Adults between 21 - 65 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have been diagnosed with Type 2 DM according to the criteria listed above, and treated&#xD;
