    <textblock>
      Prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) is most commonly defined as rupture of membranes before&#xD;
      the onset of labor and occurs in 8% of term pregnancies. A prolonged interval from rupture of&#xD;
      membranes to delivery is associated with an increase in the incidence of chorioamnionitis and&#xD;
      neonatal sepsis. The management of the term patients with PROM, especially those with an&#xD;
      unfavorable cervix, remains controversial. Management options to choose from are immediate&#xD;
      induction of labor versus delayed induction or expectant management. Several reports have&#xD;
      detailed an increase in maternal and neonatal morbidity with expectant management, whereas&#xD;
      active management leads to a shorter interval from PROM to delivery, reducing the risk of&#xD;
      postnatal infections. In addition, active management is preferred by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators know that, neonatal intensive care admission, variable decelerations, and&#xD;
      primary cesarean delivery rates are positively correlated with a longer&#xD;
      admission-to-labor-onset interval in women with PROM . So, to reduce the induction to&#xD;
      delivery times, concurrent oxytocin infusion with dinoprostone vaginal pessary use for labor&#xD;
      induction in women with PROM may be beneficial. Several studies have shown shorter&#xD;
      induction-to-delivery interval with concurrent oxytocin infusion with prostaglandin agent at&#xD;
      initiation of labor . However, in these studies, there is a a paucity information in PROM&#xD;
      labor induction. Only one randomized control trial have compared the efficacy of concurrent&#xD;
      dinoprostone and oxytocin and oxytocin alone in women with term PROM . This study indicated&#xD;
      that concurrent vaginal dinoprostone and intravenous oxytocin conferred no advantage over&#xD;
      intravenous oxytocin alone for the outcomes of interest, including length of labor patient&#xD;
      satisfaction or risk for cesarean delivery. Unfortunately, this study was limited by small&#xD;
      sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this randomized study was to compare two protocols (oxytocin vs.&#xD;
      sustained-release dinoprostone followed six hours later by oxytocin) for induction of labour&#xD;
      in women with PROM at term and an unfavorable cervix.&#xD;
