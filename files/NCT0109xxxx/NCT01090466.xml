      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin&#xD;
      together with temsirolimus may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temsirolimus&#xD;
      given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin as first-line therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic transitional cell cancer of the urothelium.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine a safety profile of temsirolimus in combination with cisplatin and&#xD;
           gemcitabine hydrochloride, including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and&#xD;
           maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic&#xD;
           transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium. (phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the recommended dose for the Phase II stage of the trial and subsequent&#xD;
           studies. (phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess progression-free survival (PFS) at six months from date of enrollment. (phase&#xD;
           II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of temsirolimus in combination with cisplatin&#xD;
           and gemcitabine hydrochloride. (phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine tolerability (side-effects) and feasibility (number of participants&#xD;
           requiring dose delays or reduction and/or treatment withdrawal). (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine objective response rate as assessed by RECIST. (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess PFS of these patients. (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess overall survival of these patients. (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine toxicity during and after treatment in these patients. (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of temsirolimus followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, cisplatin IV&#xD;
      over 3-4 hours on day 1, and temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1 or 2, 8 or 9, and 15.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood specimens may be collected periodically for pharmacokinetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 months and 1 year.&#xD;
