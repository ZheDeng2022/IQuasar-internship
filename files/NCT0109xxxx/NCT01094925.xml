  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gabapentin has been very effective at treating pain after knee and hip operations,&#xD;
      hysterectomies, and many other types of operations. A previous study at the investigators'&#xD;
      hospital found that a single pre-operative dose of 600mg gabapentin produced a significant&#xD;
      reduction in pain after caesarean section. However, 19% complained of sedation. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to see whether a reduced dose of gabapentin will produce a similar&#xD;
      improvement in pain scores while avoiding adverse effects such as sedation or dizziness. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of a single pre-operative oral dose of&#xD;
      gabapentin 300mg, versus 600mg and placebo in women undergoing Cesarean section. The&#xD;
      investigators' hypothesis is that gabapentin 300mg will result in decreased pain scores&#xD;
      similar to gabapentin 600mg, but with reduced side effects.&#xD;

      Post-operative pain is the greatest fear of women who undergo Cesarean section, and despite&#xD;
      current analgesic regimens, this pain can be severe, impeding the mother's recovery and her&#xD;
      ability to bond with and breastfeed her new infant. Opioids are the mainstay of treatment&#xD;
      currently, and, although effective, these drugs have significant adverse effects, including&#xD;
      sedation, nausea, vomiting and constipation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
      can reduce opioid consumption, but also have side effects, and are contra-indicated in a&#xD;
      significant number of patients. Therefore there remains considerable scope to improve&#xD;
      post-Cesarean analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that severe acute post-operative pain after Cesarean section increases the&#xD;
      risk of developing chronic pain and post-partum depression. A recent study showed that up to&#xD;
      18% of women have persistent pain after Cesarean section, and that severe acute&#xD;
      post-operative pain is a significant risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gabapentin is used widely to treat chronic pain, and has been demonstrated to be effective at&#xD;
      treating acute post-operative pain following a variety of surgical procedures, with&#xD;
      significant reductions in opioid consumption. Side effects are uncommon; the most likely are&#xD;
      dizziness and sedation. Gabapentin does cross the placenta and into breast milk, but there is&#xD;
      no evidence of adverse maternal or neonatal effects in women taking gabapentin during&#xD;
      pregnancy. Gabapentin has been used successfully to treat pain in neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study at Mount Sinai Hospital compared a single pre-operative dose of 600mg&#xD;
      gabapentin versus placebo in women undergoing Cesarean section. Women in the gabapentin group&#xD;
      reported significantly improved pain scores on movement up to 48 hours after surgery. Side&#xD;
      effects were similar in both groups apart from an increase in somnolence in the gabapentin&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of a single pre-operative oral dose of&#xD;
      gabapentin 300mg, versus 600mg and placebo in women undergoing Cesarean section. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that gabapentin 300mg will result in decreased pain scores similar to&#xD;
      gabapentin 600mg, but with reduced side effects. We have designed a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study which will aim to answer these questions. Aside from the&#xD;
      administration of gabapentin one hour prior to surgery, there are no other changes to the&#xD;
      standard protocol of anaesthetic care. Women will be followed up for 48 hours after surgery&#xD;
      for assessment of pain scores and overall satisfaction. A further follow-up at three months&#xD;
      will determine the incidence of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have examined the incidence of chronic pain following Cesarean section, and none&#xD;
      have examined the impact of pre-emptive analgesia using gabapentin on the incidence of&#xD;
      chronic pain following Cesarean section. As the rate of Cesarean section continues to&#xD;
      increase, and there remain significant problems with current analgesic regimens, the use of&#xD;
      gabapentin, a drug with proven effectiveness in post-surgical pain and with limited side&#xD;
      effects, has the potential to considerably improve acute and chronic post-Cesarean pain, and&#xD;
      lead to a widespread change in clinical practice.&#xD;
