  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, continuous wound infiltration systems have been introduced to treat a&#xD;
      variety of post-surgical pain. These systems, commonly referred to pain pumps by patients,&#xD;
      possess a catheter(s) attached to a reservoir of local anesthetic that directly infuses into&#xD;
      the surgical site to provide local pain control thus avoiding the common and less desirable&#xD;
      systemic effects of oral narcotic pain medication. Due to its portability, another benefit&#xD;
      associated with these wound infiltration systems is its use as an outpatient pain control&#xD;
      modality. Despite the apparent benefits, the verdict on the system's effectiveness in&#xD;
      treating pain - throughout a variety of surgical fields - varies between very effective in&#xD;
      reducing post-operative pain and reducing overall narcotic consumption for several days to&#xD;
      completely ineffective with no reported changes in perceived pain or overall narcotic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through a randomized trial comparing plain saline to a common local anesthetic, The&#xD;
      investigators hope to evaluate the effectiveness of these pain pumps as an outpatient&#xD;
      modality for pain management following hemorrhoidectomy patients. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that there will be a significant benefit in pain relief with the use of these&#xD;
      pumps.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients scheduled for hemorrhoidectomies at NMCP&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient with co-existing active purulent infection (i.e. abscess).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient who has had previous surgical intervention for his/her hemorrhoidal&#xD;
             disease. Previous simple incision to treat a thrombosed hemorrhoid is not considered a&#xD;
             surgical intervention for the purposes of this study. The minimal scar produced by a&#xD;
             small incision would not alter post-operative pain following removal of a hemorrhoidal&#xD;
             column.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient allergic to local anesthetics or oral pain medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient with a history of chronic pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient allergic to or has had an adverse reaction (i.e. history of&#xD;
             gastrointestinal bleed) to a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient pregnant patient&#xD;
