  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the drug concentration of Micafungin amongst healthy&#xD;
      volunteers having different weight groups.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study. A total of 36 adult volunteers will be consented for the&#xD;
      study. Volunteers will be admitted for an overnight stay. Half will be female and half male.&#xD;
      Twelve volunteers will have a body mass index (BMI) less than 25 kg/m2, 12 will have a BMI&#xD;
      25-40 kg/m2, and 12 will have a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2. Volunteers will have height and&#xD;
      weight measured after they have consented to participate. Exactly half the volunteers in each&#xD;
      category will received a single dose of intravenous micafungin of 100 mg, while the other&#xD;
      half will receive 300 mg as determined by a coin flip. The volunteers will have blood drawn&#xD;
      via an intravenous catheter just prior to the dose, and then at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24h&#xD;
      after the drug dose. The intravenous catheter is then removed after the 24h blood draw, and&#xD;
      the volunteer discharged from the study. Compensation will be provided to the participants&#xD;
      for their time.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All racial and ethnic origins&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing or unwilling to use a reliable contraception method during the&#xD;
             study. The effects of micafungin on pregnancy are unknown. In addition, the metabolic&#xD;
             changes that accompany pregnancy may alter the concentration-time profile of&#xD;
             micafungin, so that the pregnancy and post-partum state would be a confounding&#xD;
             variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abnormal liver function tests: transaminases&gt;10 times upper limit of normal,&#xD;
                  Alkaline phosphatase&gt;5 times upper limit of normal, total bilirubin&gt;5 times upper&#xD;
                  limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine Clearance &lt; 70 ml/min as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergies to echinocandins&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Echinocandins are contraindicated for any reason&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers unwilling to comply with study procedures.&#xD;
