      The purpose of the study is to determine whether circulating molecular and cellular&#xD;
      biomarkers are predictive of imatinib effect on pulmonary artery hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      We hypothesize that bone marrow progenitor cells are mobilized into the circulation in PAH,&#xD;
      home to the lungs and differentiate into mast cells, which promote vascular remodeling and&#xD;
      vasoconstriction through release of renin and chymase. As a corollary to this, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that anti cKit tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib, provides clinical benefit to&#xD;
      patients through inhibition of mast cell progenitor proliferation, mobilization and&#xD;
      differentiation. To test this, we will determine if mast cell progenitors and mast cell&#xD;
      biomarkers are related to imatinib clinical response. This will be an ancillary study, part&#xD;
      of a placebo-controlled, double-blind multi center clinical trial of imatinib in pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension.&#xD;
