      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers who are studying autism spectrum disorders are interested in developing a&#xD;
           collection of research samples from both children with autism and healthy individuals,&#xD;
           some of whom may be related to the children with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The genetic condition tuberous sclerosis, which can cause the growth of benign tumors in&#xD;
           the brain and other parts of the body, is also linked with autism. Researchers have been&#xD;
           able to determine the specific genetic mutations involved in tuberous sclerosis, and as&#xD;
           a result are interested in studying the genetic information of children who have both&#xD;
           tuberous sclerosis and autism, as well as tuberous sclerosis without autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop a collection of DNA samples from blood and skin samples taken from children with&#xD;
      autism and/or tuberous sclerosis, as well as healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children between 4 to 18 years of age who have autism and/or tuberous sclerosis, or are&#xD;
           healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some of the healthy volunteers will be siblings of children with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and a physical examination, and may&#xD;
           also have a genetic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a blood sample and a skin biopsy for further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this protocol is to provide further elucidation of the clinical phenotype of&#xD;
      autism, and second to characterize a potential cellular phenotype through the re-programming&#xD;
      of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). The scope of autistic&#xD;
      spectrum disorders (ASD) is defined by its behavioral symptoms, encompassing a group of&#xD;
      conditions that includes Asperger disorder, autism and pervasive developmental disorder-not&#xD;
      otherwise specified (PDD). The clinical presentation of each of these diagnostic groups&#xD;
      differs slightly, but all share three common features: deficits in social reciprocity, delays&#xD;
      or deficits in communication (both verbal and non-verbal) and presence of repetitive&#xD;
      behaviors and fixated interests. These symptoms are most pronounced in the autism group, so&#xD;
      they will serve as the subjects for this pilot investigation. Individual differences in&#xD;
      behavioral symptoms, genetic abnormalities, medical comorbidities and other risk factors will&#xD;
      be assessed. These approaches will be coupled with computational approaches to identify&#xD;
      neural networks by analysis of gene association study data, and analysis of gene databases to&#xD;
      relate the diagnostic criteria of autism by unbiased analysis of the ontology of genes&#xD;
      relevant to CNS function.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Autism Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Meeting criteria for a diagnosis of autism, based on the Autism Diagnostic&#xD;
        Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, as well as clinical&#xD;
        judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Health Sibling and Typically Developing Group: Within 1.5 standard deviations from the mean&#xD;
        on the cognitive test performed, and lower than the cutoff scores on the Autism Diagnostic&#xD;
        Interview and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, and not meeting criteria for any&#xD;
        psychiatric disorder on interviews or questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Tuberous Sclerosis Groups: Confirmed diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Autism Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-idiopathic autism (e.g. previously identified genetic abnormality associated with&#xD;
        autism in that individual)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Typically Developing Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of receiving a diagnosis or services for psychiatric or significant learning issues&#xD;
