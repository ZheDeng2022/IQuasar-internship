      Assumptions and Objectives: The working hypotheses are: 1 - subjects with type 1 diabetes and&#xD;
      / or type 2, compared to subjects without diabetes are at risk for osteopenia and / or&#xD;
      abnormal bone structure the foot (calcaneus and ankle) can lead to bone deformities,&#xD;
      fractures and final stage of Charcot foot. These anomalies are favored by the presence of&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy and plasma levels of advanced glycation end products higher than in&#xD;
      diabetic subjects without bone abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this research are to evaluate these anomalies quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      bone in the foot (calcaneus and ankle) through the use of MicroScanner. In parallel a whole&#xD;
      body bone mineral density (BMD) and calcaneal ultrasound will be performed to measure bone&#xD;
      mineral density as realized in clinical practice in a defined population of patients with&#xD;
      type 1 or type 2. These bone abnormalities will be correlated with the presence of peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy and the rate of advanced glycation end products of proteins and reference to&#xD;
      parameters of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress to better understand the&#xD;
      pathophysiology and target a population at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of this study is paramount in the management of diabetic foot. Indeed for the&#xD;
      moment we are dealing primarily the consequences of diabetes impact bone when bone&#xD;
      deformities have appeared with their attendant disability and the risk of recurrent&#xD;
      infections in areas of friction in this fragile environment. The ultimate goal is to target&#xD;
      people with diabetes have abnormal bone subclinical and take care to avoid changes to bone&#xD;
      deformities and find ways to treat them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population studies on subjects with type 1 and 2 diabetes have revealed a fracture risk&#xD;
      multiplied by 4 to 12, especially at the shoulder, hip, ankle and foot, compared to a&#xD;
      population of non-diabetic subjects matched for age and sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If osteopenia (decreased bone mineral density) is consistently associated with fracture risk&#xD;
      in diabetic patients with type 1 diabetes type 2 often have a bone mineral density comparable&#xD;
      or superior to non diabetes subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The various causes mentioned in this alteration of the quantity and bone quality in the&#xD;
      context of chronic hyperglycemia is a disturbance of the interaction between osteoblasts&#xD;
      (cells forming bone) and osteoclasts (cells that resorb bone), partly mediated by the system&#xD;
      RANK / RANK-L / osteoprotegerin with decreased bone formation and increased osteolyses. The&#xD;
      peripherical neuropathy, the glycation proteins (modifications of proteins by addition of&#xD;
      glucose) and the receptor of glycation proteins are directly involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the foot, these changes in the bones (osteopenia and decreased bone quality) are&#xD;
      responsible for deformations observed in some diabetic subjects, resulting in the formation&#xD;
      of &quot;Charcot foot&quot; and the risk of sores and amputation as a major disability cause. Few&#xD;
      studies have examined the abnormalities that we could find at the foot of the diabetic&#xD;
      patients before the development of deformities observed in the Charcot foot. One study looked&#xD;
      at bone mineral density measured by ultrasound at the Charcot foot and the contralateral foot&#xD;
      in subjects with type 1 or type 2 compared to subjects with no diabetic Charcot foot. The&#xD;
      authors found a decrease in bone density measured by ultrasound at the Charcot foot compared&#xD;
      with the contralateral foot in subjects with type 1 and type 2. Bone density at the&#xD;
      contralateral foot was reduced compared with control subjects with diabetes only in subjects&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes but not in patients with type 2 diabetes. The link with the peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy is not clear. A second study in women with type 1 diabetes in premenopausal also&#xD;
      found a decrease in bone density at the calcaneus measured by ultrasound compared with women&#xD;
      without diabetes. None of these studies focused on the local structure of the bone. Yet we&#xD;
      may suspect that hyperglycemia, including glycation of proteins may cause structural changes&#xD;
      in the bone of diabetic subjects. Previously, it was difficult to understand the structure of&#xD;
      bone by non-invasive, the MicroScanner developed by the Scanco company can measure bone&#xD;
      density and trabecular architecture of the wrist and ankle with a discrimination of 42&#xD;
      microns . He does a minimal radiation (3 microsV) and allows a resolution of 80 microns. It&#xD;
      has already been used in osteopenic women and showed significant differences in terms of bone&#xD;
      architecture between women with fracture and those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumptions and Objectives: The working hypotheses are: 1 - subjects with type 1 diabetes and&#xD;
      / or type 2, compared to subjects without diabetes are at risk for osteopenia and / or&#xD;
      abnormal bone structure the foot (calcaneus and ankle) can lead to bone deformities,&#xD;
      fractures and final stage of Charcot foot. These anomalies are favored by the presence of&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy and plasma levels of advanced glycation end products higher than in&#xD;
      diabetic subjects without bone abnormalities.&#xD;

      The objectives of this research are to evaluate these anomalies quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      bone in the foot (calcaneus and ankle) through the use of MicroScanner. In parallel a whole&#xD;
      body BMD and calcaneal ultrasound will be performed to measure bone mineral density as&#xD;
      realized in clinical practice in a defined population of patients with type 1 or type 2.&#xD;
      These bone abnormalities will be correlated with the presence of peripheral neuropathy and&#xD;
      the rate of advanced glycation end products of proteins and reference to parameters of&#xD;
