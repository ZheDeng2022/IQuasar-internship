      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of calcitriol when given with&#xD;
      cisplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with advanced solid tumors that&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Calcitriol may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. Calcitriol may also help cisplatin and gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride kill more tumor cells by making them more sensitive to the drug.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral calcitriol when combined with a standard&#xD;
      dose of gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and cisplatin in a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe the toxicity of this combination using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Study the pharmacokinetics of calcitriol at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in an&#xD;
      expanded cohort of 6 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Describe the clinical activity associated with this regimen in this advanced solid tumor&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive calcitriol orally (PO) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16; cisplatin&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 2; and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      days 2, 9, and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
