      RATIONALE: Receiving standard information and watching a video or DVD at home that describes&#xD;
      treatment options and treatment outcomes may help patients decide to receive treatment in a&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying implant radiation therapy to see how well&#xD;
      it works compared with surgery in treating patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the proportion of patients consenting to the treatment randomization of&#xD;
           brachytherapy vs radical prostatectomy in treating patients with good-risk prostate&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility of randomization, in terms of average accrual rate per center,&#xD;
           during the last 6 months of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the decisional quality post-treatment in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the compliance with allocated treatment in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical failure in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the PSA relapse in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the patient-reported quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 (decision-aid randomization): Patients are stratified according to participating&#xD;
           center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 Decision-Aid arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm I (standard patient information): Patients receive standard patient information&#xD;
                according to routine clinical practice and preferred materials of each center. This&#xD;
                information typically includes booklets about prostate cancer and its treatment,&#xD;
                contact details for sources of further information (e.g., prostate support groups,&#xD;
                prostate charities, and web-based information), and access to a specialist nurse as&#xD;
                required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm II (standard patient information + decision aid): In addition to standard&#xD;
                information as described in Arm I, patients are given a 30-minute Decision-Aid&#xD;
                video or DVD to take home. The Decision Aid describes the standard treatment&#xD;
                options available to patients, provides detailed information about treatment&#xD;
                outcomes in relation to individual patient characteristics, and seeks to help&#xD;
                patients apply their own personal values to their treatment decision. Patients may&#xD;
                watch the audio-visual aid as many times as they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who decide to choose a treatment are removed from study; patients who agree to&#xD;
      undergo treatment randomization proceed to part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 (treatment randomization): Patients are stratified according to risk (low risk vs&#xD;
           intermediate risk). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm I (radical prostatectomy): Patients undergo surgery within 60 days of&#xD;
                randomization. The surgical technique for radical prostatectomy may be retropubic,&#xD;
                transperineal, laparoscopic or robotic. Pelvic lymph node surgery is permitted at&#xD;
                the discretion of the treating surgeon. Unilateral or bilateral nerve-sparing&#xD;
                techniques may be used at the discretion of the treating surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm II (brachytherapy): Patients undergo brachytherapy within 60 days of&#xD;
                randomization. Brachytherapy seeds may be implanted using pre-loaded needles or a&#xD;
                MICK® applicator of either iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-reported quality-of-life data is collected to assess erectile function, urinary&#xD;
      function, bowel function, and general quality of life at baseline and during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 1 and 4 months, every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3&#xD;
      years, then annually for 5 years.&#xD;
