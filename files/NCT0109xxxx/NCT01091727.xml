  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentre (7 sites), randomized, double-blind, study comparing&#xD;
      intravesical injection of BOTOX to placebo in 56 subjects with NDO secondary to spinal cord&#xD;
      injury or multiple sclerosis. Study subjects will be randomized to one of the following two&#xD;
      treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 n=28 BOTOX - 300U Group 2 n=28 Placebo BOTOX (saline)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects will receive one injection cycle (BOTOX 300U or Placebo) at Visit 2&#xD;
      (Treatment, Day 0) as per Supplement III. The study duration is approximately 61 weeks and&#xD;
      consists of a Pre-Treatment Evaluation, a Treatment/Randomization Visit (Visit 2, Day 0),&#xD;
      Telephone Follow-ups at 1, 3 and 4 weeks post-treatment, and Follow-up Visits at 6, 24 and 36&#xD;
      weeks (Visits 3 to 5). At Week 36, subjects will be offered open-label BOTOX 300U and will be&#xD;
      followed for an additional 6 months, returning for evaluations at Weeks 48 and 60.&#xD;

             control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with a history of transurethral sphincterotomy, bladder neck or prostatic&#xD;

             botulinum toxin including diagnosed Myasthenia Gravis, Eaton-Lambert Syndrome,&#xD;
             Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or any other disease that might interfere with&#xD;
             neuromuscular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with an allergy or sensitivity to any component of BOTOXÂ® (Section 5.2).&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Subjects with, in the opinion of the Investigator, unstable stable multiple sclerosis.&#xD;

             situation that may put the subject at significant risk, confound the study results, or&#xD;
             interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with a history of poor cooperation, non-compliance, or unreliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
