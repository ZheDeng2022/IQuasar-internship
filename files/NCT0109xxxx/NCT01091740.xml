      Recent autopsy study showed the most important histological and morphometric predictors of&#xD;
      stent thrombosis were endothelial coverage and the ratio of uncovered to total strut after&#xD;
      drug eluting stent (DES) implantation. Although there have been some controversies,&#xD;
      incomplete stent apposition might be possible cause of very late stent thrombosis after DES&#xD;
      implantation. Therefore, theoretically dual antiplatelet therapy should be continued to&#xD;
      prevent the stent thrombosis until complete reendothelialization. But, detection of&#xD;
      endothelial coverage over stent is not possible with available intravascular devices in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Among currently available intravascular devices, intravascular optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT) could give a more clear identification for a thin layer of&#xD;
      neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) and malapposition with high-resolution (10 -20 μm) compared to&#xD;
      intravascular ultrasound (100-150 μm). Previous OCT studies showed the significant different&#xD;
      pattern of neointimal coverage between baremetal stent (BMS) and DES. In our experience,&#xD;
      there were also some differences in neointimal coverage among the DESs, especially in&#xD;
      zotarolimus eluting stent (ZES). ZES have been known to be associated with significantly more&#xD;
      neointimal coverage than SES at 8 months intravascular untrasound (IVUS). This finding might&#xD;
      be related with strut thickness and drug elution property. In our data, 99.7 % of stent&#xD;
      struts were covered with neointima in ZES, but 93.2 % in sirolimus eluting stent (SES) at 9&#xD;
      month follow-up OCT. This difference was more distinct in patients with acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (99.3 % in ZES vs.79.9 % in SES).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both everolimus eluting stent (EES) was recently introduced and ZES resolute also will be&#xD;
      available in the near future in Korea. Previous phosphorylcholine polymer was replaced with&#xD;
      new, proprietary polymer which can provide extended elution kinetics in ZES resolute.&#xD;
      Therefore, efficacy to suppress the neointimal growth might be improved but, safety for&#xD;
      neointimal coverage needs to be evaluated in human coronary artery. Both new DESs are cobalt&#xD;
      chrominum stent with thin stent strut and reported similar efficacy for suppressing the&#xD;
      neointima growth. Also, endothelial coverage over stent strut occurred earlier compared to&#xD;
      previous DESs (SES or PES) in animal experiments. But, there has been no data for neointimal&#xD;
      coverage and malapposition of ZES resolute and EES using OCT in human coronary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent paper according to Kubo et al reported that serial OCT examinations demonstrated&#xD;
      markedly different vascular response up to 9 months after SES implantation between unstable&#xD;
      angina and stable angina patients. These findings implied that initial native vessel status,&#xD;
      which covered with stent, might be important and related with neoinitmal coverage and&#xD;
      malapposition. But, there is little data evaluated the relationship between initial lesion&#xD;
      status and neointimal coverage or late malapposition with OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will 1) evaluate the neointimal coverage and malapposition at 3 month&#xD;
      after ZES resolute and EES implantation and 2) compare them between ZES resolute and EES at 3&#xD;
      months after stent implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. STUDY OBJECTIVE This study is an prospective open labeled randomized study to compare the&#xD;
      neointimal coverage of ZES resolute (Endeavor® resolute) and EES (Xience®) in 3 month after&#xD;
      stent implantation by OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Primary end point The primary endpoint is to compare the pattern of neointimal coverage&#xD;
      between ZES resoute (Endeavor® resolute) and EES (Xience®) at 3 months after stent&#xD;
      implantation by OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Secondary end point The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate neointimal&#xD;
      growth between ZES resolute and EES at 3 months and 2) to compare the difference in early and&#xD;
      late malapposition between ZES resolute and EES at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Methods and Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Patient enrollment Patients with stable angina pectoris who present to the cath lab for&#xD;
      non-emergent PCI are eligible for participation. A patient is considered to be enrolled if&#xD;
      they meet all of the inclusion and have none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant coronary de novo lesion (&gt; 70% by quantitative angiographic analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with stable angina pectoris who are considered for coronary revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reference vessel diameter of 2.5 to 3.5 mm by operator assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for exclusion were&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraindication to anti-platelet agents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proximal leison within 15 mm from ostium&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treated with any DES within 1 year at other vessel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine level 2.0 mg/dL or ESRD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe hepatic dysfunction (3 times normal reference values)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant women or women with potential childbearing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complex lesion morphologies (aorto-ostial, unprotected Left main, chronic total&#xD;
           occlusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target lesion is vein graft lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reference vessel &lt; 2.5 mm or &gt; 4.0mm diameter by visual&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Sample Size and Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of the sample size could not be done because of observation study. Therefore, we&#xD;
      decided to enroll 40 patients for 20 ZESs resolute and 20 EESs considering sufficient stent&#xD;
      strut (over 3000 stent struts each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results are expressed as the mean ±SD. Comparisons of discrete variables were made using the&#xD;
      chi-square test or Fisher's Exact Test. Student t-tests were used for continuous variables.&#xD;
      Because the distribution was skewed due to a small study sample, non-parametric tests&#xD;
      (Mann-Whitney test for unpaired variables and Wilcoxon-signed rank test for paired variables)&#xD;
      were used. All statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 13.0. (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,&#xD;
      USA). A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. STUDY PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cath lab will follow site standard operating procedures for PTCA and stenting. Stent&#xD;
      overlapping is not allowed. Treatment of multiple vessels is acceptable. However, information&#xD;
      will be collected on only one study lesion per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will be collected and recorded on the treated study vessel including&#xD;
      angiographic, IVUS and OCT parameters. The IVUS and OCT study should be checked in the&#xD;
      procedure and follow up at 3 months angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1. PROCEDURAL MATERIALS Endeavor ® resolute 2.75 to 3.5 mm All available length Drug&#xD;
      Eluting Stent Xience ® 2.75 to 3.5 mm All available length&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 RANDOMIZATION Patients with native coronary arteries who fulfill all enrollment criteria&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive either ZES (Endeavor®) resolute or EES (Xience or Promus®).&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio of ZES or EES according to each clinical&#xD;
      presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 STENT SELECTION The vessel size will be determined either by quantitative angiography or&#xD;
      by IVUS for appropriate stent size selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 IVUS ASSESSMENT IVUS assessment was performed using a commercially available IVUS system&#xD;
      (Boston Scientific/ Scimed, Natick, MA). Studies were recorded on Index system (Echoplaque 2;&#xD;
      INDEC Systems Inc, Mountain View, CA) for off-line analysis. Motorized transducer pullback&#xD;
      permitted cross-sectional area measurements at 1mm axial increments throughout the length of&#xD;
      the stent. All IVUS studies were performed after the intracoronary administration of 200 µg&#xD;
      of nitroglycerin. The reference segment was the most visually normal cross section (largest&#xD;
      lumen with least plaque burden) within 10mm proximal or distal to the lesion. Using the&#xD;
      software, external elastic membrane (EEM) CSA (mm2), lumen CSA (mm2), minimal stent&#xD;
      cross-sectional area (MSA); identified as the CSA at the tightest segment within stent, stent&#xD;
      MLD were determined. The CSA at the proximal and the distal reference segments and at the&#xD;
      most stenotic lesion as well as the CSA at the proximal and the distal stent edge was&#xD;
      determined. A determination of the percent expansion was made by measuring the MSA and the&#xD;
      average reference segment CSA. Average reference segment CSA is calculated as [Proximal&#xD;
      Reference segment CSA +Distal Reference segment CSA)/2]. Plaque volume was calculated as&#xD;
      vessel minus stent volume. Neointimal volume was calculated as stent minus lumen volume, and&#xD;
      percentage (%) of neointimal obstruction was calculated as neointimal volume divided by stent&#xD;
      volume. Neointimal coverage over stent surface and mean physical neointimal thickness were&#xD;
      obtained by measuring circumferential stent length covered with neointimal hyperplasia (LN)&#xD;
      and stent perimeter (LS) at every 1-mm cross-sectional image throughout the stented segment:&#xD;
      (a) percentage of neointimal coverage over stent surface, calculated as total LN divided by&#xD;
      total LS, and (b) mean physical neointimal thickness, calculated as mean neointimal area&#xD;
      divided by mean LN for only the cross sections with detectable neointima.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5. OCT ASSESSMENT OCT measurements will be made as following methods: (Takano M, et al.&#xD;
      Evaluation by Optical Coherence Tomography of Neointimal Coverage of Sirolimus-Eluting Stent&#xD;
      Three Months After Implantation. Am J Cardiol 2007;99: 10331038)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional OCT images were analyzed at 1-mm intervals (every 15 frames). Neointimal&#xD;
      hyperplasia (NIH) thickness inside stent struts was measured. Stent area and lumen area in&#xD;
      every image were measured by manual trace and percent NIH area was calculated as percent NIH&#xD;
      area = ([stent area - lumen area]/ stent area) / 100. Measured NIH thickness equal to 0 micro&#xD;
      meter was defined as exposure, and maximum distance &gt; 110 micro meter between the strut&#xD;
      surface and adjacent vessel surface (thickness of strut and polymer) was defined as&#xD;
      malapposition. On an image of stent malapposition, lumen area was divided into an in-stent&#xD;
      lumen area and an extra-stent lumen area. . Intracoronary thrombus was defined as a&#xD;
      protruding mass beyond the stent strut into the lumen. Bifurcation lesions with major&#xD;
      sidebranches were excluded from this analysis. Inter- and intraobserver variabilities were&#xD;
      assessed by evaluation of 20 random cross- sectional images by 2 independent readers and by&#xD;
      the same reader at 2 separate time points, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6. Follow-Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed after hospital discharge. When patients come back in 3 and 9&#xD;
      months after the discharge due to clinical follow-up, the patient record will be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Clinical follow-up at 3, 9 months and 2 years after the procedure.&#xD;
