    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel, an inhibitor of ADP induced platelet aggregation and activation, is one of the&#xD;
      most commonly used drugs in patients with cardiovascular disease; coronary-stenting would not&#xD;
      be possible without the robust anti platelet function of this drug. Clopidogrel is a pro-drug&#xD;
      that is transformed through a series of hepatic cytochrome p-450 (CYP) enzymes to an active&#xD;
      metabolite. One of these CYP enzymes, 2C19 is subject to competitive inhibition by commonly&#xD;
      used proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). PPIs are commonly used for gastro-esophageal protection&#xD;
      in patients treated with clopidogrel. Around 63% of 3,799 patients on clopidogrel received a&#xD;
      PPI at TMH in 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a series of publications indicated that clopidogrel active metabolite levels and&#xD;
      platelet inhibition are lower in patients receiving PPIs. In addition, a recent survey of&#xD;
      &gt;16,690 patients in Medco database indicates that use of PPIs is associated with a 51%&#xD;
      increase in the risk of death or myocardial infarction in patients receiving clopidogrel.&#xD;
      Recent data have also indicated that patients with loss of function (LOF) haplotypes of the&#xD;
      CYP2C19 gene have lower levels of the active metabolite after dosing with clopidogrel. These&#xD;
      patients have higher rates of death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis and other&#xD;
      ischemic complications than do patients with the wild type enzyme. Inadequate responses to&#xD;
      clopidogrel therapy have been implicated as an important predictor of adverse clinical&#xD;
      events. The reported prevalence of non-responsiveness to clopidogrel among patients with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease is between 4% and 34%, depending on the method and definition used to&#xD;
      assess this parameter. Approximately 25% of American population carries a LOF mutation of&#xD;
      CYP2C19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear whether the concomitant use of omeprazole (PPI) with clopidogrel would result&#xD;
      in a decrease in platelet function parameters through the CYP2C19 clopidogrel activation&#xD;
      pathway. The specific aim of the proposed study is to determine whether the interaction&#xD;
      between PPIs and clopidogrel is dependent on CYP2C19 haplotype. We hypothesize that among&#xD;
      subjects with a LOF genotype, the interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs is greater than&#xD;
      that in subjects with the wild type genotype7 and is manifest in both platelet function&#xD;
      parameters and in conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 75 randomly selected healthy volunteer subjects will be screened with the&#xD;
      intent of identifying at least 16 subjects who are heterozygous for a LOF mutation of CYP2C19&#xD;
      (known as *2/rs4244285, *3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with the LOF allele will be selected along with age and gender-matched wild type&#xD;
      controls and baseline platelet function studies will be performed (n=16 for each group).&#xD;
      Subjects in each stratum will then be randomly assigned to receive one week of clopidogrel in&#xD;
      combination with omeprazole or clopidogrel alone. Subjects initially assigned to clopidogrel&#xD;
      + omeprazole will then take clopidogrel only and subjects initially assigned to clopidogrel&#xD;
      only will take both clopidogrel and omeprazole.&#xD;
