    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of daily treatment for 12&#xD;
      weeks of oral administration of a delayed release, locally delivered 6MP (mercaptopurine)&#xD;
      drug (80 mg), as compared to standard Purinethol (at a dose of 1-1.5 mg/kg/body weight), in&#xD;
      alleviating the clinical, immunological and mucosal signs and symptoms of moderately active&#xD;
      Crohn's Disease&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's Disease (CD) therapy is aimed at reducing inflammation via induction of remission&#xD;
      after a flare-up and maintenance of the remission for as long as possible. Therapies commonly&#xD;
      used for inducing remission are steroids and anti-TNF-a. Standard 6MP, on the other hand, has&#xD;
      a slow onset of action and requires several months of administration before its therapeutic&#xD;
      effects become apparent. Therefore, 6MP is typically used as maintenance therapy, rather than&#xD;
      for remission. Furthermore, serious AE's associated wtih 6MP include leucopenia,&#xD;
      hepatoxicity, pancreatitis and bone marrow suppression, requiring lowering of dose or&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Teva DR-6MP project was designed to evaluate a new oral 6MP formulation that would&#xD;
      address these limitations. The slow action of standard 6MP, precluding its use as a treatment&#xD;
      for induction of remission, would be offset by a faster-disintegrating, more soluble&#xD;
      formulation with an enteric coating for targeted ileal delivery. This new formulation&#xD;
      designed to open at the terminal ileum, the most commonly affected area of CD bowel&#xD;
      involvement, could deliver higher effective local concentrations of drug to the site most&#xD;
      affected by CD, stimulating an effective local immunological response, resulting in a cascade&#xD;
      of widespread immunological activity, evoking an induction of remission. The safety of&#xD;
      standard 6MP would be improved upon by the fact that negligible levels of the DR-6MP&#xD;
      formulation have been observed in the plasma, obviating the toxicities associated with&#xD;
      systemic 6MP. Moreover, since the DR-6MP dose is fixed and not subject to patient weight, nor&#xD;
      potentially, side-effects, the dose adjustments required for up-titration to optimal dose, or&#xD;
      down-titration due to toxicity, could be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous small, pilot proof-of-concept clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetic studies of the&#xD;
      DR-6MP formulation demonstrated the potential for induction of remission, mucosal healing,&#xD;
      systemic immunological improvement and lower systemic side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is designed to repeat the earlier studies under larger, more rigorous&#xD;
      conditions in a randomized, double-blind fashion at multiple sites to ascertain if the&#xD;
      initial encouraging results could be repeated. Moreover, a higher dose of 6MP (80 mg) will be&#xD;
      tested to ascertain if presumably higher local concentrations at the disease site can evince&#xD;
      a more robust clinical effect.&#xD;

Therefore, patients randomized to this arm to receive combination active Purinethol/comparable placebo.
