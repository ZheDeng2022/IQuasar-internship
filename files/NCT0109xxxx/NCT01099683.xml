  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 26 healthy elderly male and female subjects will receive both 10 mg NRL001 in a 2&#xD;
      g rectal suppository and placebo in this double-blind, cross-over study. The order of&#xD;
      treatment will be randomised, with a minimum washout period of 3 days between doses. An end&#xD;
      of study assessment will be conducted at least 7 days after administration of the last&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetics of NRL001 will be determined prior to, and after, dosing.&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamics will be examined using a three lead Holter monitor during both treatment&#xD;
      periods. Adverse Events, vital signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory parameters will be&#xD;
      collected, tabulated, reviewed and recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
