  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that patients with schizophrenia smoke in order to produce amelioration&#xD;
      of dysfunctional dopaminergic pathways allowing them to experience pleasure and satisfaction&#xD;
      and overcome anhedonia. No studies have assessed the effects of nicotine withdrawal on reward&#xD;
      responsivity in patients with schizophrenia. The investigators believe that an understanding&#xD;
      of this is crucial if improved treatments for nicotine dependence are to be developed for&#xD;
      this patient population. If this group already has deficits in reward responsivity as a&#xD;
      symptom of the disease then they may be particularly prone to the effects of nicotine&#xD;
      withdrawal on reward systems. Smoking cessation may lead to a further decrease in their&#xD;
      responsivity to pleasurable stimuli and worsening anhedonia. Treatments for smoking cessation&#xD;
      may need to ameliorate any increased deficits if they are likely to be effective in patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heavy smoking continues to represent a significant public health problem for people in the&#xD;
      general population and for people with major mental illness. Twenty-four percent of adults in&#xD;
      the general population smoke and it has been estimated that 74-92% of people with&#xD;
      schizophrenia smoke. While effective treatments for smoking cessation have been developed,&#xD;
      response rates are modest and relapse rates are high. Approximately 70% of people who quit&#xD;
      smoking with effective treatments relapse to smoking within one year. A syndrome of negative&#xD;
      affect and anhedonia has been described as an important component in maintenance of&#xD;
      dependence on nicotine. It has also been suggested that preventing the syndrome of anhedonia&#xD;
      and negative affect during early abstinence may reduce relapse rates. If the syndrome of&#xD;
      anhedonia can be measured objectively and quantitatively, we will be better able to test&#xD;
      treatments for this withdrawal syndrome. It is our hypothesis that the syndrome of anhedonia&#xD;
      during early abstinence from nicotine is quantifiable as a deficit in reward responsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies suggest that nicotine withdrawal is associated with an alteration in reward&#xD;
      responsivity. Brain stimulation reward thresholds have been used to measure anhedonia and&#xD;
      responsivity to reward in animal models. Nicotine withdrawal has been associated with a&#xD;
      significant decrease in brain reward function as measured by elevations in brain reward&#xD;
      thresholds that persist for 4 days. Nicotine withdrawal has also been associated with failure&#xD;
      of conditioning to an environment paired with novel stimuli, possibly due to a decrease in&#xD;
      reward associated with novel stimuli. Drug withdrawal states have also been associated with&#xD;
      inhibition of mesolimbic release in murine models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a randomized placebo controlled trial to investigate the effects of nicotine&#xD;
      abstinence on reward responsivity in patients with no major mental illness and in patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the effects of nicotine withdrawal on a measure of reward responsivity&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: Normal controls and subjects with schizophrenia will demonstrate deterioration&#xD;
      on a measure of reward responsivity during abstinence (placebo condition) compared to&#xD;
      baseline. (Primary Outcome Measure)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the effects of transdermal nicotine on reward responsivity during&#xD;
      abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: Normal controls and subjects with schizophrenia will demonstrate greater&#xD;
      response bias toward a rewarded condition following transdermal nicotine administration&#xD;
      relative to placebo patch during a 3 day period of abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To evaluate the effects of smoking abstinence and transdermal nicotine on a measure of&#xD;
      reward responsivity in patients with schizophrenia who smoke relative to normal control&#xD;
      smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3a: Subjects with schizophrenia will demonstrate decreased reward responsivity&#xD;
      during all conditions (baseline, nicotine replacement therapy condition and placebo&#xD;
      condition) relative to normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To evaluate the effects of nicotine withdrawal on cognitive function in smokers&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4a: Normal controls and subjects with schizophrenia will demonstrate poorer&#xD;
      performance on tests of cognition following placebo administration compared with baseline and&#xD;
      nicotine conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to test the effects of smoking abstinence and nicotine replacement therapy, using&#xD;
      nicotine transdermal patch on a measure of reward responsivity in patients who smoke. We&#xD;
      propose a randomized placebo controlled crossover trial with the primary outcome measure&#xD;
      being Response bias using a signal detection task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are 70 patients with schizophrenia who smoke and 70 normal control smokers who do&#xD;
      not have a major mental illness and who are matched for age, sex and nicotine dependence.&#xD;
      Though we expect to consent 70 subjects in each group, we expect only 20 subjects in each&#xD;
      group to complete the study&#xD;
