      Studies in humans and animals support that stress and/or elevations in corticosteroids lead&#xD;
      to changes in hippocampal structure and functioning. This is important as patients with major&#xD;
      depression frequently have elevated cortisol, and millions of patients receive prescription&#xD;
      corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone). Both depression and corticosteroid therapy are associated&#xD;
      with memory impairment and hippocampal atrophy. Our research uses corticosteroid-treated&#xD;
      patients to explore interventions that might protect the brain from the effects of stress or&#xD;
      corticosteroids. We propose to give 30 corticosteroid-treated asthma patients acetaminophen&#xD;
      or placebo. Between group differences in mood, memory and other neurocognitive measures will&#xD;
      serve as outcome measures.&#xD;

      SCIENTIFIC PROPOSAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if patients receiving prescription corticosteroid therapy who are given&#xD;
           acetaminophen have smaller declines in declarative memory than those receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if patients receiving prescription corticosteroid therapy who are given&#xD;
           acetaminophen have smaller increases in manic/hypomanic symptoms than those receiving&#xD;
           placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if patients receiving prescription corticosteroid therapy who are given&#xD;
           acetaminophen have smaller declines in cognitive domains other than declarative memory&#xD;
           such as working memory and executive functioning than those receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if patients receiving prescription corticosteroid therapy who are given&#xD;
           acetaminophen have smaller increases in depressive symptoms than those receiving&#xD;
           placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background/Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of stress or corticosteroids on the hippocampus:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in animals suggest that stress-induced elevations in endogenous corticosteroids or&#xD;
      the administration of exogenous corticosteroids are associated with cognitive deficits and&#xD;
      changes in hippocampal structure which can (after extended exposure) include irreversible&#xD;
      neuronal loss (Brown et al. 1999, 2004a; McEwen 1997, 2000). These findings have important&#xD;
      implications as common psychiatric illnesses including major depressive and bipolar disorders&#xD;
      are frequently associated with acute or chronic elevations in cortisol (Brown et al. 1999).&#xD;
      In addition, each year approximately 10 million Americans are given prescription&#xD;
      corticosteroids, such as prednisone or dexamethasone, for illnesses such as asthma,&#xD;
      allergies, arthritis, and dermatological conditions (Brown et al. 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hippocampus is important as it mediates important cognitive processes and provides&#xD;
      negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Jacobson &amp; Sapolsky&#xD;
      1991). Thus, hippocampal impairment could result in both memory loss and potentially even&#xD;
      greater cortisol levels due to loss of normal negative feedback. This concept of hippocampal&#xD;
      dysfunction leading to greater elevation in cortisol levels and additional hippocampal&#xD;
      dysfunction has been termed the &quot;glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis&quot; (Sapolsky et al. 1986).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several lines of evidence suggest that stress and corticosteroids may impair human&#xD;
      hippocampal structure and functioning. Starkman et al. (1992) examined hippocampal volumes&#xD;
      using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in 12 patients with cortisol elevations of 1-4 years&#xD;
      duration secondary to Cushing's disease. In three patients, hippocampal volumes fell outside&#xD;
      the 95% confidence interval reported in the literature. Atrophy correlated with mean cortisol&#xD;
      levels. Our group recently reported poorer performance on a declarative memory task (a&#xD;
      measure of hippocampal functioning), smaller hippocampal volume and lower levels of N-acetyl&#xD;
      aspartate, a putative marker of neuronal viability, in a group of 17 asthma and arthritis&#xD;
      patients receiving long-term prednisone therapy than in a control group of similar age,&#xD;
      education level and medical history not receiving prednisone (Brown et al 2004b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in humans also suggest smaller hippocampal volumes by Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) in people with chronic or recurrent major depressive or bipolar disorders (Sheline et&#xD;
      al. 1996; Bremner et al. 2000). Although none of these studies documented elevated cortisol&#xD;
      levels at the time of the neuroimaging, mood disorders can be associated with an elevation in&#xD;
      cortisol. Therefore, one explanation for these findings is hippocampal atrophy due to an&#xD;
      excess of cortisol at some point in the illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids are associated with deficits in cognitive functioning, which may occur very&#xD;
      rapidly after exposure and long before any changes in hippocampal structure could be detected&#xD;
      with available imaging techniques. Thus, cognitive instruments may be a sensitive measure of&#xD;
      early changes in the hippocampus due to corticosteroids. Declarative memory, assessed with&#xD;
      instruments such as word lists or paragraph recall, appears to be particularly sensitive to&#xD;
      hippocampal functioning (Squire 1992). Memory deficits have been reported in patients&#xD;
      receiving short (days) (Naber et al. 1996, Bender et al. 1988, Newcomer et al. 1994, 1999) or&#xD;
      long term (weeks, months or years) (Brown et al. 2004b, Keenan et al. 1996) exposures to&#xD;
      exogenous corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mood symptom with prescription corticosteroids In addition to cognitive effects,&#xD;
      corticosteroids are also associated with changes in mood. Brief courses of prescription&#xD;
      corticosteroids are associated primarily with manic or hypomanic symptoms (Brown et al. 2002;&#xD;
      Naber et al. 1996) although clinically significant depressive symptoms are reported in some&#xD;
      patients (Naber et al. 1996). Longer-term exposure to lower dosages of prednisone may be&#xD;
      associated more strongly with depressive symptoms (Brown et al. 2004b; Keenan et al. 1996).&#xD;
      We found lifetime prednisone-induced mood disorders in 60% of patients receiving chronic&#xD;
      prednisone therapy (Bolanos et al. 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions to prevent or reverse hippocampal changes secondary to stress or&#xD;
      corticosteroids In animal models, pharmacological interventions focusing on agents that&#xD;
      directly reduce corticosteroid levels or reduce corticosteroid-induced elevations in&#xD;
      serotonin or glutamate have been explored. A novel antidepressant not currently available in&#xD;
      the U.S. for use in humans, tianeptine, appears to prevent and reverse morphological changes&#xD;
      in the rat hippocampus during a stress paradigm (Conrad et al. 1996; Watanabe et al. 1992;&#xD;
      Magarinos et al. 1999). An additional agent, which appears to prevent stress-induced&#xD;
      hippocampal damage in rats, is the glutamate-release inhibitor phenytoin (Watanabe et al.&#xD;
      1992; Magarinos et al. 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an excess of corticosteroids is associated with memory impairment and eventual hippocampal&#xD;
      volume loss, interventions that may prevent or reverse these changes are of great importance.&#xD;
      Memory deficits secondary to brief (days to weeks) exposure to corticosteroids are clearly&#xD;
      reversible with medication discontinuation. Even hippocampal changes with longer term&#xD;
      corticosteroid exposure may be reversible. Starkman et al (1999) reported significant&#xD;
      increases in hippocampal volumes, measured on MRI, and improvement in declarative memory in&#xD;
      22 patients with Cushing's disease approximately 3-18 months (mean 12 months) following&#xD;
      successful treatment and normalization of cortisol levels. We reported on the use of&#xD;
      lamotrigine, a glutamate release inhibitor, for 12 weeks in a group of 10 patients receiving&#xD;
      long-term prednisone therapy (Brown et al 2003). We found statistically significant&#xD;
      improvement in declarative memory, suggestive of a neuroprotective effect on the hippocampus,&#xD;
      following lamotrigine therapy. We recently completed a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial of phenytoin in patients receiving prednisone therapy (Brown et al&#xD;
      2005). Phenytoin was associated with a significantly smaller increase in hypomanic symptom&#xD;
      severity than placebo during the prednisone exposure. However, it appears that phenytoin, not&#xD;
      unexpectedly, may have also been associated with some negative effects on cognition. Thus, a&#xD;
      medication with few cognitive effects may be a better choice for use in our model system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions to prevent or reverse the mood effects of prescription corticosteroids Only two&#xD;
      controlled clinical trials have been conducted in patients with psychiatric symptoms&#xD;
      secondary to corticosteroids. Falk et al. (1979) reported that lithium pretreatment might&#xD;
      attenuate corticosteroid-induced mood symptoms. While 14% of patients receiving corticotropin&#xD;
      therapy suffered from mood symptoms, none of the patients receiving corticotropin following&#xD;
      lithium pretreatment had a mood disturbance. As discussed above, we gave a group of adult&#xD;
      asthma patients either phenytoin or placebo at the same time they began a course of oral&#xD;
      prednisone therapy. The group receiving phenytoin has a significantly smaller increase in&#xD;
      manic symptom severity than the group receiving placebo (Brown et al. 2005, see also&#xD;
      preliminary studies section). Case reports and small open-label studies suggest that lithium&#xD;
      and other mood stabilizers including lamotrigine, carbamazepine, gabapentin, valproic acid,&#xD;
      traditional neuroleptics (Ahmad and Rasul, 1999) and the newer atypical agents (Brown et al.&#xD;
      2004c) may effectively treat or prevent corticosteroid-induced mood symptoms after their&#xD;
      development (Brown, 2003, Brown et al. 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has developed a research program using humans who receive prescription&#xD;
      corticosteroids as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant therapy to explore the effects of&#xD;
      the stress hormones on the hippocampus. Our current focus is on interventions that may&#xD;
      prevent or reverse the effects of stress or corticosteroids on the hippocampus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetaminophen as a neuroprotective agent Data suggest that acetaminophen is widely&#xD;
      distributed in the central nervous system (Caurad et al. 2001a) and may have neuroprotective&#xD;
      properties. Pertinent to the proposed study acetaminophen protects dopaminergic neurons&#xD;
      against glutamate excitotoxicity in vitro (Casper et al. 2000) and protects hippocampal&#xD;
      neurons from oxidative stress (Bisaglia et al 2002). Acetaminophen also reduces&#xD;
      staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced increases in glutamate release in the rabbit brain (Huang&#xD;
      et al 2004). Acetaminophen also alters monoamines in the rat brain (Courad et al. 2001b), and&#xD;
      synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus through presynaptic serotonin receptors (Chen and&#xD;
      Bazan, 2003). No reports were found on the effect of acetaminophen on mood or memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary A reliable early effect (beginning 1-2 days into therapy) of corticosteroids on the&#xD;
      human hippocampus is a decline in performance on declarative memory tasks (e.g. word lists).&#xD;
      Preclinical data suggest that acetaminophen may have neuroprotective properties. We propose&#xD;
      to give patients scheduled to receive prescription corticosteroids either acetaminophen or&#xD;
      placebo along with the corticosteroids. Our aim is to determine if the acetaminophen&#xD;
      attenuates the decline in declarative memory, and development of hypomanic symptomatology&#xD;
      (e.g. insomnia, irritability, agitation) better than placebo. If this pilot study shows&#xD;
      promising results we would anticipate conducting a larger, more definitive study, with&#xD;
      funding from National Institutes of Health (NIH).&#xD;

    <measure>Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of declarative memory (associated with the hippocampus). The test consists of 15 nouns read aloud for five consecutive trials with each trial followed by a free-recall trial. Following the fifth trial, an interference list of 15 different words is presented followed by a free-recall trial of that list. Delayed recall of the first list is tested immediately following the interference list and after a 20-minute delay. A recognition test of 50 words including the 15 original words is presented after the delayed recall. RAVLT total score of ≥ 40 words on trials 1-5(from a range of 0 to 75 words possible)suggests relatively normal memory prior to prednisone therapy.</description>

        <title>Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)</title>
        <description>This is a measure of declarative memory (associated with the hippocampus). The test consists of 15 nouns read aloud for five consecutive trials with each trial followed by a free-recall trial. Following the fifth trial, an interference list of 15 different words is presented followed by a free-recall trial of that list. Delayed recall of the first list is tested immediately following the interference list and after a 20-minute delay. A recognition test of 50 words including the 15 original words is presented after the delayed recall. RAVLT total score of ≥ 40 words on trials 1-5(from a range of 0 to 75 words possible)suggests relatively normal memory prior to prednisone therapy.</description>

        <title>Internal State Scale - Activation (ISS-ACT)</title>
        <description>Activation subscale assesses (hypo)manic symptoms. There are 16 questions on the total ISS, each rated on a series of visual analogue scale (VAS) items consisting of statement followed by a 100 mm line with anchor points at 0 and 100. The 16 questions divide into four subscales measuring activation; depression, global psychopathology, and well being. Depression Index (DI): Scores for items 7 and 9 are added to give a DI score ranging from 0-200 with 0 being absence of depressive symptoms and 200 indicating severe depressive symptoms. Well-Being Index (WB): Scores for items 3, 5 and 15 are added to give a WB score ranging form 0-300, with &gt;125 indicating euthymia. Activation Index (ACT): Scores for items 6, 8, 10, 12 and 13 are added to give an ACT score ranging from 0-500, with &gt;155 indicating mania. Perceived Conflict Index (PC): Scores for items 1, 2, 4, 11 and 14 are added to give a PC score ranging from 0-500, with higher scores indicating greater severity of psychopathology.</description>

        <title>Asthma Control Questionnaire</title>
        <description>This is a seven item assessment of symptoms pertinent to asthma management, including day and nighttime symptoms; activity limitation; use of prn bronchodilators; a physiological measure of asthma (spirometry), forced expiratory volume in 1 second percent predicted (FEV1% predicted), which is the percentile of FEV1 compared to normal controls matched for age, height, gender, and race, in the scoring. Total mean is interpreted on a scale between 0 (asthma completely controlled) and 6 (asthma severely uncontrolled).</description>
