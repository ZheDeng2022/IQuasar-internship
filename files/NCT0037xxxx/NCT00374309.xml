  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if an experimental vaccine to prevent Ebola virus infection is safe&#xD;
      and what side effects, if any, it causes. Ebola virus infection may range from mild to&#xD;
      severe, and may cause breathing problems, severe bleeding, kidney problems and shock that can&#xD;
      lead to death. The vaccine used in this study contains man-made genetic material similar to&#xD;
      one part of the Ebola virus, which is designed to stimulate an immune response to the virus.&#xD;
      The vaccine itself cannot cause Ebola virus infection because it does not contain any Ebola&#xD;
      virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are assigned to one of three groups as they enter into the study. Of the first&#xD;
      16 people in the study, 12 receive the lowest study dose of vaccine and 4 receive placebo (an&#xD;
      inactive substance). If this dose is safe, then of the next 16 people who enter the study, 12&#xD;
      receive a higher dose of the vaccine, and the remaining 4 receive placebo. If this dose is&#xD;
      safe, the final 12 people in the last group of 16 receive the highest study dose, and 4&#xD;
      receive placebo. The vaccine is given as a single injection in the arm on the day of&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants keep a diary for 5 days, recording their temperature, symptoms and any reaction&#xD;
      at the injection site. They call a study nurse the day after vaccination to report how they&#xD;
      feel, and they return to the clinic approximately six times for follow-up evaluations. These&#xD;
      visits may include a check of vital signs, physical examination, blood and urine tests, or&#xD;
      other medical tests if needed.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study to examine safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and immune response of a recombinant Ebola adenovirus serotype 5 vector&#xD;
      (Ebola-rAd5) vaccine in healthy adults. The hypothesis is that this vaccine will be safe and&#xD;
      elicit immune responses to Ebola. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the investigational vaccine VRC-EBOADV018-00-VP in healthy subjects. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives include immunogenicity evaluations and adenovirus serotype 5 antibody&#xD;
      titers (Ad5 Ab) at Weeks 0, 4, and 24. Exploratory evaluations include immunogenicity&#xD;
      evaluations at Weeks 2, 12, and 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-EBOADV018-00-VP is a recombinant product composed of two replication-deficient&#xD;
      recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vectors encoding for glycoprotein (GP), one from the&#xD;
      Zaire strain and one from the Sudan-Gulu strain of Ebola. The final formulation buffer will&#xD;
      be used as the diluent and as the placebo control (Crucell placebo). Injections will be&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly (IM) by needle and syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult subjects ages 18 to 50 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-eight subjects will receive a 1 mL intramuscular (IM) deltoid injection, via needle and&#xD;
      syringe, of the study agent or placebo in a deltoid muscle as shown in the schema. Dose&#xD;
      escalation will occur about three weeks after the last injection in the preceding dose group&#xD;
      following an interim safety data review by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB),&#xD;
      provided that there are no significant toxicities. No more than one subject per day will be&#xD;
      enrolled for the first 6 enrollments into each dosage group and the sixth subject enrolled&#xD;
      must have 5 days (Group 1) or 14 days (Group 2 and Group 3) of follow-up before proceeding&#xD;
      with further enrollments into that group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated at 7 or more clinical visits during the 48 weeks after the study&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability of the vaccine administered at doses of 2 x&#xD;
      10(9), 2 x 10(10) and 2 x 10(11) virus particles (VP) by IM injection. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      are immunogenicity as indicated by Ebola-specific antibody and cellular immune responses at&#xD;
      Weeks 0, 4 and 24 and Ad5 antibody titer at Weeks 0, 4, and 24. Exploratory analyses of&#xD;
      immunogenicity will also be conducted on stored samples collected at other timepoints&#xD;
      including Weeks 2, 12 and 48.&#xD;
