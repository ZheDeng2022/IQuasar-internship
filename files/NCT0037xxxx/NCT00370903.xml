      The purpose of this retrospective study is to determine if there is an increase in postpartum&#xD;
      depression (PPD) among women who undergo an emergency cesarean section as opposed to a&#xD;
      planned cesarean section. We will analyze the hospital and clinic medical records of&#xD;
      postpartum women who delivered by cesarean section (CS) at Tulsa Regional Medical Center&#xD;
      between January 1, 2003, and June 1, 2005, and who obtained their postpartum care at the OSU&#xD;
      Ob/Gyn Clinic in Tulsa, Oklahoma. We will record whether the cesarean was planned or&#xD;
      emergent, and we will note the score they received on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression&#xD;
      Scale when they came to the clinic for their four-week postpartum visit. A score of 12 or&#xD;
      lower on the EPDS will be considered &quot;not depressed&quot;, and a score of 13 or higher will be&#xD;
      considered &quot;depressed.&quot; Numbers of depressed patients will be compared among the two types of&#xD;
      cesarean sections and analyzed for statistical differences using the chi-squared method of&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

      The purpose of this retrospective study is to determine if there is an increase in postpartum&#xD;
      depression (PPD) among women who undergo an emergency cesarean section as opposed to a&#xD;
      planned cesarean section. All previous research documenting the rate of PPD in cesarean&#xD;
      section patients looks only at the incidence of PPD in cesarean section versus vaginal&#xD;
      delivery, and does not separate emergent versus planned cesarean section. The general study&#xD;
      hypothesis is as follows: An emergent cesarean section can be an emotionally traumatic&#xD;
      experience. Women who have a cesarean section for emergent causes are not psychologically&#xD;
      prepared for surgery, and thus experience an increased rate of PPD. The null hypothesis is:&#xD;
      There is no significant difference in the rate of PPD among women who have a cesarean section&#xD;
      for emergent causes versus women who have their cesarean section at the previously scheduled&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum depression (PPD) is diagnosed in approximately 10-20% of women (DSM-IV-TR), and&#xD;
      25% of these women still suffer from PPD twelve months after delivery (Gregoire et al, 1996).&#xD;
      Risks for developing PPD include a higher subjective burden of childbirth, poor relationship&#xD;
      with spouse, significant other, or father of the baby, unemployment or dissatisfaction with&#xD;
      job, and low socioeconomic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstetrical history risk factors include previous abortions, high-risk pregnancy, low birth&#xD;
      weight, and cesarean section (Bergant et al, 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery via cesarean section (CS) creates a much different emotional experience than does a&#xD;
      vaginal delivery. Disappointment in the ability to have a natural birth, feelings of&#xD;
      resentment towards the physician, altered treatment expectation, as well as, pain and trauma&#xD;
      associated with surgery are all contributing factors (Al-Nuaim, 2004). A majority of women&#xD;
      consider an emergency cesarean section (CS) to be a mentally traumatic encounter. One third&#xD;
      of women who require an emergency CS will experience posttraumatic stress reactions during&#xD;
      the postpartum period (Ryding et al, 1997). Fisher et al reported that there is a significant&#xD;
      relationship between mode of delivery and negative psychological outcomes. A mother who has a&#xD;
      CS instead of a vaginal delivery is more likely to have mood deterioration, lowered&#xD;
      self-esteem, grief reaction, posttraumatic distress, and depression (Fisher et al, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to analyze the hospital and clinic medical records of 200 postpartum women who&#xD;
      delivered by cesarean section (CS) at Tulsa Regional Medical Center between January 1, 2003,&#xD;
      and June 1, 2005, and who obtained their postpartum care at the OSU Ob/Gyn Clinic in Tulsa,&#xD;
      Oklahoma. Of the charts reviewed, 100 women will have had a CS for emergent causes, and the&#xD;
      other 100 will have delivered via a planned CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital records will be reviewed to determine whether the cesarean delivery was for&#xD;
      emergent causes or if it was a planned operation. Planned cesarean sections are performed on&#xD;
      patients who have had a previous CS and are scheduled for a repeat, fetuses that are&#xD;
      measuring greater than 4000 grams, prior uterine scars, and known breech presentations on&#xD;
      patients not in labor. Emergent causes will include nonreassuring fetal heart tones,&#xD;
      placental abruption, inductions that result in CS due to failure to progress or cephalopelvic&#xD;
      disproportion, and malpresentations in active labor. Malpresentations include face, brow,&#xD;
      shoulder, hand, breech, compound, or transverse lie.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will have their clinic chart reviewed for the following data from their&#xD;
      antenatal and postpartum visits: date of delivery, breastfeeding status as a simple yes/no&#xD;
      question without regard to whether or not the mother is supplementing with formula, mother's&#xD;
      age, smoker/non-smoker, race, employment status, previous history psychological disorders,&#xD;
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score (routinely administered by obstetrician at the six&#xD;
      week postpartum visit), other antepartum or postpartum complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum depression will be diagnosed with the assistance of the Edinburgh Postnatal&#xD;
      Depression Scale (EPDS). The OSU Ob/Gyn Clinic began routine use of the EPDS in 2003. As a&#xD;
      result, all patient records used in this study will be from January 1, 2003 to June 1, 2005.&#xD;
      A one-year time period has been allotted for collection of data as this will allow sufficient&#xD;
      time to review the necessary records. In addition, one of the collaborating investigators is&#xD;
      a resident, and the research assistants are medical students, therefore, the data collection&#xD;
      must be completed in a timely manner. OSU Ob/Gyn and Tulsa Regional Medical Center are the&#xD;
      only sites in this investigation to ensure that the diagnosis of postpartum depression is&#xD;
      made using the same parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study population will include 200 postpartum women ages 15 to 43 who have given birth via&#xD;
      cesarean section at Tulsa Regional Medical Center. In addition, these same individuals must&#xD;
      have had their postpartum follow up visit(s) at the OSU Ob/Gyn Clinic in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The&#xD;
      study population consists predominantly of Medicaid patients. These patients are generally of&#xD;
      a lower socioeconomic status. The ethnic mix includes Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic,&#xD;
      American Indian and Asian patients. Patients who deliver vaginally, have an intrauterine&#xD;
      fetal demise, known anomalies in the delivered fetus, a known mood disorder during pregnancy,&#xD;
      or drug use during pregnancy or the postpartum course will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Termination Criteria&#xD;

      N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS/PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of postpartum depression will be given based on the use of the Edinburgh&#xD;
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The EPDS has 10 questions, and possible scores range from&#xD;
      0-30. We used its author's recommendation that scores higher than 12 be considered a positive&#xD;
      screen for PPD and for which sensitivity and specificity have been found to be 86% and 78%,&#xD;
      respectively (Cox et al). We are aware that other depression evaluations may be used to&#xD;
      definitively diagnose PPD. The OSU Ob/Gyn clinic uses the EPDS for convenience, and it was&#xD;
      the only data available in patient charts for this retrospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection Collaborating investigators and research assistants will review each chart, and&#xD;
      extract only the following data from the patient's postpartum visit: Edinburgh Postnatal&#xD;
      Depression Scale score (routinely administered by obstetrician at the six week postpartum&#xD;
      visit), breastfeeding status as a simple yes/no question without regard to whether or not the&#xD;
      mother is supplementing with formula, date of delivery, mother's age, smoker/non-smoker,&#xD;
      race, employment status, previous history psychological disorders, other antepartum or&#xD;
      postpartum complications. No additional information will be collected from patient charts.&#xD;
      The research assistants are OSU medical students employed in the work study program for the&#xD;
      specific purpose of working on this research project. They will collect the data from clinic&#xD;
      records. These assistants are under the OSU umbrella of individuals who may have access to&#xD;
      patient charts, and they have basic human use research training as well as HIPAA training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Numbers of depressed patients will be compared among the two groups and analyzed for&#xD;
      statistical differences using the chi-squared method of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality Patient's clinic records will be kept in the medical records department,&#xD;
      which is under direct security supervision, or locked at all times. Hospital records will be&#xD;
      kept in the health information management department at Tulsa Regional Medical Center, which&#xD;
      is locked 24 hours a day. All study records will be de-identified by conversion to numbers&#xD;
      before review, analysis, or interpretation. J. Martin Beal, D.O., Sarah McCoy, Ph.D., and&#xD;
      Jennifer Howell, D.O. will have access to these numbers which will be kept locked in the OSU&#xD;
      Ob/Gyn office, which is separate from both medical records departments. All documents linking&#xD;
      patient names to charts will be destroyed after the data collection is complete.&#xD;
