  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find an optimal dose of atropine for preventing the rapid&#xD;
      progression of myopia in children by comparing the efficacy, safety and functional impact of&#xD;
      binocular treatment with 0.5%, 0.1% and 0.01% atropine and to develop a treatment regimen for&#xD;
      the routine management of childhood myopia.&#xD;

      A Randomised, Double-Masked Study to Compare The Safety and Efficacy of Bilateral 0.5%, 0.1%&#xD;
      &amp; 0.01% Atropine Treatment In Controlling Progression of Myopia In Children&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration and Visit Schedule Total of 5 years with 15 scheduled visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase I: 2 years with 8 scheduled visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase II: 3 years with 7 scheduled visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This study consists of 2 phases, each with a different design. Phase I is a&#xD;
      double-masked single-centre clinical trial wherein 400 children aged 6-12 years, with myopia&#xD;
      of -2.00 D or worse in each eye, and from whom assent and parental/guardian consent have been&#xD;
      obtained, will be randomised to receive 0.5% atropine, 0.1% atropine or 0.01% atropine once&#xD;
      nightly in both eyes. Participants will be assigned to treatment in the ratio of 2:2:1,&#xD;
      respectively. Each child will receive treatment for a period of 2 years during which they&#xD;
      will be reviewed every 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II is an open-label study wherein all children will continue to be followed-up&#xD;
      regularly for changes in their refractive error after stopping atropine treatment. Those&#xD;
      children who demonstrate myopia progression of -0.5 D or more, at least on one eye after a&#xD;
      minimum of 8 months washout period will restart atropine treatment in both eyes. The&#xD;
      appropriate dose will be determined by analysis of the data from Phase I of the study.&#xD;
      Treatment will be for a further 2 years and all children, including those not receiving&#xD;
      treatment, will be reviewed every 6 months.&#xD;
