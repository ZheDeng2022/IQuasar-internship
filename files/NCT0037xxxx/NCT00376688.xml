    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well temsirolimus works in treating patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall activity (as defined by complete response [CR] + partial response&#xD;
      [PR] + stable disease [SD] for &gt;= 24 weeks) of a weekly 25 mg intravenous dose of&#xD;
      temsirolimus in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the activity of temsirolimus in patients with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer whose primary tumors have mutations in the PIK3CA or PTEN gene with those whose&#xD;
      tumors do not have a mutation in the PIK3CA gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine correlations between antitumor activity of temsirolimus and alterations in&#xD;
      expression of genes in the PI3K pathway in primary tumor biopsy specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes weekly. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0 was used for response evaluation. Clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of subjects experiencing a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks.&#xD;
Evaluation of target lesions: Complete Response (CR)-- Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)-- At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Stable Disease (SD)-- Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started;&#xD;
Evaluation of non-target lesions: Complete Response (CR)-- Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; Incomplete Response/ Stable Disease (SD)-- Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent&#xD;
             breast cancer not amenable to local therapy (surgery and radiation)&#xD;

             be recorded) as &gt;= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm with spiral&#xD;
             computed tomography (CT) scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are no limitations on the number of prior therapy regimens; however, patients&#xD;
             who have had prior exposure to rapamycin or any other mechanistic target of rapamycin&#xD;
             (mTOR) inhibitor are excluded from the trial&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately; women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
             prior to treatment on study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with temsirolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tissue for correlative studies must be available and the subject must agree to use of&#xD;
             tissue for these studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be off of hormonal agents used for the treatment of breast cancer for&#xD;
             one week with the exception that premenopausal women who have been on a&#xD;
             gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and subsequently progressed may, at the&#xD;
             discretion of the treating physician, continue on the GnRH agonist&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients should have recovered from the adverse effects of prior chemotherapy; in&#xD;
                  general, this will mean that the patient would have been due or overdue for the&#xD;
                  next dose of the prior regimen: three weeks should have elapsed for a regimen&#xD;
                  administered once every three weeks, etc&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiotherapy should have been completed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Three weeks should have elapsed since prior therapy with monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or herbal preparations;&#xD;
             patients may not be taking corticosteroids except in low doses as replacement for&#xD;
             adrenal insufficiency or for short -term (less than 5 days) use for other reasons&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases are not permitted on study unless the metastases&#xD;
             have been controlled by prior surgery or radiotherapy, and the patient has been&#xD;
             neurologically stable and off of steroids for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients cannot be receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (enzyme-inducing&#xD;
             antiepileptic drugs [EIAEDs]; e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) nor any&#xD;
             other CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampin or St. John's wort, as these may decrease&#xD;
             temsirolimus levels; use of agents that potently inhibit CYP3A (and hence may raise&#xD;
             temsirolimus levels), such as ketoconazole, is discouraged, but not specifically&#xD;
             prohibited; CCI-779 can inhibit CYP2D6, and may decrease metabolism (and increase drug&#xD;
             levels) of drugs that are substrates for CYP2D6, such as codeine; the appropriateness&#xD;
             of use of such agents is left to physician discretion; if there is any doubt about&#xD;
             eligibility based on concomitant medication, the study chair, Dr Fleming, should be&#xD;
             contacted; all concomitant medications must be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             uncontrolled symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients receiving combination&#xD;
             anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to macrolide antibiotics (such as&#xD;
             erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin) are not eligible for this trial&#xD;

          <description>Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0 was used for response evaluation. Clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of subjects experiencing a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks.&#xD;
Evaluation of target lesions: Complete Response (CR)-- Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)-- At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Stable Disease (SD)-- Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started;&#xD;
Evaluation of non-target lesions: Complete Response (CR)-- Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; Incomplete Response/ Stable Disease (SD)-- Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits</description>
