      This study examines the ability of two new malaria vaccines (FP9-PP and MVA-PP) to prevent&#xD;
      the development of malaria infection after controlled exposure to the parasite. Volunteers&#xD;
      for this trial will have received these vaccines in the preceding trial VAC027.1.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria infection kills over 2 million people each year. It is a major problem for those who&#xD;
      live in endemic areas and for travellers. There is clearly a great need for a safe effective&#xD;
      malaria vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the clinical efficacy of two candidate malaria vaccines&#xD;
      (FP9-PP and MVA-PP). These live viral vector vaccines were administered in a 'prime boost'&#xD;
      regime in the preceding trial VAC027.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will now be exposed to 5 infective bites from mosquitoes carrying P. falciparum&#xD;
      malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure efficacy as the time in hours from malaria exposure to blood film positive for&#xD;
           malaria parasites&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine immunogenicity before and after malaria infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure longer term vaccine efficacy by re-challenging any protected volunteers 6 - 12&#xD;
           months later&#xD;
