    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the relationship between serious mental&#xD;
      illness and the detection and management of diabetes and pre-diabetic conditions. Patients&#xD;
      who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia are at an increased risk for developing diabetes&#xD;
      and pre-diabetic conditions such as impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose.&#xD;
      In addition, novel antipsychotics have also been linked to impaired glucose metabolism and&#xD;
      increased incidence of diabetes. The medical management of these patients may be difficult ot&#xD;
      achieve through standard family practice. The objectives of this project are to: screen a&#xD;
      sample of this high-risk population using an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), and to&#xD;
      provide multidisciplinary team support to those identified as having diabetes or a&#xD;
      pre-diabetic condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies suggest that the extensive psychiatric needs of some patients could take&#xD;
      attention away from management of other health problems and from the usual health promotion&#xD;
      services physicians provide. Studies suggest that medical comorbidity has often been under&#xD;
      recognized and under diagnosed in psychiatric patients, especially among those with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Unrecognized physical diseases are often associated with serious, potentially&#xD;
      fatal illness, and may exacerbate the symptoms of psychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disorder of schizophrenia has been repeatedly associated with a higher than normal&#xD;
      incidence of medical illnesses- specifically, diabetes mellitus (DM). The prevalence of DM in&#xD;
      a retrospective study of 95 chronic schizophrenic patients was found to be 15.8% - 4 to 5&#xD;
      times higher than that reported in epidemiological surveys in the general population. This&#xD;
      increased risk has recently been formally recognized in the Canadian diabetes practice&#xD;
      guidelines. In addition, the first line treatment of schizophrenia as per many published&#xD;
      clinical practice algorithms, novel antipsychotics (NAP), has been associated independently&#xD;
      with increased risk for diabetes. Novel antipsychotics such as clozapine, olanzapine,&#xD;
      quetiapine, and risperidone have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia with&#xD;
      generally fewer extrapyramidal side effects than high dosed typical neuroleptics. However,&#xD;
      there is accumulating data suggesting that treatment with at least some of the NAPs may be&#xD;
      associated with the development of DM and associated risk factors. The use of olanzapine, for&#xD;
      example, has been associated with weight gain, exacerbation of previously well-controlled&#xD;
      diabetes, and onset of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Clozapine has also been associated with&#xD;
      weight gain in several reports, as well as increased risk of developing diabetes, and at&#xD;
      least one report citing deaths from diabetic ketoacidosis after long-term use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-risk groups need targeted diabetes strategies. The Canadian diabetes practice guidelines&#xD;
      outline that the service model needed to achieve the benchmarks set for diabetes care will&#xD;
      need to be designed to reflect the unique diabetes related challenges faced by various&#xD;
      segments of the diabetes epidemic. Diabetes care should be organized around a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary diabetes healthcare (DHC) team that can establish and sustain a&#xD;
      communication network between the person with DM and the necessary healthcare and community&#xD;
      systems. The high risk mental health communities in Ontario need a targeted primary health&#xD;
      care service delivery model that attends to the unique set of diabetes related challenges&#xD;
      they face, including: weight increase related to medication use, inadequate self-care&#xD;
      resources and capacity related to poverty, social constraints and lack of supports,&#xD;
      communication barriers and mental health symptomology impacting interactions with service&#xD;
      providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines for diabetes management are clear regarding the monitoring and treatment&#xD;
      of identified high-risk groups. Screening for DM should be performed every three years in&#xD;
      individuals over 40 years of age. However, more frequent and/or earlier testing with a 75-g&#xD;
      Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) should be considered in people with identified risk&#xD;
      factors such as schizophrenia and NAP use. Annual screening could detect individuals with&#xD;
      undiagnosed DM as well as individuals with the pre-diabetic conditions of Impaired Fasting&#xD;
      Glucose and Impaired Glucose Tolerance. Results of large, well-designed studies assessing&#xD;
      early interventions in adults to prevent the progression from pre-diabetic conditions to DM&#xD;
      have recently been published. These studies have demonstrated significant risk reduction with&#xD;
      lifestyle management and appropriate pharmacologic interventions. It is also well documented&#xD;
      that a comprehensive multidisciplinary Diabetes Healthcare team can help slow the progression&#xD;
      of the disease and reduce the incidence of DM-related complications for those already&#xD;
      diagnosed with DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The London Intercommunity Health Centre (LIHC) has recently piloted a diabetes program&#xD;
      addressing the needs of a high-risk mental health population within the recommended&#xD;
      guidelines. The program was designed as a &quot;one stop shop&quot; for self-management teaching,&#xD;
      medication and glucose monitoring, and referral to specialist providers as needed. The&#xD;
      structure of the program followed the Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice&#xD;
      Guidelines. Although the program has yet to be implemented long enough to determine if the&#xD;
      progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes was prevented, pre-diabetic patients involved in&#xD;
      the program have demonstrate clinically significant improvement in lipid profiles and blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements. Those patients diagnosed with DM, who participated in the program,&#xD;
      were found to attend regularly, and demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in&#xD;
      their metabolic control. Thus, initial results from the LIHC, and a recent extension of this&#xD;
      model into a community population, indicate that this model of diabetes care for this&#xD;
      high-risk mental health population is promising for diabetes risk and disease management.&#xD;
