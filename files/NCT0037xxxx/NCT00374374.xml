      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a probiotic containing Lactobacillus&#xD;
      Acidophilus and Lactobacillus Rhamnosus is effective as treatment for patients with active&#xD;
      colonic Crohn's disease&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aetiology of Crohn's disease is still not known. In the recent years there has been an&#xD;
      increasing interest in the relationship between the gastrointestinal flora and gut function.&#xD;
      Several studies have shown promising results for the use of probiotics in patient with&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of a probiotic suspension in&#xD;
      patients with active colonic Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study is a two-centre, randomised placebo-controlled, and double-blind trial.&#xD;
      Patients above the age of 18 years, attending our out-patient clinic, can be included if they&#xD;
      have Crohn's disease in the colon or colon and small bowel and have active disease with a&#xD;
      CDAI: 220-400. Patients are not included if they have undergone larger bowel resections, have&#xD;
      been treated with antibiotics within the last two months, if dose of prednisolone has been&#xD;
      changed within the last 4 weeks, or dose of immunosuppressives has been changed within the&#xD;
      last 2 months. During the study period no changes in medication is allowed. During an 8 week&#xD;
      period patients are treated with a combination of lactobacillus rhamnosus strain 19070-2 and&#xD;
      lactobacillus acidophilus strain 18911-2 (10EE9 colony forming unit/ml). Freeze-dried&#xD;
      probiotics are dissolved in sterile water to a volume of 1 ml which is ingested once daily,&#xD;
      in the evening.&#xD;
