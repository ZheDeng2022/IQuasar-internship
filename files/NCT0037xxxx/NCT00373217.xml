      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response&#xD;
      to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce&#xD;
      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving vaccine therapy and chemotherapy&#xD;
      after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with&#xD;
      paclitaxel and carboplatin works in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for stage&#xD;
      III or stage IV ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the immunogenicity of vaccine therapy comprising synthetic ovarian&#xD;
           cancer-associated peptides administered with a synthetic tetanus toxoid helper peptide&#xD;
           emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 before or after paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients&#xD;
           with stage III-IV ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube&#xD;
           cancer undergoing optimal cytoreductive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy:Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and&#xD;
                carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to&#xD;
                4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
                then proceed to surgical debulking.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical debulking: Patients undergo primary optimal cytoreductive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vaccine therapy: Within 14 days after surgery, patients receive vaccine therapy&#xD;
                comprising synthetic ovarian cancer-associated peptides, MAGE-A1:161-169,&#xD;
                FBP:1901-199, Her-2/neu:369-377, MAGE-A1:96-104, and Her-2/neu:754-762, and tetanus&#xD;
                toxoid helper peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 intradermally and&#xD;
                subcutaneously on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 14 weeks for 2&#xD;
                courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive 4 courses of paclitaxel and carboplatin as&#xD;
                in neoadjuvant chemotherapy after completion of course 1 of vaccine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical debulking: Patients undergo up-front optimal cytoreductive surgery.&#xD;
                Patients with non-optimal primary debulking may undergo interval debulking surgery&#xD;
                within 6 weeks after completing course 4 of adjuvant chemotherapy. If interval&#xD;
                debulking surgery is performed, tumor and/or lymph node tissue is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vaccine therapy: Patients receive 2 courses of vaccine therapy as in group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in group 1,&#xD;
                neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo periodic blood and tumor tissue collection during study for correlative&#xD;
      immunological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients with progressive disease are followed at 30&#xD;
      days and then every six months thereafter. All other patients are followed every 3 months for&#xD;
      36 months until disease progression or until another therapy is initiated, and then every six&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

Treatment may repeat every 14 weeks for two courses. After finishing the first course of vaccine therapy, patients will receive a 3-hour infusion of paclitaxel and an infusion of carboplatin every 3 weeks for up to four courses.</description>
