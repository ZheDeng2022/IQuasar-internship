      1. Primary Objective To assess the response rate of sequential VAD (Vincristine,&#xD;
           Adriamycin, Dexamethasone) and VTD (Velcade, Thalidomide, Dexamethasone) induction&#xD;
           therapy as a first line treatment for the patients with multiple myeloma&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To assess the progression free survival, duration of response, and overall survival&#xD;
                of patients given sequential VAD and VTD induction followed by high dose therapy&#xD;
                with autologous stem cell transplantation and maintenance treatment with Velcade&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To assess the toxicities of sequential VAD and VTD induction chemotherapy, high&#xD;
                dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation, and of maintenance&#xD;
                treatment with Velcade.&#xD;

      1. Overview of study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study aims to assess the efficacy and toxicities of sequential VAD and VTD&#xD;
           induction followed by high dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation and&#xD;
           maintenance treatment with velcade as a first line treatment for the patients with&#xD;
           multiple myeloma. This study will be conducted as an open, multi-center, single arm,&#xD;
           prospective phase 2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sample size determination&#xD;
&#xD;
           The expected response rate of sequential VAD and VTD induction chemotherapy as a first&#xD;
           line treatment for the patients with multiple myeloma is 80%. By using Flemming's single&#xD;
           stage design ( error: 0.05,  error : 0.2), 55 evaluable patients are needed to prove&#xD;
           this hypothesis. If withdrawal rate is 10%, enrollment of total 62 patients will be&#xD;
           needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Duration of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      One year of enrollment will be needed (2006.03.1-2007.02.28). At least 24 months of follow-up&#xD;
      for the patients who are to be enrolled last time is needed.&#xD;
