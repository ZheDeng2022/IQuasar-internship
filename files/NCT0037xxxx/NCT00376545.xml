      This study will explore how the areas in the brain are connected to link what people see to&#xD;
      what they do; that is, how they use what they see to help guide their movements. The study&#xD;
      uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at different areas in the brain&#xD;
      while a person performs tasks in which both what they see (visual input) and what they do&#xD;
      (their motor response) are related or unrelated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, right-handed normal volunteers who are 18 years of age or older may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, neurological examination and MRI&#xD;
      scan, if one has not been done within a year of entering the study. MRI uses a magnetic field&#xD;
      and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. The subject lies on a table&#xD;
      that can slide in and out of the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud&#xD;
      knocking sounds that occur during scanning. The procedure lasts about 90 minutes, during&#xD;
      which the subject is asked to lie still for up to 30 minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo fMRI for this 1-day study. fMRI differs from ordinary MRI in that the&#xD;
      subject performs tasks during the scanning, allowing researchers to see brain changes that&#xD;
      occur during performance of the activity. Before the scan, the subject is trained for the&#xD;
      tasks, which include looking at shapes while following them with the fingers and looking at&#xD;
      shapes without making finger movements. Following the testing, subjects have a second&#xD;
      ordinary MRI scan.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to analyze task-related connectivity changes in brain regions, using a block&#xD;
      design blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI),&#xD;
      as a function of the linkage between visual input and motor output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - 25 right-hand dominant, healthy adult volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Connectivity between brain areas can change related to the dependence level between visual&#xD;
      input and motor output. The dependence level will be modulated while performed tasks engage&#xD;
      visual and motor areas either in a functionally related fashion or not. Subjects will perform&#xD;
      a visuomotor task (VM, dependence level = maximal) that consists of tracking a target by&#xD;
      exerting force isometrically on a transducer with their right index finger (target signal and&#xD;
      exerted force are displayed in the scanner). In the visual plus motor task (V+M), two&#xD;
      different tasks will be performed simultaneously. Subjects will perform the same motor task&#xD;
      as in VM but without target signal and visual feedback of their force control, while a&#xD;
      neutral visual input unrelated to the motor output is dynamically flashed in the screen. In&#xD;
      the visual (V), subjects will watch the target signal while relaxed. In the motor task (M),&#xD;
      subjects will produce the same motor task as in VM and V+M while staring at a static fixation&#xD;
      cross. A rest period will require subjects to fixate on a stationary dot in the middle of the&#xD;
      visual field. fMRI scanning will be used to record brain activity during tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental phase will have six sets of 6-minute scanning sessions where the subject&#xD;
      will perform the conditions. The conditions will appear pseudo-randomly throughout the scan&#xD;
      sessions. V will always precede VM condition to avoid motor system activation secondary to&#xD;
      imagination of movement primed by the visual stimulus. The M and VM conditions will be&#xD;
      presented in a random order. At the completion of fMRI scanning, a baseline high-resolution&#xD;
      MRI T1 scan will be obtained for anatomic localization and co-registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the connectivity change in brain networks in response to loss of&#xD;
      dependence between a sensory input and the motor output. We will be focused on the&#xD;
      correlation between the time series of activations in each condition and the connectivity&#xD;
      changes over all the conditions. This will allow us to elucidate the task-dependent&#xD;
      connectivity between occipital cortex and prefrontal cortex relative to the functional link&#xD;
      between visual input and motor output.&#xD;
