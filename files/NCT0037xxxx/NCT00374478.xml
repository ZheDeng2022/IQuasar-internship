      Our study proposes to use a randomized crossover placebo controlled design to test the&#xD;
      effects of transdermal scopolamine vs. placebo on simulated ship navigation performance under&#xD;
      conditions of heavy seas. We hypothesize that mariners will experience a greater decrement in&#xD;
      navigational performance in the placebo condition vs. transdermal scopolamine, when faced&#xD;
      with simulated heavy seas. Study staff will apply the transdermal scopolamine patch or&#xD;
      placebo patch, 8 hours prior to performance assessment. Participants will surrender car keys&#xD;
      and will agree stay on the Kalmar Maritime Campus until they are dismissed from the study. A&#xD;
      study nurse and/or study physician will be on call from the time of patch application until&#xD;
      study participants are dismissed from the study. Eight hours following patch application&#xD;
      participants will perform navigation tasks, under stormy weather conditions, in the bridge&#xD;
      simulation lab at Kalmar Maritime Academy. Participants will repeat the protocol one week&#xD;
      later under the opposite dosing condition. This study will be conducted at the Kalmar&#xD;
      Maritime Academy, Kalmar, Sweden.&#xD;
