  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tissue factor is the main activator of coagulation cascades. Excessive tissue factor&#xD;
      expression is made responsible of thrombosis in a number of clinical situations including&#xD;
      thrombosis in contact with atherosclerotic plaques. Recent work showed that tissue factor&#xD;
      gene expression in adipose tissue was significantly increased in obese versus lean mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to show that tissue factor expression is increased in&#xD;
      human adipose tissue obtained from obese subjects and to identify its main tissular origin by&#xD;
      comparing abdominal and subcutaneous adipose tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to identify the cell origin of tissue factor (adipocytes versus&#xD;
      stromal cells) and to analyze the relation ship between blood tissue factor and (i) tissue&#xD;
      factor expressed by adipose tissue, (ii) the amount of subcutaneous and profound adipose&#xD;
      tissue, and (iii) coagulation activation markers.&#xD;
