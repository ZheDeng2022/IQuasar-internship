      The investigators propose to compare the proteomic analysis of umbilical venous blood from&#xD;
      neonates with brain injury to gestational age matched noninjured controls. After delivery an&#xD;
      umbilical arterial gas and a 10 ml umbilical venous sample are obtained, then the remainder&#xD;
      of the cord blood is discarded. The investigators plan to use this cord blood that would&#xD;
      otherwise be discarded to perform our proteomic analysis. The investigators will use up to 20&#xD;
      ml of cord blood per delivery. This will be a 5 year study during which time the&#xD;
      investigators hope to analyze 450 infants at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Bayview Medical&#xD;
      Center. The investigators will obtain an umbilical venous sample from infants born at &lt; 34&#xD;
      weeks gestation. For infants born at &gt; 34 weeks the investigators will obtain an umbilical&#xD;
      venous sample for any infant suspected to be at risk for neurologic injury by having a&#xD;
      diagnosis of chorioamnionitis during labor, nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing at the&#xD;
      time of delivery, or a 5 minute Apgar &lt; 7. For the infants born at &lt; 34 weeks the brain&#xD;
      injured infants will be compared to gestational age matched controls without brain injury.&#xD;
      For the infants born at &gt; 34 weeks, each infant later confirmed to have neurologic morbidity&#xD;
      will be compared to a gestational age matched noninjured control. The investigators hope to&#xD;
      use proteomic analysis to determine if there are measurable differences in protein expression&#xD;
      between the 2 groups.&#xD;

      We will draw up to 20 ml of umbilical venous blood at the time of delivery from infants born&#xD;
      at &lt; 34 weeks gestation, and for any infant born at &gt; 34 weeks suspected to be at risk for&#xD;
      neurologic morbidity by having intrapartum chorioamnionitis, nonreassuring fetal heart&#xD;
      tracing prior to delivery, or a 5 minute Apgar &lt; 7. For each infant born at &gt; 34 weeks later&#xD;
      confirmed to have neurologic morbidity by head ultrasound or EEG we will draw cord blood from&#xD;
      a gestational age matched control without intrapartum infection or nonreassuring fetal heart&#xD;
      tracing prior to delivery. At the time of delivery an umbilical arterial gas and umbilical&#xD;
      venous sample for a type and screen, RPR and hematocrit are routinely drawn. The remainder of&#xD;
      the cord blood is discarded. After the routinely done arterial blood gas and umbilical venous&#xD;
      blood sample are obtained the remainder of the umbilical cord blood, which would otherwise be&#xD;
      discarded, will be collected using a 23 gauge or larger needle into a heparinized tube. The&#xD;
      sample will be centrifuged for 10 minutes and the plasma layer separated. The sample will be&#xD;
      placed into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes in 500 ul aliquots. Proteomic techniques including mass&#xD;
      spectrometry, 2-dimensional electrophoresis, and chromatography, will be used to analyze the&#xD;
      proteome from the brain injured and control groups. Specific proteins will be identified, and&#xD;
      differences in expression compared between the 2 groups.&#xD;
