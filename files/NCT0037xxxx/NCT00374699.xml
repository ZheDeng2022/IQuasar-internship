  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are neoplasias from post-thymic T-cells at different&#xD;
      stages of differentiation and are a heterogeneous group of malignancies which present with&#xD;
      different morphological patterns, phenotypes, and clinical presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These tumours have a striking epidemiological distribution with a lower incidence in Western&#xD;
      countries than in Asia. In Korea, PTCLs including T- or natural killer (NK)-cell lymphomas&#xD;
      constitute approximately 25 to 35% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. This incidence is quite&#xD;
      similar to that of other Eastern Asian countries, including Japan, Hong Kong, and China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies suggest that the T-cell phenotype is an independent significant prognostic&#xD;
      factor, with PTCLs having one of the lowest overall survival and failure-free survival rates.&#xD;
      Based on the investigator's experience, the overall complete remission rate was 61.2% (95%&#xD;
      confidence interval [CI]: 48.5-72.8%) and the 5-year probability of failure-free survival was&#xD;
      33.5%. Median survival of all patients was 45 months (range 0-64+ months) and the 5-year&#xD;
      probability of survival was 36.2%. Rassidakis et al. reported that expression of&#xD;
      pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BCL-XS, may explain the poor response of many types of PTCL to&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome such poor outcome, the optimal therapy for PTCLs remains to be defined. However,&#xD;
      because of the rarity of the disease in Western countries, only a few trials have been&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib (Velcade) is a modified dipeptidyl boronic acid, and a reversible inhibitor of the&#xD;
      chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteosome. Bortezomib may induce tumor cell apoptosis&#xD;
      or decreased bcl-2 associated drug resistance. Through phase II studies, single agent&#xD;
      bortezomib in patients with relapsed indolent and mantle cell lymphomas showed its activity.&#xD;
      And also preliminary data indicate that bortezomib can be safely administered in combination&#xD;
      with dose adjusted etoposide, prednisolone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin&#xD;
      (EPOCH) chemotherapy. Therefore, it can be possible to improve the poor outcome of patients&#xD;
      with PTCLs by a combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone&#xD;
      (CHOP) with bortezomib as a first-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Based on the clinical trials and experimental data, bortezomib can&#xD;
      overcome pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BCL-XS induced drug resistance.&#xD;
