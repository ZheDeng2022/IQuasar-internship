  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dengue is a common disease and a major health concern in the Philippines. Dengue is caused by&#xD;
      a virus transmitted from the bite of an infected mosquito. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      understand why some infants remain well or have a mild illness, and why other infants become&#xD;
      very sick from this virus. Studies have shown that the mother's immune response to dengue can&#xD;
      play a role in the infant's immune response and affect whether or not the infant becomes&#xD;
      sick. This study will enroll up to 10,000 healthy infants 6-14 weeks old and their mothers in&#xD;
      San Pablo City. At the first study visit, information about the mother and birth will be&#xD;
      collected and blood samples will be taken from the mother and infant. The infant will have&#xD;
      blood drawn at all 3 study visits. The infants will be followed until the age of 16 months.&#xD;
      The information obtained from this study may help in the development and future testing of a&#xD;
      safe and effective dengue vaccine.&#xD;

      This is a prospective natural history study to define the levels of maternally-acquired&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody (Ab) and other correlates of immunity that may protect against the&#xD;
      development of dengue hemorrhagic fever in infants. Approximately 10,000 mother-infant pairs&#xD;
      will be enrolled to achieve a continuous study cohort of approximately 4,000 children less&#xD;
      than 16 months of age. Children leave the study when they reach 16 months of age and are&#xD;
      replaced by new participants at 6-14 weeks of age. The investigators will recruit study&#xD;
      participants among 3rd trimester pregnant women receiving pre-natal care and women with&#xD;
      newborns receiving post-natal care in San Pablo City. The first aim of this study is to&#xD;
      define levels of serotype-specific neutralizing Abs associated with protective immunity&#xD;
      against symptomatic dengue virus (DV). Neutralizing Ab titers in blood samples collected from&#xD;
      Filipino infants before DV infection, and predicted neutralizing Ab titers at the time of&#xD;
      illness, will be correlated with disease severity rankings and peak viremia levels.&#xD;
      Neutralizing Ab titers at which infants developed symptomatic dengue will be determined. The&#xD;
      second aim will be to delineate risk factors contributing to the pathogenesis of dengue&#xD;
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in infants. From pre-illness blood samples, the association of Ab&#xD;
      neutralizing capacity or enhancement of infection with DHF will be measured while controlling&#xD;
      for other potential covariates. The covariates will include measures representing viral load&#xD;
      and infant host immune responses. The third aim will be to strengthen the capacity for&#xD;
      diagnosis and research on dengue in the Philippines. A collaborative and international&#xD;
      consortium has been formed to advance dengue research in the Philippines. The research will&#xD;
      generate vital data for the effective testing of dengue vaccines and future public health&#xD;
      vaccination campaigns throughout the region. This study will enroll up to 10,000 healthy&#xD;
      infants 6-14 weeks old and their mothers in San Pablo City. The infants will be followed&#xD;
      until the age of 16 months. Mothers and infants will enter the study when the infant is&#xD;
      between the ages of 6-14 weeks. At the 1st study visit, data on the mother and the birth will&#xD;
      be collected and blood samples will be collected from the mother and infant. The infant will&#xD;
      have blood drawn at all 3 study visits. The 2nd study visit will take place when the infant&#xD;
      is between the ages of 4-6 months. At this time, data on infant health will be obtained. In&#xD;
      all infants, an anticoagulated blood sample will be collected for plasma and PBMC isolation.&#xD;
      At age 15-16 months, 250 infants per year will be selected to return for a 3rd study visit.&#xD;
      The 250 infants will be randomly selected from those without prior symptomatic dengue and&#xD;
      whose study visits 2 and 3 span a significant portion of the peak DV transmission season&#xD;
      (June-October). Data on infant health will be obtained and an anticoagulated blood sample for&#xD;
      plasma will be collected. Surveillance for DV infections will occur year round and throughout&#xD;
      the entire period of an infant's study participation (ages 6 weeks-16 months). Study&#xD;
      personnel will screen infants in the study who present with acute febrile illnesses. Those&#xD;
      infants will have history and clinical data abstracted, and an acute illness blood sample&#xD;
      (serum) taken for dengue diagnostic testing. A convalescent blood sample (serum) will also be&#xD;
      taken 10-14 days later. The primary outcome measured will be the identification of DV&#xD;
      infection and the classification of disease severity. The secondary outcome measured will be&#xD;
      the estimation of peak viremia levels.&#xD;
