      This research focuses on women with breast cancer whose disease has not significantly&#xD;
      progressed, but who have 5 or more lymph nodes involved. In this study subjects will receive&#xD;
      bevacizumab, a drug which is FDA approved for colon cancer but not for breast cancer, in&#xD;
      combination with a regimen of approved chemotherapy drugs known as &quot;dose dense chemotherapy.&quot;&#xD;
      The study will observe the effectiveness and tolerability of this regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 200,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States every year.&#xD;
      A significant factor determining long-term survivability of breast cancer is whether or not&#xD;
      lymph nodes, glands which cleanse and filter the body's fluids, are involved. Despite&#xD;
      treatment with approved multiagent cytotoxic chemotherapy (&quot;dose-dense chemotherapy&quot;), women&#xD;
      with breast cancer involving more than 4 axillary lymph nodes still have a high risk for&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several dose-dense chemotherapy regimens are currently being compared in other studies,&#xD;
      however, at this time there is no proof that one regimen is superior to another. Therefore,&#xD;
      in an attempt to decrease metastases, prolong time to recurrence and improve overall&#xD;
      survival, it is essential to develop novel therapeutic strategies. The use of inhibitors of&#xD;
      angiogenesis represents a promising option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is the first angiogenesis inhibiting drug to be FDA approved, for the treatment&#xD;
      of colon cancer. It is has also been studied alone in progressed lymph-node positive breast&#xD;
      cancer and has shown moderate efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will observe the efficacy and tolerability of using bevacizumab in combination&#xD;
      with an approved dose-dense chemotherapy regimen for 8 cycles, followed by 12 of bevacizumab&#xD;
      alone. Patients may be on the study for up to 52 weeks if their disease has not progressed&#xD;
      and the regimen is tolerated.&#xD;
