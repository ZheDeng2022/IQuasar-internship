    <textblock>
      Study hypotheses were 1) Classification of the risk of sickness absence can be made with&#xD;
      questionnaires addressing self-rated health problems; 2) Occupational health intervention of&#xD;
      the employees at 'High Risk´ of sickness absence is more effective than usual care in&#xD;
      controlling sickness absence; 3) Health advice intervention of the employees at 'Increased&#xD;
      Risk´ of sickness absence is more effective than usual care in controlling sickness absence;&#xD;
      4) The interventions are cost-effective use of resources from the societal perspective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a longitudinal cohort study with two embedded randomised trials. The risk&#xD;
      of sickness absence is classified on the basis of self-administered questionnaires, on the&#xD;
      basis of a priori defined cut-off limits. Two randomised trials are performed in the&#xD;
      subgroups of 'High Risk´ and 'Increased Risk´ of sickness absence. The study is performed&#xD;
      within one corporation in Finland. All employees with permanent job and age between 18 and 60&#xD;
      years are invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The worker's own occupational nurses and physicians execute the occupational health program&#xD;
      for workers at 'High Risk´ for sickness absence. The employees in the &quot;High Risk&quot;&#xD;
      intervention group receive a personal feedback of their health survey results in a letter, in&#xD;
      which they are also invited to a consultation at the OHS. The main purpose of the&#xD;
      consultation, during which the individual findings of the health survey are available for the&#xD;
      OHS professionals, is the construction of an action plan, and if appropriate, referral to a&#xD;
      medical specialist, or psychologist. The employees in the 'High Risk´ control group receive&#xD;
      care as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention for workers at 'Increased Risk´ for sickness absence is executed as medical&#xD;
      counselling over the telephone. The employees in the 'Increased Risk´ intervention group&#xD;
      receive a personal feedback of their questionnaire results in a letter, in which they were&#xD;
      also invited to call the phone advice centre in order to receive medical advice. The&#xD;
      employees in the 'Increased Risk´ control group receive care as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickness absence data is obtained from the employer's records, the baseline covering the&#xD;
      one-year period before the intervention and the follow-up covering the one-year period after&#xD;
      the intervention. Sickness absences are obtained without medical diagnoses. The study&#xD;
      participants also fill in a health questionnaire including, among other questions, healthcare&#xD;
      utilization variables at the one-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will carry out an intention to treat analysis. We will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)&#xD;
      to analyse sickness absence outcomes at 12 months, with corresponding baseline values and&#xD;
      risk / treatment group as covariates. Economic evaluation will be performed alongside the&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial within the 'High Risk´ group.&#xD;
