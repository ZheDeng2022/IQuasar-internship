      RATIONALE: Oxycodone helps lessen pain caused by cancer and may improve quality of life. It&#xD;
      is not yet known whether oxycodone works better and is more cost effective than standard&#xD;
      therapy in treating patients with cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase IV trial is studying oxycodone to see how well it works&#xD;
      compared with standard pain therapy in treating patients with cancer pain and if it is more&#xD;
      cost effective than standard pain therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare overall pain management in patients with cancer-related pain treated with&#xD;
           oxycodone hydrochloride vs standard three-step analgesic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the health economics of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the factors that inform patients' decisions about commencing opioid analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, parallel group, pilot study.&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive an analgesic regimen, according to their level of pain, for up&#xD;
           to 18 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Step 1: Patients in mild pain receive oral acetaminophen 4 times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Step 2: Patients in mild-to-moderate pain receive oral codeine or oral&#xD;
                dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride 4 times daily and oral acetaminophen 4 times&#xD;
                daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Step 3: Patients in moderate-to-severe pain receive oral morphine or oral oxycodone&#xD;
                hydrochloride 6 times daily (every 4 hours) with or without a non-opioid analgesic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may also receive an adjuvant drug (i.e., for side effects or for primary indication&#xD;
      other than pain management that is analgesic in selected circumstances).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral oxycodone hydrochloride twice daily for up to 18 weeks.&#xD;
           Patients may receive a different opioid analgesic or analgesia or adjuvant medication as&#xD;
           in arm I, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both arms may also receive additional medication for breakthrough pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a patient-assessment booklet (PAB) daily which includes a Box-Scale (BS)-11&#xD;
      rating for average pain; questions regarding contact (e.g., telephone or visit) with&#xD;
      healthcare professionals on that day; and information regarding the number of times escape&#xD;
      medication is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life and levels of cancer pain are assessed using the short form of the Brief Pain&#xD;
      Inventory (BPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
