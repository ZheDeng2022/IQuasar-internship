      The purpose of this retrospective pilot study is to address the effect that obesity, in the&#xD;
      absence of other comorbidities, has on birth weight. We wish to determine if obesity is a&#xD;
      risk factor for small for gestational age (SGA) or intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR)&#xD;
      infants in our clinic population. There have been many studies linking maternal obesity with&#xD;
      fetal macrosomia, defined as fetal birth weight greater than 4500 grams. However, we have&#xD;
      noted that a percentage of our obese patient population has delivered either an SGA or IUGR&#xD;
      infant. SGA refers to a constitutionally small infant weighing less than the 10th percentile&#xD;
      for age. This refers to a genetically normal infant. IUGR refers to a fetus whose growth has&#xD;
      been restricted by influences other than normal genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study population will consist of all women over the age 18 who delivered a term infant&#xD;
      either by vaginal delivery or cesarean section at Tulsa Regional Medical Center between July&#xD;
      1st 2004 and December 31st 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of obesity will be based upon a Body Mass Index (weight in kilograms/height in&#xD;
      meters squared) of thirty or greater. We will look at the infant birth weight as recorded in&#xD;
      the patient's chart. We will define SGA or IUGR as birth weight less than the 10th percentile&#xD;
      for gestational age as defined previously. The control group will consist of women meeting&#xD;
      the same criteria except they will have a BMI less than thirty but greater than 19.8 as low&#xD;
      maternal weight is also a risk factor for IUGR. We will compare the average birth weight and&#xD;
      the rates of SGA/IUGR infants between the two groups and analyze using the chi-squared method&#xD;
      of analysis.&#xD;

      for age. This refers to a genetically normal infant. IUGR refers to a fetus whose growth has&#xD;
      been restricted by influences other than normal genetics. Obesity is defined as a body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) greater than 30 by the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health. This is a relevant topic in health care today as one-third of adult women fall into&#xD;
      the category of obese. As this number increases, we will be faced with the challenge to&#xD;
      provide comprehensive prenatal care to these women. Risk factors for IUGR in particular&#xD;
      include hypertension, renal disease, restrictive lung disease, diabetes, cyanotic heart&#xD;
      disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, collagen vascular disease, hemoglobinopathies, tobacco&#xD;
      and drug use, severe malnutrition, placental disease, multiple gestation, infection, genetic&#xD;
      disorders, and teratogenic exposure. The children born with this condition are at greater&#xD;
      risk for hypothermia, hypoglycemia, apneic episodes, seizures, sepsis, and neonatal death.&#xD;
      Long term problems usually develop based on the cause of the SGA or IUGR status with most&#xD;
      catching up growth-wise to other children their age. Previous studies have linked these&#xD;
      conditions to higher incidence of hypertension and cardiovascular problems. The most basic&#xD;
      screening for these conditions is the simple fundal height measurement, as the most likely&#xD;
      physical finding will be uterine size less than dates. It is questionable how accurate this&#xD;
      measurement is in the obese population as the measurement is taken over the layer of&#xD;
      abdominal fat. Obesity in the pregnant patient is linked to increased rates of hypertension,&#xD;
      preeclampsia, and gestational or preexisting diabetes. Although many studies have also linked&#xD;
      fetal macrosomia to maternal obesity, there have been studies published within the last year&#xD;
      that relate maternal obesity with SGA or IUGR infants. A Danish study looked at a cohort of&#xD;
      women who delivered singleton infants. They looked at pregnancy complications including&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia, and cesarean delivery. The study population included&#xD;
      only deliveries from 37-42 weeks gestation. Women with hypertension and preexisting diabetes&#xD;
      were included in the study population. The findings included higher risk of macrosomic&#xD;
      infants in the general study population. In a small segment of the study population, however,&#xD;
      they found increased incidence of SGA infants but not IUGR infants. This hints at a possible&#xD;
      relationship between obesity and SGA but does not control for other variables. A study out of&#xD;
      Medical University of South Carolina looked at prepregnancy weights and subsequent weight&#xD;
      gain. It was a cohort study using birth certificate information linked to the South Carolina&#xD;
      Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a system of telephone and mail survey, to&#xD;
      collect the data for this study. The results included a 1.8 times greater likelihood of an&#xD;
      obese woman delivering a very low birth weight infant (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Our study population will consist of all women&#xD;
      over the age 18 who delivered a term infant either by vaginal delivery or cesarean section at&#xD;
      Tulsa Regional Medical Center between July 1st 2004 and December 31st 2005. We choose this&#xD;
      time frame as we feel this will give an adequate sample size of approximately about 160 women&#xD;
      in the study group and about 260 in the control group, while allowing for completion of the&#xD;
      project within 12 to 18 months. Our statistician, Dr. Mark Payton, has completed a power&#xD;
      analysis for these numbers, and it is included with our submission. We will define a term&#xD;
      infant as 37 weeks gestation or greater. They must have had at least one visit at the Houston&#xD;
      Park Ob-Gyn clinic, not including the initial prenatal lab visit, before delivery. Our study&#xD;
      population will consist of mainly Medicaid patients, most of who are of lower socioeconomic&#xD;
      status. The ethnic blend of our study population will include Caucasian, African-American,&#xD;
      Hispanic, American Indian, and Asian women. Our study population will have a BMI greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 30 based on initial recorded weight and recorded height. We will exclude women&#xD;
      with multiple gestation, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, heart disease, tobacco or drug use,&#xD;
      gestational or preexisting diabetes, autoimmune disease of any form, hypertension, collagen&#xD;
      vascular disease, any disease process resulting in decreased gastrointestinal nutrient&#xD;
      absorption, or lung disease as these are conditions known to be risk factors for IUGR (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Termination Criteria N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Procedures Diagnosis The diagnosis of obesity will be based upon initial weight and&#xD;
      height recorded in the patients chart, typically during the first trimester, to derive a BMI&#xD;
      (weight in kilograms/height in meters squared). Although total weight gain during a term&#xD;
      pregnancy could add enough to the BMI to falsely indicate obesity, since we will be using the&#xD;
      initial weight recorded, this difficulty should be minimized. The cutoff for our study group&#xD;
      will be a BMI of thirty or greater as this is the definition of obesity by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization and the National Institutes of Health. We will look at the infant birth weight&#xD;
      as recorded in the patient's chart. We will define SGA or IUGR as birth weight less than the&#xD;
      10th percentile for gestational age as defined previously. The control group will consist of&#xD;
      women meeting the same criteria except they will have a BMI less than thirty but greater than&#xD;
      19.8 as low maternal weight is also a risk factor for IUGR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection The collaborating investigators and research assistants will collect only the&#xD;
      following information from the patients chart: age, height, weight at initial visit, date of&#xD;
      delivery, infant birth weight, smoking status, and any of the abovementioned comorbidities&#xD;
      that would exclude the patient from the study. No other data will be collected from any&#xD;
      patients chart. We will utilize research assistants in the collection of this data, and these&#xD;
      research assistants will be OSU medical students employed by the work study program to work&#xD;
      on this project. They will be collecting data from clinic records. They have basic human&#xD;
      research and HIPAA training and are allowed access to patient chart information as they fall&#xD;
      under the OSU community of individuals with this privilege. Analysis We will compare the&#xD;
      average birth weight and the rates of SGA/IUGR infants between the two groups. We will&#xD;
      analyze the results using chi-squared method of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality The clinic records to be reviewed will be kept in the Houston Park medical&#xD;
      records department which is either locked or under security supervision at all times. The&#xD;
      hospital records will be kept in the Tulsa Regional Medical Center health information&#xD;
      management department. This department is locked 24 hours a day. No identifying information&#xD;
      from any individual's chart will be recorded, so de-identification will occur when the data&#xD;
      is collected, and no master list of patient names or other identifying information will be&#xD;
      kept.&#xD;
