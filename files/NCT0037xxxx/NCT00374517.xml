  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a drug called pimonidazole hydrochloride shows areas of low&#xD;
      oxygen in tuberculosis (TB)-infected lungs. Pimonidazole is a &quot;low oxygen marker,&quot; an agent&#xD;
      designed to find areas in the body that are not getting enough oxygen. If it is found that TB&#xD;
      grows where oxygen is low, these results may help doctors decide what medicines would be most&#xD;
      effective for treating TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 20 years of age or older who are scheduled for lung surgery at the National Masan&#xD;
      Tuberculosis Hospital in Masan, Korea to treat their TB may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw before surgery to test for hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for women who can become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infusion of pimonidazole through a vein in the arm 24 hours before surgery. A part of&#xD;
           the patient's lung is removed during surgery. This tissue is examined under a microscope&#xD;
           for evidence of pimonidazole, which would indicate low oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collection during surgery and on the 7th and 14th days after surgery to&#xD;
           check liver function.&#xD;

      The purpose of this Phase II clinical trial is to establish whether pulmonary tuberculous&#xD;
      lesions are hypoxic or contain hypoxic microenvironments using an in vivo hypoxia-imaging&#xD;
      marker, pimonidazole hydrochloride, in subjects undergoing lung resection surgery for&#xD;
      treatment-refractory pulmonary tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be drawn from subjects undergoing treatment at the National Masan&#xD;
      Tuberculosis Hospital (NMTH), Masan, Republic of Korea. Subjects who are scheduled for&#xD;
      partial lung resection surgery for treatment refractory TB will be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Selected subjects will be those who demonstrate one or more radiographic abnormalities&#xD;
      associated with pulmonary tuberculosis (e.g., cavities, nodules, consolidation, fibrosis, or&#xD;
      calcified lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects undergoing elective pulmonary resection will receive a single preoperative IV dose&#xD;
      of pimonidazole 0.5 g/m(2) in 100 mL of normal saline, infused over 20 minutes 18 to 24 hours&#xD;
      prior to surgery. The resected tissue will be analyzed to look at the following: 1) the&#xD;
      degree of pimonidazole-adduct formation in tissue specimens with different histopathologic&#xD;
      presentations; 2) the number of acid-fast bacilli in tissue sections, smears, or cultures&#xD;
      prepared from homogenized lesions from distinct gross anatomic and histopathologic types in&#xD;
      relation to the extent of tissue hypoxia, and; 3) comparison of lesions labeling with&#xD;
      pimonidazole with the presence of human cellular and bacterial markers expected to be&#xD;
      expressed under oxygen-limiting conditions. NIAID study investigators will have no input of&#xD;
      any kind in selecting subjects for surgery, or in determining the kind or extent of surgical&#xD;
      resection. Subjects will be on study from a few days before surgery until approximately 8&#xD;
      weeks after their surgery.&#xD;
