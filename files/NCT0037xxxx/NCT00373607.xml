      In Peru, Mefloquine plus Artesunate (MAS3), is the current first line treatment for P.&#xD;
      falciparum malaria in the Amazonian Region, and has proved its efficacy against&#xD;
      multi-resistant P. falciparum parasites, but several side effects have been reported.&#xD;
      Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) is a new co-formulated and well tolerated ACT,&#xD;
      increasingly used in Southeast Asia where it has proved to be highly effective against&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria. We tested the efficacy, safety and tolerability of DHA-PPQ in&#xD;
      patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. A RCT to evaluate DHA-PPQ was carried out,&#xD;
      between 2003 and 2005. Patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were randomly&#xD;
      allocated to receive either DHA-PPQ or MAS3 with a 63-day follow-up period. Five hundred&#xD;
      twenty two patients were included in the analysis, 262 were allocated to receive DHA-PPQ, and&#xD;
      260 to receive MAS3. The two groups were comparable at baseline in demographic and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics. The mean time for parasite clearance into the DHA-PPQ group was 32.0 hours&#xD;
      and 35.5 hours in the MAS3 group. Twenty-four hours after the first dose, the proportions of&#xD;
      patients whose cleared parasitaemia were 67.2% in the DHA-PPQ group, and 58.1% in the MAS3&#xD;
      group (RR 1.25, [95% CI 1.03-1.52], p = 0.017). All patients were able to clear parasites&#xD;
      within 72 hours after the first dose. The mean time for fever clearance was 28.0 and 29.5&#xD;
      hours in DHA-PPQ and MAS3 group respectively. (P= 0.69). Twenty-four hours after the first&#xD;
      dose, 85.5% and 83.1% of patients cleared fever in the DHA-PPQ and MAS3 group respectively&#xD;
      (p&gt;0.05). The Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response (ACPR), PCR adjusted, were 97.7%&#xD;
      and 99,2% for the DHA-PPQ and MAS3 group respectively, (RR 0.99, 95% CI [0.86-1.13], P =&#xD;
      0.88). No Early Treatments Failures were reported in any group. In the DHA-PPQ group,&#xD;
      according to the PCR adjusted results, 6 subjects had Late treatment Failures. In the MAS3&#xD;
      group, two Late Treatment Failures was reported. The frequency of adverse events was&#xD;
      significantly lower in patients treated with DHA-PPQ than in those treated with MAS3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DHA-PPQ proved to be a highly effective antimalarial drug for the treatment of P. falciparum&#xD;
      malaria and suitable for use in the Peruvian Amazon region. It also has the advantage of&#xD;
      being better tolerated. In terms of cost, DHA-PPQ is cheaper and more affordable than MAS3&#xD;
      and should be considered for the National Antimalarial Drug Policy in Perú.&#xD;
