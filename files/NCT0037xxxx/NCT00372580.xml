  <brief_summary>

      Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by the formation of scaly and&#xD;
      erythematous plaques. A Th1-cell mediated process is believed to be involved in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of psoriasis. It is mainly because of the detected Th1 cytokine profile in the&#xD;
      sera and tissue. Epidemiologic studies also showed a significantly decreased incidence of&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis. According to the Th1 and Th2 dogma, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are&#xD;
      two mutually exclusive dermatoses. However, the simple dichotomy of Th1 and Th2 in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis may be overly simplistic.1. Recent genetic&#xD;
      studies suggest striking overlapping genetic loci for both psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
      In fact, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis shared more genetic similarity than atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis and asthma. 2. It is indeed, difficult to find patients with both typical atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis and psoriasis. However, asthma is not so rarely encountered in psoriasis. And&#xD;
      asthma is one of the hallmark in the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. 3. The cytokine profile&#xD;
      in long-standing atopic dermatitis shifted to a Th1 profile. A mixed Th1 and Th2 chemokine&#xD;
      profiles are present in atopic dermatitis. Scratch can result in a Th1 infiltrate in animal&#xD;
      model. 4. Patients with erythrodermic psoriasis has a higher percentage of elevated IgE&#xD;
      levels. And tissue or peripheral eosinophilia might be present. 5. Eczema is a known&#xD;
      precipitating factor of psoriasis. Areas of atopic dermatitis in childhood may serve as&#xD;
      koebernizing loci for the future development of psoriasis. And in adulthood, since the main&#xD;
      pathologic event of asthma is in the aerorespiratory tract, the presence of Th2 cytokine&#xD;
      profile does not seemingly affect the build up of a Th1 profile in the skin of psoriasis.&#xD;

      It has been suggested that psoriasis is not a homogeneous disease. It is a constellation of&#xD;
      diseases sharing similar pathologic findings. Clinical distinct entities of psoriasis include&#xD;
      pustular psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, psoriasis vulgaris, erythrodermic psoriasis, inverse&#xD;
      psoraisis, sebopsoriasis. Recent studies also showed a different cytokine profile in small&#xD;
      and large plaque psoriasis. It is also suggested that the thickness of psoriatic plaques is&#xD;
      also genetically pre-determined. In my daily practice, nummular/eczematous (or thin plaque),&#xD;
      inverse and erythrodermic psoriasis seems to be more common in the presence of an&#xD;
      asthma/atopy history. The present study was designed to find out the influence of atopic&#xD;
      diathess on the phenotypic manifestation of psoriasis. In the absence of typical atopic&#xD;
      eczema lesions in patients of psoriasis, the Th2 cytokine profile and serum IgE level as well&#xD;
      as personal and family history of atopy (i.e. asthma, allergic rhinitis, hay fever, atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis) and the presence and degree of itch will also be assayed and correlated with the&#xD;
      clinical manifestation. At least one hundred consecutive psoriatic patients with or without&#xD;
      atopic diathesis will be recruited. The definition of variants of psoriasis other than&#xD;
      psoriasis vulgaris is as follows: 1. Pustular psoriasis: lesions showing clinical pustular as&#xD;
      the main form, excluding pustular transformation secondary to treatment.2. Erythodermic&#xD;
      psoriasis: thin plaques covering more than 90% of BSA at its worst and at least 50% when seen&#xD;
      during the study3. Inverse psoriasis: psoriasis mainly over the large skin folds, including&#xD;
      the groins, breast, foreskin, interdigital (psoriasis alba) and subauricular areas. 4.&#xD;
      Sebopsoriasis: lesions mainly confined to the seborrheic areas, i.e. scalp, ears,&#xD;
      retroauricular folds, glabella, eyebrows, nasal folds, presternal and intersscapular areas.&#xD;
      Lesions confined only to the scalp will be excluded. 5. Guttate psoriasis: acute onset of&#xD;
      multiple lesions usually not wider than 1 cm6. Nummular psoriasis: discoid thin plaques&#xD;
      (PSAI: thickness mostly 1), usually 4-5 cms wide, with somewhat exudative surface sometimes&#xD;
      annular and preferentially located on the limbs. In case of uncertainty, pathology will be&#xD;
      performed to make the diagnosis before enrollment. 7. Thin plaque psoriasis: similar to&#xD;
      psoriasis vulgaris, but the thickness of individual plaques are no more than grade 2 in PASI&#xD;
      except on the elbows, knees and scalp. 8. Small plaque psoriasis: similar to guttate&#xD;
      psoriasis but the plaques are larger (1-5 cm) and has a more chronic course.9. Other&#xD;
      psoriasis: this includes figurate erythema like psoriasis, psoriasis unguium only, etc.&#xD;
