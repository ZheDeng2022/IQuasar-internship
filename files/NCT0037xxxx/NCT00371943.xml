  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both medications with beta-blockers and isosorbide-5-mononitrate and endoscopic variceal&#xD;
      ligation have been proven plausible in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. However, the&#xD;
      relative efficacy and safety of the combined treatment for preventing rebleeding remains&#xD;
      unresolved.&#xD;

      Bleeding from esophageal varices is a severe complication of portal hypertension. After&#xD;
      initial control of acute variceal bleeding, patients still carry a high risk of rebleeding.&#xD;
      Of those do rebleed, there is a 20%-35% mortality (1). Therefore, preventive procedures are&#xD;
      required in patients surviving an episode of acute variceal bleeding. In recent years,&#xD;
      endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has replaced endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) as&#xD;
      the endoscopic treatment of choice in the management of bleeding esophageal varices (2-3). On&#xD;
      the other hand, nonselective beta blockers have been well documented to be effective in&#xD;
      reducing variceal rebleeding (4-5). The addition of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISMN) has been&#xD;
      shown to be even more effective than propranolol alone in the reduction of portal pressure&#xD;
      and in the prevention of variceal rebleeding (6). Some studies showed that the combination of&#xD;
      nadolol and ISMN is more effective than EIS or EVL in the reduction of variceal rebleeding&#xD;
      (7-8). It is still unknown whether EVL combined with nadolol and ISMN is superior to nadolol&#xD;
      and ISMN in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. This study was undertaken to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness and complications of ligation plus nadolol and isosorbide mononitrate vs.&#xD;
      nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate for the prevention of variceal rebleeding.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Acute bleeding from esophageal varices (defined below);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. the etiology of portal hypertension was cirrhosis; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. age was between 20 and 75 years old. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on&#xD;
             pathology, clinical, biochemical, and sonographic or computed tomographic findings.&#xD;
             Acute esophageal variceal bleeding was defined as when blood was directly seen by&#xD;
             endoscopy to issue from an esophageal varix, or when patients presented with red color&#xD;
             signs on their esophageal varices with blood in esophagus or stomach and no other&#xD;
             potential site of bleeding identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. association with hepatocellular carcinoma or other malignancy,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. association with cerebral vascular accident, uremia, sepsis or other debilitating&#xD;
             disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. had history of gastric variceal bleeding,&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. received beta blocker within one month prior to entry,&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. had history of contraindication to the use of beta blockers, such as asthma, heart&#xD;
             failure, atrioventricular block, bradycardia (pulse rate &lt;55/min) or arterial&#xD;
             hypotension (systolic blood pressure&lt;90 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. had history of prior shunt operation, TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic&#xD;
             stent shunt), EIS or EVL,&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. deep jaundice (serum bilirubin &gt;10mg/dl),&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. encephalopathy greater than stage II,&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. failure in control of index variceal bleeding,&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. death within 24 hours of admission, or&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. refused to participate in the trial.&#xD;
