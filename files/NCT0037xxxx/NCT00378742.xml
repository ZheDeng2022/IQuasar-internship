  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect blood and DNA samples from patients with inherited eye diseases to be&#xD;
      used in research to identify genetic factors responsible for these conditions. In recent&#xD;
      years, nearly 500 genes that contribute to inherited eye diseases have been identified.&#xD;
      Disease-causing mutations are associated with many eye diseases, including glaucoma,&#xD;
      cataracts, strabismus, corneal dystrophies and a number of forms of retinal degenerations. As&#xD;
      a result, gene-based therapies are being pursued to treat eye genetic diseases that were once&#xD;
      considered untreatable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Ophthalmic Genotyping Network (eyeGENE ) is creating a national tissue&#xD;
      repository to further advance genetic research on inherited eye disease, while at the same&#xD;
      time providing clinically-useful information back to patients and physicians who request it..&#xD;
      Physicians in collaborating institutions will recruit patients to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Patients will provide a blood sample and undergo a standard eye examination. The blood sample&#xD;
      and clinical information will then be sent to the NEI for testing, processing and storing in&#xD;
      the tissue repository. Patients are given the option to receive results back and/or to be&#xD;
      re-contacted in the event of future clinical studies. Information supplied to the testing&#xD;
      laboratories includes a unique identification number, the patient gender, and the patient&#xD;
      date of birth. The stored samples will be made available to researchers along with&#xD;
      information about the patient's disease, but without patient identifiers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Molecular genetics has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      inherited eye diseases. Progress in research on inherited eye disease would be augmented by&#xD;
      the availability of patient DNA coupled to robust, anonymous phenotypic information. The&#xD;
      National Ophthalmic Genotyping and Phenotyping Network (eyeGENE(R)) has been created to&#xD;
      answer this need. By creating a national DNA and blood repository for inherited eye disease.&#xD;
      These samples have been gathered from clinical centers around the nation and will be coupled&#xD;
      to anonymous, phenotypic descriptors. If requested, a portion of the sample submitted by a&#xD;
      clinician can be used for appropriate, CLIA-certified molecular diagnostics that can be used&#xD;
      in patient care. Once a sufficient repository is created, researchers will be able to request&#xD;
      aliquots for their laboratory experiments. Participants will be provided the option to be&#xD;
      re-contacted if an approved clinical study for which they might qualify is offered.&#xD;
      Researchers can request aliquots for their laboratory experiments or ask the eyeGENE(R)&#xD;
      Coordinating Center to re-contact participants to inform them about the possibility to&#xD;
      participate in a clinical study.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To participate in this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1a. The participant must present with characteristics that meet minimal clinical criteria&#xD;
        established by eyeGENE, as determined by the referring clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        1b. The participant must be a relative of an affected participant if analysis would help&#xD;
        with the interpretation of an affected participant's test results or to obtain some useful&#xD;
        information as decided by the eyeGENE Research Study Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The participant must be willing and able to provide a suitable blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe systemic disease that compromise the ability of the referring clinician to&#xD;
             obtain an adequate eye examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any disease or condition that makes it unsafe for a subject to provide a blood sample&#xD;
             of at least 5 ml for children and at least 15ml for adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to cooperate with phlebotomy and clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with impaired decision-making capability who do not have a legally-authorized&#xD;
             representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If clinical criteria information, consent forms, or a blood sample can not be provided&#xD;
             by the doctor or participant after one year of submitting a blood sample to eyeGENE .&#xD;
