  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (anemia due to&#xD;
      destruction of red blood cells by abnormal antibodies). Almost all patients also suffer from&#xD;
      cold-induced disturbances of blood circulation. The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of combination therapy with rituximab (an antibody against B lymphocytes)&#xD;
      and fludarabine (a cytotoxic drug) for CAD. Another aim is to try to assess whether these&#xD;
      agents in combination are better than single agent therapy with rituximab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is mediated by monoclonal cold-reactive autoantibodies&#xD;
      that bind to erythrocyte surface antigens, causing haemagglutination and complement-mediated&#xD;
      haemolysis. Anaemia is severe (Hb 8.0 g/dL or lower) in one-third of patients and&#xD;
      complement-induced exacerbation during febrile illness occurs frequently 1-3. Cold-induced&#xD;
      circulatory symptoms are present in more than 90% of patients and may be disabling 1. CAD not&#xD;
      associated with overt lymphoma or other disease has traditionally been classified as primary&#xD;
      or idiopathic. However, a lymphoproliferative bone marrow disorder can be demonstrated by&#xD;
      flow cytometry in 90% and by histology in approximately 75% of these patients, characterized&#xD;
      by clonal proliferation of CD20+,κ+ B-cells 1,4,5. The histological features are those of&#xD;
      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in about 50% of the patients 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many standard therapies used in other autoimmune diseases or indolent lymphomas are&#xD;
      inefficient, e.g. corticosteroids, alkylating agents, interferon-α and, probably, purine&#xD;
      analogue single agent therapy 1,6-8. Treatment with the chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20&#xD;
      antibody rituximab has been shown in prospective studies to induce remission in more than&#xD;
      half of patients 9,10. Almost all responses were partial, however, and the median response&#xD;
      duration was less than one year. Further studies are warranted, therefore, in order to&#xD;
      explore the possibilities for increasing the response rate and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purine analogues, cladribine and fludarabine, are not cyclus dependent, and they have&#xD;
      yielded partial response rates of 30-75% and complete response rates of 3-10% in&#xD;
      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma 11,12. Although probably clinically inefficient as monotherapy in&#xD;
      most CAD patients, clinical effect of fludarabine has been reported in a single case 13, and&#xD;
      cladribine has been shown to induce tumour reduction even in this condition 8. In&#xD;
      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, purine analogue and rituximab combination therapy has resulted in&#xD;
      higher response rates and more prolonged remissions as compared to purine analogue single&#xD;
      agent therapy 12. The combination has produced favourable results in some patients with the&#xD;
      related condition cryoglobulinaemia type I 14. Fludarabine has induced autoimmune haemolytic&#xD;
      anaemia in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but such events have not been&#xD;
      reported in CAD patients 13,15. Moreover, there are reasons to assume that rituximab therapy&#xD;
      will further reduce the risk of this adverse effect of fludarabine 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study is a prospective, non-randomized multicentre study in order to investigate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of rituximab and fludarabine combination therapy in patients with&#xD;
      CAD. The protocol has approved by the Regional Medical Research Ethics Committee of Southern&#xD;
      Norway, Norwegian Medicines Agency (EudraCT nr: 2004-002936-25), and Norwegian Social Science&#xD;
      Data Services (Privacy Issue Unit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major study objective is to assess efficacy of rituximab and fludarabine in combination&#xD;
      for patients with CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to assess safety of rituximab and fludarabine in combination for&#xD;
      patients with CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third objective is to try to assess whether rituximab and fludarabine in combination are&#xD;
      superior to rituximab monotherapy comparing patients who have received both therapies for&#xD;
      CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Remarks:See protocol text.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Bone marrow examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centres outside Norway should follow the guidelines listed below. Norwegian centres should&#xD;
      refer to the Norwegian protocol version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.) Morphologic assessment of bone marrow aspirate is performed according to the routines of&#xD;
      the participating centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.) A bone marrow trephine biopsy should be obtained according to the routines of the&#xD;
      department. Morphological and immunohistochemical assessments are to be done at a university&#xD;
      pathology laboratory by an experienced haematopathologist. If possible, a fresh biopsy&#xD;
      specimen should be preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.) Flow-cytometric immunophenotyping of bone marrow aspirate should be done at a&#xD;
      university hospital laboratory. Cells should be washed at 37oC in order to remove cold&#xD;
      agglutinins, using the previously published procedure 5 (Appendix 1) or an equally&#xD;
      satisfactory method. The antibody panel should comprise CD19, CD20, CD5, kappa, lambda and&#xD;
      preferably also IgM and IgG. The kappa/lambda ratio should be calculated. CD20 expression is&#xD;
      registered semi-quantitatively as 0, + or ++.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.) If possible, 5 ml bone marrow aspirate should be frozen at -70oC for the purpose of&#xD;
      later DNA-based examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Treatment schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: Rituximab; 375 mg/m2 Day 1-5: Fludarabine orally; 40 mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 28: Rituximab; 375 mg/m2 Day 28-33: Fludarabine orally; 40 mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 56: Rituximab; 375 mg/m2 Day 56-60: Fludarabine orally; 40 mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 84: Rituximab; 375 mg/m2 Day 84-88: Fludarabine orally; 40 mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Administration and precautions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration and monitoring of rituximab and fludarabine therapy should be in accordance&#xD;
      with the manufacturers' recommendations, the official regulations that apply in the&#xD;
      participating country, and the routine procedures of the participating unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Dose adjustments&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.1 Haematological toxicity If ANC&lt;1,0x109/L and/or platelets&lt;75x109/L at day 1 of any&#xD;
      cycle treatment should be delayed for up to 2 weeks and fludarabine dose should be reduced to&#xD;
      30 mg/m2 in the remaining cycles. Myelosuppression of the same degree in the subsequent&#xD;
      cycles should result in a reduction of the fludarabine dose to 20 mg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjustments of the rituximab dose should not be done due to myelosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.2 Renal insufficiency In patients with a creatinine clearance between 30-60 ml/min the&#xD;
      fludarabine dose should be reduced to 20 mg/m2. Patients with a creatinine clearance below 30&#xD;
      ml/min are not eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Follow-up during treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters listed below must be recorded before each therapy cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical condition, possible adverse effects, need for transfusion, Hb, reticulocytes count,&#xD;
      WBC including differential count, platelet count, CRP, LDH, ASAT, ALAT, alkaline phosphatase,&#xD;
      urea, creatinine, bilirubin and haptoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse effects of fludarabine are registered in CRF 2 (Appendix 3). Any adverse effects&#xD;
      of rituximab are registered in CRF 3 (Appendix 4). In case of death or other serious events,&#xD;
      these should be reported without delay to S. Berentsen or G. Tjønnfjord as well as the&#xD;
      relevant national authorities according to regulations that apply in the participating&#xD;
      country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Follow-up after treatment (first six months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.) The following measurements must be done monthly during the first six months after the&#xD;
      last cycle of therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.) All measurements listed in Paragraph 5.1. II.) Quantification of immunoglobulin classes.&#xD;
      In case of reduction of a previously elevated IgM level to the normal range, serum&#xD;
      electrophoresis with immunofixation should be performed at the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.) Number of blood transfusions after the previous registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.) At the first visit after cessation of therapy, a new bone marrow biopsy is performed in&#xD;
      those patients where histological or immunohistochemical signs of a lymphoproliferative&#xD;
      disorder were present at baseline. If a lymphoproliferative bone marrow involvement could be&#xD;
      detected at baseline by flow cytometry only, flow-cytometric immunophenotyping is also&#xD;
      repeated at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.) Bone marrow examinations should also be repeated four months after the last therapy cycle&#xD;
      if the examinations three months before showed signs of lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Long-term follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      When more than six months have passed since cessation of treatment, patients should be&#xD;
      followed every third month for three years or until they need treatment again.&#xD;
