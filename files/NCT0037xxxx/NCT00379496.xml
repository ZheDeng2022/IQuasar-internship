      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of acupuncture as a treatment for this&#xD;
      condition. Fifty-eight women diagnosed with fibromyalgia were randomly allocated to two&#xD;
      groups. One group received acupuncture (n=34) twice a week for 20 sessions in addition to&#xD;
      tricyclic antidepressants and exercises. The control group (n=24) received only tricyclic&#xD;
      antidepressants and exercises. A blinded assessor evaluated patients' pain using visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS), tender points number (TePsN) and myalgic index (MI). The same assessor&#xD;
      also evaluated quality of life (QoL) using SF-36. These evaluations were done prior to&#xD;
      treatments, at the end of the 20 sessions, and again at six months, one year and two years&#xD;
      after the first evaluation. At the end of the 20 sessions, patients who had received&#xD;
      acupuncture were significantly better than those who had not in all measures of pain (VAS,&#xD;
      TePsN, MI) and in five subscales of SF-36. After six months, the acupuncture group was&#xD;
      significantly better than the control group in some measures of pain (TePsN and MI) and in&#xD;
      three subscales of SF-36. After one year, the acupuncture group showed significant advantage&#xD;
      in only one subscale of SF-36; at two years there were no significant differences between the&#xD;
      two groups on all outcome measures. The addition of acupuncture to usual treatment for&#xD;
      fibromyalgia is beneficial for pain and quality of life, but only in first six months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a diffuse musculoskeletal pain syndrome with multiple tender points which are&#xD;
      widely and symmetrically distributed throughout the body. The main symptom is widespread&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain, lasting longer than three months, which is associated with chronic&#xD;
      fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disorder, morning stiffness, anxiety and depression.&#xD;
      The etiology of fibromyalgia remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Brazil, fibromyalgia is estimated to affect two-and-half percent of the population . This&#xD;
      incidence is similar to other countries .Acupuncture, which involves inserting needles at&#xD;
      specific points on the patient's skin, is one of the oldest forms of therapy and is widely&#xD;
      practiced in the United States. Each year about one million Americans undergo acupuncture&#xD;
      treatments, mainly to relieve pain caused by a variety of ailments . A consensus statement&#xD;
      from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that acupuncture may be useful as&#xD;
      an adjunct treatment or may be an acceptable alternative treatment in a comprehensive&#xD;
      management program for fibromyalgia patients (NIH Consensus Conference, 1998.In Brazil, there&#xD;
      is increased interest in acupuncture; in 1995, a federal law established that the procedure&#xD;
      can only be performed by physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic reviews looking at the effectiveness of acupuncture for fibromyalgia have found a&#xD;
      limited amount of high quality scientific studies. These reviews concluded that acupuncture&#xD;
      was more effective than sham (placebo) acupuncture in improving symptoms of fibromyalgia.&#xD;
      There is a need for acupuncture trials that include a large sample size of patients with&#xD;
      similar and well-defined pain conditions. Such trials should utilize standardized and&#xD;
      well-described acupuncture stimuli. These should be placed effectively in the skin in&#xD;
      accordance with classical Chinese experience and utilizing unequivocal primary outcome&#xD;
      measures for the effect.&#xD;
