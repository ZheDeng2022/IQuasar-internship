      This study will evaluate patients with sarcoidosis to understand how the disease affects the&#xD;
      body. Sarcoidosis is a disease that results from inflammation of body tissues. The lungs,&#xD;
      lymph nodes in the chest, skin and eyes are most commonly affected. As the disease&#xD;
      progresses, small lumps, or granulomas, appear in the affected tissues. In most cases, the&#xD;
      granulomas clear up, but in cases where they do not heal and disappear, the tissues tend to&#xD;
      remain inflamed. Eye inflammation (uveitis) associated with sarcoidosis can cause various eye&#xD;
      diseases, sometimes leading to blindness. This study will examine the clinical, immunological&#xD;
      and genetic features of ocular sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 6 years of age and older with sarcoidosis may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      are screened with the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of a questionnaire with medical, social and demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete eye examination, including measurement of eye pressure and dilation of the&#xD;
           pupils to examine the back of the eye. Fluorescein angiography may be done. This test&#xD;
           involves injecting a dye into a vein in the arm. The dye travels to the blood vessels in&#xD;
           the eyes. A camera flashes a blue light into the eye and takes pictures of the retina&#xD;
           that show whether the dye has leaked from the blood vessels into the retina. Other&#xD;
           photographs of the eye may also be taken using a special camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are followed in conjunction with their local eye doctor as required by the&#xD;
      status of their disease. Patients whose disease is stable are seen for an initial examination&#xD;
      and followed every 12 months for 3 years.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcoidosis is a multi-systemic granulomatous disease. The lungs, thoracic lymph nodes, the&#xD;
      skin and the eyes are the most commonly affected organs. Most patients with sarcoidosis&#xD;
      present with respiratory symptoms. Sarcoid uveitis is usually suspected when ocular&#xD;
      inflammation is found in conjunction with suggestive serological and radiological studies.&#xD;
      Currently, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis requires the demonstration of non-caseating&#xD;
      granulomas on biopsy; but even this is not always diagnostic; more sensitive and specific&#xD;
      noninvasive tools are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ophthalmic involvement has been reported in as many as 40% of patients with sarcoidosis, but&#xD;
      most series report ophthalmic findings in approximately 25% of patients who develop chronic,&#xD;
      systemic sarcoidosis. Uveitis associated with sarcoidosis can be very diverse, including:&#xD;
      acute non-granulomatous or chronic granulomatous iridocyclitis, vitritis, retinal vasculitis,&#xD;
      choroiditis with choroidal granulomas and papillitis secondary to optic nerve granulomas; and&#xD;
      it can cause ocular morbidity due to a high incidence of glaucoma and cataracts. Other&#xD;
      ophthalmic findings include lacrimal gland enlargement, secondary Sjogren's disease,&#xD;
      scleritis, orbital gland involvement, secondary proliferative retinopathy, subretinal&#xD;
      neovascularization, and optic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better evaluate and diagnose patients, we also need to improve our ability to predict&#xD;
      susceptibility and prognosis, especially among African-Americans. Current epidemiologic&#xD;
      studies of sarcoidosis indicate that in the United States, African Americans have about a&#xD;
      threefold higher age-adjusted annual incidence, 35.5/100,000, compared with Caucasians,&#xD;
      10.9/100,000. In addition, African Americans with chronic sarcoidosis are more likely to&#xD;
      develop ocular manifestations than whites. The study of ocular sarcoidosis is important&#xD;
      because it is a leading inflammatory cause of blindness and ocular morbidity. In large&#xD;
      surveys of patients with uveitis, approximately 5% of patients were found to have ocular&#xD;
      sarcoidosis, and approximately 10% of these patients become blind in at least one eye.&#xD;

      AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: CLINICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical features of sarcoidosis associated uveitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Chronological association of ocular disease to histopathologic diagnosis of sarcoidos&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Family history of sarcoidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Previous therapies and response&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ocular status compared with systemic disease status, current and historical&#xD;
           Environmental exposure history&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: IMMUNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the goals of this study is to determine the diagnostically important cytokines in&#xD;
      biopsy-proven ocular sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemokine profile of the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and Broncho-Alveolar Lavage&#xD;
      Fluid (BALF) of pulmonary sarcoidosis patients has been reported and many cytokines have been&#xD;
      implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serum Level for&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. TNF alpha&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. MIP-1 alpha&#xD;
&#xD;
           C. IL-8&#xD;
&#xD;
           D. IL-2&#xD;
&#xD;
           E. TGF Beta&#xD;
&#xD;
           F. INF gamma&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immunophenotyping of whole blood cells and BALF by flow cytometry&#xD;
&#xD;
           Focus on:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. T cell sub-typing (examples: CD4, CD8)&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. NK cell sub-typing (examples:CD56, KIR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. TLRs sub-typing&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: GENETIC ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum analysis for HLA Class I and II typing&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of 100 patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis will be recruited from the Uveitis&#xD;
      and Ocular Immunology Clinic at the National Eye Institute and the Pulmonary Clinic at the&#xD;
      National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FUTURE AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to characterize the TLR activation profile in patients with ocular sarcoidosis, and&#xD;
      compare them to patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis and normal volunteers. Using this&#xD;
      immuno-genetic classification scheme, in conjunction with HLA typing, we hope to develop&#xD;
      novel diagnostic and/or prognostic criteria for sarcoidosis. In addition, the TLR activation&#xD;
      profile may allow risk stratification for different sarcoidosis phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of 100 patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis will be recruited from the Uveitis&#xD;
      and Ocular Immunology Clinic at the National Eye Institute and the Pulmonary Clinic at the&#xD;
      National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. After obtaining informed consent, the patients will&#xD;
      be invited to participate in the study. After appropriate enrollment, they will undergo the&#xD;
      following&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Completion of a questionnaire, with medical, social and demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A complete ophthalmologic examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline serologic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Baseline serum analysis for immunologic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. HLA-Typing&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients who are quiescent will be seen at baseline with a second visit at 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients who are active will be treated appropriately, by their referring&#xD;
           ophthalmologist or on a treatment protocol at the National Eye Institute&#xD;
