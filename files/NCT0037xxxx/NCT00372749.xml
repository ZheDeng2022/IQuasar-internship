      To evaluate the effect of the threat of an aversive reaction on the response during alcohol&#xD;
      cue exposure in alcohol dependent patients : (1) the subjective response (craving) and (2)&#xD;
      the physiological response (heart rate and blood pressure).&#xD;

      The efficacy of disulfiram in relapse prevention is controversial. Not only are most of the&#xD;
      studies dated but their methodological rigor is generally poor. The major obstacle to&#xD;
      disulfiram's effectiveness is non-compliance. No study to date has directly explored whether&#xD;
      the threat of a disulfiram ethanol reaction (DER), provoked by the ingestion of disulfiram,&#xD;
      has an effect on craving. Alcohol dependent patients have difficulty tolerating craving, a&#xD;
      phenomenon that is believed to increase the probability of relapse. We propose in this study&#xD;
      an evaluation of alcohol craving in relation to the threat of a DER compared to no threat. In&#xD;
      both of these experimental conditions, we will use a placebo in order to avoid confounding&#xD;
      the pharmacological effect of disulfiram with the psychological effect of the threat. Craving&#xD;
      will be evaluated in the context of the multidimensional model of ambivalence (BREINER,&#xD;
      STRITZKE and Lang, 1999) which provides two independent dimensions, craving and aversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of the threat of an aversive reaction on the response during alcohol&#xD;
      cue exposure in alcohol dependent patients : (1) the subjective response (craving) and (2)&#xD;
      the physiological response (heart rate and blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the correlation between the subjective and physiological responses to&#xD;
           alcohol cue exposure in relation to the threat of an aversive reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the moderating effects of mood and personality on alcohol cue exposure in&#xD;
           relation to the threat of an aversive reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of this study is a within-subject, single-blind, randomized, and monocentric. The&#xD;
      participants will be exposed to their habitual alcoholic drink. They will receive a placebo&#xD;
      with two types of randomized inductions : (1) the threat of an aversive reaction and (2) no&#xD;
      threat. The initial inclusion visit will take place a minimum of six days after the patients&#xD;
      consumed their last alcohol beverage, the first cue exposure will take place one to seven&#xD;
      days after the inclusion visit, and the second cue exposure will take place four to eight&#xD;
      days after the first. This study directly benefits the patient because the experience of cue&#xD;
      exposure provokes habituation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demonstration of an effect of the threat of an aversive reaction on craving may help&#xD;
      alcohol dependent patients to better accept treatment using disulfiram as they would view it&#xD;
      as alleviating craving instead of strictly as a punitive measure in the event of alcohol&#xD;
      intake.&#xD;
