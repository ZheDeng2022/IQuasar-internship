  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) is a disorder characterized by the production&#xD;
      of antibodies against platelets, resulting in enhanced destruction of platelets. Most&#xD;
      children with ITP present with low platelet counts (PC) but minimal bleeding. Very rarely a&#xD;
      child may present with a severe life-threatening bleed, such as a bleed in the head. In this&#xD;
      case it is very important that the PC be raised as quickly as possible. The combination of&#xD;
      corticosteroids and intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) is commonly used in the management of&#xD;
      such severe bleeding in children with ITP to quickly raise the PC and yet this treatment&#xD;
      combination has not been tested against using IVIG alone. If it is shown that the combination&#xD;
      of these agents does result in a quicker rise in PC then when using IVIG alone would support&#xD;
      the use of this combination therapy in emergency situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As we can not ethically conduct this study in patients with life-threatening bleeds, we plan&#xD;
      to study patients with ITP and PC less than 20 X 109/L, but without life threatening&#xD;
      bleeding. Eligible patients will be randomized to one of these 2 regimens (IVIG + placebo or&#xD;
      IVIG + IV corticosteroids). The study is designed as a double-blind trial, where the patient&#xD;
      or the treating physician will not be aware of the regimen that a patient is randomized to.&#xD;
      PC's will be measured as a surrogate measure of bleeding risk; bleeding scores (a score&#xD;
      generated by observing patients for bleeding symptoms) will be used to grade bleeding&#xD;
      severity, and adverse effects to treatment will be monitored by the means of questionnaires&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rarely children with immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) can present with severe or&#xD;
      life-threatening bleeding. In these cases it is very important that the platelet count be&#xD;
      raised as quickly as possible. Several studies have shown that IVIG and corticosteroids on&#xD;
      their own can raise platelet counts, but few studies have examined how the combination of&#xD;
      IVIG and corticosteroids compares to IVIG alone in raising platelet counts in childhood ITP.&#xD;
      Yet despite the lack of conclusive evidence to indicate that steroids given together with&#xD;
      IVIG is more effective, this combination treatment is often given when children present with&#xD;
      a life-threatening bleed, e.g. intracranial bleed. In addition to presumed greater&#xD;
      effectiveness of giving the two agents together there is also evidence to show that the&#xD;
      combination of IVIG with steroids may have other beneficial effects, in addition to greater&#xD;
      effectiveness at raising platelet counts. This can include reducing side effects of IVIG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to compare the effectiveness of the combination of IVIG with corticosteroids to&#xD;
      IVIG alone in raising platelet counts in children with ITP and a platelet count less than 20&#xD;
      x 109/L. Patient will be eligible only if they in conjunction with their treating physician&#xD;
      have decided to be treated with IVIG. In this way they will require an intravenous regardless&#xD;
      of study participation. The primary outcome is the rise in platelet count as reflected by the&#xD;
      platelet count at 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVMP and IVIG, administered together, will&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. increase the PC faster, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. minimize the adverse effects of IVIG, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. lead to a more sustained increase in PC (longer time before needing retreatment) If it&#xD;
           is shown that the combination of these agents does result in a quicker rise in PC, this&#xD;
           would support and justify the use of the combination therapy in emergency situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Proposal and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to prospectively evaluate 2 treatment regimens in patients with childhood ITP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen A: Placebo followed by IVIG 1 g/kg (Gamunex® Immune Globulin Intravenous [Human],&#xD;
      10%; Bayer)* x 1 dose Regimen B: Combination therapy (IV MP (Solu-Medrol®, Upjohn) 30 mg/kg&#xD;
      (max. 1 g) over 30 min followed by IVIG 1 g/kg (Gamunex® Immune Globulin Intravenous [Human],&#xD;
      10%; Bayer)* x 1 dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Gamunex will be given according to manufacturer's guidelines. Gamunex has been demonstrated&#xD;
      to be safely and effectively administered by means of a rapid infusion protocol whereby it&#xD;
      can be given over a period of 2 hours (although in some cases it needs to be given at a&#xD;
      slower rate over a longer period of time).&#xD;
