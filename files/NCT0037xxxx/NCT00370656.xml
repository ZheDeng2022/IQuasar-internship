  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of pregabalin, duloxetine and&#xD;
      amitriptyline compared with placebo in reducing pain in diabetic patients as assessed by&#xD;
      Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is understood concerning the interaction of pain with sleep. Pain may disrupt sleep&#xD;
      leading to daytime sleepiness and poor sleep can increase the perception of pain. There is&#xD;
      uncertainty concerning the most effective way in which medication could be used to ease pain&#xD;
      and poor sleep in patients such as those with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Various drugs&#xD;
      have been tried or proposed, and these include amitriptyline, pregabalin and duloxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amitriptyline is believed to relieve pain and improve sleep, though there is little evidence&#xD;
      of its beneficial effects on sleep. Furthermore, even at low doses, it affects reaction time,&#xD;
      attention, memory, information processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In two studies with duloxetine, it has been shown to significantly reduce pain compared with&#xD;
      placebo, although little data are available on the usefulness of this compound in the&#xD;
      management of pain with poor sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregabalin has been shown to be effective in reducing pain, and therefore improving sleep. It&#xD;
      has also been demonstrated that it has limited potential to affect daytime cognition. In&#xD;
      another study gabapentin (a compound structurally related to pregabalin) demonstrated&#xD;
      superior efficacy in the management of pain compared to amitriptyline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this study will assess the effectiveness of pregabalin, duloxetine and&#xD;
      amitriptyline compared with placebo in reducing pain associated with diabetes and poor sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the incidence of diabetes is predicted to increase in future years and as a consequence so&#xD;
      will the cases of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), this research will serve to provide&#xD;
      essential information on sleep and DPN which will be beneficial now and in the future.&#xD;
