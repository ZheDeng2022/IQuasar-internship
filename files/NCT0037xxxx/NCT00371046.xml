    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the use of both sonographic&#xD;
      cervical length (CL) and fetal fibronectin (FFN) on the length of outpatient triage and&#xD;
      preterm labor interventions in symptomatic women with intact membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We performed a randomized trial of the use of transvaginal ultrasound cervical length and&#xD;
      fetal fibronectin in women being evaluated for suspected PTL at a gestational age between 24&#xD;
      and 33 weeks 6 days. Women are randomized to either a standard (blinded) or a protocol arm.&#xD;
      Women in the standard arm are evaluated without the results of the CL and FFN while women in&#xD;
      the protocol arm are evaluated using the results of the CL and FFN and managing physicians&#xD;
      are asked to follow a specific PTL algorithm to determine a women's eligibility for&#xD;
      treatment. The primary outcome is length of stay in the triage area before discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of preterm labor (PTL) represent a&#xD;
      clinical challenge. Many studies have shown that over 70% of women evaluated for PTL do not&#xD;
      deliver within 7 days and almost 40% of women, whether they are treated or not, deliver at&#xD;
      term. On the other hand, about 20% of women who are not thought to be in PTL will deliver&#xD;
      preterm. Women who are diagnosed with PTL are exposed to a variety of evidenced and&#xD;
      non-evidenced based interventions including hospital admission, tocolysis, antenatal&#xD;
      steroids, maternal transfer and bedrest. These interventions are associated with both&#xD;
      maternal risks and increased health care costs and often have harmful social, financial and&#xD;
      psychological effects on the mother as well her family. Therefore, methods to accurately&#xD;
      evaluate the risks of preterm delivery in symptomatic women would help to identify those who&#xD;
      would most benefit from standard clinical interventions and help reduce their use in those&#xD;
      women who would not deliver preterm. A number of retrospective and cohort studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that the use of fetal fibronectin (FFN) and transvaginal sonographic cervical&#xD;
      length (TVU CL) improves prediction over standard digital exams, and that the combination of&#xD;
      the two adds prognostic information in women admitted for PTL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the use of both sonographic&#xD;
      cervical length and fetal fibronectin on the length of outpatient triage and preterm labor&#xD;
      interventions in symptomatic women with intact membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a randomized trial of the use of transvaginal ultrasound cervical length&#xD;
      and fetal fibronectin in women being evaluated for suspected PTL on labor and delivery at the&#xD;
      Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia between November 2004 and April 2006. The&#xD;
      study was approved by the Internal Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gestational age was assigned by last menstrual period and first or early second trimester&#xD;
      ultrasound. If the last menstrual period was unknown or there was a discrepancy regarding the&#xD;
      dates, the ultrasound dating was used. Eligible women who agreed to participate in the study&#xD;
      were randomized to either a standard or a protocol arm. At the time this study was initiated&#xD;
      neither FFN nor CL were routinely used in the management of symptomatic women presenting to&#xD;
      L&amp;D to be evaluated for PTL. Women in the standard arm were evaluated without the results of&#xD;
      the CL and FFN while women in the protocol arm were evaluated using the of the CL and FFN and&#xD;
      managing physicians were asked to follow a specific PTL algorithm to determine a women's&#xD;
      eligibility for treatment. Physicians were encouraged to manage protocol patients according&#xD;
      to the study recommended protocol for the use of FFN and CL, which was reviewed with them for&#xD;
      each patient on labor and delivery by a study investigator. Once eligible for treatment, the&#xD;
      management of PTL was then left to the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions and study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before randomization all patients being evaluated for preterm labor were monitored in the&#xD;
      triage area and uterine activity and fetal heart rate evaluated. A speculum exam was&#xD;
      performed to rule out ruptured membranes and to obtain a specimen for fetal fibronectin.&#xD;
      Specimens for fetal fibronectin were obtained with a Dacron swab from the posterior vaginal&#xD;
      fornix and placed in buffer which then held on labor and delivery until the patient was&#xD;
      either randomized, determined to be ineligible or declined to participate in the study. After&#xD;
      randomization the specimen was immediately analyzed in our in house laboratory. Samples were&#xD;
      delivered to the laboratory within 1 hour of obtaining the sample and results were available&#xD;
      within 1 hour. Samples containing 50 ng or more per milliliter were designated as positive.&#xD;
      The FFN was delayed for 24-36 hours as needed if the patient had intercourse, a pelvic exam&#xD;
      or a transvaginal ultrasound within 24 hours. A digital exam was then performed to determine&#xD;
      dilatation and effacement of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the fibronectin analysis were labeled by one of the study investigators after&#xD;
      randomization so that only results from non-blinded specimens would be available to the&#xD;
      managing physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was performed by means of computer generated random blocks of numbered sealed&#xD;
      opaque envelops which were stratified in two groups based on gestational age &lt; 28 weeks and â‰¥&#xD;
      28 weeks. Each envelope was opened sequentially within each strata by one of the study&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization, transvaginal ultrasound assessment of the cervix was performed.&#xD;
      Measurements were obtained using a 5-7.5 Mhz transvaginal probe placed in the anterior fornix&#xD;
      after emptying the bladder. The transducer was oriented to obtain a sagittal view of the&#xD;
      cervix, with the long axis view of the echogenic endocervical mucosa along the length of the&#xD;
      canal. The probe was withdrawn slightly until the image was blurred, and enough pressure then&#xD;
      reapplied to restore the image. CL was measured from the internal to the external os along&#xD;
      the endocervical canal. At least three measurements were recorded over 5 minutes and the&#xD;
      shortest best measurement in millimeters was used for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a two-sided t-test with alpha of 0.05, we calculated that a sample size of 45 patients&#xD;
      in each group would have an 80% power to detect a 1 hour (33%) in the mean time on labor &amp;&#xD;
      delivery (from 3.0 hrs to 2.0 hrs, assuming a standard deviation of 1.0). These assumptions&#xD;
      were based on a survey taken from the Labor and Delivery triage database for the 6 months&#xD;
      prior to the study.&#xD;
