  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares two blood thinners which are both accepted standard cares, fondaparinux&#xD;
      and unfractionated heparin (UFH). These drugs are used to prevent the growth of existing&#xD;
      blood clots and formation of additional blood clots in patients with pulmonary embolism (a&#xD;
      blood clot in the lung) as they are beginning to take warfarin (another standard care blood&#xD;
      thinner). Patients will be invited to participate because they have been diagnosed with a&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism, require anticoagulation therapy (treatment with a blood thinner), and are&#xD;
      currently hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients treated with fondaparinux will have&#xD;
      shorter hospital stays and lower costs of treatment while in the hospital than similar&#xD;
      patients receiving a different standard care with UFH. Fondaparinux is already approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for use in patients with pulmonary embolism, for both inpatient and outpatient care,&#xD;
      as long as treatment is begun with warfarin while they are hospitalized. It is therefore not&#xD;
      an experimental treatment. The study is being conducted to determine which FDA approved&#xD;
      treatment is the best practice for hospital treatment of pulmonary embolism. The study will&#xD;
      also examine the safety and effectiveness of fondaparinux in local use.&#xD;

      Research Question&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted to determine if treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) with&#xD;
      fondaparinux will decrease the length of stay and hospital costs of therapy while maintaining&#xD;
      safety and efficacy, when compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH). Primary research&#xD;
      questions: Determine if PE treatment utilizing fondaparinux will reduce the inpatient length&#xD;
      of stay (LOS) and costs of hospital care to St. Mary's Duluth Clinic Health System (SMDC),&#xD;
      when compared to a matched group of patients treated with UFH as standard care, during the&#xD;
      same time period. Secondary research questions: Determine if bleeding and recurrent&#xD;
      thrombosis rates are similar between the fondaparinux cohort and the UFH matched control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enroll 30 St. Mary's Medical Center (SMMC, an affiliate of SMDC) patients into the&#xD;
           treatment cohort, utilizing fondaparinux as their primary immediate antithrombin&#xD;
           therapy, while warfarin is being titrated to therapeutic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Retrospectively identify a matched control group of 30 PE patients, treated with UFH as&#xD;
           standard care, during the same period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the LOS and costs of inpatient care on a standardized scale for both the&#xD;
           treatment cohort and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perform a retrospective review of patients' medical records for the 3 months after the&#xD;
           initial pulmonary embolism, to determine the rates of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4a. repeat venous thromboembolism events (VTE) 4b. bleeding events&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients 18 years of age or older who present with acute symptomatic pulmonary&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Diagnostic confirmation based on the following criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. intraluminal filling defect on spiral computed tomography (CT) or pulmonary&#xD;
                  angiography&#xD;
