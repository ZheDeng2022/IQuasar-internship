  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate in patients that oral rabeprazole produces&#xD;
      equivalent acid suppression to intravenous pantoprazole on Day 1 of drug administration.&#xD;

      Following screening to determine eligibility (normal medical history, physical examination&#xD;
      including vital signs, laboratory findings, negative test for active H. pylori infection, and&#xD;
      a negative pregnancy test if applicable) and subsequent enrolment, patients will have a&#xD;
      baseline 24-hour intragastric pH recording. Patients will receive either oral rabeprazole&#xD;
      20mg or intravenous pantoprazole 40mg daily for 3 consecutive days. For blinding purposes,&#xD;
      patients will also receive either a placebo oral tablet or placebo intravenous solution&#xD;
      (&quot;double-dummy&quot; design). A 24-hour intragastric pH recording will be completed on Day 1 and&#xD;
      Day 3 of the drug administration period. This will be followed by a 14-day washout period&#xD;
      before the second 3-day drug administration period during which the patient will receive the&#xD;
      crossover drug regimen, and will again have 24-hour intragastric pH recordings completed on&#xD;
      the first and third days of this second drug administration period.Thirty-seven patients with&#xD;
      a negative test for active H. pylori infection test will be randomised into the study. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis is that oral rabeprazole produces equivalent acid suppression to&#xD;
      intravenous pantoprazole as indicated by the time during which intragastric pH is greater&#xD;
      than 4 on Day 1 of drug administration. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of&#xD;
      the 2 treatment groups and will first receive either oral rabeprazole 20mg plus placebo&#xD;
      intravenous solution or intravenous pantoprazole 40mg plus a placebo oral tablet daily for 3&#xD;
      consecutive days. After a 14-day washout, patients will receive the crossover drug regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rabeprazole: supplied as 20mg tablets (and matching placebo tablets). Pantoprazole: supplied&#xD;
      as 12-mL vials of lyophilized powder containing pantoprazole 40mg (pantoprazole&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients must be postmenopausal (for at least 1 year), sterile (6 months&#xD;
             post-sterilization), or practicing an effective method of birth control (e.g.,&#xD;
             prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, intrauterine device,&#xD;
             double-barrier method, contraceptive patch, male partner sterilization) before entry&#xD;
             and throughout the study. Patients of childbearing potential (including those using&#xD;
             birth control) must have a negative pregnancy serum test at screening before&#xD;
             medication is dispensed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18-33 kg/m2, and weight between 50 and 135kg. BMI&#xD;
             calculation: BMI = weight (kg) / height (m) 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of significant past history of gastrointestinal disease requiring&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a baseline pH recording indicative of an abnormal acid secretory pattern&#xD;
&#xD;

             visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any prescription medications within 14 days of initial screening visit, with&#xD;

             topical medications for skin conditions, or nasal sprays for allergy relief&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of either over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription histamine-2 receptor antagonists&#xD;
             (H2RAs), and/or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) prokinetics, antibiotics or bismuth&#xD;
