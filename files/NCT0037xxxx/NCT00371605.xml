  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A fixed-dosing regimen of voriconazole is routinely used as prophylaxis against aspergillosis&#xD;
      in liver transplant patients admitted to the transplant intensive care unit at UPMC. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that use of a fixed-dosing regimen of voriconazole will lead to a large degree of&#xD;
      variability in drug exposure among liver transplant patients due to: 1) variability in&#xD;
      absorption and elimination caused by physiological characteristics unique to this patient&#xD;
      population 2) its non-linear pharmacokinetics and 3) the potential for polymorphism in the&#xD;
      genes that encode for cytochrome P-450 enzymes that metabolize voriconazole. This is a pilot&#xD;
      clinical pharmacokinetic evaluation that will: 1) characterize the plasma concentration&#xD;
      versus time profile of voriconazole in liver transplant patients receiving a fixed-dosing&#xD;
      regimen to assess for extremes in systemic exposure 2) determine the oral bioavailability of&#xD;
      voriconazole in liver transplant patients 3) assess for functionally significant allelic&#xD;
      variation of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes that metabolize voriconazole (CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and&#xD;
      CYP3A4/5) in both recipient blood and allograft tissue that may contribute extremes in&#xD;
      systemic exposure among liver transplant patients. This evaluation will allow for an&#xD;
      assessment of the adequacy of the prophylactic regimen in achieving therapeutic drug&#xD;
      concentrations in all subjects. Additionally, the utility of genotyping as a clinical tool to&#xD;
      identify patients at risk for extremes in voriconazole exposure will be evaluated. The&#xD;
      characterization of the pharmacokinetics in liver transplant patients may be utilized to&#xD;
      define an optimal therapeutic regimen that will be individualized to target specific&#xD;
      concentrations to maximize efficacy and minimize side-effects.&#xD;

      All liver transplant patients receiving voriconazole prophylaxis are eligible to participate&#xD;
      in this study. We propose a single-center, observational study in 15 liver transplant&#xD;
      patients who are admitted to the ICU and receiving voriconazole prophylaxis as part of&#xD;
      standard care. Each patient will undergo blood sampling (27 mL) on one occasion&#xD;
      (Pharmacokinetic Study I), while receiving oral voriconazole. A small portion of blood (1 mL)&#xD;
      collected during this blood sampling period will be retained for genotyping (specific aim&#xD;
      III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voriconazole prophylaxis is most often administered to liver transplant patients via the oral&#xD;
      route (200 mg twice daily). However, circumstances may arise necessitating the administration&#xD;
      of intravenous doses of voriconazole for a subset of patients, as part of their standard&#xD;
      care. . Thus, these patients will undergo blood sampling on a maximum two additional&#xD;
      occasions: 1) surrounding an intravenous dose dose (27 mL) 2) surrounding an oral dose (27&#xD;
      mL) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of voriconazole present in the blood samples will be measured via high pressure&#xD;
      liquid chromatography. Individual plasma concentration time profiles will be determined&#xD;
      following oral and intravenous dosing, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates will&#xD;
      be derived via population and individual pharmacokinetic data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use, dose, and frequency of the medication voriconazole is up to the clinical staff. We&#xD;
      will not be altering the delivery, dose or use of the drug. Therefore we cannot provide you&#xD;
      with the requested information because it will all depend on the clinical team. We are not&#xD;
      intervening to enroll subjects. Subjects will only be enrolled if they are placed on&#xD;
      voriconazole and they agreed to participate.&#xD;

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic&#xD;
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To&#xD;
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and&#xD;
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The&#xD;
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept&#xD;
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples&#xD;
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected&#xD;
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's&#xD;
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.&#xD;
