      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well the vaccine is tolerated at sites where&#xD;
      administrations are given and any effects it may have on subjects' wellbeing. The study will&#xD;
      also test the ability of vaccine to cause particular immune responses in the body.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Influenza is a contagious disease of the upper airways and the lungs. It rapidly spreads&#xD;
      around the world in seasonal epidemics, killing hundreds of thousands of people and having&#xD;
      high economic consequences due to healthcare costs and lost productivity. Each year&#xD;
      governments recommend groups who are at risk of influenza or its complications to receive&#xD;
      influenza vaccination. Current vaccine supply is not sufficient to meet the demand if this&#xD;
      recommendation were to be taken up by all. This study is part of the clinical development of&#xD;
      a particle mediated epidermal delivery (PMED) trivalent DNA vaccine for the prevention of&#xD;
      influenza.This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of this vaccine as well as&#xD;
      assess the humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine in healthy subjects.&#xD;
