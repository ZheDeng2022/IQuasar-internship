  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimalarial chemoprophylaxis can reduce morbidity and mortality from malaria in children.&#xD;
      However, this approach to malaria control has not been implemented widely because of concerns&#xD;
      over its possible effect on the development of resistance and natural immunity. Intermittent&#xD;
      preventive treatment (IPT) may be able to achieve some of the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis without its drawbacks. Recently, it has been shown that IPT given to&#xD;
      Senegalese children under the age of five years on three occasions during the malaria&#xD;
      transmission season reduced the incidence of clinical malaria by approximately 90%. However,&#xD;
      it is uncertain how this intervention can be most effectively delivered. Therefore, 26&#xD;
      Maternal and Child Health (MCH) trekking clinics in Upper River Division, south of the River&#xD;
      Gambia, each with an average catchment population of 400-500 children under 5 years of age,&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to receive IPT from the MCH trekking team or from a IPT dispenser&#xD;
      (village health worker, traditional birth attendant or a community mother based in a primary&#xD;
      health care village). Treatment with a single dose of sulfadoxine /pyrimethamine (SP) plus&#xD;
      three doses of amodiaquine will be given to all study subjects at monthly intervals on three&#xD;
      occasions during the months of September, October and November. The primary end points will&#xD;
      be the incidence of clinical attacks of malaria detected by passive case detection, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the delivery methods. Important secondary endpoints will be the&#xD;
      coverage and the equity of coverage of IPT in preventing malaria morbidity.&#xD;

      3. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to study the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two&#xD;
      approaches to the administration of intermittent preventive treatment to Gambian children -&#xD;
      distribution by village volunteers or through EPI trekking teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unit of randomization will be the catchment population of the monthly EPI trekking&#xD;
      clinics. There are 33 trekking clinics in total on the south bank of URD of which 27 are&#xD;
      rural. The rural trekking clinics will be selected for randomization. 26 rural clusters (two&#xD;
      will be merged to give an even number) will be stratified by health facility catchment area&#xD;
      (Gambissara, Basse, Fatoto). Constrained randomization will be used to ensure balance within&#xD;
      strata with regard to distribution of PHC key villages and population size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bednet coverage in URD is estimated to 65%. However, during the enumeration, details of&#xD;
      bed net usage by the community will be assessed. In collaboration with the malaria control&#xD;
      programme, we will facilitate the provision of bed nets to households without one. At the&#xD;
      beginning of the rainy season permethrin will be provided to all households with bednets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Malaria card&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the enumeration has been completed, a database containing the list of eligible children&#xD;
      will be established. The database will be used to generate the list of participating study&#xD;
      children in each village. A record system using appropriate visual aids will be devised that&#xD;
      can be used by an IPTc dispenser. This will consist of a &quot;malaria card&quot; held by the mother or&#xD;
      guardian of each child and an IPT register held by IPTc dispenser or staff of the DHT&#xD;
      trekking team. On the malaria card held by the mother, the compound number and study number&#xD;
      will be written in Arabic and English, together with the child's name and the name of his or&#xD;
      her parents. The dosage of trial medication to be given will be indicated on the malaria card&#xD;
      and the register using coloured circles and semi-circles (full circle for one tablet and&#xD;
      semi-circle for half a tablet). The register held by the IPTc dispenser or DHT staff will&#xD;
      contain similar information to that on the malaria card.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a child presents to a health facility for medication, the DHT staff or the IPTc&#xD;
      dispenser will examine the malaria card of the study subject. Medication will only be given&#xD;
      to study subjects after correct identification and after matching the information on the&#xD;
      malaria card held by the mother and that on the register held by the IPTc dispenser or the&#xD;
      DHT. It is envisaged that the DHT staff and IPTc dispenser taking part in the study will be&#xD;
      paid modest salary supplements for their contribution to the project. However, the details of&#xD;
      payment will be discussed with the EPI unit and Basse DHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Cross-section survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      In December, at the end of the malaria transmission season, a cross-sectional survey of&#xD;
      children less than 6yrs will be undertaken in all the 26 clusters. A questionnaire to&#xD;
      determine asset rating and wealth index will be completed. Information on demographic, bed&#xD;
      net usage, socio-economic status, health seeking behaviour and utilisation patterns profiles&#xD;
      will be collected, a clinical history will be obtained and a physical examination will be&#xD;
      performed, including abdominal palpation for splenomegaly and measurement of height, weight&#xD;
      and axillary body temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Distribution of tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.1 Distribution of tablets in the villages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each key PHC village has a health post staffed by a community health nurse. There are 29 PHC&#xD;
      villages and the majority of these have a village health worker and a traditional birth&#xD;
      attendant. The three towns with basic health facilities (Basse, Fatoto and Gambisara) will be&#xD;
      excluded from the evaluation, and the trial will focus on other communities in the study&#xD;
      area. The trial medication will be administered by IPTc dispenser based in a PHC village. The&#xD;
      IPTc dispenser will distribute the trial medication at a central point (usually a health&#xD;
      post) on the first Wednesday of the month during September, October and November. Mothers and&#xD;
      carers will be asked to bring their children to the central point during the morning when the&#xD;
      IPTc dispenser will be available to distribute the drugs. When a child presents to the&#xD;
      central point for medication, the IPTc dispenser will identify the study subject using the&#xD;
      malaria card held by the mother and match the information on the malaria card with that on&#xD;
      her register. When she is satisfied that she has correctly identify the study subject and&#xD;
      that the information on the malaria card matches those on her register, the correct dosage of&#xD;
      the trial medication will be given to the study subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose of treatment will be taken under direct supervision of the IPTc dispenser and&#xD;
      she will mark her register and the malaria card to show that the child has received the&#xD;
      tablets. The remaining two doses will be given to the mother or guardian of the child with&#xD;
      clear instructions on how to administer the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.2 Distribution of tablets in the trekking clinics A member of the MCH trekking team&#xD;
      (designated as an IPTc officer) of each of the 3 basic health facilities (Basse, Fatoto and&#xD;
      Gambissara) will be identified by the EPI team and given responsibility for delivery of IPT&#xD;
      at the trekking clinics, which are allocated by randomization to deliver IPTc. Thus, each EPI&#xD;
      team will deliver IPTc in some of its trekking clinics but not in others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dates of each monthly treatment will be written in Arabic and English on the &quot;malaria&#xD;
      cards&quot;. To ensure that children do not receive more doses of IPTc than they should, different&#xD;
      coloured &quot;malaria cards&quot; will be issued to children in villages where children will receive&#xD;
      their medication from IPTc dispenser and to those allocated to receive medication from the&#xD;
      MCH trekking clinic. IPTc dispensers and IPTc officers will be taught how to give medication&#xD;
      only to children who have the correct coloured cards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the malaria transmission season, the total number of complete treatment doses&#xD;
      each child in the trial has taken will be recorded. Compliance will be checked on a rolling&#xD;
      basis throughout the study by assessing the number of correct doses of medication received.&#xD;
      In addition, urine samples will be collected from a random sample of 100 children each month&#xD;
      in the two-week period following administration of IPTc to test for the presence of SP in the&#xD;
      urine using Eggelte dipsticks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Morbidity surveillance during the rainy season&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive surveillance for malaria will be maintained throughout the transmission season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5 Surveillance for severe malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records will be kept of admission of study children to Basse and Fatoto Health Centres.&#xD;
      Physicians and nurses based at these facilities will be asked to look out for any child with&#xD;
      severe malaria, and any admission attributed to malaria will be carefully documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.6 Surveillance for overall and cause specific mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deaths will be investigated using postmortem questionnaire techniques and cause of death&#xD;
      established wherever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.7 Nested case control study&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the effect of inequalities in wealth on malaria morbidity and its prevention by&#xD;
      intermittent treatment, -a nested case control approach will be used to determine&#xD;
      distribution of malaria morbidity in relation to two measures of socioeconomic status - a&#xD;
      wealth rating scale and an asset index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.8 Study of cost-effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken from a societal perspective, meaning that&#xD;
      all costs and effects, no matter to whom they accrue, will be measured and valued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.8.1 Programme costs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The costs of the two modes of delivering IPTc will be assessed using the bottom-up or&#xD;
      'ingredients' approach which involves the identification of all the resources required by the&#xD;
      two modes of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.8.2 Resource savings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modes of delivery will be compared with respect to the resource savings resulting from&#xD;
      fewer children being treated for malaria related illnesses as a result of better IPTc&#xD;
      coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.8.3 Cost-effectiveness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both modes of delivery, two cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated: (i) cost per&#xD;
      child who fully adheres to treatment; (ii) cost per case of malaria averted. In addition, net&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated by subtracting resources saved from the total&#xD;
      programme cost divided by the relevant outcome measure. The incidence of malaria and the&#xD;
      costs will be compared between the two delivery arms and the cost per additional case averted&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.9 Equity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the different delivery strategies on alleviating (or exacerbating) three forms&#xD;
      of equity will be measured. Equity outcomes and the cost of each delivery mode will also be&#xD;
      compared using benefit-incidence analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.9.1 Equality of utilization or adherence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine impact in terms of IPT coverage, levels of adherence will also be compared&#xD;
      across the two delivery strategies; a cross-section survey will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.9.2 Equality of access:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here we are measuring whether households have the same opportunity to benefit from each mode&#xD;
      of delivery. This involves defining and measuring financial access, geographical access,&#xD;
      informational access and cultural/gender barriers to access. Approximately 25 compliers and&#xD;
      25 non-compliers from a sub-sample of 12 clusters will be interviewed about factors&#xD;
      influencing access to each delivery strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.9.3 Benefit-incidence-analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilization and access data for rich and poor households will be compared with the cost of&#xD;
      providing the service. This will involve the use of benefit-incidence-analysis to analyze the&#xD;
      impact of government expenditure on poverty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.9.4 Cost-effectiveness data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health service costing data including capital costs, consumables, salaries etc. will be&#xD;
      collected by careful review of health facility records and through consultation with&#xD;
      administration staff. Costs to the community will be collected using an interviewer&#xD;
      administered questionnaire recently developed by a GMP PhD student.&#xD;
