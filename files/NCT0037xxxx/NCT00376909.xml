      RATIONALE: Studying the barriers that prevent minority and low-income women from undergoing&#xD;
      cancer screening, and offering encouragement to them over the telephone, may help improve&#xD;
      cancer screening rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well a telephone-based Prevention&#xD;
      Care Manager increases screening rates for breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal&#xD;
      cancer in minority and low-income women.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether telephone support for patients, provided through a Prevention Care&#xD;
           Manager (PCM), can increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening rates&#xD;
           among minority and low-income women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the amount of PCM time required to improve early cancer detection provided to&#xD;
           age-eligible ethnically diverse women seen in community health centers in the New York&#xD;
           City area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn barriers faced by this population in obtaining indicated services (mammograms, Pap&#xD;
           tests, fecal occult blood testing, and sigmoidoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess at baseline and follow-up the office environment and work processes in each&#xD;
           participating center (in PCM randomized controlled study only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop and implement the PCM intervention to help patients overcome barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact and costs of the PCM in a randomized controlled efficacy trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, multicenter study. Patients are&#xD;
      randomized according to participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: Some patients undergo a series of structured interviews about the obstacles to&#xD;
           early cancer detection. Participating sites are assessed for study eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: Pilot testing, training, and competency testing of the Prevention Care Managers&#xD;
           (PCM) are conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 3: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm I: Patients are offered health education and follow-up services by telephone&#xD;
                with a PCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm II: Patients receive usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,729 (1,413 for PCM randomized controlled study and 1,316 for&#xD;
      pilot study) patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
