    <textblock>
      Primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of recombinant human&#xD;
      lactoferrin on the rate of infection with Clostridium difficile in long-term care patients&#xD;
      supported by enteral feeding requiring broad spectrum antibiotics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product to be tested: Lactoferrin (human) derived from rice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amount, dosage, route of administration, duration:Subjects will receive 3 grams of&#xD;
      lactoferrin every 24 hours in the flush solution for the automated enteric feeding system.&#xD;
      Dosing will begin with antibiotic dosing and continue for 8 weeks following the initial dose&#xD;
      of antibiotic. If there is a change/adjustment in the antibiotics or initiation of another&#xD;
      course of antibiotic therapy during the study period, blood and stool samples will be taken&#xD;
      as an additional study point, but there will be no extension of the 8 weeks of study material&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To test the use of lactoferrin (human) derived from rice in the management of&#xD;
      post-antibiotic colonization with Clostridium difficile and the resulting inflammation&#xD;
      reaction in the intestine in long-term care patients on enteral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. difficile antigen status change Diarrhea (2 or more loose stools, conforming to container,&#xD;
      in 24 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Markers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. difficile toxin status change Stool and serum proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 antitrypsin serum and stool cRP - serum WBC - blood&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients on enteral feeding by gastrostomy, naso-gastric, or jejunostomy tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first antibiotic treatment (after start of study), subjects will be randomized to study&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test: Recombinant human lactoferrin from rice in 50 mM NaCl in enteral feeding flush. 5 mg/mL&#xD;
      lactoferrin in 600 mL 0.3% (50 mM) saline administered every 24 hours of the 8 weeks of the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls: 600 mL 0.3% (50 mM) saline&#xD;
&#xD;
      All material for test and control flushing fluid will be supplied by Ventria Bioscience in&#xD;
      containers labeled with the patient study number, enteral feeding system flush, expiration&#xD;
      date and sponsor name. Codes will be held by Ventria and not broken until 30 patients are&#xD;
      completed. A sealed copy of the code will be available to the principal investigator. In case&#xD;
      of adverse events the code can be broken at the request of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One bottle of flush solution powder is dissolved in 600 mL of water. The 600 mL of flush is&#xD;
      used in a 24 hour period as the automatic flush by the standard enteral feeding pumps used.&#xD;
      If there is flush material remaining at the end of a cycle, it will be administered as a&#xD;
      bolus dose if less than 200 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Thirty patients will be enrolled with intent to treat in a masked, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo controlled study. All subjects will be in the long-term care facility at Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in long-term care facility, Ventilator Rehabilitation Unit (VRU) (Plaza) at the&#xD;
           John Burton Care Center of the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutrition via gastrostomy, naso-gastric or jejunostomy enteral feeding system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with supplemental oral intake, but primary nutrition via&#xD;
           gastrostomy/jejunostomy tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with colostomies are also allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not currently on antibiotic therapy and no antibiotics within 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient is negative for Clostridium difficile antigen in screen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient, guardian or health care agent willing to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who will only receive vancomycin, linezolid, or metronidazole as the antibiotic&#xD;
           treatment, not broad spectrum antibiotics. All other antibiotics will qualify.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with illeostomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have signs or symptoms of C. difficile infection; such as diarrhea (two or&#xD;
           more liquid stools in a 24-hour period) and elevated WBC (more than 15,000/mm3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known allergy to rice or rice products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the principal investigator may declare any patient ineligible if severity of&#xD;
      illness may limit adequate time for follow-up data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:All patients (new or current if they have been antibiotic treatment free for&#xD;
      10 days) negative for C. difficile on the VRU at the John Burton Care Center on enteral&#xD;
      feeding will be invited to participate in the study. New patients are screened for C.&#xD;
      difficile as part of admitting procedures; current patients will be screened for current C.&#xD;
      difficile antigen status. Patients or guardian of patients interested in participation will&#xD;
      be asked to sign an informed consent. When patient requires the first treatment with a broad&#xD;
      spectrum antibiotic, they will be randomized into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study material will be administered via the flush cycle of the enteral feeding system. The&#xD;
      typical daily flush is 600 mL of diluted saline. The study material will be in one third&#xD;
      normal saline, approximately 0.3% or 50 mM with or without lactoferrin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recombinant human lactoferrin from rice will be at 5 mg/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study material will be used in the flush cycle, 600 mL per day, beginning on the first day of&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment until 8 weeks following the final dose of antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At entry into the study, patients will have blood and stool samples taken to assay for:&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. difficile antigen and toxin C. difficile bacterial culture, an aliquot of stool and all&#xD;
      recovered organisms will be frozen for future analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum and stool cytokines cRP - c reactive protein - blood&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 antitrypsin stool and blood White blood cell count and differential&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have a positive C. difficile antigen at time zero will be exited from the study&#xD;
      and will not be considered in the intent to treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be taken again to assay for the above markers at two and six weeks after the&#xD;
      start of antibiotic treatment, and at 8 weeks post antibiotics initiation or at exit from the&#xD;
      study period. A stool sample will be collected weekly, in addition to the regular study time&#xD;
      points. This sample will be frozen for future analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored daily during the study for occurrence of diarrhea throughout the&#xD;
      study period. The definition of diarrhea will be that a stool flows to the shape of the&#xD;
      container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a second course of antibiotics is required during the 8 week post antibiotic period,&#xD;
      samples will be taken for assay of the study markers at that time and the study course will&#xD;
      continue, but not be extended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who become positive for C. difficile will remain in the study until they require&#xD;
      treatment for C. difficile. At initiation of treatment for C. difficile, study samples will&#xD;
      be collected and the patient will be exited from the study, but included in the analysis.&#xD;
      Patients who are C. difficile antigen positive will remain in the study until a positive test&#xD;
      for C. difficile toxin A or B is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses: Data will be summarized as the number and percent of patients that&#xD;
      convert from a negative to a positive C. difficile antigen and the number and percent of&#xD;
      patients with reported diarrhea at any time. The number of days that subjects are&#xD;
      diarrhea-free out of the 8-week study period will also be recorded. These data will be&#xD;
      analyzed by a comparison of rates using Fisher's Exact Test with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the small number of subjects in the study, the goal will be to identify trends rather&#xD;
      than statistical significance&#xD;
