  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will investigate whether tranexamic acid given as an intravenous bolus&#xD;
      injection before start of surgery, followed by a continuous infusion during surgery reduces,&#xD;
      perioperative hemostatic activation, and postoperative bleeding and the need for transfusions&#xD;
      of blood components in elderly patients undergoing combined aortic valve replacement and&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass surgery. Tranexamic acid will be compared with placebo (0.9% sodium&#xD;
      chloride) in a randomized and double-blind study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that tranexamic acid will reduce hemostatic activation and&#xD;
      postoperative hemorrhage and the need for blood component transfusions in this group of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has previously been shown that elderly patients show signs of increased perioperative&#xD;
      hemostatic activation after coronary artery bypass grafting. In particular, compared to&#xD;
      younger patients, elderly patients had more extensive fibrinolysis postoperatively. The&#xD;
      antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce fibrinolysis, bleeding, and&#xD;
      the need for transfusions of blood components after various cardiac surgical procedures. In&#xD;
      this study we will investigate whether tranexamic acid reduces perioperative activation of&#xD;
      coagulation as measured by plasma concentrations of antithrombin, thrombin-antithrombin&#xD;
      complex, and prothrombin fragment 1+2, whether tranexamic acid reduces perioperative&#xD;
      fibrinolysis as measured by plasma concentrations of D-dimer, and whether tranexamic acid&#xD;
      reduces platelet activation as measured by plasma concentrations of neutrophil activating&#xD;
      peptide 2 and by flow cytometry in elderly (above 70 years of age) patients undergoing&#xD;
      combined aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass surgery. The primary endpoint of&#xD;
      the study will, however, be total postoperative bleeding and the need for transfusions of&#xD;
      blood components during and after surgery. The need for transfusions will be registered&#xD;
      during the whole hospital stay. Patients will be randomized into two groups and given either&#xD;
      tranexamic acid or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) as an intravenous bolus injection before&#xD;
      start of surgery followed by an intravenous infusion during surgery. Blood samples for the&#xD;
      above mentioned plasma concentration measurements will be drawn preoperatively,&#xD;
      intraoperatively during CPB, and 30 minutes and 3, 5, and 20 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
      Postoperative bleeding will be registered for 16 hours. The need for any transfusions of&#xD;
      blood products will be registered for the whole hospital stay.&#xD;
