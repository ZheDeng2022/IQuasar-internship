  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is caused by a parasite carried by a mosquito. Currently, there is no vaccine&#xD;
      licensed to prevent malaria. The purpose of this study is to find the most effective and&#xD;
      safest dose of an experimental vaccine for the treatment of malaria. Participants will&#xD;
      include 72 healthy adults, ages18 to 45, enrolled at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and&#xD;
      Stanford University. Volunteers will receive 3 doses of either the malaria vaccine or placebo&#xD;
      (contains no vaccine) by injection into a muscle at 0, 1 and 6 months. Investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate how the body responds to increasing dosage strengths of the vaccine. Study&#xD;
      procedures include physical exam, multiple blood draws, and completion of a memory aid&#xD;
      (diary). Each participant will be actively involved in the study for about 12 months. Then,&#xD;
      an annual phone call will be made to check for any serious illness events for a period of 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria currently represents one of the most prevalent infections in tropical and subtropical&#xD;
      areas throughout the world. Each year, malaria affects around 300 million people and kills 1&#xD;
      to 3 million people in developing countries. The widespread occurrence and the growing&#xD;
      incidence of malaria are a consequence of the increasing numbers of drug-resistant parasites&#xD;
      and insecticide-resistant parasite vectors. Other factors include environmental and climatic&#xD;
      changes, civil disturbances and increased mobility of populations. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      the Ad35.CS.01 vaccine will prevent the Plasmodium (P.) falciparum parasite, which causes&#xD;
      malaria, from entering and developing within the liver of those who become infected.&#xD;
      Ad35.CS.01 would therefore be expected to reduce malaria-attributable morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. The purpose of this phase I, randomized, controlled, dosage-escalation trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of an Adenovirus Type 35 based&#xD;
      circumsporozoite malaria vaccine in 72 healthy adults, 18 to 45 years of age, in the United&#xD;
      States. Subjects will be randomized in a 5:1 ratio to receive 3 doses of the Adenovirus Type&#xD;
      35 circumsporozoite malaria vaccine (Ad35.CS.01) or normal saline placebo control by the&#xD;
      intramuscular route at 0, 1 and 6 months. The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      ascending dosages of the vaccine will be assessed. Fifteen subjects will receive vaccine at&#xD;
      each of the following dosage levels: 10^8 viral particles (vp)/milliliters (ml), 10^9 vp/ml,&#xD;
      10^10 vp/ml and 10^11 vp/ml with 3 subjects receiving control at each of these dosage levels.&#xD;
      Dosage escalation will proceed only after review of the safety data by the Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee of the prior dosage level. The primary objective is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity of ascending dosages of Adenovirus Type 35 based circumsporozoite malaria&#xD;
      vaccine among healthy subjects given in 3 intramuscular doses at 0, 1 and 6 months. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of the Adenovirus Type 35 based&#xD;
      circumsporozoite malaria vaccine through performance of Humoral Immune Assays [ELISA&#xD;
      (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)] for antibodies to circumsporozoite antigen and&#xD;
      Adenovirus Neutralization Assay for neutralizing antibodies to Adenovirus type 35) and&#xD;
      Cellular Immune Assays [enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) and Flow Cytometry] for&#xD;
      circumsporozoite (CS)-specific cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ and CD8+ T cell responses.&#xD;
