  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing evidence suggests modulating effects of cannabinoids on time of onset, severity,&#xD;
      and outcome of schizophrenia. Efforts to discover the underlying pathomechanism have led to&#xD;
      the assumption of gene x environment interactions including premorbid genetical vulnerability&#xD;
      and worsening effects of continuing cannabis use. For a main characteristic of psychoactive&#xD;
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is its affinity to biological membranes, which are known to be&#xD;
      disturbed in schizophrenia patients and genetic high-risk populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here we assess an hypothesised association between premorbid lipid disturbance and metabolic&#xD;
      effects of external cannabinoids in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity of niacin (methylnicotinate) skin flushing, indicating disturbed&#xD;
      prostaglandin-mediated processes, is used as peripheral marker of lipid-arachidonic acid&#xD;
      pathways and investigated in cannabis consuming and non-consuming schizophrenia patients and&#xD;
      in healthy controls. Methylnicotinate is applied in three concentrations onto the forearm&#xD;
      skin. Flush response is assessed in three minute intervals over 15 min using optical&#xD;
      reflection spectroscopy.&#xD;

      Subjects Niacin skin tests are performed on acutely ill consecutively admitted schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients suffering not more than two psychotic episodes. All meet DSM-IV criteria for&#xD;
      paranoide schizophrenia. Diagnosis is made by two independent experienced psychiatrists and&#xD;
      further supported by structured clinical interview (SCID IV) (Wittchen et al 1997). Majority&#xD;
      of patients is treated mostly with atypical neuroleptic drugs. The patient population is&#xD;
      subdivided in one group having used cannabis on a regular basis (≥ 0,5 g/d, at least 3 month)&#xD;
      prior to admission, and another group having never used cannabis apart from unique trials.&#xD;
      Cannabis consuming patients do not use any other drug or alcohol on a regular basis.&#xD;
      Psychiatric symptoms are assessed using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (Overall and&#xD;
      Gorham 1962), Scale of Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) (Andreasen 1984), Scale of&#xD;
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) (Andreasen 1983), and Symptom Check List 1990 Revised&#xD;
      (SCL 90-R) (Kaplan et al 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are compared to healthy volunteers recruited by newspaper advertisement including&#xD;
      again one group of cannabis users (duration and dose of cannabis use as in patients) and one&#xD;
      group without any cannabis experience. Controls are interviewed in-depth to rule out a&#xD;
      current psychiatric diagnosis or psychiatric personal or family history. As in patients, SCL&#xD;
      90-R is also applied in controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cannabis-using participants are tested positive for cannabinoids in urine at the time of&#xD;
      niacin testing. Subjects with any current or history of skin disorders (eczema, atopical&#xD;
      dermatitis, psoriasis) or recent treatment with steroids or non-steroidal antiinflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (e.g. acetylsalicylic acid) are excluded from the study before niacin testing. The&#xD;
      study is approved by the Ethics Committee of Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena. All&#xD;
      participants give written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Niacin skin test protocol Methylnicotinate (C7H7NO2, 99%, Sigma-ALDRICH Chemie GmbH, Germany)&#xD;
      is applied simultaneously in three dilutions (0.001 M, 0.01 M, 0.1 M) of 50 µl each to the&#xD;
      skin at the inner side of the forearm using chambered plaster for epicutaneous testing. After&#xD;
      90 sec the plaster is removed. Skin flushing is quantified before and up to 15 minutes after&#xD;
      methylnicotinate exposure in 3-min intervals, starting 90 sec after removal of the&#xD;
      methylnicotinate patches. Methylnicotinate solutions are freshly prepared for each test to&#xD;
      prevent any influence of sunlight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reflection spectroscopy Optical reflection spectroscopy (ORS) is applied as described in more&#xD;
      detail by Smesny et al 2001. Skin content of oxygenated blood is assessed with a handheld&#xD;
      optical reflection spectrometer (spectral range: 400 nm to 700 nm, area of measurement:&#xD;
      diameter 5 mm), using the oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) absorption double peak at 542 nm and 577 nm.&#xD;
      Each measurement is repeated three times (within 10 sec) and then averaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectroscopic data are processed automatically creating difference spectra by subtraction of&#xD;
      pre-stimulation reflection intensities (also measured three times) from test intensities. Two&#xD;
      Gaussian curves are fitted to the HbO2-absorption double peak. The area under the resulting&#xD;
      sum curve is taken as measure of current skin flushing (measured in arbitrary units [a.u.]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis We plan to conduct a repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with TIME&#xD;
      (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 min) and methylnicotinate CONCENTRATION (0.001 M, 0.01 M, 0.1 M) as&#xD;
      within-subject factors and GROUP (patients, controls) and CANNABIS (cannabis user, cannabis&#xD;
      non-user) as between subjects factors. GENDER, and AGE are treated as co-variates. For&#xD;
      post-hoc comparison of single values, Mann-Whitney-U-Tests are calculated. Psychopathological&#xD;
      ratings of the SCL 90-R are compared between groups using an univariate ANOVA with the same&#xD;
      between group factors (GROUP, CANNABIS) and co-variates (AGE, GENDER) as above. Furthermore,&#xD;
      effects of cannabis use on SAPS, SANS, and BPRS are investigated within the patient group. In&#xD;
      order to explore a possible association between age or psychopathological ratings and skin&#xD;
      flushing, Spearman correlation coefficients will be calculated. Due to the high number of&#xD;
      calculated coefficients the significance level will be set on p &lt; 0.01.&#xD;
