      Title: Randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of short course intermittent regimens&#xD;
      for the treatment of HIV-associated tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: Phase III trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: 300 HIV positive patients with tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Sites:Four&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Government General Hospital, Chennai&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine, Tambaram&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:36 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective:To study the efficacy of the standard RNTCP Category I regimen (2EHRZ3 /&#xD;
      4RH3) the control arm vs. an extended continuation phase regimen 2EHRZ3 / 7 RH3 in the&#xD;
      treatment of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB in the HIV positive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To study the relationship between stage of HIV disease and response to anti-TB treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. To study recurrences and their nature (relapse/re-infection) in detail by using RFLP&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:It is a two armed prospective randomized open label controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      with stratified random allocation based on CD4 count and sputum smear grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will be treated according to the RNTCP guidelines during the intensive&#xD;
      phase. In the continuation phase, Cat I patients will be stratified by CD4 counts and by&#xD;
      smear grade, and randomly allocated either to the standard RNTCP regimen, or to an&#xD;
      alternative extended regimen (2EHRZ3/4RH3 or 2EHRZ3/7RH3).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All HIV positive patients seeking care at one of the study centers, above the age of 15&#xD;
      years, not suffering from a serious illness, non-pregnant and diagnosed with TB will be&#xD;
      briefly explained the treatment trial.Patients willing to participate in the trial will be&#xD;
      asked to provide written consent. Patients who refuse participation in the study will be&#xD;
      managed according to the RNTCP guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who provide written consent to participate in the treatment trial will be&#xD;
      interviewed by a social worker using a standard questionnaire. Patients on anti-retroviral&#xD;
      drugs will be excluded from the study. Blood samples will be collected from patients meeting&#xD;
      initial eligibility criteria to test for laboratory eligibility criteria. Laboratory&#xD;
      investigations will include complete heamogram,Renal function tests, Liver function tests,&#xD;
      random blood sugar, urine albumin and urine sugar. Patients who fulfill laboratory criteria&#xD;
      (hemoglobin &gt;70 g/L, granulocyte count &gt;1.1 X 109/L, platelet count &gt; 100X 109/L, serum&#xD;
      alanine amino transferase concentration &lt;2.5 times the upper limit of normal, serum&#xD;
      creatinine concentration &lt;1.1mg%, random blood sugar &lt; 140 mg/dl) will be enrolled in to the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled into the treatment trial will receive supervised directly observed&#xD;
      treatment during the intensive phase. At treatment initiation, each patient will be counseled&#xD;
      about the importance of treatment regularity. While patients are undergoing intensive phase&#xD;
      treatment, they will be randomized either to the standard regimen or to the extended regimen&#xD;
      as soon as CD4 results are available. Randomization will be done according to a permuted&#xD;
      block scheme in blocks of four, stratified by CD4 counts (&gt; 200 and â‰¤200) and by smear grade&#xD;
      (0, 1+, 2+, or 3+). The treatment assignment list will be generated before the start of trial&#xD;
      and sequentially numbered sealed envelopes containing the treatment assigned will be prepared&#xD;
      independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment regimens in each arm of the trial will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Category I RNTCP regimen 2EHRZ3/4RH3 Trial regimen 2EHRZ3/7RH3 Category II RNTCP regimen&#xD;
      2SEHRZ3/1EHRZ3/5EHR3 Category III RNTCP regimen 2HRZ3/4RH3. All anti-TB drugs will be&#xD;
      administered as per the RNTCP strategy of DOTS. Patients residing in Chennai and Madurai will&#xD;
      attend the respective centers/ sub-centers three times a week for the intensive phase of&#xD;
      treatment (first two/three months) and then once a week during the continuation phase (four&#xD;
      to seven months). Dosages will be as per RNTCP manual and may be modified if the patient is&#xD;
      extremely debilitated (weight &lt; 30 kg). Patients in all treatment arms will receive 10 mg of&#xD;
      Pyridoxine on treatment days and Co-trimoxazole DS 1 tablet daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During chemotherapy, patients will be called to the clinic for monthly clinical evaluation.&#xD;
      During follow-up visits at the clinic (monthly up to 24 months, every 3 months after that),&#xD;
      patients will be thoroughly evaluated for likely drug toxicity and the information on adverse&#xD;
      effects will be recorded on a standardized toxicity chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance with therapy will be measured by checking treatment cards, DOTS provider notebooks&#xD;
      and empty drug packets. Additionally, spot urine examination will be performed to check for&#xD;
      acetyl isoniazid and rifampicin levels at each monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention-to-treat approach will be used for analyzing the data for primary and secondary&#xD;
      end points. Annual interim analyses will be done to ensure timely identification of any&#xD;
      significant risks or benefits to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons of categorical variables will be done by chi-square test and Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be compared by t test or by Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Survival&#xD;
      estimates will be made by the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves&#xD;
      will be made with the log-rank test. Multivariate analyses will be performed using Cox's&#xD;
      proportional Hazards model.&#xD;
