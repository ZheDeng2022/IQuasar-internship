      To assess the role of Arsenic trioxide and/or ATRA during consolidation course in APL. It is&#xD;
      hoped that the investigational arms will further increase the event-free survival at 2 years,&#xD;
      with reduced toxicity and without increasing the relapse rate by comparison with a classical&#xD;
      anthracycline-AraC consolidation regimen.&#xD;

      Definition: Extended description of the protocol, including information not already contained&#xD;
      in other fields, such as comparison(s) studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APL is a specific type of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by its morphology (M3 or&#xD;
      M3v in the FAB classification), t(15;17) translocation leading to PML-RARa fusion gene, and&#xD;
      by a specific coagulopathy combining D.I.C., fibrinolysis and non specific proteolysis. ATRA&#xD;
      can differentiate APL blasts in VITRO and in vivo. The combination of ATRA and anthracycline&#xD;
      based chemotherapy yields CR rates greater than 90% in newly diagnosed APL. With early&#xD;
      introduction of anthracycline AraC chemotherapy during induction treatment, and maintenance&#xD;
      combining continuous 6MP and MTX to intermittent ATRA, the relapse risk in APL therefore now&#xD;
      appears to be in the range of 10 to 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, 5 to 10% of the patients do not achieve CR and 10% to 15% still relapse.&#xD;
      Another subset of patients (5 to 7% in APL 93 trial including 17% of patients aged greater&#xD;
      than 65 years) die in CR, from complications of the consolidation treatment phase, mainly&#xD;
      from infection during chemotherapy induced aplasia. Failure to achieve CR with current&#xD;
      treatment approaches is almost exclusively due to early death during induction treatment.&#xD;
      Causes of death are predominantly bleeding, ATRA syndrome and less often infection. Early&#xD;
      deaths predominate in elderly patients and patients with high WBC counts. Reducing the amount&#xD;
      of chemotherapy administered to newly diagnosed APL patients diminishes this toxicity. The&#xD;
      Spanish PETHEMA group reported results of two successive phase II trials in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      APL with ATRA and chemotherapy with intercalating agents (idarubicin and mitoxantrone)&#xD;
      without AraC followed by maintenance combining ATRA and low dose chemotherapy (LPA96 and&#xD;
      LPA99 trials). Results appeared similar to those of the best arm of APL 93 trial, but with&#xD;
      less toxicity and only 2 to 3 % death in CR were seen, including in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arsenic trioxide (As2O3 or ATO) is an effective agent in relapsing or refractory APL, which&#xD;
      induced 85% hematological and 79% molecular CR rates in a pivotal US study. The interest of&#xD;
      ATO in the front-line therapy of newly-diagnosed APL has been strongly suggested in three&#xD;
      studies which showed high complete remission rate, low incidence of relapse and limited&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients will be stratified based on age (≤ 70 years and &gt; 70 years) and WBC&#xD;
      count at diagnosis (WBC&lt;10.000/mm3 and &gt;10.000 /mm3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients aged 70 years or less with WBC&lt;10.000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this population (about 70 % of APL) the best treatment group of APL2000 trial (ATRA with&#xD;
      early introduction of anthracycline-AraC chemotherapy but where Idarubicin will be&#xD;
      substituted for Daunorubicin, followed by 2 anthracycline-AraC consolidation courses and&#xD;
      maintenance combining continuous chemotherapy and intermittent ATRA) will be compared to the&#xD;
      same regimen, but without AraC during consolidation courses which will be replaced by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  either ATO&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or ATRA It is hoped that the investigational arms will further increase the event-free&#xD;
           survival at 2 years, with reduced toxicity and without increasing the relapse rate by&#xD;
           comparison with a classical anthracycline-AraC consolidation regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients aged 70 years or less with WBC&gt;10.000/mm3 Patients ages 70 years or less&#xD;
                with initial WBC counts &gt; 10000/mm3 (ie very high counts for APL), which represent&#xD;
                about 20% of APL, remain at relatively high risk of relapse even with the current&#xD;
                reference treatment. The main objective of the study will be to test the addition&#xD;
                of ATO during consolidation courses to our current standard ATRA and chemotherapy&#xD;
                regimen. Patients will receive the best treatment group of APL 2000 trial (but&#xD;
                where Idarubicin will be substituted for Daunorubicin) with or without ATO during&#xD;
                the 2 consolidation cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients older than 70 years with WBC&lt;10.000 /mm3. Elderly patients with initial&#xD;
                WBC ≤ 10000/m3 (about 8% of APL) and no contra indication to this treatment will&#xD;
                receive a regimen with reduced cumulative dose of chemotherapy but addition of ATO&#xD;
                during consolidation courses and during the first year of maintenance treatment.&#xD;
                The main purpose of this non randomized part of the trial is to reduce the early&#xD;
                death mortality and death in CR observed in elderly patients, without increasing&#xD;
                the relapse rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients older than 70 years with WBC&gt;10.000 /mm3. Elderly patients with initial&#xD;
                WBC &gt; 10000/m3 (about 2 to 3% of APL) and no contra indication to intensive regimen&#xD;
                will receive the same regimen as those with low WBC but with moderate doses of&#xD;
                Aracytine during the induction and during the first consolidation course. The main&#xD;
                purpose of this non randomized part of the trial is to reduce the early death&#xD;
                mortality and death in CR observed in elderly patients, without increasing the&#xD;
                relapse rate.&#xD;
