      THe study seeks to determine if pimecrolimus has a positive effect on increasing&#xD;
      antimicrobial peptide expression and reducing vaccinia virus growth in the skin explants from&#xD;
      patients with atopic dermatitis.&#xD;

      AMP play an important role in the innate immune response against infections. Two major&#xD;
      classes of AMP have been identified: the beta defensins (HBD) (Harder 1997) and cathelicidins&#xD;
      (LL-37) (Gallo 2002). AMP have been shown to have antibacterial activities against S. aureus&#xD;
      (Ong 2002) and antiviral activity against vaccinia virus (VV) (Howell 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin of AD patients is characterized by a deficiency in AMP, which may account for their&#xD;
      propensity to skin infections (Ong 2002). This AMP deficiency is believed to be due to an&#xD;
      increase in Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, expression (Ong 2002), as well as an increase of&#xD;
      IL-10 expression (Howell 2005). Other cytokines known to affect AMP expression are TNF-alpha&#xD;
      (TNFa), IL-6, IL-1 and interferon-gamma (IFN-g). These cytokines induce the expression of AMP&#xD;
      (Erdag 2002, Liu 2002, Ong 2002, Nomura 2003). However, negligible levels of TNF-a and IFN-g&#xD;
      have been shown in AD skin possibly due to their downregulation by Th2 cytokines (Nomura&#xD;
      2003). Therefore, the neutralization of IL-4, IL-13 and IL-10 in AD patients may correct the&#xD;
      AMP deficiency of AD patients and decrease their propensity to recurrent skin infections.&#xD;
      Interestingly, the addition of anti-IL10 to skin explants from AD patients augmented HBD-2&#xD;
      and LL-37 expression (Howell 2005). In addition, IL-4 and IL-13 were found to enhance VV&#xD;
      replication and down-regulate LL-37 in VV-stimulated keratinocytes and neutralization of&#xD;
      IL-4/IL-13 in AD skin augmented LL-37 and inhibited VV replication (Howell 2006a). LL-37 and&#xD;
      HBD-3 have been found to kill VV(Howell 2004; Howell 2006b). Thus a deficiency of these AMP&#xD;
      may contribute to increased propensity to viral infection. Therapeutic strategies are needed&#xD;
      to augment AMP expression in AD skin to reduce skin infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pimecrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor that binds with high affinity to macrophilin-12. The&#xD;
      complex pimecrolimus-macrophilin inhibits calcineurin, a phosphatase required for the&#xD;
      dephosphorylation of the cytosolic form of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT).&#xD;
      As a consequence, pimecrolimus prevents the nuclear translocation of NFAT and thereby the&#xD;
      transcription and release of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-g, IL-4, IL-5,&#xD;
      IL-10, TNF-a and GM-CSF (Grassberger 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the most common topical corticosteroid treatment used by AD patients, triamcinolone&#xD;
      diacetate is included in this study as an active comparator.&#xD;
