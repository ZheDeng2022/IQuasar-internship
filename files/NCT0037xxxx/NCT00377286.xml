      The goal of this study is 1) to develop a biomarker of of cartilage synthesis by determining&#xD;
      if there is a relationship between changes in the status of knee cartilage and the amount of&#xD;
      a biomarker called CTX-II in urine. 2) We will also characterize people who have experienced&#xD;
      cartilage loss and/or reduced functional ability using performance tests and a questionnaire.&#xD;
      3) The administration of glucosamine in a beverage for six months will be used to promote the&#xD;
      alteration in cartilage status and improve function in people with mild to moderate joint&#xD;
      pain. A secondary goal will be to assess the effect of glucosamine on the skin in a small&#xD;
      subset of women.&#xD;

      Reduced knee function is a significant cause of physical limitations and disability. As&#xD;
      cartilage deteriorates due to aging, wear-and-tear, injury, or disease, joint space narrowing&#xD;
      and pain can develop. The lost of articular cartilage arises from an imbalance between&#xD;
      cartilage synthesis and cartilage degradation. When cartilage needs to be remodeled, enzymes&#xD;
      such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade type II collagen. It now may be possible to&#xD;
      use new molecular markers of cartilage degradation to assess the progression of joint loss in&#xD;
      comparison with radiographic changes of the knee joint. Urinary excretion of C-terminal cross&#xD;
      linking telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) is a new molecular marker of cartilage&#xD;
      tissue degradation metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence suggests that glucosamine, a dietary supplement, may provide some relief from&#xD;
      joint pain and may increase the functional ability to participate in activities of daily&#xD;
      living. This may be a result of these dietary supplements stimulating tissue repair such as&#xD;
      cartilage in the affected joints, or by inhibiting the degradation of cartilage through an&#xD;
      inhibition of enzymes. Moreover, Braham, Dawson, &amp; Goodman (2003) reported increases in&#xD;
      function in adults with knee pain following 12 -weeks of glucosamine supplementation. It is&#xD;
      unclear, however, if glucosamine delivered via a liquid carrier would improve physical&#xD;
      function and impact quality of life measures in people who have experienced loss of knee&#xD;
      cartilage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucosamine is a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, which are a major component of both joint&#xD;
      cartilage and skin. Potential benefits of glucosamine on skin have been reported previously.&#xD;
      It is possible that glucosamine in a beverage might also improve skin parameters over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: 100 men and women with mild to moderate joint pain taking a liquid with&#xD;
      glucosamine, compared to 100 men and women with mild to moderate joint pain taking a liquid&#xD;
      with placebo.&#xD;
