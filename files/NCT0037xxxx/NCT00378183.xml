      The purpose of this study is to compare three strategies for switching patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to the atypical antipsychotic, risperdone, after&#xD;
      they have been unsuccessfully treated with another atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine. In the&#xD;
      second phase of this study, investigators will assess the effectiveness of behavioral therapy&#xD;
      in reducing body weight in risperdone-treated patients who are overweight or have problems&#xD;
      with diabetes or blood sugar.&#xD;

      Data regarding the safety and effectiveness of different strategies for switching subjects&#xD;
      with schizophrenia from one antipsychotic medication to another are very rare. Studies that&#xD;
      have examined various switching designs, especially with regard to the newer atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic agents, suggest that either abrupt or gradual discontinuation does not&#xD;
      inevitably lead to worsening of symptoms. This study is randomized (patients are assigned&#xD;
      different treatments based on chance), open-label, with a parallel group design to assess the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of each of three strategies of discontinuing olanzapine and starting&#xD;
      risperidone. The first strategy is the discontinuation of olanzapine on the day risperidone&#xD;
      is started. The second strategy involves a reduction in the dose of olanzapine to one half of&#xD;
      the study entry dose on the day risperidone is started. The reduced dose of olanzapine is to&#xD;
      be given for one week and then discontinued. In the third strategy, the dose of olanzapine&#xD;
      remains unchanged for the first week, then is reduced by one half of the study entry dose,&#xD;
      and at the end of the second week is discontinued. In all three strategies, patients take the&#xD;
      same dose of risperidone: 1 mg by mouth twice a day for 3 days, then 2 mg twice a day for the&#xD;
      next 4 days. Further increase or decrease of risperidone dose and/or changing to a single&#xD;
      daily dose can be carried out at the end of the first week. Additionally, after 6 weeks of&#xD;
      risperidone therapy, patients who are overweight or have problems with diabetes or blood&#xD;
      sugar may enter a second phase of the study that examines weight loss. In this phase,&#xD;
      patients are randomized to receive routine clinical care or training on weight management&#xD;
      behavioral techniques while continuing to take risperidone for an additional 14 weeks. At the&#xD;
      end of 14 weeks, total weight loss, changes in lipids, cholesterol and other laboratory&#xD;
      measures will be compared between the two groups. The study hypothesis is that symptom&#xD;
      improvement or worsening at week 14, as measured by total score on the Positive and Negative&#xD;
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS), should not differ depending on the method of switching from&#xD;
      olanzapine to risperidone. Safety evaluations incude collection of adverse events, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests and assessment of vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive oral tablets of risperidone 1 to 2 milligram[mg] twice a day&#xD;
      (higher or lower dose and/or changing to single daily dose allowed at end of the first week)&#xD;
      for the duration of 6 weeks in phase 1, and then for 14 more weeks in phase 2 of the study.&#xD;
      Olanzapine: none; or half of the study entry dose for 1 week; or study entry dose for 1 week,&#xD;
      then half of the study entry dose for an additional week.&#xD;
