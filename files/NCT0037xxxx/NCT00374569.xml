      One aim of this study was to find if there was a difference between balance and stability&#xD;
      between elite level gymnasts and non-gymnasts. Another aim was to find if there was a&#xD;
      relationship between dynamic posturographic scores associated with sway fatigue or&#xD;
      adaptability and the ability to learn new gymnastic routines. The ultimate aim of the study&#xD;
      was to improve gymnastic performance while reducing the probability of injury.&#xD;

      Computerized dynamic posturography outcomes will be obtained on elite level gymnasts and non&#xD;
      gymnasts who will be age matched. The outcome measurement will be obtained using computerized&#xD;
      dynamic posturography, a standard diagnostic test of balance function (41-46). The subject's&#xD;
      balance was tested using a three-component force platform (CAPS test) under one sensory&#xD;
      condition of the modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB), the eyes&#xD;
      closed on perturbing surface condition. This condition was chosen as studies have shown it to&#xD;
      be the single test that best correlates with balance impairment and falls. The stability&#xD;
      score, already used in several studies by other authors will be used as the primary outcome&#xD;
      measure in this research. It is defined as 1 minus the ratio between the measured sway during&#xD;
      the test (computed as the major axis of a standard 95% confidence ellipse) and the amount of&#xD;
      sway a normal subject of the same height as the one being tested should be able to sway&#xD;
      before falling (also known as the theoretical maximum sway or the theoretical limit of&#xD;
      stability, calculated using a regression formula based on the subject's height developed by&#xD;
      NASA in 1962 and commonly used in all posturographic tests). For convenience, the stability&#xD;
      score will be expressed as a percentage. Its definition makes it a convenient and easy to&#xD;
      understand measure to use as a subject able to stand perfectly still with no sway will have a&#xD;
      score of 100%, whereas one that sways as much as the limit of stability will have a score of&#xD;
      0%. During each test, the subject's sway will be determined by the force platform and its&#xD;
      related software. The CAPS three-component force platform uses 3 load cells arranged in a&#xD;
      triangle to measure the distribution of the vertical ground reaction force on the platform.&#xD;
      The analog load cell signals are amplified and simultaneously sampled by the platform&#xD;
      electronics using three synchronized individual 24bit delta-sigma analog to digital&#xD;
      converters sampling at 312kHz and decimating the samples to a data rate of 64Hz. The use of&#xD;
      three A/D converters insures that the signals from the 3 load cells are acquired&#xD;
      simultaneously with no timing error. The high sampling rate with the high decimation and low&#xD;
      data rate of the sigma-delta converters eliminates aliasing and provides a resolution of&#xD;
      about 4 parts per million. The digital load cell data was then sent via a USB connection to&#xD;
      the PC where software uses a calibration matrix determined by the manufacturer to compute the&#xD;
      total vertical force and the two horizontal moments acting on the platform. From these data,&#xD;
      the software computed the point of application of the vertical force acting on the platform,&#xD;
      commonly referred to as the Center of Pressure (CoP). The location of the CoP coincides in&#xD;
      static conditions with the projection of the subject's Center of Mass (CoM) onto the&#xD;
      platform, and its movement relates to the movements of the subject's CoM (sway). The&#xD;
      determination of the actual sway will require the determination of the instantaneous location&#xD;
      of the CoM via the location and inertial properties of each body segment of the specific&#xD;
      subject being tested. The CAPS test, like all posturographic equipment, uses the movement of&#xD;
      the CoP as an approximation of the sway. Because it is an approximation, and because for&#xD;
      kinetic reasons the CoP moves more than the CoM, the 95% confidence interval of the CoP&#xD;
      motion was considered. This will allow the CAPS software to compute the ellipse that&#xD;
      represents the location of all of the sway samples collected during the test with 95%&#xD;
      confidence. The major axis of this ellipse will represent the maximum sway of the subject in&#xD;
      any direction during the test and it will be used to compute the stability score. To assess&#xD;
      the accuracy and resolution of the measurement chain, calibrated weights of 75kg and 100kg&#xD;
      will be positioned in the center of the force platform (as if it were a subject) and 20s&#xD;
      acquisitions will be performed: the accuracy of the weight must be within the instrument's&#xD;
      factory specifications (+-2N). Therefore the accuracy for the position claimed by the&#xD;
      manufacturer of +-1mm for a weight of 75kg will be accepted as correct as it determination&#xD;
      will require specialized equipment and software available only to the manufacturer. It should&#xD;
      be noted that the overall accuracy of the position of the CoP given by the instrument will&#xD;
      not be relevant in this study as the motion of the CoP determined the sway. The sway&#xD;
      measurement error will be estimated considering the fact that during the test at both weights&#xD;
      the dead weight must not move, but the measurement chain will indicate a &quot;sway&quot; of less then&#xD;
      0.05mm (measurement noise), therefore the resolution of the measurement chain and the sway&#xD;
      measurement error will be considered to be 0.05mm. To verify the repeatability of the&#xD;
      measurement chain, the same type of tests will be repeated two times, obtaining similar&#xD;
      results (within the specified accuracy and resolution). Given the sway measurement error, the&#xD;
      measurement error in the stability score will be determined. From the definition of the&#xD;
      stability score it is clear that the least the theoretical limit of stability, the more&#xD;
      pronounced the effect of the sway measurement error is. As the theoretical limit of stability&#xD;
      is computed by using the formula 0.55*height*2*sin(6.25Â°), the shorter the subject, the more&#xD;
      the stability score is sensitive to the measurement errors. To estimate the stability score&#xD;
      measurement error a subject's height of 1.6m will be considered. Such a subject will have a&#xD;
      theoretical limit of stability of 191.6mm. For such a subject, a sway measurement error of&#xD;
      0.05mm means a stability score measurement error of 0.05/191.6 or, if the score is expressed&#xD;
      in percentage, of 0.026%. Thus, any changes in the stability score greater than that will be&#xD;
      a consequence of the subject's sway and not of measurement errors. A CAPS dynamic&#xD;
      posturography test in the eyes closed perturbed stance will be obtained on all subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed that they will stand on a foam platform and close their eyes&#xD;
      while data will be obtained from a computerized force plate. The subjects will be given&#xD;
      practice sessions so that they will be familiar with the test prior to the collection of&#xD;
      data. The CAPS test occurs over 25 seconds. We will divide the degree of sway observed during&#xD;
      the first half of the test and the second half of the test and will obtain ratios. Subjects&#xD;
      whose sway will increase in the second half of the test in reference to the first half will&#xD;
      be identified as demonstrating a fatigability ratio. Individuals who will demonstrate less&#xD;
      sway in the second half of the test will be identified as demonstrating an adaptability ratio&#xD;
      that we consider might be related to some type of motor learning. All gymnasts will be&#xD;
      instructed in a novel gymnastic routine which will include a variety of inverted postures and&#xD;
      ground routines unfamiliar to the subjects. The athletes will be allowed to practice the&#xD;
      routine for one hour after which they will be asked to perform the routine in front of the&#xD;
      same judge who will be blinded as to the outcome measures previously obtained. The&#xD;
      performance scores will be then compared to the CDP measurements to ascertain if there would&#xD;
      be any relationship.&#xD;
