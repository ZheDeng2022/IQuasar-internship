  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is associated with recurrent epistaxis in 90% of&#xD;
      cases. Good response to hormone treatment has been documented, although its use remains&#xD;
      controversial. A double-blind placebo-controlled trial with estrogen treatment did not show&#xD;
      any benefit over placebo. The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of an&#xD;
      antiestrogenic agent, TAMOXIFEN, in the treatment of HHT-associated epistaxis. The study will&#xD;
      include up to 60 patients, over 18 years old.&#xD;

      Patients with HHT-related epistaxis who will attend our center will randomly be assigned to 6&#xD;
      months of treatment with either Tab. tamoxifen 20 mg once daily or placebo. The group will&#xD;
      included both men and women over the age of 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed medical history will be taken at presentation. All patients will be examined by an&#xD;
      otolaryngologist before and during the trial to assess the nasal condition and telangiectases&#xD;
      and blood clots in the airway, nasal and oral cavity, and body skin. Blood will be collected&#xD;
      for blood count and measurement of clotting time and liver function at onset of the trial and&#xD;
      once monthly during treatment. Patients will be requested to complete a daily chart&#xD;
      describing the course of their epistaxis, and female patients will be referred for&#xD;
      gynecologic follow-up, including ultrasound. Evaluations will be conducted once a month&#xD;
      throughout the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Rabin Medical Center. All patients will&#xD;
      sign a consent form.&#xD;
