      Protocol Title: Open-label,single center study to evaluate the savety and efficacy of an&#xD;
      intramuscular 12 week-course of Alefacept in patients with atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase: II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Open-label, single center Primary Study Objective: to determine the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of one course of Alefasept when administered as a 15 mg intramuscular ( IM)&#xD;
      injektion to patients with atopic dermatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Study Objective: to investigate key immunological parameters involved in the&#xD;
      pathology of this common skin disease to interpret the clinical findings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: 10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Male and female patients, at least 18 years of age with atopic dermatitis,&#xD;
      aktive inflammation, a severity score of 6-9 according to Langeland and Rajika and an EASI of&#xD;
      &gt;20&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Groups: Alefacept will be administered as a 15 mg IM injection once a week for 12&#xD;
      weeks, followed by a 12-week follow-up period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic eczematous skin disease,wich often begins early in&#xD;
      infancy and runs a course of remissions and exacerbations. T-lymphocytes play a prominent&#xD;
      role in this skin disease. they represent the majority of skin-infiltrating cells and&#xD;
      patients suffering from AD also have increased levels of activated circulating T cells and&#xD;
      increased levels of markers of lymphocyte activation such as L-selectin and IL-2R.&#xD;
