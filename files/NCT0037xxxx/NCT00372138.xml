  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main risk of aortic aneurysms is rupture that leads to a high risk of death. A preventive&#xD;
      surgical treatment is thus needed. In order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated&#xD;
      with conventional surgery, an endovascular approach (insertion of an endovascular stent&#xD;
      graft)is now widely favored. The main problem of this procedure is the occurrence of&#xD;
      endoleaks (persistence of a communication between the aneurysm and the aorta). A new approach&#xD;
      is proposed to prevent these endoleaks. The principle is to draw blood from the patient,&#xD;
      separate the blood from the platelets, and reinject both platelet rich plasma (PRP) and&#xD;
      autologous thrombin, in order to form a platelet gel (PRP + autologous thrombin). Before&#xD;
      studying the efficacy of this technique, its safety of use and feasibility must be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The main risk of aortic aneurysms is rupture. Onset is usually sudden, leading to the death&#xD;
      of the patient in 80% to 90% of cases. The elective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms,&#xD;
      therefore, seems to be a priority. In order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated&#xD;
      with conventional surgery, an endovascular approach (insertion of an endovascular stent graft&#xD;
      using the endovascular aneurysm repair procedure) is now widely favored. The main problem,&#xD;
      during follow-up of patients wearing an endovascular stent graft, is the occurrence of&#xD;
      endoleaks resulting in retrograde filling of the aneurysm sac. The ideal is to prevent these&#xD;
      endoleaks either by new developments in endovascular stent grafts or by using adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy during the procedure. The principle is to draw blood from the patient, separate the&#xD;
      blood from the platelets, and reinject it into two separate catheters, one with platelet rich&#xD;
      plasma (PRP) and the other with autologous thrombin, in order to form a platelet gel (PRP +&#xD;
      autologous thrombin). Before studying the efficacy of this technique, its safety of use and&#xD;
      feasibility must be evaluated.&#xD;
