      Study Phase: IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type: Open-label, multicenter, randomised clinical trial with two arms stratified for&#xD;
      an intensified immunosuppressive regimen in patients at high risk for acute rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description: 148 kidney transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease were randomized&#xD;
      and treated with ganciclovir capsules for 3 months (Group A, prophylaxis, N=74) or received&#xD;
      ganciclovir IV only in case of proven CMV viral load (Group B, preemptive therapy, N=74).&#xD;
      Initially, a 2 months follow up was planned in this trial. However, the study group decided&#xD;
      to offer a longterm follow up to all patients and amended the protocol, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to identify the most efficacious way to prevent renal transplant&#xD;
      recipients from CMV disease and to find out, if one of these two strategies may increase&#xD;
      graft or patient survival. Therefore, both wellknown approaches of CMV prevention were&#xD;
      compared in two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylaxis (Group A): Oral primary prophylaxis with ganciclovir capsules was started&#xD;
      directly after transplantation and performed until day 90. In case of CMV infection (proven&#xD;
      CMV viral load) or symptomatic CMV disease, treatment with ganciclovir IV was initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preemptive Therapy (Group B): No oral primary prophylaxis was given. Treatment with&#xD;
      ganciclovir IV was given to patients with proven CMV viral load (CMV infection or CMV&#xD;
      disease) only.&#xD;

      Disease Background: More than 60 % of adult people are asymptomatically infected with&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV). Due to immunosuppressive therapy, renal graft recipients are at risk&#xD;
      for CMV infection and life-threatening disease. CMV can cause a variety of symptoms in the&#xD;
      immunocompromised host, including CMV retinitis, pneumonia or colitis. After grafting, CMV&#xD;
      disease most commonly occurs in the transplanted organ and can trigger graft dysfunction and&#xD;
      acute rejection. Therefore, prophylaxis or preemptive therapy should be used in order to&#xD;
      prevent graft recipients from CMV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CMV prophylaxis means the administration of antiviral agents to all patients at risk for&#xD;
           CMV disease, directly after transplantation, i.e. for 3 months. Prophylaxis is in&#xD;
           particular used for patients at high risk for CMV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CMV preemptive therapy (or targeted prophylaxis) means CMV monitoring and initiation of&#xD;
           induction therapy with antiviral agents in patients with proven CMV viral load only (CMV&#xD;
           infection). This prevents non-infected patients from being exposed to antiviral drugs&#xD;
           and the related side effects like neutropenia or renal toxicity. Preemptive therapy is&#xD;
           in particular used for patients at lower or moderate risk for CMV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description: 148 kidney transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease were randomized&#xD;
      and treated with ganciclovir capsules for 3 months (Group A, prophylaxis, N=74) or received&#xD;
      ganciclovir IV only in case of proven CMV viral load (Group B, preemptive therapy, N=74).&#xD;
      Initially, a 2 months follow up was planned in this trial. However, the study group decided&#xD;
      to offer a longterm follow up to all patients and amended the protocol, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to identify the most efficacious way to prevent renal transplant&#xD;
      recipients from CMV disease and to find out, if one of these two strategies may increase&#xD;
      graft or patient survival. Therefore, both wellknown approaches of CMV prevention were&#xD;

      CMV viral load) or symptomatic CMV disease, treatment with ganciclovir IV was initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preemptive Therapy (Group B): No oral primary prophylaxis was given. Treatment with&#xD;
      ganciclovir IV was given to patients with proven CMV viral load (CMV infection or CMV&#xD;
