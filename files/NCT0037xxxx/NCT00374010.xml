      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of PC-ACP among African American patients&#xD;
           with End-stage Renal Disease and their surrogates and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to examine preliminary effects of PC-ACP on patient and surrogate outcomes (patients'&#xD;
           perceived quality of communication, surrogates' level of comfort in decision making for&#xD;
           the patient, patients' difficulty in making choices, patient-surrogate congruence in&#xD;
           goals of care, and patients' and surrogates' psychosocial/spiritual receptiveness) at&#xD;
           one week following receipt of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the increasing emphasis placed on patient-clinician communication about end of life&#xD;
      care, efforts to guide the patient to make an informed end-of-life treatment decision often&#xD;
      fail. Past efforts to enhance end-of-life discussions were insufficient to create treatment&#xD;
      decisions that were consistent with the patient's values and the surrogate's ability to make&#xD;
      end-of-life decisions for his/her loved one when required. The importance of effective&#xD;
      end-of-life discussions has been documented extensively, yet systematic explorations of the&#xD;
      effects of such dialogue with African Americans are nearly absent from the literature. The&#xD;
      proposed study is designed to test the ability of an hour-long intervention, Patient-Centered&#xD;
      Advance Care Planning (PC-ACP), to enhance clinicians' communication about end-of-life care&#xD;
      with patients and surrogates. The specific aims are (1) to evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of PC-ACP among African American patients with End-stage Renal Disease and&#xD;
      their surrogates and (2) to examine preliminary effects of PC-ACP on patient and surrogate&#xD;
      outcomes (patients' perceived quality of communication, surrogates' level of comfort in&#xD;
      decision making for the patient, patients' difficulty in making choices, patient-surrogate&#xD;
      congruence in goals of care, and patients' and surrogates' psychosocial/spiritual&#xD;
      receptiveness) at one week following receipt of the intervention. A randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      pre and post study will be conducted. Subjects (patient-surrogate dyads) will be randomized&#xD;
      to PC-ACP or to a usual care control group. Data to assess feasibility, clinical and&#xD;
      sociodemographic data, and baseline measures of patient and surrogate outcomes will be&#xD;
      collected when subjects enter the study. Measures of the patient and surrogate outcomes and&#xD;
      data to assess acceptability of the intervention will be administered at one week follow up.&#xD;
      Findings from this study are critical to strengthening PC-ACP and designing a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to test its efficacy for improving the quality of patient-clinician&#xD;
      communication and the quality of decision making for future medical care with African&#xD;
      American patients, in comparison with non-Hispanic Whites.&#xD;

    <description>The PC-ACP is a scheduled interview with the dyad, delivered by a trained nurse facilitator. It consists of 5 stages and lasts about an hour:&#xD;
Representational assessment (10 - 15 minutes);&#xD;
Exploring concerns related to planning for future medical decision-making (10 - 15 minutes);&#xD;
Creating conditions for conceptual change (5 minutes);&#xD;
Introducing replacement information using a disease-specific Statement of Treatment Preferences document (15 minutes); and&#xD;
Summary (3 - 5 minutes)</description>
