  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the experimental drug AdhAQP1 can increase salivary flow in&#xD;
      patients whose parotid glands have been exposed to therapeutic radiation for treatment of&#xD;
      head and neck cancer. Radiation may damage the parotid glands (salivary glands located under&#xD;
      the skin in front of the ear), leading to dry mouth, infections, excessive tooth decay, mouth&#xD;
      sores, difficulty swallowing and pain. AdhAQP1 contains the human aquaporin-1 gene, which&#xD;
      codes for a protein that works to transport water across cells, and a virus that normally can&#xD;
      cause colds in humans, but is modified to render it ineffective. In animal experiments,&#xD;
      AdhAQP1 has increased saliva production for a short time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 years of age or older who received radiation treatment for head and neck&#xD;
      cancer at least 5 years before enrolling in this study, who have no evidence of recurrent&#xD;
      tumor, who have dry mouth and who secrete abnormally low levels of saliva from the parotid&#xD;
      glands may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, blood, urine and saliva tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), chest x-ray,&#xD;
      MRI exam, gallium scan (a nuclear medicine test to look for inflammation in the salivary&#xD;
      glands), technetium pertechnetate scan (a nuclear medicine test to examine salivary gland&#xD;
      function), parotid sialogram (x-ray of parotid gland), PET and CT scans to look for signs of&#xD;
      tumor and a skin biopsy to collect skin cells for use in immunological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have a salt and sugar solution infused through a catheter (plastic tube) into&#xD;
      both parotid glands. After 10 minutes, the solution drains into the mouth and is swallowed.&#xD;
      Saliva is collected from the parotid glands at 6 and 24 hours after administration of the&#xD;
      salt and sugar solution. Ten to 14 days later, patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center for up to 4 days for the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the first day, administration, through a catheter, of the study drug AdhAQP1 into one&#xD;
           parotid gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring over the next 3 days for changes in patients' ability to produce saliva. This&#xD;
           includes medical examinations and several blood, urine and saliva collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technetium scan on day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gallium scan on day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients return to NIH for follow-up visits at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the AdhAQP1&#xD;
      infusion and then 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 months for a medical examination and blood, urine and&#xD;
      saliva collections. Gallium, technetium and MRI scans are repeated at several of the&#xD;
      follow-up visits, and sialograms are done at 6 and 12 months. Chest x-ray and EKG are&#xD;
      repeated at 4 and 6 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The treatment of most head and neck cancer patients includes ionizing radiation (IR).&#xD;
      Salivary glands in the IR field suffer irreversible damage. There is no conventional&#xD;
      treatment available to correct this condition. Our research group has been developing the&#xD;
      AdhAQP1 recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral (rAd5) vector based on the hypothesis that a&#xD;
      replication deficient rAd5 vector is capable of safely transferring the human aquaporin-1&#xD;
      (hAQP1) cDNA to parotid glands of adult patients with IR-induced salivary hypofunction,&#xD;
      resulting in an elevated salivary output, albeit transiently. Salivary glands have proven to&#xD;
      be valuable gene transfer targets in numerous pre-clinical animal model studies. hAQP1, the&#xD;
      archetypal water channel, is a plasma membrane protein that facilitates water movement across&#xD;
      lipid bilayers. Rat and minipig studies have clearly shown that the AdhAQP1 strategy for&#xD;
      restoring salivary flow to IR-damaged salivary glands is effective, and studies in rats,&#xD;
      non-human primates and minipigs have shown that AdhAQP1 and similar rAd5 vectors are without&#xD;
      significant untoward effects after salivary gland delivery. The purpose of this clinical&#xD;
      protocol is to test the safety of AdhAQP1, with some measures of efficacy, in adult patients&#xD;
      with established IR-induced parotid gland hypofunction. The targeted tissue site for the&#xD;
      AdhAQP1 vector in the proposed study is a single parotid gland. In this Phase 1&#xD;
      dose-escalation study, safety will be evaluated using conventional clinical and immunological&#xD;
      parameters. The primary outcome measure for biological efficacy will be parotid gland&#xD;
      salivary output.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Capable of providing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. History of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer, having received &gt;45Gy to&#xD;
                  the parotid gland(s) due to primary or neck radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Abnormal parotid gland function in the targeted parotid gland as judged by&#xD;
                  absence of unstimulated parotid salivary flow and a stimulated parotid salivary&#xD;
                  flow in the targeted parotid gland &lt;0.2 mL/min/gland after 2% citrate&#xD;
                  stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Abnormal (99m)TcO4 scintiscan (reduced or absent uptake of (99m)TcO4) for the&#xD;
                  targeted parotid gland in the following circumstance: A (99m)TcO4 scintiscan will&#xD;
                  only be performed and used to determine eligibility if the isotope is available.&#xD;
                  If the isotope is not available, this inclusion criterion is not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Abnormal sialogram (an altered ductal network with sialectasis) for the targeted&#xD;
                  parotid gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. No current evidence of malignancy by otolaryngology assessment, including a&#xD;
                  clinical history, nasopharyngolaryngoscopy, and negative CT or PET scan (e.g.&#xD;
                  reference 58).&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Absence of shedding wild type adenovirus in the saliva sample collected from the&#xD;
                  targeted gland at the pre-dose visit 1. Specifically, an aliquot of the pre-dose&#xD;
                  visit 1 saliva sample from the target parotid gland will be used to infect A549&#xD;
                  cells to test for the presence of shedding WT Ad virus. If infectious virus&#xD;
                  emerges during the subsequent 7-10 day follow-up period, then the participant&#xD;
                  will no longer be eligible for treatment and will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
                  However, if no cytopathic effects are observed over a 7-10 day period, the&#xD;
                  participant may be treated provided all other eligibility criteria are met. If&#xD;
                  stimulated saliva cannot be collected at the pre-dose visit 1, this inclusion&#xD;
                  criterion is not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Must be disease-free for at least 5 years, with the disease-free interval&#xD;
                  calculated from date of last cancer treatment (i.e., date of last radiation,&#xD;
                  chemotherapy or surgery) to date of pre-dose visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Willingness to practice the required birth control method (&quot;barrier&quot;&#xD;
                  contraception, i.e., condoms, diaphragm) until AdhAQP1 is no longer detectable in&#xD;
                  their serum or saliva. Women who cannot bear children (post menopausal or due to&#xD;
                  a surgical intervention) also will be required to practice barrier birth control&#xD;
                  methods until AdhAQP1 is no longer detectable in their serum or saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Able to stay at the NIH hospital for the period of time necessary to complete&#xD;
                  each on-site phase of the protocol.&#xD;
