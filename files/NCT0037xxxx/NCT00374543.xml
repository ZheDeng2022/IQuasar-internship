      This study proposes to examine the potential safety and efficacy of ziprasidone for patients&#xD;
      with anxiety and bipolar disorder on anxiety outcomes, bipolar symptoms, and on measures of&#xD;
      quality of life and resilience.&#xD;

      This study would be the first prospective, placebo-controlled study to our knowledge of any&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy strategy for the treatment of comorbid generalized anxiety (or any comorbid&#xD;
      anxiety) in patients with bipolar disorder. Our hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ziprasidone flexibly dosed from 40 to 160 mg/day will reduce anxiety symptoms&#xD;
           significantly more than placebo in patients with bipolar disorder who have a full or&#xD;
           subsyndromal diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ziprasidone will be well tolerated in patients with generalized anxiety based on the&#xD;
           incidence of treatment emergent adverse effects during 8 weeks of therapy, and based on&#xD;
           a lack of worsening of bipolar depression, mania or hypomania compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment with ziprasidone will have a significantly greater positive impact on measures&#xD;
           of quality of life and resilience than placebo.&#xD;

    <description>The 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) (Hamilton, 1959) was developed to assess anxiety in a clinical population. It is considered a measure of general anxiety across anxiety disorders, in addition to being a gold standard measure for GAD.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Numerous attempts were made to increase enrollment since study inception. Researchers made use of Radio, Internet and print ads, as well as weekly Internet postings. Researchers also circulated an IRB-approved GAD checklist in a Bipolar Clinic waiting area in order to increase enrollment and recruit a clinically relevant sample.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of thirteen individuals signed consent, but only three were randomized to the study arms. The other ten participants were excluded from the study for meeting various exclusion criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)</title>
          <description>The 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) (Hamilton, 1959) was developed to assess anxiety in a clinical population. It is considered a measure of general anxiety across anxiety disorders, in addition to being a gold standard measure for GAD.&#xD;
Due to study termination, there are not results for primary and secondary outcome measures.</description>
          <population>Zero participants were analyzed because recruitment was very low. Due to this, we felt any analysis done would not be usable for accurate analyses.</population>
