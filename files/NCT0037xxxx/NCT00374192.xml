      To examine the change in sleep patterns and mood symptoms in response to eszopiclone&#xD;
      (Lunesta) using a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study design in perimenopausal&#xD;
      and postmenopausal women who experience insomnia, mild depression and/or anxiety.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a double-blinded placebo-controlled cross-over study that will be&#xD;
      completed at the MGH site. It is an 11-week study of insomnia, mild mood, and anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women age 40 years or older. Subjects who are enrolled&#xD;
      will have 5 office visits during the 11-week long study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies have identified female gender as a strong risk factor for insomnia, (Ford &amp;&#xD;
      Kamerow, 1989; Klink et al, 1992; Li et al, 2002);community-based studies that examined&#xD;
      gender differences in insomnia complaints have consistently shown a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      insomnia among women than among men. It has been hypothesized that insomnia might be an&#xD;
      overlooked complaint among women seeking treatment in the primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insomnia and other sleep disturbances may be reported during specific situations associated&#xD;
      with the female reproductive cycle, such as pregnancy (Sahota et al, 2003) and menopause&#xD;
      (Joffe et al, 2003). Complaints of sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia are among the&#xD;
      most common symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women. This sleep disturbance frequently&#xD;
      co-occurs with hot flushes and depression symptoms. The menopausal transition is also a&#xD;
      period of heightened vulnerability to mood and anxiety disturbances, and significant&#xD;
      vasomotor symptoms (i.e. hot flushes and night sweats) which may affect functioning and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented subjects will track their sleep patterns for one week using a sleep diary to&#xD;
      confirm that they have either difficulty initiating sleep (³ 30 minutes) or difficulty&#xD;
      maintaining sleep (wake time after sleep onset ³ 30), for ≥ 3 nights during 7-day observation&#xD;
      period. Those who are confirmed to meet these insomnia criteria will be randomized in a&#xD;
      1-to-1 fashion to cross-over treatment starting with either eszopiclone or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to taking the daily medication, and coming to the office visits, subjects will&#xD;
      complete a daily diary throughout the study. This diary is completed to assess insomnia&#xD;
      symptoms throughout the duration of the study. Treatment assignments will be revealed at&#xD;
      final study visit to the participant, research coordinator, and study physician.&#xD;
