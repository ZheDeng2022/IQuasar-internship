  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the exercise capacity of patients with complete&#xD;
      heart block who are chronically being paced from the right ventricle. Also, we hope to&#xD;
      correlate the level of uncoordinated contraction with the patients exercise capacity. We will&#xD;
      enroll patients with complete heart block as diagnosed by standard electrocardiographic means&#xD;
      and now have a permanent pacemaker. All patients we approach for this study will receive an&#xD;
      echocardiogram to assess their heart function. As part of the echocardiogram, they will also&#xD;
      receive a Tissue Synchronization Imaging (TSI) evaluation to assess the level of&#xD;
      uncoordinated contraction they have. The patients will then be subjected to a cardiac&#xD;
      exercise stress test which will involve them running on a treadmill until they cannot&#xD;
      continue while data is collected regarding their heart's response to exercise. All portions&#xD;
      of the study are noninvasive, which means they work from probes and monitors outside the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In third degree, or complete atrioventricular (AV) block, atrial electrical impulses fail to&#xD;
      conduct to the ventricles. Congenital complete AV block (CCAVB) has an incidence of 1 in&#xD;
      15,000 to 1 in 25,000 live births and has a strong association with maternal antibodies.&#xD;
      Patients with isolated CCAVB range from completely asymptomatic to experiencing syncope,&#xD;
      exercise intolerance or congestive heart failure. A portion of the symptoms attributable to&#xD;
      CCAVB are secondary to the inability to increase heart rate, and hence cardiac output, in&#xD;
      response to varying physiologic demands. For symptomatic patients, the mainstay of therapy&#xD;
      has been cardiac pacing. Dual chamber pacing, with atrial sensing and ventricular pacing,&#xD;
      allows for restoration of physiologic heart rates and response to exercise or increased&#xD;
      metabolic demands. Resumption of AV synchrony allows for more efficient ventricular filling.&#xD;
      Overall, pacing in patients with CCAVB would be expected to result in improved cardiac&#xD;
      function and exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional ventricular site for pacing in patients with CCAVB has been the right&#xD;
      ventricular apex (RVA). This results in interventricular dyssynchrony as pacing first&#xD;
      stimulates the right ventricle, rather than the typical midline ventricular activation&#xD;
      pattern seen in patients with intact AV node conduction. Mounting evidence shows that long&#xD;
      term RV pacing results in morphologic changes to the LV with resultant compromised&#xD;
      performance. Further studies have shown that chronic RV pacing diminishes exercise capacity&#xD;
      in patients with heart failure as well as asymptomatic adults. There have been studies, by&#xD;
      our group in particular, that have documented ventricular changes in the paced pediatric&#xD;
      patient. No published study has examined the possible deleterious effects of RV pacing on&#xD;
      exercise capacity in children. We, therefore, propose to do a detailed evaluation of exercise&#xD;
      performance, as measured by exercise duration, maximal heart rate, oxygen uptake and&#xD;
      ventilatory response, in asymptomatic chronically RV paced children and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To describe the effects of dyssynchronous ventricular activation on exercise&#xD;
      performance in children requiring long term RV pacing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Long term dyssynchronous electromechanical activation, secondary to right&#xD;
      ventricular apical pacing, has deleterious effects on the exercise capacity of asymptomatic&#xD;
      pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To correlate changes in exercise performance with tissue Doppler indices of&#xD;
      mechanical dyssynchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Tissue Doppler is a sensitive means of evaluating dyssynchrony in chronically&#xD;
      paced patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance The goal of pacemaker therapy for CCAVB is to restore, as closely&#xD;
      as can be approximated, physiologic rates and activation. Standard dual chamber pacing allows&#xD;
      for sinus node participation in cardiac conduction. As a result, a more physiologic&#xD;
      chronotropic response to exercise and AV conduction could be achieved. Indeed, prior studies&#xD;
      concluded that dual chambered pacing resulted in increased exercise performance and improved&#xD;
      perception of general well being as compared to ventricular demand pacing [1-3]. There is,&#xD;
      however, increasing evidence that long term RVA pacing leads to detrimental effects on&#xD;
      cardiac function secondary to the non-physiologic ventricular activation sequence. Animal&#xD;
      studies have revealed regional left ventricular changes in perfusion, function and&#xD;
      innervation in chronically RVA paced subjects as well as asymmetric hypertrophy of the LV&#xD;
      wall [4,5]. Examinations of patients with inter/intraventricular dyssynchrony reveal a loss&#xD;
      of coordination of ventricular contraction and relaxation. When the RV is the initial site of&#xD;
      activation, portions of the LV are prematurely activated resulting in early segmental&#xD;
      contraction at a low pressure with dissipation of energy and no resultant ejection, while the&#xD;
      areas that activate later do so at higher stress and effect a paradoxical stretch on earlier&#xD;
      contracted areas [6]. These factors lead to decreased efficiency and diminished systolic&#xD;
      function. Ventricular dyssynchrony impairs LV pressure generation, diastolic filling and&#xD;
      stroke volume, as well as, increasing wall stress [7]. Tissue Doppler echocardiography has&#xD;
      recently proven to be a valuable tool in assessing and verifying regional wall motion&#xD;
      abnormalities and aberrant LV activation by its ability to determine peak systolic velocity&#xD;
      of different myocardial regions, degree of myocardial deformation and distinguish between&#xD;
      active systolic contraction and passive displacement [8,6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognizing the less-than-optimal long term functional and hemodynamic effects of RVA pacing,&#xD;
      prior investigators have attempted to utilize alternative RV pacing sites with variable&#xD;
      success in improving LV function [9,10]. Most evidence, however, indicates that dyssynchrony&#xD;
      results in maladaptive ventricular remodeling compromised function and decreased exercise&#xD;
      capacity [11,12]. Evaluation of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction delay has&#xD;
      yielded ample evidence of the deleterious effects of dysscynchronous ventricular activation.&#xD;
      Conversely, the positive response to the restoration of ventricular synchrony via&#xD;
      bi-ventricular pacing has further highlighted the negative effects of ventricular&#xD;
      dyysynchrony. In this subset of patients, acute biventricular pacing, as compared to RV&#xD;
      pacing, demonstrated increases in systolic function and ejection fraction, along with&#xD;
      decreased mitral insufficiency and LV volumes [13]. Resynchronization positively influences&#xD;
      reverse remodeling with significant reductions in LV end systolic and LV end diastolic&#xD;
      volumes and left atrial size - changes that appear permanent [7]. Resynchronization has also&#xD;
      been implicated in improved exercise capability, peak oxygen uptake and improved quality of&#xD;
      life measures [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      With established evidence of maladaptive changes to cardiac morphology and function, plus&#xD;
      emerging evidence of adversely effected exercise capacity in adults with chronic RVA pacing,&#xD;
      it is necessary to investigate the possible aberrancy in exercise capacity in the RVA paced&#xD;
      pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 10 and 21 years of age seen at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Sibley&#xD;
      Heart Center satisfying the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Structurally normal heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Congenital complete heart block&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dual chamber, right ventricular apex paced&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal function via traditional transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of preexisting condition that precludes patient from exercise All participating&#xD;
           subjects and their parents (if applicable) will be required to sign an informed consent&#xD;
           prior to any study procedure. Patients with repaired or palliated congenital heart&#xD;
           disease will be excluded from the study. We anticipate enrolling 30 patients for this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be a single center, prospective, pilot examination of exercise&#xD;
      capacity in pediatric patients requiring right ventricular apical pacing. We will assess the&#xD;
      effects of chronic ventricular dyssynchrony on exercise duration, oxygen uptake and&#xD;
      ventilatory response to exercise. All subjects will be extracted from active patients of the&#xD;
      Children's Healthcare of Atlanta/ Sibley Heart Center pacemaker clinic, being followed for&#xD;
      CCAVB and dual chamber RVA pacing. All participants will be required to sign an informed&#xD;
      consent prior to a procedures. Patients with palliated or corrected congenital heart disease&#xD;
      will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Echocardiographic Assessment: all participants will receive a standard 2-dimensional&#xD;
           M-mode and Doppler evaluation. We will assess cardiac function using left ventricular&#xD;
           shortening fraction and ejection fractions. Tissue Doppler imaging will be utilized to&#xD;
           evaluate ventricular synchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exercise Testing: Using a modified Bruce treadmill protocol, with staged increases in&#xD;
           belt speed and incline, the subject's duration of exercise, work, oxygen uptake, maximal&#xD;
           heart rate, blood pressure and ventilatory responses will be measured. The procedure&#xD;
           will take place at the exercise laboratory at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at&#xD;
           Egleston, utilizing the customary staff. There will be physician attendance for all&#xD;
           procedures. Analysis of the exercise results will be conducted by an attending pediatric&#xD;
           cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical Assessment: Clinical evaluation will be performed during routine pacemaker&#xD;
           clinic visit, during treadmill exercise testing and at subsequent routine pacemaker&#xD;
           clinic visits. The information gained from this study will not be used for individual&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Regimens After eligibility is established and baseline assessment completed, consenting&#xD;
      patients will undergo exercise treadmill testing. Using established CHOA protocols, max heart&#xD;
      rate, oxygen uptake, blood pressure and ventilatory changes will be measured during the test.&#xD;
      Subjects will then return to their usual and customary cardiac follow up schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Monitoring of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) is an important&#xD;
      aspect of data collection in this study. Families will be questioned about possible AEs&#xD;
      follow up survey and asked to notify clinical staff of any AE, illness, medical procedure or&#xD;
      hospitalization. The duration after the completion of all study procedures for which AE's&#xD;
      will be recorded will be one month. One month will be a sufficient time to capture all&#xD;
      possible AE's given that most potential AE's would occur in the immediate testing period. An&#xD;
      adverse event case report form (CRF) will be created to capture any medical symptoms&#xD;
      experienced since the exercise test to solicit unexpected AEs. For any adverse experience&#xD;
      reported during the study, the nature, duration, intensity and any remedial action will be&#xD;
      recorded. Serious AEs (life-threatening, requiring hospitalization) will be reported to the&#xD;
      IRB within 48 hours of notification. The Research Coordinator in conjunction with the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator will collect the adverse experiences from the medical record/subject.&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator will determine the seriousness of each adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations We anticipate analyzing the obtained data utilizing analysis of&#xD;
      covariance (ANCOVA). The independent variable will be the group assignment (healthy vs paced&#xD;
      patients) and the co-variable being added to the model is age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and Patient Safety This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical&#xD;
      principals that have their base in the Declaration of Helsinki and will be conducted with&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol, any amendments and the subject&#xD;
      informed consent will receive Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval prior to initiation.&#xD;
      During the conduct of the study, all adverse events will be reported to the IRB during the&#xD;
      renewal period however, adverse events classified as serious (SAEs) will be reported within&#xD;
      24 hour of knowing of the occurrence to the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Freely given written informed consent including patient authorization per HIPAA guidelines&#xD;
      will be obtained from every subject, parent or legal guardian prior to the initiation of any&#xD;
      study procedures. A copy of all consent documents will be provided to the parent or legal&#xD;
      guardian. The rights, safety and well-being of the trial subjects are the most important&#xD;
      considerations and will prevail over interests of science and society.&#xD;
