    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to find out how effective Narrow Band-Ultraviolet Light B&#xD;
      (NB-UVB) phototherapy is in treating oral cGVHD. NB-UVB Phototherapy involves exposing the&#xD;
      inside of the mouth to light of a particular spectrum (a specific wavelength of light, 311nm)&#xD;
      of the ultraviolet band, called NB-UVB. It is known that narrow band ultraviolet light&#xD;
      therapy can improve symptoms in patients with skin chronic GVHD.&#xD;

      -  At the first visit the following information will be collected about the participant:&#xD;
           original diagnosis, the date and type of transplant, transplant conditioning regimen,&#xD;
           cGVHD prophylaxis regimen, the time when oral cGVHD was first noticed, specific&#xD;
           treatments for oral cGVHD, and any current medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each visit, and before the participant begins phototherapy treatment, they will&#xD;
           answer a series of questions asking about how their mouth feels and what they are able&#xD;
           to eat. A clinical examination of the mouth will be performed and recorded and&#xD;
           photographs will be taken of the inside of the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then receive phototherapy treatment. This will take approximately&#xD;
           three minutes and will involve opening the mouth and closing the eyes. Following&#xD;
           phototherapy, the participant will be asked several questions on how they tolerated the&#xD;
           treatment. Phototherapy treatments will be done two or three times per week for a total&#xD;
           of 24 treatments. After each treatment, if the participant has not experienced any&#xD;
           discomfort, the phototherapy dose will be increased following a specific protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 24 treatments the participant will have the option to continue phototherapy&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
