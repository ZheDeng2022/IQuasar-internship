  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with depression and cognitive impairment. When&#xD;
      depression ameliorates due to treatment, homocysteine serum levels often normalize. Aim of&#xD;
      the present study is to investigate, whether repeated ECT treatment leads to changes in&#xD;
      homocysteine levels and if these changes are associated with the occurrence of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment after ECS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients suffering from therapy-resistant depression shall be enrolled. Patients are&#xD;
      treated with repeated ECT (three times the week). Before, directly after and one day after&#xD;
      ECT treatment, blood samples are drawn and patients receive cognitive testing. Depressive&#xD;
      symptomatology is checked with different rating scales.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevated homocysteine levels have been found in depressive disorders. The modulating effects&#xD;
      of homocysteine on glutamatergic neurotransmission have been discussed to be an underlying&#xD;
      cause of depression and can also lead to cognitive impairment and may facilitate seizures.&#xD;
      Electroconvulsive therapy is the most effective treatment for depression, but often leads to&#xD;
      cognitive impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homocysteine levels normalize during rECT. This normalization is associated with the clinical&#xD;
      improvement of depression. Short term changes in homocysteine levels (i.e. increase directly&#xD;
      after ECT) may explain the cognitive impairments of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients with therapy-resistant depressive disorder are to be enrolled into the trial.&#xD;
      Patients are treated with rECT, two to three times a week. Blood withdrawal and psychometric&#xD;
      analysis will be performed before, directly after and one day after ECT treatment&#xD;
      1,4,7,10,(13). Necessity of further treatment will be checked after the first 6 ECTs.&#xD;
