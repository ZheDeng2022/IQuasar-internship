  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal pains represent a major part of pain complaints in patients. Moreover, the&#xD;
      treatment of musculoskeletal pain conditions by currently available drugs is not optimal&#xD;
      (Curatolo and Bogduk 2001). Thus, deep pain is a diagnostic and therapeutic problem, and&#xD;
      further insights into the peripheral and central neurophysiologic mechanisms are necessary to&#xD;
      improve diagnosis and therapy and to implement a mechanism-based approach. Peripheral&#xD;
      sensitization and central hyper excitability are, most likely the important factors for&#xD;
      chronic musculoskeletal pain and in particular osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of this project is to study the involvement of peripheral and central sensitization&#xD;
      underlying deep tissue hyperalgesia and referred pain in male and female OA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate quantitative sensory testing assessment techniques for measuring hyper excitability&#xD;
      are needed to investigate, in more detail the mechanisms involved in generating the&#xD;
      sensitization in OA patients.&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      General procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Outpatient Department of Clinic Farsoe, Northern Orthopaedic Division patients&#xD;
      eligible for participating in the study will be informed and asked to participate. Those who&#xD;
      agree and sign the informed consent will be scheduled for the investigational procedures to&#xD;
      be performed at the SMI as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the SMI all patients are interviewed and assessed with the following three procedures with&#xD;
      at least 10 minutes between procedures. Duration of visit will be approximately 3 hours in&#xD;
      one session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure pain sensitivity and temporal summation of pressure pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment: computer controlled pressure algometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites: knee, tibialis anterior, forearm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stimulus intensity: pressure pain threshold&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stimuli number: 10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency: ISI 1s&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain rating: pain intensity, pressure pain threshold, unpleasantness and&#xD;
           after-sensations will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure pain sensitivity and temporal summation of pressure are tested on bilateral knee,&#xD;
      tibialis anterior muscle and forearm. Test sites are located and marked according to the&#xD;
      landmark stated below. Pressure pain threshold of these test sites are measured first.&#xD;
      Sequential stimulations are applied to these test sites respectively to test the pain&#xD;
      perception for each press stimulus. Unpleasantness and after-sensations are collected after&#xD;
      cessation of sequential stimulation to evaluate the affective aspect of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven test sites (2 cm proximal to the superior lateral edge of patella, 2 cm proximal to the&#xD;
      superior edge of patella, 2 cm proximal to the superior medial edge of patella, 2 cm distal&#xD;
      to the inferior lateral edge of patella, 2 cm distal to the inferior medial edge of patella,&#xD;
      5 cm lateral to the superior lateral edge of patella and 5 cm medial to the superior medial&#xD;
      edge of patella) are marked around the knee. The site for measuring temporal summation of&#xD;
      pain is the most sensitive site among these five sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test site on the arm is 7 cm distal to the lateral humeral epicondyle on the line&#xD;
      connecting the lateral epicondyle and the styloid process of the radius, located on the&#xD;
      extensor carpi radialis longus muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test site on the leg is at the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle 14 cm distal to the inferior&#xD;
      lateral edge of the patella.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure pain threshold on these test sites are measured. A mechanical pressure stimulus with&#xD;
      gradient of 0.3 kg/s will be applied until the subject reports pain and presses a stop&#xD;
      button. The PPT measurements start from the contralateral knee of the affected knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequential stimulation consists of 10 pressure stimuli (1 sec duration) at the pressure pain&#xD;
      threshold level. Inter-stimulus interval (ISI) is set to 1 sec. Skin contact between the&#xD;
      individual pressure stimuli will be ensured by keeping a constant force of 0.1 kg; i.e.&#xD;
      during the series of sequential stimulation the probe has skin contact and is first withdrawn&#xD;
      after 10 stimulations. The subjects rate the pain intensity continuously during the&#xD;
      sequential stimulation on an electronic visual analogue scale (VAS) on which &quot;0&quot; indicates&#xD;
      &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;10 cm&quot; indicates &quot;maximal pain&quot;. Sequential stimulation is to be applied on&#xD;
      each test site with at least a 1 min interval. The sequence of test sites is chosen in a&#xD;
      randomized way to minimize order effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unpleasantness and after-sensations are collected 15 sec after cessation of sequential&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referred pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment: computer controlled pressure algometer, computer-controlled auto-infusion syringe&#xD;
      pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Site: tibialis anterior&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concentration: 6% hypertonic saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Method: continuous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain rating: pain intensity, pain area drawing (primary and secondary pain area),&#xD;
           pressure pain threshold, unpleasantness and after-sensations will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertonic saline is infused into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle to elicit local and&#xD;
      referred pain. The experiment will be conducted in one leg at a time, by giving a single&#xD;
      bolus infusion of hypertonic saline with a time interval of approximately 20 min between each&#xD;
      leg. Test sites are located and marked on the TA. Pressure pain thresholds on injection site&#xD;
      and front side of ankle are measured before infusion. Hypertonic saline is infused by using a&#xD;
      computer-controlled syringe pump. Subjects report pain intensity and draw the pain area&#xD;
      induced by infusion. Pressure pain thresholds on injection site and front side of ankle are&#xD;
      measured 10 min after infusion- evoked-pain disappears. Unpleasantness and after-sensations&#xD;
      for the evoked pain are collected as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection site is placed at the belly of the TA 14 cm distal to the inferior lateral edge of&#xD;
      the patella on both legs. At the marked site in the TA a 24G - 40 mm needle will be inserted&#xD;
      vertically until a piercing of the muscle fascia is felt, at a depth of approximately 20 mm&#xD;
      from the skin surface. Then the plunger of the syringe will be withdrawn to ensure that the&#xD;
      needle is deep in the muscle and not in a blood vessel. The needle will then be connected&#xD;
      through a polyethylene extension tube (Vygon, France, No. 1155.70) to a 10 ml syringe fitted&#xD;
      in a computer-controlled auto-infusion syringe pump (Terumo Terufusion syringe pump, model&#xD;
      STC-S27, Type CG). A total volume of 0.5 ml sterile 6% hypertonic saline (58.5 mg/ml, Sygehus&#xD;
      Apotekerne, Denmark) will be infused over 20 s into the TA muscle (infusion-rate 90 ml/h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain intensity response is scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS) after the infusion.&#xD;
      The subjects mark the painful region(s) on pain maps after the infusion. Local pain is&#xD;
      defined as the pain area drawn at the infusion site, referred pain is defined as the pain&#xD;
      areas drawn away from the infusion site and radiating pain is defined as the pain areas drawn&#xD;
      radiating from the local site into the other regions of the leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure pain thresholds on injection site and front side of ankle are measured before and 10&#xD;
      min after infusion when infusion evoked pain disappears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unpleasantness and after-sensations for the evoked pain are collected afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cuff pressure pain and DNIC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment: computer controlled cuff algometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Site: upper arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain rating: pain intensity, cuff pressure pain threshold, pressure pain threshold,&#xD;
           unpleasantness and after-sensations collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous cuff pressure stimulation is applied to measure the inhibitory control of the pain&#xD;
      sensory system. Cuff stimulation is applied to bilateral upper arms and tibialis anterior&#xD;
      (location see procedure 1). Pressure pain threshold on the test sites around knee, on the&#xD;
      ipsilateral and contralateral arm (on the belly of biceps brachii) are measured before,&#xD;
      during and after cuff pressure stimulation. Cuff pressure stimulation is applied by&#xD;
      computer-controlled cuff algometer to induce continuous pain perception for 10 min. Pain&#xD;
      intensity of ongoing pain in the stimulated limb and affected knee are rated on electrical&#xD;
      VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cuff is wrapped around the middle of both arms. The lower rim of the tourniquet cuff (7.5&#xD;
      cm wide) is at least 3 cm proximal to the cubital fossa. The setup of the cuff algometer is&#xD;
      programmed to stop the pressure increase at a preset pain intensity of 4 cm on the VAS and to&#xD;
      automatically adjust the pressure to maintain the obtained pain within ±0.5 cm VAS for 10 min&#xD;
      or until the subject presses the stop button. If the pain increases over the upper pain&#xD;
      limit, the system decreases the pressure until the pain returns into the 'target' zone and&#xD;
      vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the VAS rise up to 4 cm and keep constant for 1 min, we will measure PPTs on the same&#xD;
      test sites except tested arm. Pain intensity of ongoing pain in affected knee and arm which&#xD;
      is not stimulated is rated on another electrical VAS during cuff pressure stimulation. Five&#xD;
      minutes following deflation, pain intensity of ongoing pain in affected knee and arms is&#xD;
      rated. Fifteen minutes following deflation, PPTs are measured on the test sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequence of test limb is chosen at random to minimize order effects.&#xD;
