  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether locally advanced breast cancer&#xD;
      responds (by shrinking, by not progressing or by being destroyed) to combined chemotherapy&#xD;
      (gemcitabine, epirubicin and paclitaxel) given before surgery to patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer. This study will also evaluate the toxicity of the chemotherapy&#xD;
      combination to patients and will determine survival and progression-free survival 2 years&#xD;
      after treatment. Also, the study will look at whether there are molecular and genetic changes&#xD;
      in the tumor tissue that match the tumor's response to the chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary chemotherapy has had an established role in locally advanced breast cancer. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that the combination of chemotherapeutic agents is superior to single therapeutic&#xD;
      agent in overall response rate and progression free survival. The inclusion of the most&#xD;
      active drugs in combination regimens can improve the percentage of patients achieving a&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR). The chemotherapy agents gemcitabine, epirubicin, and&#xD;
      paclitaxel have been used individually to treat breast cancer. While use of the combination&#xD;
      of these three drugs has been studied in the metastatic setting, the combination has not been&#xD;
      evaluated in locally advanced disease. In this study the combination of the three agents&#xD;
      gemcitabine, epirubicin, and paclitaxel [Taxol] will be administered to patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer prior to surgery; pathologic response will be determined at the time&#xD;
      of surgery. The main objective of this study is to determine the pathological response rate&#xD;
      for these patients. Also because prior studies have suggested that only a specific subset of&#xD;
      tumors responds to a specific chemotherapeutic agent and that this subset is determined by&#xD;
      the gene expression profile of each tumor, preoperative therapy protocols such as this&#xD;
      provide an ideal setting to identify gene expression pattern and gene copy number changes&#xD;
      that may predict response to a specific therapy using high-throughput assay methods and&#xD;
      RNAlater. Therefore, this study will also look at the feasibility of tissue collection and&#xD;
      analysis in identifying predictive markers of complete pathological response.&#xD;
