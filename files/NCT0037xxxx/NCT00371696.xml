  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to provide essential pilot data on the feasibility of conducting&#xD;
      n-of-1 trials within secondary care within the UK, notably to: test the process of&#xD;
      recruitment and design aspects of such trials; assess the acceptability of this research&#xD;
      method to patients, explore the experiences of patients involved; determine the most&#xD;
      appropriate treatment for individual patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whilst the large scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) remains the scientific &quot;gold&#xD;
      standard&quot; for evaluating therapies in clinical medicine, the assumption made, that the&#xD;
      treatment effect demonstrated is generalisable and applicable to all patients, is unlikely to&#xD;
      be true. There will inevitably be some patients who benefit from a particular treatment more&#xD;
      than others. N-of-1 trials are a means of conducting RCTs in individual patients with the&#xD;
      added opportunity to use patient generated outcome measures. Patients act as their own&#xD;
      control and receive all treatments under comparison, more than once, in a random sequence.&#xD;
      While n-of-1 trial methodology is reasonably well specified they remain under-exploited and&#xD;
      little is known about the process aspects of conducting such trials or the experiences and&#xD;
      views of those who participate in them. The time commitment by patients and health&#xD;
      professionals is not inconsiderable and there may well be particular problems with&#xD;
      recruitment and drop out. N-of-1 trials rely on co-operation between individual clinicians&#xD;
      and patients, however, no work has been undertaken to explore the ways in which&#xD;
      patient-practitioner relationships and their experiences and views influence the progress and&#xD;
      outcome of n-of-1 trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with confirmed osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, selected for a mix of gender, age,&#xD;
      weight, will be recruited to the n-of-1 trials to compare either, an NSAID (diclofenac) with&#xD;
      simple analgesic (paracetamol) or a standard knee support with a heat retaining support.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a (1 hour) semi-structured interview before the trial commences and&#xD;
      once the trial is completed or terminated. Patients treated with supports/drugs will receive&#xD;
      each treatment for a period of one/two weeks respectively, for 3 cycles (order determined at&#xD;
      random). Patients will complete daily diaries including standard patient questionnaires and a&#xD;
      patient generated outcome measure. Qualitative interviews and observational methods will be&#xD;
      employed to study practitioner/ patient relationships; decision to participate; expectations&#xD;
      and experience; appropriateness and acceptability of research design and measures. Patients&#xD;
      declining to take part will be approached to explore reasons for not participating.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients attending clinics in the North Bristol Health Care Trust, with confirmed OA&#xD;
             of the knee (Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic score of 2-4 within the previous 12&#xD;
             months) and use-related pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had received corticosteroid injections or operations on their knee in the&#xD;
             previous six months were excluded. Those with known contraindications to paracetamol&#xD;
             or any NSAID, and those taking steroids, warfarin or aspirin for another medical&#xD;
             condition were excluded from the drug trials.&#xD;
