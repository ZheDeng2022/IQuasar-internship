  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing chest surgery (thoracotomy) often develop shoulder pain after their&#xD;
      operation despite epidural pain control of the incision. We plan to study the incidence of&#xD;
      this phenomenon in our institution to determine whether there are patterns that may predict&#xD;
      those persons at highest risk of developing this type of pain. Further, we hope to determine&#xD;
      whether newer surgical techniques have an impact on the development of this type of pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing thoracic surgery often benefit from aggressive post-operative pain&#xD;
      management including thoracic epidural analgesia (1). However, a significant number of&#xD;
      patients develop shoulder tip pain (SP) refractory to epidural analgesia. The incidence of&#xD;
      post-thoracotomy ISTP has been noted in association with treatment studies to be high, as&#xD;
      much as 88% of patients having thoracotomy for lobectomy (2). The actual incidence of SP has&#xD;
      not been systematically studied. We propose to prospectively study all thoracotomy patients&#xD;
      for a period of six months. The goal of this study is to determine the incidence of&#xD;
      post-thoracotomy SP and to identify predictive factors. Further, we hope to elucidate the&#xD;
      incidence of SP associated with newer minimally invasive surgical procedures such as&#xD;
      video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for lobectomy. This will facilitate early identification&#xD;
      of the patients most likely to benefit from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures requiring thoracotomy including video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) be&#xD;
      included. The following non-nominal information will be collected:1. demographic data- age,&#xD;
      sex, BMI, 2. presence/absence and tip position of epidural catheter3. type of surgery and&#xD;
      duration of surgery4. surgeon5. inta-operative analgesia6. epidural infusion and rate7.&#xD;
      position and number of chest drains8. pain assessment9. co-morbid conditions- diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, coronary artery disease, pulmonary disease (obstructive/restrictive), arthritis&#xD;
      (rheumatoid/osteo)10. pre-existing pain conditions 11. treatment for ISTPPatients will be&#xD;
      separated into two groups for assessment of SP. The two groups will consist of patients with&#xD;
      functional epidural analgesia (group E) and those without epidural catheters or with&#xD;
      non-functioning epidural catheters (group NE). Epidural catheter level will be determined&#xD;
      using nerve stimulation (Tsui test) prior to induction of anesthesia. Upon arrival to the&#xD;
      Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU), patients in group E will be assessed for incision pain and&#xD;
      shoulder tip pain. Epidural catheter function will be assessed by pinprick testing to assess&#xD;
      the function of the anesthetic. In patients experiencing incisional pain and in whom nerve&#xD;
      stimulation indicates positioning of the epidural catheter in the epidural space (stimulation&#xD;
      at 1.1-10 mA), 4 millilitres of 2% lidocaine will be infused through the epidural catheter.&#xD;
      Incision pain and anesthetic level will be reassessed after 10 minutes. The catheter will be&#xD;
      considered non-functional if no improvement in incisional pain is noted 10 minutes after&#xD;
      infusion of the 2% lidocaine. Time 0 will be the time at which incisional pain is determined&#xD;
      by pinprick testing to be absent. This may be immediately on arrival to PACU or 10 minutes&#xD;
      after instillation of 2% lidocaine. Standard epidural infusions of bupivacaine 0.1% plus&#xD;
      hydromorphone 0.015mg/ml or ropivacaine 0.1% will be continued. Management of SP will be at&#xD;
      the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist and the Acute Pain Service. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed daily until resolution of the SP or hospital discharge. Patients with ongoing ISTP&#xD;
      at discharge will be followed by telephone weekly for 3 months or until the pain resolves,&#xD;
      whichever is earlier. Patients in group NE will also be assessed for incision and shoulder&#xD;
      tip pain upon arrival to the PACU. VAS and VRS will be obtained after the initial nursing&#xD;
      assessment. This will be recorded as time 0. Patients will be asked to identify the area of&#xD;
      greatest pain. They will then be asked specifically about shoulder tip pain. VRS and VAS&#xD;
      scores will be recorded for 1) incision pain, 2) ipsilateral shoulder pain 3) contralateral&#xD;
      shoulder pain and 4) area of greatest pain if different from 1,2and 3. Management of pain&#xD;
      will be at the discretion of the anesthesiologist and the Acute Pain Service. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed until the resolution of their pain or until discharge. Patients with ongoing SP&#xD;
      at discharge will be followed by telephone weekly for three months or until the pain&#xD;
      resolves, whichever is earlier.&#xD;
