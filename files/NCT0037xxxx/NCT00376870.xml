  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restenosis requiring reintervention is still a limitation of percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      angioplasty. Despite the use of Drug eluting stent (DES), the rate of restenosis remains 7%&#xD;
      to 16% in diabetic patients, making it a challenging problem in interventional cardiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Still, in clinical trials, most of these attempts did not successfully limit neointimal&#xD;
      formation after coronary stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), like pioglitazone (pio) or rosiglitazone, are a novel class of&#xD;
      oral antidiabetic agents currently used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These agents increase insulin sensitivity and, as such, have favorable effects on blood&#xD;
      glucose levels and the lipid profile in treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond their metabolic action, TZDs have been shown to exhibit antiinflammatory and&#xD;
      antiatherogenic effects in vascular cells in vitro and to limit lesion development in various&#xD;
      animal models of arteriosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, TZDs inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration, 2 critical processes in neointimal&#xD;
      formation after coronary stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from rodent models suggest that TZDs limit intimal proliferation after vascular injury,&#xD;
      and in clinical studies with type 2 diabetic coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, TZDs&#xD;
      have been shown to reduce neointimal formation as well as restenosis after coronary stent&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Still, it remains unclear to what extend these effects depend on the metabolic action of&#xD;
      these drugs and what might mainly be due to the improvement in glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a few reports on prevention of restenosis in type 2 diabetic patients (T2DM) with&#xD;
      the use of TZDs as been published. All of them uses BMS as endoprosthetic devices. None of&#xD;
      these evaluated the use of TZDs in combination with DES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of pioglitazone in prevention of in-stent&#xD;
      restenosis after successful implantation of a sirolimus-eluting coronary stent for treatment&#xD;
      of de-novo &quot;complex&quot; coronary vessel disease in patients with T2DM and stable coronary artery&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study primary end-point are late-loss at 9 months.Secondary end-point include binary&#xD;
      restenosis MACE at 1, 9 and 12 month, stent thrombosis at 12 months.&#xD;

      2.Design This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multicenter centre&#xD;
      study.The patients' clinical data will be recorded on case report forms (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.Aim of the study To evaluate the efficacy of Pioglitazone (30 mg/daily) therapy on in-stent&#xD;
      late luminal loss in T2DM patients treated with sirolimus-eluting stent for a complex lesion.&#xD;
      Both Pioglitazone and matched Placebo will be provided by Takeda Global Research &amp;&#xD;
      Development (TGRD), London, UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.Primary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point is defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-stent late luminal loss after 9 months of implant procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2.Secondary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary end-points are defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binary restenosis (defined as in-segment stenosis of at least 50 percent on follow-up&#xD;
           angiography)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within discharge, 30 days, 6 and 12&#xD;
           months after implant procedure. The major adverse events are described as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cardiac death;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recurrent Myocardial infarction (Q-wave and non-Q wave)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of STENT Thrombosis classified by the ARC definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  definite, probable, or possible&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute (0 to 24 hours after stent implantation), Subacute ( &gt;24 hours to 30 days),&#xD;
                or Late (&gt;30 to 360 days) and Very Late (&gt; 1 year afer stent implantation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.Study population Sample size is calculated on the basis of results from previous&#xD;
           trials that have examined the effect of TZDs on neointima formation in diabetic&#xD;
           subjects, with late luminal loss in the control group of 0.43±0.45 mm and a&#xD;
           pre-specified 40% reduction in the TZDs group (expected late luminal loss of 0.26±0.28&#xD;
           mm) resulting in 86 lesions per group to achieve statistical significance ([alpha]=0.05,&#xD;
           [beta]=0.2, 2 tailed). Considering a 20% of patients lost in follow-up and a mean of 1.3&#xD;
           lesion for patients treated we will need 80 patients per group. The patients to be&#xD;
           enrolled have to fulfil the inclusion criteria listed below and none of the exclusion&#xD;
           criteria and they have to be enrolled in a consecutive manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.Conduct of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.Screening procedure and enrollment Patients with T2DM, scheduled for angioplasty will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility. If all inclusion criteria are met and no exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      present the patients should be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Randomisation procedure After informed written consent is obtained a randomisation number&#xD;
      will be assigned to the patient. A pre-packed blind-label study drug or placebo with a 3&#xD;
      months dose will be assigned to the patient. The first dose will be administered before the&#xD;
      implant procedure and continued for 9 months. Randomisation code will be stored in a safe&#xD;
      place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Stenting procedure Stents can be implanted after lesion predilatation, or using direct&#xD;
      stenting technique, performed at the discretion of the operator. After checking the correct&#xD;
      position, stent should be inflated and deployed with a single inflation. Residual stenosis,&#xD;
      after the stent implant, must be less than 10%. If needed another stent should be placed&#xD;
      overlapping with former. Post dilatation of the overlapped segment, with a non-compliant&#xD;
      balloon is mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Pharmacological treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aspirin 75 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clopidogrel loading dose of 600 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous GP IIb/IIIa agents will be allowed at the discretion of the operator with the&#xD;
      following doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abciximab 0,25 mg/kg intravenous bolus 10-60 min. before the procedure, followed by a&#xD;
           continuous infusion of 0,125 mg/kg/min for 12-18 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tirofiban 10 mcg/kg intravenous bolus, followed by a continuous infusion of 0, 15&#xD;
           mcg/kg/min for 18-24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eptifibatide 180 mcg/kg intravenous bolus immediately before the procedure, followed by&#xD;
           a continuous infusion of 2 mcg/kg/min (in patients with serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl the&#xD;
           infusion should be of 1 mcg/kg/min) and a second bolus of 180 mcg/kg/min 10 min. after&#xD;
           the first bolus. Infusion should be maintained for 18-24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Heparin will be given at the dose of 70-100 U/kg if no GP IIb/IIIa are administered or at a&#xD;
      dose of 50/70 U/Kg if GP IIb/IIIa are administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Aspirin 75 mg/day indefinitely&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Clopidogrel 75 mg/day for 12 months All of the patients will receive standard medical&#xD;
      therapy as judged by the reference cardiologist, including, [beta]-blockers,&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.In hospital and follow-up examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical examination will be performed in all patients enrolled before hospital discharge,&#xD;
      and at 3, 9 and 12 months. The physical evaluation must include an assessment of the&#xD;
      patient's clinical status, including evaluation of ischemia and angina status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient and primary care physicians will be strongly encouraged to keep an &quot;optimal&quot;&#xD;
      control of the glycemia, considering the following recommendation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in life style with increment in physical activity will be suggested for all patients.&#xD;
      The diabetology centre will treat patients with stepwise approach to achieve a possible goal&#xD;
      of HbA1c &lt; 7% and daily glycaemic levels reported in the following table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycemic goals ADA and AACE criteria (1,2) HbA1c 6.5 - 7.0% Fasting / pre-prandial glucose&#xD;
      levels 90 - 130 mg/dl Post-prandial glucose levels 140 - 180 mg/dl Bed time glucose levels&#xD;
      110 - 150 mg/dl&#xD;

&#xD;
             3. if failure (HbA1c&gt;7.0%), OAD combination&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. if failure (HbA1c&gt;7.0%), OAD + basal insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. if failure (HbA1c&gt;7.0%), OAD + multiple daily insulin injections&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. if failure (HbA1c&gt;7.0%), multiple daily insulin injections Starting from point 3,&#xD;
                diabetology centre will decide on the dosing and therapeutic regimens. Type 2&#xD;
                diabetic patients on insulin therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Multiple daily insulin injections, with increasing doses if HbA1c&gt;7.0% The number&#xD;
                of diabetologic follow-up visits will be decided by the usual diabetology care&#xD;
                policy of the centre according to plasma glucose and HbA1c levels&#xD;
&#xD;
                Blood samples: cardiac enzymes (Troponin, CK and CK-MB) should be evaluated before&#xD;
                the procedure and before discharge (CK-MB after 6, 12 and 24 hour and continued if&#xD;
                abnormal till normalization).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Metabolic and inflammatory indices will be analysed before discharge and at 3, 9&#xD;
                and 12 months follow-up. Among them will be evaluated: fasting glucose, fasting&#xD;
                insulin, HbA1c, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,&#xD;
                APO-a/APO-b, Hs-CRP, CD40L, Adiponectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Scheduled follow-up visit&#xD;
&#xD;
                Patients will be contacted by phone at 30 days and 6 months follow-up and they will&#xD;
                undergo clinical evaluation after 3, 9 and 12 months. At 9 months follow-up,&#xD;
                patients will be scheduled for a repeat angiography.&#xD;

             9. Definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.1 In segment late-luminal loss&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defined as difference between the minimal luminal diameter at the end of the procedure and&#xD;
      the minimal luminal diameter at 9 months follow-up in the target lesion or either edge (5mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 Major Adverse Cardiac Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Myocardial infarction: Chest pain persisting for &gt; 30 minutes associated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ST segment elevation of at least 0.1 mV in two or more contiguous leads; or true posterior MI&#xD;
      with ST segment depression of at least 0.1 mV in leads V1 through V3; or new left bundle&#xD;
      branch block; and elevation of CK-MB or CK more than two times upper limit of normal.&#xD;
      Periprocedural myocardial infarction is defind by &gt; 3 times ULN rise in troponin or CK-MB&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac death: all deaths occurring during the study are considered cardiac related unless&#xD;
      clinical assessment can establish an unequivocal non-cardiac cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-infarction: a diagnosis of a new myocardial infarction is clinically defined on the basis&#xD;
      of ECG or enzymatic doses if one of the following criteria is met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Detection of new pathological Q-waves not present on baseline ECG according to the&#xD;
           Minnesota Code.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enzyme changes defined by more than two times upper limit of normal CK and the presence&#xD;
           of CK-MB. If the CK-MB is not available, the CK will be accepted as evidence of&#xD;
           myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target lesion revascularization: repeat revascularization (PCI or CABG) in the follow-up&#xD;
      period due to restenosis either in the target lesion or either edge (5mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target vessel revascularization: repeat revascularization (PCI or CABG) in the follow-up&#xD;
      period due to restenosis either within the target lesion or anywhere else in the same&#xD;
      epicardial coronary artery (includes proximal and distal lesions, branches and left main).&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3 Binary restenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defined as in-segment stenosis of at least 50 percent on follow-up angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.4 Thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of definite stent thrombosis required the presence of an acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome with angiographic or autopsy evidence of thrombus or occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probable stent thrombosis included unexplained deaths within 30 days after the procedure or&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction involving the target-vessel territory without angiographic&#xD;
      confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible stent thrombosis included all unexplained deaths occurring 30 days after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.5 Complex Lesion definition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total occlusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long lesions (≥ 28 mm). Two long lesions in series necessitating overlapping stents are&#xD;
           accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  True bifurcation lesions with a side branch greater than or expected to be ≥2.5 mm by&#xD;
           visual estimate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients requiring 4 or more stents in one procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target lesions in a vessels with diameter 2.5 mm by visual estimate which are not&#xD;
           secondary branches such as postero-laterals, diagonals or obtuse marginals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10. Quantitative Coronary Angiography Baseline, postprocedural, and follow-up coronary&#xD;
           angiograms will be digitally recorded and assessed off-line in the angiographic&#xD;
           laboratory with an automated edge-detection system by experienced personnel unaware of&#xD;
           the study drug allocation. The complexity of the lesions will defined according to the&#xD;
           modified grading system of the American College of Cardiology-American Heart&#xD;
           Association16 . The morphologic appearance of in-stent restenosis at follow-up&#xD;
           angiography will be classified according to the system proposed by Mehran et al.17. All&#xD;
           measurements will be performed on cineangiograms recorded after the intracoronary&#xD;
           administration of nitroglycerin. The same single, worst-view projection will be used at&#xD;
           all times. The contrast-filled nontapered catheter tip will be used for calibration. The&#xD;
           reference diameter will be determined by interpolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables that will be measured include the reference diameter of the vessel, the minimal&#xD;
      diameter of the lumen, the extent of stenosis (the difference between the reference diameter&#xD;
      and the minimal luminal diameter, divided by the reference diameter and multiplied by 100),&#xD;
      late luminal loss (the difference between the minimal luminal diameter at the end of the&#xD;
      procedure and the minimal luminal diameter at 9 follow-up), and net luminal gain (the&#xD;
      difference between the minimal luminal diameter at 9 follow-up and the minimal luminal&#xD;
      diameter before the procedure). Quantitative analysis will be used to evaluate the stented&#xD;
      area (&quot;in stent&quot;) and the area that included the stented segment as well as the 5-mm margins&#xD;
      proximal and distal to the stent (&quot;in segment&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. Safety and Tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AE) An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in&#xD;
      a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product; it does not&#xD;
      necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory&#xD;
      finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product,&#xD;
      whether or not it is considered related to the medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Results in DEATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is LIFE THREATENING.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • The term &quot;life threatening&quot; refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of&#xD;
           death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might&#xD;
           have caused death if it were more severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Requires inpatient HOSPITALIZATION or prolongation of existing hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Results in persistent or significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Leads to a CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Is an IMPORTANT MEDICAL EVENT that satisfies any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  May require intervention to prevent items 1 through 5 above.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  May expose the subject to danger, even though the event is not immediately life&#xD;
                threatening or fatal or does not result in hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Includes any event or synonym described in the Takeda Medically Significant List&#xD;
                (Table A):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table A Takeda Medically Significant List Term Acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome Hepatic necrosis Ventricular fibrillation Acute liver failure Torsade de&#xD;
      pointes Anaphylactic shock Malignant hypertension Acute renal failure Convulsive seizures&#xD;
      Pulmonary hypertension Agranulocytosis Pulmonary fibrosis Aplastic anemia Confirmed or&#xD;
      suspected endotoxin shock Toxic epidermal necrolysis Confirmed or suspected transmission of&#xD;
      infectious agent by products Stevens-Johnson syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.3 Severity of AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different categories of intensity (severity) are characterized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject. Moderate: The event causes&#xD;
      the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.4 Causality of AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship of each AE to study drug will be assessed using the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definite: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug&#xD;
      (including the course after treatment withdrawal of the drug) AND that satisfies any of the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reappearance of similar reaction upon readministration (rechallenge).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive results in a drug sensitivity test (skin test, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxic level of the drug revealed by measurement of drug concentrations in blood or&#xD;
           another body fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probable: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug&#xD;
      (including the course after withdrawal of the drug) AND for which involvement of factors&#xD;
      other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs, and&#xD;
      concurrent treatment can reasonably be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug&#xD;
      (including the course after withdrawal of the drug) AND for which possible involvement of the&#xD;
      drug can be argued although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases,&#xD;
      complications, concomitant drugs, and concurrent treatments also may be responsible. For&#xD;
      example, there have been similar reports in the past, including reports on its analogues, or&#xD;
      the occurrence of the event could be predicted from the pharmacologic actions or chemical&#xD;
      structure of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of&#xD;
      the drug or that can be reasonably explained by other factors, such as underlying diseases,&#xD;
      complications, concomitant drugs, and concurrent treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.5 Relationship to Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship (causality) to study procedures should be determined for AEs. The relationship&#xD;
      should be assessed as &quot;Yes&quot; if the investigator considers that there is reasonable&#xD;
      possibility that an event is due to a study procedures. Otherwise, the relationship should be&#xD;
      assessed as &quot;No&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.6 AE Reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, the investigator will assess whether any subjective AEs have occurred. A&#xD;
      neutral question, such as &quot;How have you been feeling since your last visit?&quot; may be asked.&#xD;
      Subjects may report AEs occurring at any other time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study&#xD;
      medication or not, must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant&#xD;
      changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or until there is a satisfactory&#xD;
      explanation for the changes observed. All AEs will be documented in the AE page of the CRF,&#xD;
      whether or not the investigator concludes that the event is related to the drug treatment.&#xD;
      The following information will be documented for each event:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Event term.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start and stop date and time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator's opinion of the causal relationship between the event and administration&#xD;
           of study drug(s) (not related, possible, probable, or definite).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator's opinion of the causal relationship to study procedure(s), including the&#xD;
           details of the suspected procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Action concerning study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome of event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.7 Collection and Reporting of SAEs&#xD;
&#xD;
      When an SAE occurs after informed consent through the AE collection period it should be&#xD;
      reported according to the following procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Takeda SAE form must be completed, in English, and signed by the investigator immediately&#xD;
      or within 1 working day of first onset or notification of the event. The information should&#xD;
      be completed as fully as possible but contain, at a minimum:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A short description of the event and the reason why the event is categorized as serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator's name.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Causality assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAE form should be transmitted within 1 working day to the attention of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Takeda Global Research &amp; Development (TGRD) Pharmacovigilance Dept. Arundel Great Court, 2&#xD;
      Arundel Street London WC2R 3DA Fax No: + 44 207 759 5272&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any SAE spontaneously reported to the investigator following the AE collection period should&#xD;
      be reported to TGRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.8 Follow-up of SAEs&#xD;
&#xD;
      If information not available at the time of the first report becomes available at a later&#xD;
      date, the investigator should add this to the initial SAE form or provide other written&#xD;
      documentation and fax it immediately within 1 working day of receipt. Copies of any relevant&#xD;
      data from the hospital notes (eg, ECGs, laboratory tests, discharge summary, postmortem&#xD;
      results) should be sent to the addressee, if requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SAEs should be followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event. The&#xD;
      timelines and procedure for follow-up reports are the same as those for the initial report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13. Patient withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without affecting their&#xD;
      right to treatment by the Investigator. Every patient should be encouraged to remain in the&#xD;
      study until they have completed the 12 months follow-up. If the patient prematurely&#xD;
      discontinues from the study, for any reason, a final evaluation must be completed for that&#xD;
      patient and the reason for withdrawal must be documented. All documentation concerning the&#xD;
      patients must be as complete as possible.&#xD;
