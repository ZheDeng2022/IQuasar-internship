      The purpose of this study is to compare levels of clot formation (platelet aggregation),&#xD;
      markers of heart muscle damage, and inflammation in two groups undergoing percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary stent implantation. The first group will be on a regimen of high-dose clopidogrel&#xD;
      used in combination with bivalirudin plus eptifibatide, and the second group will be on a&#xD;
      regimen of high-dose clopidogrel with bivalirudin alone. Clinical outcomes will be determined&#xD;
      up to one year after enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous stent implantation has revolutionized the revascularization procedure for&#xD;
      patients with obstructive coronary disease and angina. The major risk of coronary stenting,&#xD;
      both during and after the procedure, is clot formation (thrombosis) which often leads to&#xD;
      significant heart muscle damage. The standard medical practice for patients undergoing&#xD;
      coronary stenting is the use of antiplatelet (plavix, aspirin) and anticoagulant (blood&#xD;
      thinner) therapy. The results from our recently completed CLEAR PLATELETS I study showed that&#xD;
      the addition of eptifibatide (a potent antiplatelet agent) to current therapy resulted in&#xD;
      superior reduction in clot formation, inflammation and heart damage after elective coronary&#xD;
      intervention. Recent studies have also suggested the drug bivalirudin to be a safer and more&#xD;
      effective therapy compared to heparin, the current anticoagulant agent of choice. It has been&#xD;
      hypothesized that bivalirudin acts not only as an anticoagulant but also as an antiplatelet&#xD;
      agent, making the use of eptifibatide in current coronary therapy unwarranted. In the CLEAR&#xD;
      PLATELET II study, we will compare levels of clot formation (platelet aggregation), markers&#xD;
      of heart muscle damage, and inflammation in two groups. The first group will be on a regimen&#xD;
      of high-dose clopidogrel used in combination with bivalirudin plus eptifibatide, and the&#xD;
      second group will be on a regimen of high-dose clopidogrel with bivalirudin alone. The&#xD;
      antiplatelet/antithrombotic effect that bivalirudin has in combination with these current&#xD;
      therapies is unknown; therefore we hope to see the effect that bivalirudin has on arresting&#xD;
      platelet formation with and without eptifibatide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be done at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore with Paul Gurbel M.D. as the&#xD;
      principal investigator. It will include 200 patients who will be randomized equally between&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clopidogrel (600 mg) + eptifibatide + bivalirudin Clopidogrel (600 mg) + bivalirudin&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive treatment with clopidogrel in the cath lab immediately after&#xD;
      successful stenting. All patients post-stenting will receive standard antiplatelet treatment&#xD;
      (75mg Plavix and 325 mg aspirin). Patients will have serial assessment of platelet&#xD;
      reactivity, myocardial necrosis markers, and inflammatory markers (3 tablespoons of blood per&#xD;
      time point) at baseline, 2 hours, 8 hours, and 18- 24 hours post-stenting. All blood work&#xD;
      will be processed at the Sinai Center for Thrombosis Research. Clinical outcomes will be&#xD;
      recorded using a standard case report form. Patients will be followed up at 30 days and 1&#xD;
      year by telephone to assess for adverse events.&#xD;
