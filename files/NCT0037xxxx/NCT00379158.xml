      1. At 12 mo of age, all three intervention groups will have significantly better iron and&#xD;
           vitamin A status than the NI group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Infants who receive the Foodlet or Nutributter will have significantly greater weight&#xD;
           and length gains from 6 to 12 mo and higher indices of vitamin B6, riboflavin and zinc&#xD;
           status at 12 mo of age than the infants who receive the sprinkles containing iron and&#xD;
           vitamin A only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Infants who receive Nutributter will have significantly greater weight and length gains&#xD;
           from 6 to 12 mo and higher indices of vitamin A and essential fatty acid (linoleic,&#xD;
           alpha-linolenic and docosahexaenoic, DHA) status at 12 mo of age than the infants who&#xD;
           receive the Foodlet or sprinkles.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a randomized controlled study of infants recruited from Maternal and&#xD;
      Child Health centers in the town of Koforidua, located in eastern Ghana. There are 8 such&#xD;
      centers located in various parts of the town, each of which serves the mothers and children&#xD;
      in the immediate vicinity. The vast majority of infants born in Koforidua are brought to the&#xD;
      MCH centers beginning a few weeks after birth for monthly weight monitoring. A list of all&#xD;
      infants attending the MCH centers who are approximately 5 mo of age, have no congenital&#xD;
      abnormality or chronic disease, and are currently breastfed will be created during each&#xD;
      clinic day. From these lists we will randomly select approximately 34 infants per month&#xD;
      (during a recruitment period of 9 mo) who will be invited to participate in the intervention&#xD;
      trial. These infants will then be randomly assigned to one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;Sprinkles&quot; group: Will receive micronutrient Sprinkles beginning at 6 mo of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;Foodlet&quot; group: Will receive crushable multiple micronutrient tablet beginning at 6 mo&#xD;
           of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &quot;Nutributter&quot; group: Will receive fat-based supplement (Nutributter) beginning at 6 mo&#xD;
           of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have chosen not to include a negative control (placebo) group because there is a high rate&#xD;
      of iron and vitamin A deficiency in this population, and we cannot leave children who are&#xD;
      known to be anemic untreated during the 6-mo study period. Instead, we will assess a&#xD;
      &quot;Non-Intervention&quot; (NI) group of infants at 12 mo of age, which will allow us to evaluate&#xD;
      attained size and micronutrient status in the absence of any intervention. The NI group will&#xD;
      be randomly selected from the subset of infants who were recorded on the MCH lists described&#xD;
      above during the recruitment period for the intervention trial (and thus met the same&#xD;
      selection criteria), but not randomly selected for the intervention trial. [We cannot take&#xD;
      all of the infants who come to the MCH clinics each month because the field work would be&#xD;
      unmanageable. Given the birth rate of 179/mo, there will be more than enough &quot;left over&quot; each&#xD;
      month who won't be selected for the intervention, and from whom we can randomly select the&#xD;
      non-intervention group once they reach 12 mo.] We plan to recruit approximately 9/mo for the&#xD;
      NI group for a period of 9 months, starting 6 mo after we initiate recruitment for the&#xD;
      intervention (i.e., when the &quot;left-over&quot; infants begin to reach 12 mo of age). The MCH lists&#xD;
      will include contact information (address), so that we can find the NI mothers at 12 mo. When&#xD;
      we contact them at 12 mo, we will confirm that their infants would have met the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria for the intervention study (breastfed at 5 mo, and free of congenital abnormality,&#xD;
      chronic disease or peanut allergy), and ask them to participate in the one-time assessment.&#xD;
      At that time each NI family will be given compensation equivalent in value to the supplements&#xD;
      provided to the intervention groups (such as a 6-mo supply of Nutributter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site The study will be conducted in Koforidua, which has a population of about 87,000&#xD;
      and an average birth rate of 179/mo (between 1998 and 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Ghana will administer the project and provide scientific and technical&#xD;
      support for the study. It will also provide office space for administrative tasks and&#xD;
      laboratories for biochemical analyses of blood samples. UC Davis will provide supervision of&#xD;
      the study through the Project Manager (Seth Adu-Afarwuah, a doctoral student at UC Davis),&#xD;
      and will order and ship all of the necessary supplies and equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent procedures: Approval for the study has been obtained from the UC Davis Human&#xD;
      Subjects Review Committee and the University of Ghana (Noguchi Memorial Institute) Ethics&#xD;
      Committee. Consent to conduct the study in the town will be obtained from the Koforidua&#xD;
      Municipal Health Administration. Written consent to participate in the study will be obtained&#xD;
      individually from the mothers of the infants. Consent forms explaining the purpose of the&#xD;
      study, potential risks or discomfort, the rights of subjects and the benefits to the subjects&#xD;
      will be available both in English and in the local language, Asante Twi. For illiterate&#xD;
      mothers unable to read, the form will be read and explained to them in Asante Twi. To&#xD;
      indicate their consent, mothers will be asked to either sign the consent form or thumb-print&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
