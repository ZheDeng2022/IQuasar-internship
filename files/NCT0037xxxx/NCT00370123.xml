  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic disabling inflammatory disease which effects 15-20% of women in&#xD;
      their reproductive life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients suffering from endometriosis retrograded menstrual cells induce an inflammatory&#xD;
      response.Endometriosis has also been considered to be an autoimmune disease, owing to the&#xD;
      presence of auto antibodies, the association with other autoimmune diseases and recurrent&#xD;
      immune-mediated abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to study this aberrant regulation of endometrial cell apoptosis by investigating the&#xD;
      peripheral blood immune system of patients suffering from endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that immune peripheral mononuclear cells of patients suffering from pelvic&#xD;
      endometriosis react differently to eutopic endometrial cells than matched control women&#xD;
      group. This difference could be study on a molecular, antigenic and/or apoptotic cycle gene&#xD;
      expression. We also hypothesized that a deficiency of regulatory T cells is associated with&#xD;
      the progression of endometriosis.&#xD;

      Endometriosis affects 15-20% of women in their reproductive life. Endometriosis is a chronic&#xD;
      disabling inflammatory disease, characterized by implantation and growth of endometrial&#xD;
      tissue (glandular epithelium and stroma) outside the uterine cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrograde menstruation was found in 80%-90% of women. In most women these endometrial cells&#xD;
      undergo apoptosis. In patients suffering from endometriosis this cells induce an inflammatory&#xD;
      response. Pelvic endometriosis is associated with intrinsic anomalies of the refluxed&#xD;
      endometrium, increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, neoangiogenesis, and impaired&#xD;
      function of cell-mediated natural immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometriosis has also been considered to be an autoimmune disease, owing to the presence of&#xD;
      auto antibodies, the association with other autoimmune diseases and recurrent immune-mediated&#xD;
      abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that Foxp3-expressing CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells play a crucial role in&#xD;
      the suppression of inflammatory disease. However, their role in the suppression of&#xD;
      endometriosis has not yet been addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to study this aberrant regulation of endometrial cell apoptosis by investigating the&#xD;
      peripheral blood immune system of patients suffering from endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that immune peripheral mononuclear cells of patients suffering from pelvic&#xD;
      endometriosis react differently to eutopic endometrial cells than matched control women&#xD;
      group. This difference could be study on a molecular, antigenic and/or apoptotic cycle gene&#xD;
      expression. We also hypothesized that a deficiency of regulatory T cells is associated with&#xD;
      the progression of endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open labeled prospective in vitro study for two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 Patients suffering from endometriosis undergoing laparoscopy will be compared to 50&#xD;
      patients undergoing laparoscopy for other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Blood withdrawal and pipelle endometrial cells harvesting 2. Isolation of peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) 3. Generation of T cell lines (from patients) 4. Measurement of&#xD;
      cytokines 5. Determination of T- cell subsets by flow cytometry 5. PMNC and T cell lines will&#xD;
      be frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at-70C for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Endometrial tissue will be served ad antigenic source to generated T cell lines and the&#xD;
      remnants will be stored at-70C for future studies.&#xD;
