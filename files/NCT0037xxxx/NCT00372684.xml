  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a major public health problem in endemic areas, with&#xD;
      approximately 2 million deaths each year, especially in tropical African countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In non-endemic industrialized areas, imported malaria is generally diagnosed in travelers, as&#xD;
      well as immigrants from endemic countries. Such imported cases have increased worldwide, with&#xD;
      approximately 7000 cases each year in France. Among these cases, 300 are severe requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) with an overall mortality rate of 10%,&#xD;
      despite available effective care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have been performed to evaluate clinical and physiopathological aspects of&#xD;
      severe malaria in endemic areas but few data are available for imported malaria. Therefore,&#xD;
      determinants of severe imported malaria are not well known. The majority of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in the ICU for severe malaria are white caucasians as well as those patients who&#xD;
      die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study has two main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) to describe the clinical spectrum of severe imported malaria and to assess outcome&#xD;
      (mortality and neurological sequelae), and the biological interactions between host and the&#xD;
      parasite,&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) to evaluate the role of gene polymorphisms, of parasitic factors in the occurrence of&#xD;
      severe malaria with a case control study comparing severe and non-severe malaria in patients&#xD;
      matched according to ethnic patterns. The intensity of the inflammatory response will also be&#xD;
      studied in the two groups of patients.&#xD;

      Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a major public health problem in endemic areas, with&#xD;
      approximately 2 million deaths each year, especially in tropical African countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In non-endemic industrialized areas, imported malaria is generally diagnosed in travelers, as&#xD;
      well as immigrants from endemic countries. Such imported cases have increased worldwide, with&#xD;
      approximately 7000 cases each year in France. Among these cases, 300 are severe requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization in ICU with an overall mortality rate of 10%, despite available effective&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have been performed to evaluate clinical and physiopathological aspects of&#xD;
      severe malaria in endemic areas but few data are available for imported malaria. Therefore,&#xD;
      determinants of severe imported malaria are not well known. The majority of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in ICU for severe imported malaria are white caucasians, as well as those&#xD;
      patients who die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present two-year prospective multicentric nationwide study has two main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the clinical spectrum of severe imported malaria in France and to assess&#xD;
           outcome (especially mortality, very severe cases, and neurological sequelae).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyse the biological interactions between host and the parasite, by evaluating: the&#xD;
           role of gene polymorphisms of the host including haemoglobin analysis, the intensity of&#xD;
           inflammatory response, endothelial activation, and finally several plasmodial factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to include 150 to 200 patients with severe malaria hospitalized in ICU and 150 to 200&#xD;
      patients with uncomplicated malaria. These two groups will be included in a case control&#xD;
      study comparing severe and non-severe malaria with matching according to ethnic patterns.&#xD;
