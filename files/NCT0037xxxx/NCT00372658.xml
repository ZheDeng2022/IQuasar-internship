      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of 1% lidocaine intracervical block to&#xD;
      placebo for pain control during the performance of a hysterosalpingogram (HSG). We&#xD;
      hypothesized that an intracervical block would decrease pain during a hysterosalpingogram.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is an integral part of the evaluation for anatomic etiologies&#xD;
      of female infertility. The majority of women regard a hysterosalpingogram as acutely painful&#xD;
      since it involves placement of a cervical tenaculum, traction on the cervix, and instillation&#xD;
      of dye through a cervical cannula. Different techniques have been employed to attempt to make&#xD;
      the procedure less painful, including use of balloon catheters rather than cannulas; however,&#xD;
      this has not been shown to be uniformly effective. Previous studies have shown a reduction in&#xD;
      overall pain during HSG after pre-medication with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.&#xD;
      Benzocaine gel (20%) applied to the cervix has also been shown to reduce pain. Conversely, a&#xD;
      study of pre-medication with paracetamol (acetaminophen) showed no statistical improvement in&#xD;
      pain perception. Additionally, transcervical intrauterine instillation of lidocaine has been&#xD;
      shown in randomized studies to not improve pain scores and may actually increase pain after&#xD;
      the procedure is complete A MEDLINE literature search of papers written in English from&#xD;
      January 1966 to August 2005, using the keywords &quot;hysterosalpingogram,&quot; &quot;analgesia&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;paracervical,&quot; and &quot;intracervical&quot; did not reveal any prior studies on the use of an&#xD;
      intracervical block prior to hysterosalpingography. A paracervical block has been shown to&#xD;
      decrease pain with therapeutic abortions, endometrial biopsy, and office hysteroscopy (7, 8).&#xD;
      We hypothesized that an intracervical block would also decrease pain during a&#xD;
      hysterosalpingogram. A three armed, randomized controlled trial comparing pain control after&#xD;
      a 1% lidocaine intracervical block, saline injection or no injection in patients undergoing&#xD;
      hysterosalpingogram was performed.&#xD;
