      The trial will examine the efficacy of sambucol in the treatment of influenza. The primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint will be the length of time to resolution of influenza illness.The double&#xD;
      blind trial will be conducted at the Personnel Clinic, and at the Clinical virology Unit,&#xD;
      Hadassah University Hospital, and will include 100 patients with laboratory-confirmed&#xD;
      influenza infection, 50 in the sambucol and 50 in the placebo study arm.&#xD;

      The trial will be conducted at the Personnel Clinic, and at the Clinical virology Unit,&#xD;
      Hadassah University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates for participation in the trial :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will present at the clinic with influenza-like symptoms; men and women ages 20&#xD;
      yrs- 65 yrs who will sign written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded from the trial will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant women or women who cannot exclude pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune-suppressed patients, including patients taking immunosuppressive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who received the recent influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will receive treatment (either Sambucol or placebo) for five days. The&#xD;
      follow-up period will be 10 days. All patients initially included in the trial will be&#xD;
      followed for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fever ≥ 380C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of at least one of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, sore throat,&#xD;
           nasal congestion/ runny nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of at least one of the following systemic symptoms: headache, fatigue,&#xD;
           myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Patients A total of 100 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection will be&#xD;
      included in the study (50 in each study arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This calculation is based on the expected percentage of recovery within 3 days from initial&#xD;
      treatment (allowing that 80% of patients given the active component will show improvement as&#xD;
      opposed to 50% of placebo patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that 50% of the patients presenting with influenza-like illness will have a&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed influenza infection, a total number of 200 patients is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the length of time to resolution of influenza illness&#xD;
      (defined as the period from start of study drug to the relief of symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients presenting at the clinic with the above indicated inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
           referred by the clinic nurse to a physician to establish the diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The temperature, the presence and severity of influenza symptoms including cough, nasal&#xD;
           obstruction, sore throat, fatigue, headache, myalgia will be recorded on a four-point&#xD;
           scale (0-absent, 1-mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe). Patients will also record their ability&#xD;
           to do their normal activities, overall health status, and sleep quality on a ten-point&#xD;
           scale (0-unable or worst, to 10-fully able, best)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For influenza detection, nose and throat swabs will be collected at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either Sambucol or placebo (15 cc 4 times&#xD;
           daily for 5 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients will be instructed that relief medications (Acamol /Optalgin) will be taken&#xD;
           only as required, and that their use should be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The follow-up will include all the parameters (see &quot;2&quot;) recorded daily at days 1-5, at&#xD;
           day 7, and at day 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Compliance with the study drug will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. In case the patient's condition deteriorates, the patient will be examined at the clinic&#xD;
           to rule out the presence of complications (such as pneumonia, sinusitis, or bronchitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Statistical analysis will include the duration and severity of the symptoms as well as&#xD;
           the use of relief medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory diagnosis of influenza infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined nose and throat specimens will be tested for the presence of influenza virus at the&#xD;
      Clinical Virology Unit by real-time PCR, following viral RNA extraction, using the TaqMan ABI&#xD;
      7900 instrument. Primers and fluorescent probes specific for influenza A and B viruses will&#xD;
      be employed in a multiplex reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimens found positive for influenza by real-time PCR will be further subjected to&#xD;
      influenza culture on MDCK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recovered influenza viruses will be subtyped by hemagglutination inhibition, using&#xD;
      specific antisera obtained from the WHO, or by multiplex reverse transcription (RT)- PCR&#xD;
      reaction, using specific primers for influenza B as well as for the different influenza A H&#xD;
      and N.&#xD;
