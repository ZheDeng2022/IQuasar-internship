      This prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) study, assessed the efficacy of&#xD;
      sildenafil in women with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant-associated sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction (SRI-AASD) following the same protocol which previously established efficacy in&#xD;
      men with SRI-AASD. Women (n=100) with MDD-remission and SRI-AASD were randomized to receive&#xD;
      sildenafil (50-100mg) or placebo for 8 weeks, followed by 8-weeks open-label extension.&#xD;
      Sexual function was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Sexual Function (CGI-SF),&#xD;
      with positive response defined as a score &lt;3, and UNM-SFI, ASEX, SFQ-FSD sexual function&#xD;
      questionnaires. Depression was monitored using the HAM-D17.&#xD;
      Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-gonadal hormones were measured at baseline and DB-endpoint.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:S Subjects will be females only, ages 18 to 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects have been taking an SSRI, venlafaxine, nefazodone, or tri/hetero cyclic&#xD;
             antidepressant for treatment of depression for at least 8 weeks, are currently at a&#xD;
             stable dose of the antidepressant for at least 4 weeks, and have been consistently&#xD;
             experiencing arousal dysfunction [inability to attain or maintain until completion of&#xD;
             sexual activity an adequate lubrication swelling response of sexual excitement] or&#xD;
             orgasmic dysfunction [delayed orgasm/anorgasmia following a normal sexual excitement&#xD;
             phase] that interferes with sexual functioning for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must currently be euthymic (HAM-D&lt;10) and without significant anxiety&#xD;
             symptoms (HAM-A&lt;10).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have had no sexual dysfunction prior to taking an antidepressant and&#xD;
             there must be a clear temporal relationship of the sexual dysfunction to the&#xD;
             antidepressant treatment. [Note - sexual dysfunction occurring as a symptom of the&#xD;
             depressive disorder for which AD treatment was initiated is not considered to be a&#xD;
             pre-existing condition in this definition].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must meet at least one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Inability to have an orgasm (anorgasmia), according to patient opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Clinically significant orgasm delay with masturbation or intercourse that&#xD;
                  according to patient opinion:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. represents a meaningful delay compared with the subject's usual time to&#xD;
                       achieve orgasm in response to sexual stimulation prior to antidepressant&#xD;
                       medication and&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. interferes with subject's sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Inability to attain or maintain until completion of sexual activity an adequate&#xD;
                  lubrication swelling response of sexual excitement that according to patient&#xD;
                  opinion interferes with subject's sexual function compared to prior to&#xD;
                  antidepressant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must experience at least one of the above criterion items (#1-3) with&#xD;
