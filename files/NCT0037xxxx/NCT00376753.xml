    <textblock>
      This study will examine and compare brain activity in people with focal hand dystonia (FHD)&#xD;
      and healthy volunteers to obtain further knowledge about the underlying cause of FHD.&#xD;
      Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause abnormal postures while trying to&#xD;
      perform a movement; FHD affects the hands and fine finger movements. During fine finger&#xD;
      movement, the brain controls muscles in a process called surround inhibition. This process&#xD;
      may be impaired in people with hand dystonia, leading to uncontrolled overactivity in muscles&#xD;
      and impairing motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with FHD over 18 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a physical and neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a series of three experiments conducted during a single clinic visit, participants undergo&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while performing a finger movement. A wire coil is&#xD;
      placed on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil,&#xD;
      creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small&#xD;
      electrical currents in the outer part of the brain. The stimulation may cause muscle, hand or&#xD;
      arm twitching, or may affect movement or reflexes. During the stimulation, the subject is&#xD;
      asked to contract one finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to TMS, subjects have surface electromyography. For this test, they sit in a&#xD;
      chair with their hands placed on a pillow on their lap. The electrical activity of three&#xD;
      muscles in the right hand is recorded by electrodes (small metal disks) taped to the skin&#xD;
      over the muscles.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sensory systems, a neural mechanism called surround inhibition (SI) sharpens sensation by&#xD;
      creating an inhibitory zone around the central core of activation. This principle was&#xD;
      described for the visual system first, but there is evidence for similar mechanisms in the&#xD;
      primary motor cortex (M1) involved in movement generation and control, especially in precise&#xD;
      motor tasks. Dystonia is generally regarded as a motor execution abnormality due to a&#xD;
      dysfunction in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical motor loop. Using transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS), recent findings point to highly task-specific impairment of motor cortical&#xD;
      inhibition in patients with focal hand dystonia (FHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal for this research proposal is to understand the underlying physiology as it relates&#xD;
      to different inhibitory pathways on movement generation and control. To achieve this goal,&#xD;
      different modes of voluntary contractions will be examined in healthy controls and patients&#xD;
      with FHD with the prospect of having new options for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study 100 adult patients with FHD and 100 healthy volunteers on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform a contraction of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). At&#xD;
      rest, before EMG-onset (premotor), during phasic and tonic contraction single TMS pulses&#xD;
      (Experiment 1) or double TMS pulses (Experiment 2) will be applied over the primary motor&#xD;
      cortex to assess activation-induced changes in cortical excitability in the abductor pollicis&#xD;
      brevis muscle (APB), which is not activated. Additionally the influence of visual feedback on&#xD;
      short intracortical inhibition (SICI) will be tested in Experiment 3. In Experiment 4-8&#xD;
      interhemispheric (IHI), ventral and dorso-lateral premotor-motor intracortical inhibition&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for Experiment 1 will be the difference in MEP peak-to-peak&#xD;
      amplitude between all motor conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for Experiment 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 will be the difference in&#xD;
      normalized MEP peak-to-peak amplitude between all motor conditions in FHD patients and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Experiments 1 and 2, the change in MEP peak-to-peak amplitude between different force&#xD;
      levels (10% versus 20%) will be a second outcome parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome parameter for Experiment 3 will be change in MEP peak-to-peak between&#xD;
      patients and healthy volunteers during tonic contraction with and without visual feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Experiment 4, Hmax/Mmax ratio will be the primary outcome parameter.&#xD;
