  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether giving estrogen replacement therapy through an estradiol&#xD;
      patch can improve ovulation rates in women with spontaneous premature ovarian failure. The&#xD;
      ovaries are glands in women that produce female hormones and normally release an egg once a&#xD;
      month. In women with spontaneous premature ovarian failure, the ovaries stop working too&#xD;
      soon. Women with this disorder have abnormally high levels of leuteinizing hormone (LH) in&#xD;
      their blood, which impedes normal ovulation. In some women, estrogen replacement can suppress&#xD;
      LH levels to the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women between 18 and 40 years of age with premature ovarian failure may be eligible for this&#xD;
      4-month study. Participants receive either standard hormone replacement therapy, consisting&#xD;
      of an estradiol patch and progestin tablets, or placebo. The placebo group receives patches&#xD;
      and tablets that look the same as those for the group with active treatment but they contain&#xD;
      no hormone. All participants wear the patch every day and take the tablets the first 12 days&#xD;
      of each month. In addition to taking the study drug, participants have blood drawn once a&#xD;
      week for the 16 weeks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the trial, women who were in the placebo group are offered the opportunity to&#xD;
      receive the estrogen patch and progestin therapy for another 16 weeks and continue the blood&#xD;
      tests to determine if they ovulate on this treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a life altering and distressing diagnosis for women due to&#xD;
      associated infertility. Despite having amenorrhea and markedly elevated serum gonadotropin&#xD;
      levels, approximately 50% of women with 46XX spontaneous premature ovarian failure have&#xD;
      ovarian follicles that function intermittently. These follicles are faced with high serum LH&#xD;
      levels. Normally, women have their LH levels in the range of 3-14 u/L except in the&#xD;
      preovulatory stage, when it rises above 20 u/L. At that level it works on LH receptors on the&#xD;
      granulosa cells and transforms the follicle in the corpus leutium. In POF, continuous high&#xD;
      level of LH prematurely lutienizes growing follicles and thereby causes follicle dysfunction.&#xD;
      We have shown by histological examination that inappropriate luteinization is a major&#xD;
      mechanism of Graffian follicle dysfunction in these women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have found that approximately 50% women with premature ovarian failure have LH levels in&#xD;
      the normal range while they are taking 100 mcg per day of our standardized transdermal&#xD;
      estradiol therapy.&#xD;
