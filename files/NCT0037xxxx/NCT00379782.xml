    <textblock>
      This Cancer Prevention and Treatment Demonstration Project funded by the Centers of Medicare&#xD;
      and Medicaid Services awarded six sites across the United States to develop Patient Navigator&#xD;
      Programs to eliminate disparities in the rate of preventative cancer screening and timely&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of cancer for racial and ethnic minorities. This site of Molokai&#xD;
      General Hospital are focused on Pacific Islanders and Asian Americans. This program called&#xD;
      Kukui Ahi propose to increase screening and early detection for four targeted cancers-breast,&#xD;
      cervical, colorectal, and prostate- with lung cancer additionally being included in treatment&#xD;
      protocols to improve outcomes and satisfaction by employing a culturally appropriate&#xD;
      navigation protocol to facilitate utilization of healthcare services and decrease health&#xD;
      barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the project is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if a Navigator Program can reduce the proportion of the targeted cancers&#xD;
           diagnosed at a late stage,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if the Navigator Program can improve the continuity of health care for cancer&#xD;
           patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if the Navigator Program can improve quality of life and subjective well being&#xD;
           of navigated cancer patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine if the Navigator Program is a cost-effective way to reduce cancer care&#xD;
           disparities for screenable cancers.&#xD;

      To be eligible, patients must have Medicare parts A and B, not enrolled in a managed care&#xD;
      plan, not enrolled in hospice, and if currently have cancer, it must be either breast,&#xD;
      cervical, colorectal, lung, or prostate. Patients may be enrolled up to 3 Â½ years. After&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained, the navigator will administer a CSA triage (attached) to&#xD;
      determine if patient has cancer or not. Patients who have never had cancer or been in&#xD;
      remission for five years are eligible for the screening arm and then will have the Screening&#xD;
      CSA (attached) performed. Cancer screening arm of the study will then go into randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medistat has created a data entry system for randomization via internet. Medstat will create&#xD;
      site administrators and CMS staff users. All users have a defined role that controls what&#xD;
      they can see and do. Site administrators can perform all functions and create site staff&#xD;
      users. Site staff users can only assign protocols. All users must supply a user&#xD;
      identification and password to gain access to the site. Patients are qualified for the&#xD;
      demonstration by site staff. Cancer status is ascertained via CSA. Sites will assign patient&#xD;
      identification number that will be entered along with cancer status onto the website, no&#xD;
      personal identification. RTI will then perform randomization protocol determination and log&#xD;
      into database. Site reports available by sight only include individual protocol assignments&#xD;
      by patient identification number, summarized protocol assignments by site and year, and view&#xD;
      all individual assignments made within a time window. Only the site administrator can&#xD;
      disenroll patients. RTI will be utilizing block randomization by site and arm&#xD;
      (screening/treatment) in even blocks of 10-18 events depending on size of site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients that are in the screening intervention group will have the navigational&#xD;
      services. The control group will receive only nutritional education. Those patients who have&#xD;
      non-study cancers and are not in remission for five years are ineligible for the study. The&#xD;
      study cancers will be given a treatment CSA (attached). For those patients with study cancer,&#xD;
      the patients will automatically be put in the navigational group. Molokai being such a small&#xD;
      community where everyone knows everyone, it was agreed that to have a control group here&#xD;
      would appear to be withholding care and cause bias. The control group will come from another&#xD;
      community of similar demographics of Kahuku. Both navigational groups will have an initial&#xD;
      CSA, annual CSA, and then an exit CSA conducted in the last six months of the program. CMS&#xD;
      has not issued the annual or exit CSA at this time. Molokai has agreed to provide no more&#xD;
      than 578 patients with delivery of navigational services to no more than 289 patients in the&#xD;
      screening arm of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization to intervention or control group will be done as above per RTI International, a&#xD;
      statistical firm contracted by CMS. Twenty-five cancer or treatment patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      for navigational arm on Molokai and 25 control group patients from a neighboring island.&#xD;
