      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the timing of the clamping of the umbilical&#xD;
      cord after delivery has an impact on neonatal hemoglobin and hematocrit, tests that determine&#xD;
      the number of red cells in the blood and their ability to carry oxygen. The study hypothesis&#xD;
      is that delaying cord clamping until cord pulsation has ceased will increase the neonatal&#xD;
      blood volume and thereby increase the hemoglobin and hematocrit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to recruit 150 women who present for vaginal delivery at Tulsa Regional Medical&#xD;
      Center. Half of the women will be randomly assigned to the immediate clamping group, which&#xD;
      will entail clamping of the umbilical cord within six seconds of delivery of the fetal&#xD;
      shoulders. The other half of the volunteers will be assigned to the delayed clamping group,&#xD;
      which will entail clamping the cord after a palpable pulse has ceased, or after 10 minutes.&#xD;
      The infants of mothers in both groups will have blood drawn for a hemoglobin and hematocrit&#xD;
      at the time of the routine PKU heel stick, usually is performed within 18-24 hours of&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical differences between the blood counts of infants in the control and study groups&#xD;
      will be compared using independent samples t tests.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the timing of the clamping of the umbilical&#xD;
      cord after delivery has an impact on neonatal hemoglobin and hematocrit, tests that determine&#xD;
      the number of red cells in the blood and their ability to carry oxygen. The study hypothesis&#xD;
      is that delaying cord clamping until cord pulsation has ceased will increase the neonatal&#xD;
      blood volume and thereby increase the hemoglobin and hematocrit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the communication between the placenta and fetus, the umbilical cord provides oxygen and&#xD;
      nutrients until the time of delivery. Even after delivery, placental respiration continues&#xD;
      for a short time and the newborn infant continues to receive blood from the placenta until&#xD;
      physiologic closure of the cord vessels terminates the transfusion. While most term infants&#xD;
      can tolerate variations in blood volume, those who are compromised by prematurity, cesarean&#xD;
      delivery or cord compression in utero may require blood transfusions if the cord is clamped&#xD;
      before pulmonary perfusion is established. Delayed cord clamping is believed to provide a&#xD;
      greater supply of blood to perfuse the lungs without robbing blood from the other organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In uncomplicated vaginal deliveries the umbilical cord traditionally has been clamped&#xD;
      immediately after delivery, more for the doctor's convenience than for any consideration&#xD;
      regarding the health of the infant. Both immediate and delayed cord clamping are accepted as&#xD;
      routine standard of care at delivery, depending on the circumstances. However, some&#xD;
      clinicians and researchers have suggested that by delaying the clamping of the umbilical&#xD;
      cord, the placental transfusion to the newborn is maintained, optimizing blood volume and&#xD;
      hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several European research studies have suggested that delayed cord clamping increases newborn&#xD;
      hemoglobin and hematocrit. However, these studies were not performed under properly&#xD;
      controlled conditions and thus have failed to gain general acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to recruit 150 women who present for vaginal delivery at Tulsa Regional Medical&#xD;
      Center. We believe this number of volunteers is possible to enroll in the allotted five&#xD;
      months for data collection. A power analysis for this sample size was performed by Dr. Mark&#xD;
      Payton, professor of statistics at the OSU Stillwater campus. He estimated that a difference&#xD;
      of 0.3 standard deviations has a power of just over 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSU medical students will explain the study and recruit patient volunteers during routine&#xD;
      third trimester prenatal care visits at the OSU OB/Gyn resident clinic at Houston Parke.&#xD;
      Study investigators Drs. Beal and Carnett will determine the eligibility of those patients&#xD;
      who agree to participate. The ethnic mix of the resident clinic population is not available&#xD;
      because race information is not routinely entered in the MegaWest Practice Management Program&#xD;
      currently in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a volunteer presents for delivery, the resident in charge of the labor and delivery unit&#xD;
      will remind the patient of her previous consent to participate and assign her to either the&#xD;
      control group or the study group in an alternating fashion. Women who have agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study will have an identifying mark on their prenatal records which are&#xD;
      sent from the clinic. In the control group, the umbilical cord will be clamped immediately&#xD;
      after delivery. In the study group, the umbilical cord will be clamped once cord pulsation&#xD;
      ceases. Patients also will be advised at this time that they can withdraw from the study at&#xD;
      any time, regardless of the reason. The physician making group assignments and performing&#xD;
      deliveries on a given day may not be one of the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inability to mask the patients and study personnel will not affect the outcome of the&#xD;
      study as strict guidelines regarding the timing of cord clamping will be applied. Immediate&#xD;
      clamping will entail clamping of the umbilical cord within six seconds of delivery of the&#xD;
      fetal shoulders. Delayed clamping will be performed by clamping the cord after a palpable&#xD;
      pulse has ceased, or after 10 minutes. Cord pulsation generally stops within two minutes of&#xD;
      delivery. The physician performing the delivery will determine when cord pulsation stops and&#xD;
      the clamp times, immediate or delayed will be recorded by delivery room personnel who&#xD;
      routinely record times of delivery of infant, delivery of placenta, infant weight and APGARs.&#xD;
      Therefore, prior knowledge of group assignment will not affect the behavior of the patient or&#xD;
      the physician at the time of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infants of mothers in both groups will have blood drawn for a hemoglobin and hematocrit&#xD;
      at the time of the routine PKU heel stick. There will be no additional heel sticks to collect&#xD;
      blood. The PKU test usually is performed within 18-24 hours of delivery. All infant study&#xD;
      data will be collected at this time and no further blood draws will be necessary. The total&#xD;
      amount of blood drawn from the baby will be approximately 8-10 drops, or about two teaspoons,&#xD;
      which will include blood for the PKU test and the study tests. The results of the blood tests&#xD;
      will then be analyzed and compared between the two groups. This comparison will also involve&#xD;
      analysis of the mothers' admitting hemoglobin and hematocrit, blood type and demographic&#xD;
      data, including age and smoking history, to look for possible exclusion or confounding&#xD;
      factors. Maternal blood is routinely tested at the time of admission for blood type,&#xD;
      hemoglobin and hematocrit. This involves the collection of approximately two test tubes of&#xD;
      blood. No additional testing or blood collections will be performed on participating mothers&#xD;
      other than those routinely done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no increased risks to mothers or their infants who agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Likewise, there are no direct benefits to participation to either mothers or babies&#xD;
      aside from the contribution their participation makes in furthering medical knowledge.&#xD;
      Adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded and reported to the IRB under the&#xD;
      policies and procedures provided by OSUCHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our tentative timetable is to recruit 25 patients per month so that the data collection can&#xD;
      be completed within five months. Tulsa Regional typically delivers about 1,000 babies&#xD;
      monthly. Approximately 23 percent of these deliveries are cesarean sections. Of the remaining&#xD;
      deliveries, it is reasonable to estimate that 25 patients per month could be recruited to the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 150 women and their newborn infants delivered at Tulsa&#xD;
      Regional Medical Center. Mothers must be between the ages of 18 and 34 and be full term, 37&#xD;
      to 41 weeks, with a singleton pregnancy at the time of delivery. Women will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study if their delivery is complicated by non-reassuring fetal heart tones, preeclampsia,&#xD;
      eclampsia, chronic hypertension, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, fetal anomalies or any&#xD;
      other condition which could require immediate newborn evaluation by nursery personnel at the&#xD;
      time of delivery. Infants requiring operative delivery by forceps or vacuum also will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Statistical differences between the blood counts of infants in the control and study&#xD;
      groups will be compared using independent samples t tests.&#xD;
