      BACKGROUND:PEG can be performed by pull, push or introducer technique, pull method is the one&#xD;
      most commonly used worldwide. PEG site infection is clearly the commonest procedure related&#xD;
      complication of PEG placement and the routinely used pull technique has been shown to have&#xD;
      quite high (4-30%), peristomal infectious complications. To curtail these infectious&#xD;
      complications various gastroenterological societies have recommended giving intravenous&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics 30 minutes prior to the procedure which has been shown to&#xD;
      significantly reduce this complication. Despite this the incidence of peristomal infectious&#xD;
      complications remains high post PEG. Another problem associated with the administration of&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics is the emergence of resistant micro-organisms especially the&#xD;
      Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at the PEG site. Introducer PEG is the&#xD;
      technique of PEG placement which avoids the transit of PEG catheter through the oropharynx.&#xD;
      Despite its introduction since 19 years back it has not become popular among endoscopists&#xD;
      because of technical difficulties and complications associated with it. However the newer&#xD;
      introducer PEG technique using endoscopic gastropexy has been shown to be quite safe and easy&#xD;
      to perform in recent studies. We at our institute have been performing this procedure since&#xD;
      January 2003 and on prospective follow up have found much lower incidence of peristomal&#xD;
      infections with it. Recently Maetani et al have already demonstrated in a prospective&#xD;
      randomised trial that the introducer type PEG results in fewer infectious complications as&#xD;
      compared to conventional pull PEG. There is no study comparing introducer PEG technique with&#xD;
      or without administration of prophylactic antibiotics. As in principal, the chances of&#xD;
      infections are much lower in the introducer technique. We want to address this issue in a&#xD;
      randomised double blind placebo controlled settings in those patients who will as it is unfit&#xD;
      to undergo routine pull PEG because of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) malignant stenoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMARY: Peristomal infections are the commonest complications of PEG despite prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics which may result in emergence of resistant micro-organisms like Methicillin&#xD;
      resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Introducer PEG technique avoids the travel of PEG&#xD;
      catheter through the oropharynx which is richly inhabitated with microorganisms so chances of&#xD;
      infectious complications at the raw PEG wound are negligible. This technique was not popular&#xD;
      because of associated risks and complications in the past which has shown it to result in&#xD;
      complications like deflation of balloons, catheter dislodgement, leading to peritonitis etc.&#xD;
      However the new introducer PEG gastropexy has been recently proved to be safe. At our&#xD;
      institute about 200 PEG procedures are performed annually, out of these 10-12% have tight&#xD;
      stenotic stricture in which pull PEG is not possible without dilatation of oropharyngeal&#xD;
      tract. We plan to randomise these patients in to 2 groups with and without antibiotics&#xD;
      (placebo). PEG will be done using the new introducer PEG, FrekaÂ® Pexact CH/FR 15 (Fresenius&#xD;
      Kabi, Germany), in which the gastric wall is sutured non surgically to the anterior abdominal&#xD;
      wall using 2 silk sutures. Peristomal wound would be assessed daily for 7 days using 2 types&#xD;
      of point scores systems (given by Jain and by Gossner) by 2 members of nutrition support team&#xD;
      independently. As these are the objective scoring systems, we intend to determine the grades&#xD;
      of post procedure peristomal infections in these patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having very tight stenotic malignant lesions of the upper GI tract (i.e.&#xD;
             esophagus and or oropharynx) in whom routine pull PEG is not possible without&#xD;
             dilatation/bougeinage of the UGI tract. The GI lumen in patients included in this&#xD;
             study would have just sufficiently enough diameters to allow only the passage of thin&#xD;
             (8.8 mm) endoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergies to Ceftriaxone antibiotics,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving systemic antibiotics,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any contraindications to PEG like, severe coagulation disorders, peritonitis,&#xD;
             peritoneal carcinomatosis, burns or inability to achieve transillumination.&#xD;
