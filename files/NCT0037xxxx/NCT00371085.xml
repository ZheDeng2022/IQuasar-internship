    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a very common condition and is one of the main reasons people are admitted&#xD;
      to hospital. There are many things people with heart failure can do to manage their condition&#xD;
      at home. Unfortunately many people do not have enough information to do this and need to come&#xD;
      back to the hospital because their heart failure got worse. This study will look at different&#xD;
      ways to help people learn more about heart failure and how to manage their condition at home.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the clinical and economic importance of heart failure (HF) widely applicable strategies&#xD;
      to improve patient outcomes are needed. In Canada,1.4 million hospital days were associated&#xD;
      with HF in the fiscal year 2000 and almost one-third of these were readmissions . The&#xD;
      majority of acute precipitants of HF relate to poor self-care including excessive sodium and&#xD;
      fluid intake, and nonadherence to medications. Data derived from the PaKSAC survey confirm&#xD;
      that patients with HF have very poor knowledge of their condition and self-care&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease Management Programs for HF have been shown to improve clinical outcomes by providing&#xD;
      intensive education and medical management. Due to the resource intensity of such programs,&#xD;
      however, only a limited proportion of the population at risk is served. Clearly more&#xD;
      practical educational interventions are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intervention consisting of a video-based educational program for patients with HF,&#xD;
      focusing on 3 key steps (salt restriction, daily weights and medication adherence) will&#xD;
      improve knowledge of self-care activities, and clinical and economic outcomes at 6 months of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicentre randomized control trial comparing a simple, practical educational program for&#xD;
      patients with heart failure to usual care. All patients will be assessed using the validated&#xD;
      PaKSAC survey (Patient Knowledge of Self-Care Activities in Congestive Heart Failure) at&#xD;
      baseline and at 6 months. Those randomized to the intervention will view a 22 minute&#xD;
      educational video developed by our group that focuses on 3 key steps to self management. A&#xD;
      booklet and series of 3 newsletters will also be provided to the intervention group. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is the improvement in clinical outcomes at the end of the 6 month follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
