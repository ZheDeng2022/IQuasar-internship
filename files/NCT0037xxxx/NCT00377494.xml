    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of 2&#xD;
      doses of a malaria vaccine (DNA) followed by a dose of another type of malaria vaccine (MVA)&#xD;
      given as a &quot;booster.&quot; Forty-eight adults in Ghana, ages 18-50 years, will participate for 17&#xD;
      months. They will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Group 1 will receive the&#xD;
      DNA malaria vaccine at months 0 and 1, and the booster at month 7. Group 2 will receive a&#xD;
      rabies vaccine at months 0 and 1, and an injection containing no vaccine at month 7. Group 3&#xD;
      will receive the DNA malaria vaccine at months 5 and 6, and the booster at month 7. Group 4&#xD;
      will receive the rabies vaccine at months 5 and 6, and an injection containing no vaccine at&#xD;
      month 7. Blood samples and information regarding health problems that may occur after&#xD;
      vaccination will be collected.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      immunization with 2 doses of the PfCSP DNA vaccine (given 1 month apart) followed by a single&#xD;
      dose of MVA.CSO (given either 1 month or 6 months later) when administered to healthy,&#xD;
      malaria semi-immune adult volunteers. This Phase 1, randomized study conducted at Tetteh&#xD;
      Quarshie Memorial Hospital will enroll 48 healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 50 years. Twenty&#xD;
      four volunteers will initially be recruited and randomized to Groups 1 and 2. During Months 4&#xD;
      and 5 of the study, another 24 volunteers will be recruited and randomized to Groups 3 and 4.&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive the DNA malaria vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at months 0 and 1, and the&#xD;
      MVA malaria vaccine intradermally (ID) at month 7. Group 2 will receive a rabies vaccine IM&#xD;
      at months 0 and 1, and a normal saline injection ID at month 7. Group 3 will receive the DNA&#xD;
      malaria vaccine IM at months 5 and 6, and the MVA malaria vaccine ID at month 7. Group 4 will&#xD;
      receive the rabies vaccine IM at months 5 and 6, and a normal saline injection ID at month 7.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at intervals for safety and immunogenicity studies. Vaccine&#xD;
      safety will be monitored until 10 months after the final dose. At the conclusion of the&#xD;
      study, volunteers randomized to Groups 1 and 3 will have the option of receiving the rabies&#xD;
      vaccine. The primary study objectives are to: (1) assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      immunization with two doses of PfCSP DNA followed by one dose of MVA.CSO in healthy, malaria&#xD;
      semi-immune adult volunteers when given at intervals of 0, 1, and 2 months or at 0, 1, and 7&#xD;
      months; (2) evaluate whether the PfCSP DNA/MVA.CSO prime/boost vaccine regimen induces&#xD;
      PfCSP-specific immune responses, as assessed by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay, over background&#xD;
      responses; and (3) evaluate whether extending the interval between the second dose of PfCSP&#xD;
      DNA and MVA.CSO from 1 month to 6 months is associated with higher levels of PfCSP specific T&#xD;
      cell responses in semi-immune adults. The secondary study objective is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      extending the interval between the second dose of PfCSP DNA and MVA.CSO from 1 month to 6&#xD;
      months is associated with higher levels of humoral immunity by ELISA and IFAT in semi-immune&#xD;
      adults. The principal outcome measure will be the incidence of any vaccine related adverse&#xD;
      event, abnormal lab values, and local or systemic reactions. An additional outcome variable&#xD;
      for the remaining primary objectives is the results of the IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay at 1 week&#xD;
      after administration of MVA.CSO. This study is planned to be the first of multiple clinical&#xD;
      trials designed to test malaria vaccines in adults, children, and infants in endemic regions&#xD;
      of Ghana.&#xD;
