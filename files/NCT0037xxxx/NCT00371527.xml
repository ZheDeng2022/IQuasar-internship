      ABSTRACT CONTEXT: Inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for acute bronchitis is a major&#xD;
      public health concern because of antibiotic resistance. Effective therapies for managing the&#xD;
      symptoms of acute bronchitis are lacking, however.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: Determine if patients with acute bronchitis have better symptom control when&#xD;
      treated with inhaled ipratropium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: COUGH STOP was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled&#xD;
      trial comparing ipratropium with placebo in acute bronchitis. Subjects were referred by their&#xD;
      primary care provider or from urgent care clinics at a single institution. Subjects had been&#xD;
      diagnosed with acute bronchitis and had no significant co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: Subjects received ipratropium or placebo inhalers, administering 2 puffs four&#xD;
      times daily. A structured telephone interview took place 2, 4, and 8 days after enrollment.&#xD;
      Medical records were reviewed at 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME: The primary endpoint was improvement in cough symptomology; secondary endpoints&#xD;
      included subsequent antibiotic prescriptions and &quot;well being.&quot;&#xD;

      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      COUGH STOP was an investigator-initiated study. We conducted a prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      double blind, placebo controlled trial to test the hypothesis that ipratropium would improve&#xD;
      cough symptoms in otherwise healthy subjects with acute bronchitis. Subjects were enrolled&#xD;
      between October 9th 2002 and November 1 2003, and were included if they had a cough with or&#xD;
      without sputum production for less than 30 days duration; were age 18 through 65; and were&#xD;
      willing to follow up by phone for a brief interview at 2, 4, and 8 days after enrollment.&#xD;
      Subjects were excluded if they had a history of COPD; asthma; or other lung disease; had&#xD;
      localized lung findings on exam to suggest pneumonia or asthma; chest X-ray (if done) with&#xD;
      evidence of pneumonia; purulent nasal discharge or other evidence of bacterial sinus&#xD;
      infection; evidence of streptococcal pharyngitis; temperature greater than 101.5 in the&#xD;
      preceding 72 hours; treatment of a respiratory tract infection in the last 30 days;&#xD;
      pregnancy; breast feeding; actively trying to become pregnant; history of heart failure;&#xD;
      history of renal failure or insufficiency with a creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl; history&#xD;
      of psychiatric illness other than minor depression; currently incarcerated; or were unwilling&#xD;
      to sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was reviewed and approved by the IRB for our facility, and approved by the FDA by&#xD;
      way of an IND application. Subjects were either referred to one of the study investigators by&#xD;
      a practicing physician or nurse practitioner at our facility, or were enrolled by a member of&#xD;
      our team directly. Subjects were given a copy of the consent form, asked to review it and ask&#xD;
      questions. Those who signed the consent form were randomly assigned to treatment with&#xD;
      ipratropium or placebo metered dose inhaler (MDI). The assignment key was maintained by the&#xD;
      pharmacy and by one of the investigators who had no interaction with the subjects or the data&#xD;
      collection process. Subjects received training on how to use an MDI with a spacer device from&#xD;
      a member of the study team. Subjects were instructed to take two puffs from the study MDI&#xD;
      four times a day for the next 8 days. After the first 8 days they were instructed to use the&#xD;
      study MDI on an as needed basis if they thought it was benefiting them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a structured enrollment interview subjects were asked the following questions: How&#xD;
      long have you been coughing (number of days)? What other symptoms do you have? Are you&#xD;
      producing sputum? Do you smoke? Are you coughing at night? If &quot;Yes,&quot; is it interrupting your&#xD;
      sleep? Have you stopped working/daily activities? Are you having fevers? If &quot;Yes,&quot; how high&#xD;
      are they? What over-the-counter medications are you using?&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow up telephone interviews, on days 2, 4, and 8 after enrollment, subjects&#xD;
      were asked a similar but shorter set of questions: Are you still coughing? Is your cough&#xD;
      better, worse, the same? Are you producing sputum? Is your sputum production better, worse,&#xD;
      the same? Are you coughing at night? If &quot;Yes,&quot; is it interrupting your sleep? Have you&#xD;
      returned to work/daily activities? Has your sense of well being returned? Are you having&#xD;
      fevers? If &quot;Yes,&quot; how high are they? Are you having any side effects with the medication? If&#xD;
      &quot;Yes,&quot; what are they? Are you having any problems using your inhaler? If &quot;Yes,&quot; please&#xD;
      describe. What over-the-counter medications are you using? Subjects were not given any&#xD;
      medical advice during the follow up interviews and were advised to address any medical&#xD;
      questions with their primary care physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records were reviewed after two months of enrollment for, frequency of return clinic&#xD;
      visits, medication prescriptions, especially antibiotics, and complications related to study&#xD;
      enrollment. Subjects who had either a subsequent antibiotic prescription or clinic visit for&#xD;
      respiratory complaints in the 60 days following study enrollment had an audit of their&#xD;
      medical records. Subjects who were prescribed antibiotics in this period had their records&#xD;
      reviewed for the following: which antibiotic was prescribed; how long after enrollment it was&#xD;
      prescribed; and why it was prescribed. This data was collected in a separate database and&#xD;
      reviewed in a blinded fashion by the entire research team for inclusion in the final&#xD;
      analysis. All decisions were unanimous, and based on the following factors: the diagnosis at&#xD;
      the time of the prescription was consistent with that of an upper respiratory tract infection&#xD;
      (URI); the antibiotic prescribed was consistent with treatment for URI; in cases where the&#xD;
      diagnosis at the time of prescription could not be determined, the subject was included in&#xD;
      the secondary analysis if the antibiotic prescribed was consistent with treatment of a URI.&#xD;
      Subjects were excluded from the analysis if their diagnosis at the time of the prescription&#xD;
      was not consistent with URI or if the antibiotic prescribed was not consistent with treatment&#xD;
      of a URI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, subjects who had clinic visits in the subsequent sixty-days had their records&#xD;
      audited. Data was again collected in a separate database and reviewed in a blinded fashion by&#xD;
      the entire team. Again, all decisions were unanimous, and criteria for inclusion were that&#xD;
      the diagnosis at the time of the visit was consistent with that of a URI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Power analysis indicated that a sample size of approximately 100&#xD;
      subjects in the treatment and control arms would be sufficient to detect a 33% reduction of&#xD;
      cough frequency in the experimental arm receiving ipratropium, assuming a =.05 and b =.20,&#xD;
      using a two- tailed z-statistic. Calculation of standard effect size for this power analysis&#xD;
      was based upon extrapolation from Hueston's and Melbye's data13 15 on albuterol and fenoterol&#xD;
      use in acute bronchitis, assuming a similar effect of ipratropium. Effect size for this&#xD;
      calculation was based upon published values of relative risk in the references. Power&#xD;
      analysis was not performed for other outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, according to randomized assignment. The&#xD;
      ipratropium and placebo arms were compared for: self-reported cough severity [same, better,&#xD;
      worse]; cough duration [present, not present] for days 2, 4, 8; , well-being [well, not-well]&#xD;
      for days 2, 4, 8; work absence [attended work, did not work] for days 2, 4, 8. Proportions&#xD;
      and rates for non-continuous grouped variables were compared using chi-square test. Normally&#xD;
      distributed continuous variables, such as cough duration, were compared between treatment&#xD;
      arms using a two-tailed t-test.&#xD;
