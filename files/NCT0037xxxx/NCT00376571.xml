&#xD;
      End-point evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary end-points will be assessed by an independent end-point committee. The&#xD;
      end-point committee will consist of experienced interventional cardiologists. Detailed&#xD;
      end-point definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Q-wave myocardial infarction: Appearance of a new Q-wave in two or more contiguous leads&#xD;
           on ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction: Infarction, which is considered present in a patient&#xD;
           having clinical, angiographic, electrocardiographic and/or laboratory evidence of&#xD;
           myocardial necrosis with an ECG showing no new Q-waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure related myocardial infarction: A threefold increase or CK-MB or Troponin-T/I.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target lesion revascularization: Coronary bypass operation with grafting or PCI of index&#xD;
           lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target vessel revascularization: Coronary bypass operation with grafting or PCI of index&#xD;
           vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stent thrombosis: Thrombotic occlusion of index stent/stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vessel measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1 Proximal reference diameter: Vessel diameter proximal to lesion. 2 Distal reference&#xD;
           diameter: Vessel diameter distal to lesion. 3 Reference diameter: Mean of proximal and&#xD;
           distal vessel diameter. 4 Percentual diameter stenosis: (Reference diameter - minimal&#xD;
           luminal diameter)/reference diameter in percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Angiographic restenosis: &gt; 50% diameter stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiographic core lab:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The index and the follow-up angiograms will be assessed blindly at the QCA core lab. at&#xD;
      Department of Cardiology, Skejby Hospital, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Definition of index angiography: The angiography obtained during the PCI procedure will be&#xD;
      used as index angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Definition of follow-up angiography: After 8 months a conventional diagnostic angiography&#xD;
      will be performed and the projections used at the index angiography will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steering committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The steering committee will consist of one or two investigators from each center. All&#xD;
      steering committee members will have full access to the database and will participate in the&#xD;
      interpretation of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progress of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progress of the study will be checked on a weekly basis by the steering committee. They&#xD;
      will receive and evaluate data on inclusion rate and the primary end-point event rate.&#xD;
      Further, the steering committee will receive and evaluate the weekly safety data on the rate&#xD;
      of stent thrombosis in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The statistical analyses will be performed by UNI-C, University of Aarhus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary end-point: The composite of the primary end-point at 6 months follow-up will be&#xD;
           analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between the event-free survival curves&#xD;
           will be compared with the use of the Wilcoxon and log-rank tests. Two-sided test is used&#xD;
           and the p-value considered to indicate significance will be 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary end-points and other parameters: For continuous variables, differences between&#xD;
           the treatment groups will be evaluated by analysis of variance or Wilcoxon's rank-sum&#xD;
           test. For discrete variables, differences will be expressed as counts and percentages&#xD;
           will be analyzed with Fisher's exact test. Secondary end-points will be assessed after 8&#xD;
           months. Two-sided test is used and the p-value considered to indicate significance will&#xD;
           be 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * For safety reasons, stent thrombosis after one month will be monitored continuously. A&#xD;
      stent thrombosis rate of &gt;5% in any of the treatment groups will necessitate premature&#xD;
      termination of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Results are analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle, i.e. patients&#xD;
      randomized to a certain group will be followed and assessed irrespectively of the actual&#xD;
      treatment. Protocol violations will be noted and the responsible centers notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * With an expected primary end-point event rate of 30% in the &quot;stenting main vessel and side&#xD;
      branch group&quot;, an alpha of 5% and a power of 80%, a reduction of primary end-point event rate&#xD;
      to 15% in the &quot;optional side branch treatment group&quot; can be detected with 200 patients in&#xD;
      each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be randomized at the beginning of the PCI procedure and before any&#xD;
           insertion of wire or balloons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a block randomization according to centre and a stratification according&#xD;
           to sex, age&gt;70 years, diabetes, use of GPIIb/IIIa blocker and +/- angiographic&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be computer randomized by a 24 hour telephone service. The PARAVOX&#xD;
           system will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be monitored according to the GCP rules by independent professionals. During the&#xD;
      trial, the monitor will have regular contacts with the trial site(s), including visits to&#xD;
      ensure that the trial is conducted and documented properly in compliance with the protocol,&#xD;
      GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Results will be published in an international cardiovascular journal. Publication and&#xD;
      author issues will be decided by the steering committee on basis of general involvement in&#xD;
      the study (core lab. function, end-point committee membership ect.) and of number of included&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
