  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial dysfunction precedes the development of cardiovascular disease and it is common&#xD;
      in patients with diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study is to identify the effect of two&#xD;
      different physical training programs, using ultrasound techniques, on the endothelial&#xD;
      function of patients with type 2 DM.&#xD;

      Subjects Subjects with type 2 DM, of both genders, aged between 40 and 65 years, without&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, characterized by a negative maximum exercise test, will be studied.&#xD;
      This study will be carried out at the Prevention and Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Unit&#xD;
      Unicardio, in Hospital Santa Catarina, in the city of Blumenau, State of Santa Catarina,&#xD;
      South of Brazil. The patients will be invited to participate in the study as they are treated&#xD;
      at the clinic during regular medical consultations, with approximately 235 patients per&#xD;
      month. After that, patient randomization will be carried out, by dividing the patients in the&#xD;
      groups: intervention (a group undergoing high-intensity exercise and another one undergoing&#xD;
      low-intensity exercise) and control group (patients not submitted to the physical exercise&#xD;
      program, but went to the health care center to undergo blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
      measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following exclusion criteria will be used: subjects in whom, for reasons related to&#xD;
      clinical screening, it is not possible to withdrawn medications with known endothelial&#xD;
      function effect, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers,&#xD;
      nitrates, beta-blockers, anti-oxidizers, hormonal replacement therapy, insulin; subjects with&#xD;
      altered maximum exercise test (positive); cigarette smoking history in the last 12 months;&#xD;
      participation in a physical exercise program in the last 12 months; chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease; high blood pressure levels (systolic blood pressure &gt; 180mmHg and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110mmHg); osteoporosis and diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants will&#xD;
      be informed of the objectives of the study and possible risks and discomforts involved with&#xD;
      their participation in the experiments, and will be included only after signing the informed&#xD;
      consent term. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Santa&#xD;
      Catarina (Blumenau, Santa Catarina, Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol All study subjects will undergo an initial clinical examination performed by a&#xD;
      cardiologist. Before and after 6 weeks of intervention, the patients will undergo the maximum&#xD;
      exercise test, physical examination and endothelial function evaluation. The participants&#xD;
      will be submitted to a program of physical exercise in the Prevention and Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Unit Unicardio of Hospital Santa Catarina, in Blumenau, Brazil. After the&#xD;
      maximum exercise test is limited by fatigue, the participants will be referred, based on&#xD;
      their individual exercise prescription and randomized to a low (50 to 60% of maximum heart&#xD;
      rate) or high intensity (75 to 85% of maximum heart rate) exercise program. During the study&#xD;
      period, the patients should maintain the same doses of medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a non-invasive evaluation of endothelial function, performed at&#xD;
      Cl√≠nica Uniangio, in the city of Blumenau, Brazil. Two investigators will perform all the&#xD;
      tests, while blinded to the group the patients were randomized to. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      an 8-12 hour period of food and water deprivation. The individuals will be placed in the&#xD;
      supine position, with the arms placed along the body in a comfortable position to obtain&#xD;
      image of the brachial artery, above the antecubital fossa, in the longitudinal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ultrasonic sound wave equipment will be used (Acuson, Model 128XP System, Mountain View,&#xD;
      California, USA), with vascular software for two-dimensional images (2D), color Doppler with&#xD;
      an internal electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor and a high-frequency vascular transducer (Acuson,&#xD;
      Model L7 7,5-10 MHz, Mountain View, California, USA). After positioned, a segment with&#xD;
      anterior and posterior interfaces with the arterial wall will be selected for 2D images.&#xD;
      Arterial diameter values will be recorded in super-VHS for subsequent analysis.&#xD;
