  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an OBSERVATIONAL Specimen procurement and data collections trial for acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome that will be conducted in the Emergency Department at Henry Ford Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard protocol for evaluating patients in the Emergency Department for possible acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction includes the measurement of cardiac troponin over 3 hours. Subjects&#xD;
      presenting to the ED with chest discomfort or ischemic symptoms will be eligible for blood&#xD;
      draw protocol. The study is blinded to treating physicians and does not change current&#xD;
      standard of care. After informed consent patients will have blood samples drawn at 0, 30&#xD;
      minutes, 1 hour and 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum from the samples will be stored in a -80 research freezer to be evaluated at a later&#xD;
      time as new cardiac markers for acute coronary syndrome are developed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects considered for enrollment in this study will be identified and approached by either&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator or trained study coordinator (SC). Candidates for enrollment will&#xD;
      be individuals presenting with signs and/or symptoms of Acute Coronary Syndrome at the Henry&#xD;
      Ford Hospital Emergency Department (ED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This specimen collection study is a prospective serial draw plasma collection study designed&#xD;
      to collect specimens for use in existing or future clinical studies. Specimen collection is&#xD;
      expected to take approximately 30-36 months. Specimens will be collected from subjects that&#xD;
      are being evaluated for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other than sample collection, no special procedures or medications are required by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to enroll approximately 250-500 individuals evaluated for possible ACS in the&#xD;
      ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimens will be obtained from the subject at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      t0 =Baseline ECG (ECG time + 60 minutes) t1= within 30 (+/- 10 minutes) minutes after t0 t2 =&#xD;
      1 (+/- 15 minutes) hours after t0 t3 = 3 (+/-15 minutes) hours after t0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each sample will consist of approximately 6-8.5 ml of blood in each of two anticoagulant tube&#xD;
      types: SST and K2EDTA plasma. Four serial specimens will be collected within 3 hours of&#xD;
      presentation to the ED for observation of ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Investigator or designee will obtain the subject's written informed consent prior to&#xD;
           collecting the specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each subject will be given a unique study number. An enrollment log will be used to&#xD;
           document the enrollment of individuals by study number. This study number will be used&#xD;
           to identify the individual throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each subject will have a medical history reviewed and documented, as well as significant&#xD;
           cardiac medical history documented in the subject's case report form in addition to&#xD;
           demographic information including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and medication history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each subject will have a baseline ECG obtained in the ED, vital signs and routine&#xD;
           laboratory results. These will be documented in the subject's case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 6-8.5 ml of blood will be collected in each of two anticoagulant tube&#xD;
           types: SST and K2EDTA plasma. The first blood collection in the ED is designated as t0&#xD;
           ED ECG time (+ 60 minutes). Additional blood draws of approximately 6-8.5 mL/tube type&#xD;
           will occur at t1 = 30 (+/- 10 minutes) after t0, t2=1 (+/-15 minutes) hour after t0, t4&#xD;
           = 3 (+/- 15 minutes) hours after t0 (if the patient is still in the ED/hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each draw, a minimum volume (after processing) of approximately 2 mL of plasma&#xD;
           should be obtained. The specimens will be processed, aliquoted, and retained in a -70&#xD;
           secured freezer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
