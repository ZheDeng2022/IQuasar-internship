  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the spinal cord injured population ages, these individuals are being exposed to an&#xD;
      increased prevalence of age-associated diseases, which coupled with the secondary&#xD;
      complications of the injury may contribute to the reduced life expectancies. Decentralized&#xD;
      autonomic regulation in persons with SCI results in a multitude of cardiovascular changes,&#xD;
      which may contribute to accelerated aging. Adverse cardiovascular changes may have&#xD;
      deleterious effects on cerebral blood flow dynamics and an increase in cerebral vascular&#xD;
      resistance index in individuals with SCI during cognitive testing. Deficits in memory and&#xD;
      processing speed in individuals with SCI may relate to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      dysfunction. Identifying the associations between healthy aging versus premature or&#xD;
      accelerated aging in organ system function in the SCI population is an important first step&#xD;
      towards prevention and amelioration of these changes. Therefore the study objectives are to&#xD;
      compare, among individuals with SCI, age-matched non-SCI and older non-SCI individuals&#xD;
      arterial stiffness and cerebral vascular resistance index; memory, processing speed, and&#xD;
      executive function; and volume of white matter hyperintensities. 60 individuals with SCI, 30&#xD;
      age-matched non-SCI controls, and 20 older non-SCI controls will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
      All potential subjects will undergo a two-part screening process which consists of an initial&#xD;
      screening via telephone and a detailed, in-person screening. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in a 4 hour laboratory visit during which their arterial stiffness,&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate and, blood flow to the brain will be monitored&#xD;
      at rest and during a comprehensive series of cognitive tests. A subset of the participants&#xD;
      will be asked to take part in an MRI brain imaging session: 40 persons with SCI, 10&#xD;
      age-matched non-SCI and 10 older non-SCI. Eligible subjects will be asked to participate in a&#xD;
      1 hour MRI/functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that arterial stiffness and cerebral vascular resistance index will be&#xD;
      increased in the SCI group compared to the age-matched non-SCI but will be comparable to the&#xD;
      older non-SCI groups. In addition, we hypothesize that the prevalence of mild to moderate&#xD;
      cognitive impairments in memory, processing speed, and executive function will be increased&#xD;
      in the SCI individuals compared to the age-matched non-SCI but will be comparable to the&#xD;
      older non-SCI individuals.&#xD;
