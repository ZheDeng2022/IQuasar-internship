  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that investigation medication&#xD;
      (Bowklean) is not less effective than the active comparator (Klean-Prep with Dulcolax), with&#xD;
      regards to the overall quality of bowel preparation in subjects undergoing colonoscopy. An&#xD;
      additional objective of this study is to collect subject's response to the acceptability and&#xD;
      tolerability about bowel preparation and safety information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After bowel preparation, independent evaluator who is blinded to subject's treatment will&#xD;
      evaluate the overall colon cleansing based on Aronchick and Ottawa scale. A total of 600&#xD;
      eligible subjects scheduled to a colonoscopy will be randomly assigned with equal allocation&#xD;
      to 1 of 2 treatment groups: &quot;Bowklean&quot; or &quot;Klean-Prep&quot; with Dulcolax. Each subject's&#xD;
      participation is expected to be maximally 4 weeks in study duration (up to 3-week screening&#xD;
      period followed by one week post colonoscopy).&#xD;

      The objective of this study was to demonstrate that investigational medication (Bowklean) is&#xD;
      not less effective than the active comparator (Klean-Prep with Dulcolax), with regards to the&#xD;
      overall quality of bowel preparation in subjects undergoing colonoscopy. It was designed to&#xD;
      measure the number of subjects whose colons are cleansed successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects that achieve excellent or good&#xD;
      cleansing (success rate) in the Aronchick Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary efficacy variables include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proportion of successes (excellent, good, or fair) by individual colon segment&#xD;
           (ascending, transverse, descending), which are assessed with the Ottawa scale6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mean bowel preparation score assessed with Ottawa Scale by adding points for the&#xD;
           cleansing of three parts of colon and points for amount of fluid in the bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Percentage of subject's responses to the acceptability and tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety was assessed at each clinic visit by evaluation of the following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Percentage of subjects occurred solicited event (nausea, vomiting, chest pain and&#xD;
           dizziness) during the preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events during the study period.&#xD;
