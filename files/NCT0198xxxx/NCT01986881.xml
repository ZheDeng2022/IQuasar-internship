    <textblock>
      An overall study of the cardiovascular outcomes following treatment with ertugliflozin in&#xD;
      participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and established vascular disease. The main&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the cardiovascular safety of ertugliflozin. This trial&#xD;
      includes 3 pre-defined glycemic sub-studies; 1. In participants receiving background insulin&#xD;
      with or without metformin, 2. In participants receiving background sulfonylurea monotherapy,&#xD;
      and 3. In participants receiving background metformin with sulfonylurea (all fully-enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled prior to Amendment 1 were in the overall study as well as a sub-study,&#xD;
      if they met certain entry criteria. Participants enrolled following the start of Amendment 1&#xD;
      were only enrolled in the overall study. The sub-studies were the initial 18 weeks of the&#xD;
      overall study period.&#xD;

      The primary hypotheses for the 4 studies are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overall Cardiovascular Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The time to first occurrence of the composite endpoint of MACE: cardiovascular death,&#xD;
           non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI] or non-fatal stroke in participants treated with&#xD;
           ertugliflozin is non-inferior compared to that in participants treated with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The 3 Glycemic Sub-studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The mean reduction from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) for 15 mg ertugliflozin is&#xD;
                greater than that for placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The mean reduction from baseline in A1C for 5 mg ertugliflozin is greater than that&#xD;
                for placebo.&#xD;

    <description>Doses of background anti-hyperglycemic agents (AHA), medications will be required to be held constant in all participants enrolled for the initial 18 weeks of the trial with 2 exceptions: First, participant will be prescribed glycemic rescue therapy if they meet specific, progressively more stringent, glycemic thresholds based on repeated, confirmed fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measured at a central laboratory. Second, a participant experiencing clinically significant hypoglycemia according to the investigator at any time during the trial is permitted to have the dose of appropriate background AHA (e.g., insulin, sulfonylurea [SU], glinide) reduced or discontinued as per the judgment of the investigator or the treating physician. Choice and dosing of glycemic rescue will be at the discretion of the investigator or the treating physician consistent with standards of care for management of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) within the country of the investigational site.</description>

        <description>A1C is a blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time and is reported as a percentage (%). A1C represents the percentage of glycated hemoglobin. This change from baseline reflects the Week 18 A1C minus the Week 0 A1C. A negative number indicates a reduction in A1C level. Participants who met glycemic rescue criteria received glycemic rescue medication. &quot;Excluding Rescue&quot; excluded all data following the initiation of rescue in order to avoid the confounding influence of the rescue therapy.</description>

        <description>A1C is a blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time and is reported as a percentage (%). A1C represents the percentage of glycated hemoglobin. This change from baseline reflects the Month 36 A1C minus the Week 0 A1C. A negative number indicates a reduction in A1C level.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Albuminuria Progression or Regression at Week 18 (Overall Cardiovascular Study)</title>
        <description>Albuminuria progression and regression were assessed relative to the baseline albuminuria category. Progression was defined as either a change from having normal-albuminuria at baseline to micro-albuminuria at the respective visit, or micro-albuminuria at baseline to macro-albuminuria at the respective visit, or normal albuminuria at baseline to macro-albuminuria at the respective visit. Regression was defined as either a change from having micro-albuminuria at baseline to normal albuminuria at the respective visit, or macro-albuminuria at baseline to micro-albuminuria at the respective visit, or macro-albuminuria at baseline to normal albuminuria at the respective visit. Normal albuminuria: urine albumin to urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) &lt;30 (mg/g); Micro-albuminuria: UACR ≥30 and ≤300 (mg/g); Macro-albuminuria: UACR&gt;300 (mg/g).</description>

          <description>Albuminuria progression and regression were assessed relative to the baseline albuminuria category. Progression was defined as either a change from having normal-albuminuria at baseline to micro-albuminuria at the respective visit, or micro-albuminuria at baseline to macro-albuminuria at the respective visit, or normal albuminuria at baseline to macro-albuminuria at the respective visit. Regression was defined as either a change from having micro-albuminuria at baseline to normal albuminuria at the respective visit, or macro-albuminuria at baseline to micro-albuminuria at the respective visit, or macro-albuminuria at baseline to normal albuminuria at the respective visit. Normal albuminuria: urine albumin to urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) &lt;30 (mg/g); Micro-albuminuria: UACR ≥30 and ≤300 (mg/g); Macro-albuminuria: UACR&gt;300 (mg/g).</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Albuminuria Progression or Regression at Month 48 (Overall Cardiovascular Study)</title>
          <description>Albuminuria progression and regression were assessed relative to the baseline albuminuria category. Progression was defined as either a change from having normal albuminuria at baseline to micro-albuminuria at the respective visit, or micro-albuminuria at baseline to macro-albuminuria at the respective visit, or normal albuminuria at baseline to macro-albuminuria at the respective visit. Regression was defined as either a change from having micro-albuminuria at baseline to normal albuminuria at the respective visit, or macro-albuminuria at baseline to micro-albuminuria at the respective visit, or macro-albuminuria at baseline and normal albuminuria at the respective visit. Normal albuminuria: urine albumin to urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) &lt;30 (mg/g); Micro-albuminuria: UACR ≥30 and ≤300 (mg/g); Macro-albuminuria: UACR&gt;300 (mg/g).</description>
          <population>The analysis population included all participants who were randomized, received at least one dose of blinded study medication, had a baseline measurement, and at least one measurement for the analysis endpoint for the specified timepoint at Month 48.</population>
