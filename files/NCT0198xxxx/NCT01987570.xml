    <textblock>
      Generating critical levels of power is a prerequisite for performing simple daily activities,&#xD;
      such as rising from a chair or climbing stairs. For a young healthy person these activities&#xD;
      can be performed easily, however after a prolonged period of forced inactivity (such as&#xD;
      during the recovery from a sports injury, prolonged bed rest or spaceflight) a loss of muscle&#xD;
      mass occurs. It has been suggested that this loss may be triggered by oxidative stress. An&#xD;
      enzyme involved in the production of free radicals in various experimental models, including&#xD;
      immobilization, is xanthine oxidase (XO). Although allopurinol is an inhibitor of XO widely&#xD;
      used in clinical practice, its effect on the maintenance of muscle mass after an&#xD;
      immobilization protocol is unknown. Thus, the major aim of this clinical trial is to&#xD;
      determine the effect of allopurinol administration on the prevention of muscle mass loss in&#xD;
      immobilized subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized study in which fifty young male subjects (aged between 25&#xD;
      and 40 years) diagnosed with grade II ankle sprain will be recruited. After immobilization&#xD;
      the patients will be assigned randomly to one of two experimental groups, one treated with&#xD;
      allopurinol (n=25) and the other with placebo (n=25). The dosage of allopurinol will be the&#xD;
      same as recommended for gout patients, i.e. 300 mg/day orally, during all the immobilization&#xD;
      period, which will last fifteen days. This medication will be delivered to the patients when&#xD;
      they agree to participate in the clinical trial. They will be immobilized by posterior knee&#xD;
      splint, preventing use of that leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will determine muscle mass loss by performing two magnetic resonances of both legs before&#xD;
      and after the immobilization period. We will also take two blood samples (before and after&#xD;
      immobilization) to measure oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, protein carbonyls,&#xD;
      and XO activity), inflammatory parameters (IL-6, C-reactive protein and 1-antichymotrypsin),&#xD;
      as well as vitamin D levels.&#xD;
