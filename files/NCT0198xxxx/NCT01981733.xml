  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The THRIVE-1 study will examine novel methods for enhancing blood flow in the lower limb&#xD;
      using electrical stimulation. Increases in lower limb blood flow improve venous return and&#xD;
      thereby reduce venous stasis. Since stasis is one of the compounding factors in the&#xD;
      development of deep vein thrombosis, the risk of developing thrombosis should theoretically&#xD;
      be proportionally reduced. This technique may prove to be a useful tool in preventing and&#xD;
      reducing the incidence of deep vein thrombosis in both medical and surgical patients together&#xD;
      with passengers undertaking significant duration travel (as travel - related deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis is not exclusively related to flying).&#xD;
