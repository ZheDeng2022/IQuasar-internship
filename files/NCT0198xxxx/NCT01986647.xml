  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community-dwelling older adults fear loss of independence and nursing home placement more&#xD;
      than death. Walking difficulty often leads to loss of independence. Exercise is beneficial to&#xD;
      physical and mental health and may prevent walking difficulty and promote independence.&#xD;
      Recognizing the importance of exercise, senior housing facilities offer exercise programs to&#xD;
      their residents. The exercise programs are often group-based, seated range of motion&#xD;
      exercises that do not challenge the older adult; consequently participation rates and&#xD;
      resident satisfaction are low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the goal is to improve walking to promote independence than the exercise program should&#xD;
      specifically target walking. Therefore, we developed a challenging, group exercise program&#xD;
      entitled &quot;On the Move&quot; which focuses on the fundamentals of walking. In this research study&#xD;
      we will determine if the On the Move program is better than a standard program at improving&#xD;
      walking and promoting independence and if the same benefits can be obtained if the On the&#xD;
      Move program is delivered by staff of the senior living facilities instead of an exercise&#xD;
      leader. To answer these questions, 400 community-dwelling older adults living in 32 different&#xD;
      Independent Living Facilities and Senior High Rises or living in the community and attending&#xD;
      senior community centers will be randomly assigned to either the 12 week On the Move group&#xD;
      exercise program or the standard group exercise program delivered by either an exercise&#xD;
      leader or staff activity personnel. Participants' walking and reported ability to carry out&#xD;
      everyday activities (functional ability) will be assessed before and after the 12 week&#xD;
      program. We will also assess participant safety and satisfaction with the exercise program&#xD;
      and instructor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this research study will provide evidence for the value of the On the Move&#xD;
      group exercise program and will better inform patient choices regarding participation in&#xD;
      exercise programs. If successful in improving walking and promoting independence and&#xD;
      acceptable to the older adult, the On the Move program could be incorporated into exercise&#xD;
      programming for older adults in community centers, health clubs, and senior residences across&#xD;
      the country.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This single-blinded cluster randomized trial compares the effectiveness and sustainability of&#xD;
      On the Move and a standard group exercise program in 400 community-dwelling older adults. We&#xD;
      will also examine the acceptability and risks associated with exercise participation. We will&#xD;
      accomplish the objectives by pursuing the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the effects of the On the Move group exercise program to a standard program on&#xD;
           self-reported function and disability and walking ability. The On the Move program will&#xD;
           produce greater gains in self-reported function and disability (Late Life Function and&#xD;
           Disability Index/LLFDI) and walking ability (6-minute walk test/6MWT and gait speed)&#xD;
           when delivered by an exercise leader.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When feasible to be delivered by staff activity personnel, explore the effectiveness of&#xD;
           On the Move compared to a standard program; and sustainability compared to delivery by&#xD;
           exercise leaders (when feasible). Explore barriers to identifying and training staff&#xD;
           activity personnel. On the Move delivered by staff activity personnel (when feasible)&#xD;
           will produce gains in above outcomes that are greater than the standard program; and&#xD;
           comparable to when delivered by an exercise leader.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the acceptability and the risks of the On the Move and standard exercise&#xD;
           programs delivered by (a) exercise leaders and (b) staff activity personnel (when&#xD;
           feasible). On the Move will result in greater satisfaction and higher attendance rates&#xD;
           than the standard program. Attendance rates and satisfaction will be similar for&#xD;
           exercise leader and staff activity personnel led programs when feasible to recruit staff&#xD;
           personnel. Adverse event (falls, soft tissue injuries, muscle soreness, etc) rates&#xD;
           during exercise will be similar between the two groups and the two facilitators when&#xD;
           feasible to recruit staff personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore potential baseline predictors of benefit and risks of participation in On the&#xD;
           Move program to facilitate informed patient decision making. We will be able to identify&#xD;
           combinations of baseline physical, psychosocial and demographic factors associated with&#xD;
           each of the treatment response and adverse events outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-blinded cluster randomized trial targets community-dwelling older adults residing&#xD;
      in Independent Living Facilities and Senior High Rises or living in the community and&#xD;
      attending senior community centers. The trial compares type of exercise program (12 week&#xD;
      standard group exercise program to the 12 week On the Move group exercise program) and the&#xD;
      mode of delivery (exercise leader to staff activity personnel). Primary outcomes include&#xD;
      function, disability and walking ability. We will also examine acceptability and risks&#xD;
      associated with exercise participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population We will recruit participants from the Independent Living Facilities (ILFs),&#xD;
      Senior Housing sites and from senior community centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise program comparison. The On the Move exercise program will be compared to a standard&#xD;
      group exercise program. Both exercise programs will be group-based and led by a person. Both&#xD;
      programs will be delivered by trained exercise leaders or trained staff activity personnel&#xD;
      (only when such a person is available). When a suitable staff activity person is not&#xD;
      available, the program will be delivered by one of our exercise leaders. The frequency and&#xD;
      duration of the programs are identical (50 minutes, 2 times a week for 12 weeks). The main&#xD;
      difference between the standard and the On the Move group exercise programs is the program&#xD;
      content which is described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The On the Move exercise program is based on principles of motor learning that enhance&#xD;
      &quot;skill&quot; or smooth and automatic movement control. The program contains a warm-up (5 minutes),&#xD;
      stepping patterns (15 minutes), walking patterns (15 minutes), strengthening exercises (10&#xD;
      minutes), and cool-down exercises (5 minutes). The warm-up and cool down contain gentle range&#xD;
      of motion exercises and stretches for the lower extremities and trunk. The stepping and&#xD;
      walking patterns are goal-oriented progressively more difficult patterns which promote the&#xD;
      timing and coordination of stepping, integrated with the phases of the gait cycle. The&#xD;
      strengthening exercises are conducted in sitting and standing and target the lower extremity&#xD;
      muscles. The majority of the program will be conducted in standing (40 minutes) with only a&#xD;
      small portion conducted in sitting (10 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard group exercise program is based on exercise programs that are currently being&#xD;
      conducted at the facilities (i.e. standard of care). The operationally defined program&#xD;
      contains a warm-up (5 minutes), upper and lower extremity strength and flexibility exercises&#xD;
      (30 minutes), static balance exercises (10 minutes) and a cool-down (5 minutes). The majority&#xD;
      of the program will be conducted in sitting (40 minutes) with only a small portion (10&#xD;
      minutes) conducted in standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustainability of the program: exercise leader and staff activity personnel comparison (Aim&#xD;
      2). The sustainability of the program will be evaluated by assessing the effectiveness of On&#xD;
      the Move compared to a standard program when delivered by staff activity personnel and by&#xD;
      comparing outcomes obtained by the On the Move program delivered by exercise leaders and&#xD;
      staff activity personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main outcomes, function, disability, and walking ability are highly associated with&#xD;
      independence and are extremely important to the older adult. Our primary measure of function&#xD;
      and disability is the Late Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) and our main&#xD;
      measures of walking ability are Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and gait speed. We will also&#xD;
      examine confidence in walking (Gait Efficacy Scale), walking under challenging conditions&#xD;
      (challenging gait tasks and figure of 8 walk), and gait variability as additional measures of&#xD;
      walking ability. All measures will be collected at baseline and immediately following the 12&#xD;
      week intervention by research personnel who are blinded to the intervention group assignment.&#xD;
      All testing will be conducted at the ILFs and Senior Housing sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, we will perform a multivariate Hotelling t-test to simultaneously compare the baseline&#xD;
      to follow-up change in the three primary outcomes between the arms to protect the type I&#xD;
      error rate from multiplicity. If significant, subsequent analyses will be performed without&#xD;
      further multiplicity adjustment. If not, subsequent comparisons will be performed with a&#xD;
      conservative Bonferroni correction at the α=0.05/4=0.0125 level. This protected test approach&#xD;
      has been recommended in the statistical literature and used in other exercise intervention&#xD;
      trials with multiple outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, we will fit a series of linear mixed models using the SAS® MIXED procedure with&#xD;
      baseline to follow-up change in each of the continuous outcomes (LLFDI function/disability,&#xD;
      walking ability, other measures of mobility performance) as the dependent variable;&#xD;
      intervention arm (standard/On the Move), as the fixed effect of primary interest; baseline&#xD;
      value of outcome as an additional fixed effect covariate; and a facility random effect to&#xD;
      account for greater similarity of participants from the same facility compared to different&#xD;
      facilities and resulting non-independence of observations within facility (ie. clustering).&#xD;
      We will construct appropriate means contrasts to estimate difference in gains in the two&#xD;
      interventions when delivered by exercise leaders (Aim 1) whose statistical significance of&#xD;
      the estimates will serve as formal tests of hypotheses. We will consider adding other&#xD;
      baseline measures found to be significantly different between the arms or deemed important as&#xD;
      additional fixed effect covariates in the model to assess robustness of the findings. We note&#xD;
      that waiting of participants randomized to staff activity personnel classes constitute a&#xD;
      group of control participants, if smaller, without any intervention. Therefore, we will&#xD;
      perform another sensitivity analysis employing a similar analytic strategy but with three&#xD;
      intervention arms (On the Move/Standard/Wait List Control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3(a):&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will fit a series of generalized estimating equations (GEE) models(68) using the SAS®&#xD;
      GENMOD procedure with each of the dichotomous adverse events, adherence (21+ sessions or&#xD;
      ≥90%) and satisfaction outcomes as the dependent variable; a binomial distribution for the&#xD;
      outcome and a logit canonical link function; intervention arm, as the effect of primary&#xD;
      interest; baseline value of outcome and any other measures found to be different between arms&#xD;
      or deemed important as additional fixed effects covariates; and an exchangeable working&#xD;
      correlation structure to account for clustering due to facility. We will appropriately&#xD;
      construct contrasts to test hypotheses of differential proportions with adverse events based&#xD;
      on intervention when delivered by exercise leaders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims 2, 3(b) and 4 Exploratory Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose an analytic strategy with an exploratory philosophy for Aim 2 sustainability aim,&#xD;
      because of the uncertainty surrounding our ability to recruit and train a staff activity&#xD;
      person to lead a class safely and per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will fit a series of linear mixed models using the SAS® MIXED procedure with baseline to&#xD;
      follow-up change in each of the continuous outcomes (LLFDI function/disability, walking&#xD;
      ability, other measures of mobility performance) as the dependent variable; intervention arm&#xD;
      (standard/On the Move), delivery mode (by exercise leader/staff activity personnel) and their&#xD;
      interaction as fixed effects of interest; baseline value of outcome and any other measures&#xD;
      found to be different between arms or deemed important as additional fixed effects&#xD;
      covariates; and a facility random effect to account for greater similarity of participants&#xD;
      from the same facility compared to different facilities and resulting non-independence of&#xD;
      observations within facility (ie. clustering). We will construct appropriate means contrasts&#xD;
      to estimate difference in gains in the two interventions when delivered by staff exercise&#xD;
      personnel (Aim 2 effectiveness hypothesis); and difference in gains attributable to On the&#xD;
      Move intervention when delivered by exercise leaders and staff activity personnel (Aim 2&#xD;
      sustainability hypothesis). Statistical significance of the estimates will serve as formal&#xD;
      tests hypotheses. We note that participants randomized to staff activity personnel had to&#xD;
      wait 12 weeks since their baseline assessment and randomization to start the intervention,&#xD;
      during which they may have changed; and that they underwent a second baseline assessment&#xD;
      immediately prior to starting the exercise intervention. Therefore, we will repeat the above&#xD;
      analysis using their second baseline assessment instead of the first one to assess the&#xD;
      sensitivity of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3(b):&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will fit a series of generalized estimating equations (GEE) models using the SAS® GENMOD&#xD;
      procedure with each of the dichotomous adverse events, adherence (21+ sessions or ≥90%) and&#xD;
      satisfaction outcomes as the dependent variable; a binomial distribution for the outcome and&#xD;
      a logit canonical link function; intervention arm, delivery model and their interaction as&#xD;
      effects of interest; baseline value of outcome and any other measures found to be different&#xD;
      between arms or deemed important as additional fixed effects covariates; and an exchangeable&#xD;
      working correlation structure to account for clustering due to facility. We will&#xD;
      appropriately construct contrasts to test hypotheses of differential proportions with adverse&#xD;
      events based on intervention when delivered by staff activity personnel and delivery mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform the exploratory analyses to identify combinations of baseline predictors of&#xD;
      treatment response and risks of participating in On the Move program.&#xD;
