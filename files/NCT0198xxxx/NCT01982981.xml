  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, it is common to ingest beverages other than plain water, which range from flavored&#xD;
      with a low energy input to others of high input. In Mexico, flavored beverage ingestion is&#xD;
      believed to be displacing plain water; this phenomenon is raising concern in the health&#xD;
      sector, due to the relation between flavored beverage intake and the increase in obesity and,&#xD;
      consequently, chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up until now, there is no instrument available to characterize the perception of the Mexican&#xD;
      population's well-being, beliefs and knowledge regarding plain water ingestion, nor is there&#xD;
      an instrument capable of quantifying the daily water ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is design and validate a questionnaire to identify and evaluate the&#xD;
      perception of well-being (PWBQ) related to plain water consumption in a sample of adult men&#xD;
      and women of the city of Cuernavaca.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Water makes up the majority of the human body; it is vital to ingest it every day to maintain&#xD;
      proper hydration and be able to carry out the different cellular processes that make life&#xD;
      possible.Plain water is the ideal liquid to perform all the cellular functions without the&#xD;
      risk of ingesting substances or elements that could bring energy or represent other risks to&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, water ingestion recommendations offered vary dramatically among individuals and&#xD;
      populations; for instance, individuals residing in dry and hot climates, as well as athletes,&#xD;
      may have a greater need for water. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) suggests that the usual&#xD;
      daily average ingestion in adults is 3.7 liters for men and 2.7 liters for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Mexico, data from national health and nutrition surveys showed that highly energetic&#xD;
      beverage consumption, such as sodas (carbonated or not), sugar-added or sugar-free fruit&#xD;
      juices, fresh fruit waters (&quot;aguas frescas&quot;) with sugar added and whole or flavored milk,&#xD;
      doubled among the Mexican population between 1999 and 2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, this study has the following specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Characterize beliefs, knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of physical well-being&#xD;
           resulting from plain water consumption in a sample of adult men and women of the city of&#xD;
           Cuernavaca, using qualitative techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Validate the instrument through a process of instrument testing and adjustment,&#xD;
           feasibility tests (consistency, temporary stability, inter-rater reliability and&#xD;
           sensitivity to detect a change), content validity with field experts, criterion validity&#xD;
           correlating the instrument with health questionnaire SF-36 and finally through an&#xD;
           intervention in order to correlate the PWBQ with urine biochemical markers (volume,&#xD;
           osmolarity, color, density, pH, Ca, Na and K), plain water ingestion reports, physical&#xD;
           activity levels, diet, SF-36 and LCF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The current study objectives will be achieved using two methodologies, qualitative&#xD;
      and quantitative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For practical purposes this protocol will be divided in 2 phases: Phase 1 will be dedicated&#xD;
      to qualitative methods to design and validate the PWBQ instrument and Phase 2 will employ&#xD;
      quantitative methods to evaluate the PWBQ and the LCF through an intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1. INSTRUMENT DESIGN (PWBQ) During this phase, 2 qualitative techniques-focus groups&#xD;
      and semi-structured interviews-will be used to compile the required information and elaborate&#xD;
      the PWBQ. Both techniques will focus on the study's main subject &quot;perception of physical&#xD;
      well-being due to plain water ingestion&quot; as well as on the identification of topic-related&#xD;
      beliefs, knowledge and attitudes, in 2 specific groups of adults, &quot;light and heavy plain&#xD;
      water drinkers&quot;, stratifying by variables that can be related to water consumption, such as&#xD;
      the nutritional state (normal weight, overweight and obesity) and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of light drinker will be those who ingest &lt; 1.5 l of general liquids including&#xD;
      food such as soups or similar and cold or hot beverages like coffee or tea. The heavy drinker&#xD;
      will be those who ingest &gt;2.0 l of general liquids. The definition of Normal weight will be&#xD;
      defining a Body Mass Index (BMI) of between 18.5 - 24.99 and overweight or obese when that&#xD;
      index is between 25 - 34.99. All participants will have to meet the inclusion criteria set&#xD;
      forth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the FG guides, a convenience sample of 8 adults from a set socioeconomic level will&#xD;
      participate in a focus group session. A total of 8 FG will be carried out. In order to test&#xD;
      the interview guides, a convenience sample of 6 healthy adult informants will be applied a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interview once FG are completed, will be carried out with new participants to&#xD;
      obtain similar information. Up to 64 semi-structured interviews will be conducted; fewer will&#xD;
      be done if theoretical saturation is reached. Convenience sampling will be used. We will look&#xD;
      for light and heavy plain water drinker informants, from one socioeconomic level and&#xD;
      stratifying by gender and nutritional state (normal weight and overweight or obesity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative phase analysis general plan. Recordings of focus groups and interviews will be&#xD;
      transcribed by trained personnel. After transcription, codification guides will be designed&#xD;
      based on interview and FG guides, then each FG and interview will be codified and we will&#xD;
      undertake the global analysis process, which will be coordinated and supervised by 2&#xD;
      qualitative area-expert counselors. Information processing will be done using the &quot;ATLAS.ti&#xD;
      Scientific&quot; software for qualitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content validity Once the first questionnaire model is defined, it will be submitted to a&#xD;
      group of expert researchers in the area of perception, in order to evaluate the construct and&#xD;
      respective dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the evaluation, each expert will be provided with a dossier containing the instrument,&#xD;
      and the theoretical and operational definition which establishes each dimension of the&#xD;
      instrument, &quot;perception of well-being associated with water consumption&quot;. Each expert will&#xD;
      present his report; any discrepancies observed between experts will be solved by consensus or&#xD;
      by an external expert. This process will take place in four steps: 1) Initial evaluation of&#xD;
      the instrument, 2) Consensus of report, 3) Adjustments to the instrument, and 4) Final&#xD;
      version approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire test and adjustment with target population We will carry out a test of the PWBQ&#xD;
      in order to ensure correct and cogent question phrasing for the target population, adequate&#xD;
      length, appropriate categorization of answers, logical order and acceptable interview&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the test, 16 adults (men and women) will be recruited and will have to meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria of the qualitative phase. Each participant will be informed of the purpose of the&#xD;
      test and will be asked for his/her consent to participate in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants finish answering the PWBQ, 2 focus groups will be organized to discuss&#xD;
      details and listen to corresponding comments. Each FG will be recorded, after obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent. Each PWBQ answer will be adjusted based on the focus groups comments and&#xD;
      the written evaluation. Answers with an average of Likert answer levels between 4 and 5 will&#xD;
      be considered adequate, while those with an average below 4 will be adjusted or restructured&#xD;
      as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 The PWBQ instrument will be a product of phase 1 (qualitative) and its design will be&#xD;
      based on the structure of health questionnaire SF-36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second phase, we will carry out the instrument validation process, using an&#xD;
      intervention. We will evaluate content reliability and validity and carry out correlation&#xD;
      tests the PWBQ and biochemical indicators in urine (volume, osmolarity, color, density, pH,&#xD;
      Ca, Na and K), with total ingestion of water consumed, physical activity levels, diet and LCF&#xD;
      instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation A total of 180 participants will be included in the intervention. The&#xD;
      sample size was calculated based on internal consistency analysis, considering a Cronbach&#xD;
      alpha of 0.8 with a maximum error of 5% and considering that the instrument could be between&#xD;
      30 and 40 questions. This sample size (n=180) allows us to estimate correlations from 7.0&#xD;
      with a 10% maximum error and a CI of 95%, between the PWBQ with urine variables, total water&#xD;
      consumption, physical activity levels, diet and LCF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistics A total of 180 participants will be recruited to form 2 groups of 90 subjects each&#xD;
      (intervention and control), ideally trying to include an equal proportion of normal and&#xD;
      overweight men and women (figure 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 During visits 1 and 2, we will check that participants are light drinkers and that&#xD;
      they meet the rest of inclusion criteria previously mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit, the following instruments will be applied, in order to check all the&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Integral health evaluation (weight, height, waist circumference)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Liquid consumption frequency (LCF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Questionnaire PWBQ on well-being perception 4 Health questionnaire SF-36&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 24-hour recall 6) Physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) At the end of this visit,&#xD;
           participants will receive instructions to go to the clinic 1 week later in the morning&#xD;
           with a 24-hour urine sample, for which they will be given a special bottle and&#xD;
           corresponding instructions for collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermediate week On the Monday between visit 1 and 2, phone calls will be made to every&#xD;
      participant to implement a LCF to evaluate the weekend consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2, (one week later). During this visit, participants will provide a 24-hour urine&#xD;
      sample for analysis and they will go through the same entire evaluation as in visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will subsequently be informed if they are eligible to participate in the study. We will&#xD;
      explain the study purpose (informed consent letter) and inform them that upon completion of&#xD;
      study, they will receive an incentive package and will be asked if they want to participate.&#xD;
      If they do, they will sign a letter of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once accepted as participants to the study, 2 groups will be randomly formed (control and&#xD;
      intervention) and 40 accelerometers will be randomly assigned (20 for each group), finally,&#xD;
      they will be given a detailed explanation of how to use them and their next appointment will&#xD;
      be scheduled. The estimated average time required from each participant that day is from 30&#xD;
      to 45 minutes in total. The clinic will offer healthy food to those interested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive plain water on a weekly basis during 8 weeks, for daily&#xD;
      consumption. Water will be supplied and delivered by the Bonafont company to the home address&#xD;
      of participants. Bottles and tops will be numbered and marked with the project's name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each time participants will be asked to return spare bottles in order to quantify their total&#xD;
      ingestion. Every 2 weeks, the control and intervention group will be given an appointment for&#xD;
      accelerometer reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4 (week 2 and 8 after the beginning of the intervention) all participants&#xD;
      (control and intervention) will have to bring a 24-hour urine sample to their appointment,&#xD;
      readings of accelerometers will be taken and the same instruments will be implemented again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General analysis plan The data obtained will be used to evaluate the agreement and&#xD;
      correlation of ingested water with biochemical indicators in urine, PWBQ, LCF, r24hrs and&#xD;
      SF-36. Finally, differences between intervention and control groups will be evaluated, in&#xD;
      order to determine if such differences are due to water availability and to identify possible&#xD;
      bias and suggest corrective equations. Descriptive statistics will be generated, using simple&#xD;
      and partial correlations, regression models and multivariate methods (factor analysis).&#xD;
