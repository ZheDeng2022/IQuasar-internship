      Background. Cognitive, communication and physical weakness combined with environmental&#xD;
      changes frequently cause changes in roles, routines and daily occupations. The educational&#xD;
      intervention combines the best choice for teaching new behaviours since it involves the&#xD;
      active participation of the patient in learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Design. Randomized clinical trial. Participants. Total sample: 80 adults who have&#xD;
      suffered a stroke with moderate severity and who have been discharged to their homes.Outcome&#xD;
      variables. BI, FIM, MMSE, CNS, SIS-16, TCT, MRS, MSPSS, QLSF, FRT, RT, TUG, TST, a portable&#xD;
      dynamometer and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Data analysis. Descriptive analyses will&#xD;
      include mean and 95% CI of the values for each variable. The Kolmogov-Smirnov (KS) test and a&#xD;

      Background. Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of long-term&#xD;
      neurological disability in the world. Cognitive, communication and physical weakness combined&#xD;
      with environmental changes frequently cause changes in roles, routines and daily occupations.&#xD;
      The educational intervention combines didactic and interactive intervention, which combines&#xD;
      the best choice for teaching new behaviours since it involves the active participation of the&#xD;
      patient in learning. Nowadays there are many types of intervention or means to increase&#xD;
      adherence to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. This study is a randomized clinical trial. Participants. The total sample will&#xD;
      consist of 80 adults who have suffered a stroke with moderate severity and who have been&#xD;
      discharged to their homes in the 3 months prior to recruitment to the study. Outcome&#xD;
      variables. Barthel Index, the Functional Independence Measure, the Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination, the Canadian Neurological Scale, the Stroke Impact Scale-16, the Trunk Control&#xD;
      Test, the Modified Rankin Scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the&#xD;
      Quality of Life Scale for Stroke, the Functional Reach test, the Romberg test, the Time Up&#xD;
      and Go, the Timed-Stands Test, a portable dynamometer and a sociodemographic questionnaire.&#xD;
      Data analysis. Descriptive analyses will include mean and 95% confidence intervals of the&#xD;
      values for each variable. The Kolmogov-Smirnov (KS) test and a 2x2 mixed model ANOVA will be&#xD;
      used. Intergroup effect sizes will be calculated (Cohen's d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation A power analysis was conducted using the program G*Power 3.1. A&#xD;
      priori, a sample of approximately 40 participants per group for the stage 1 intervention is&#xD;
      needed to detect a significant difference (17.3 in the FIM) between the experimental group&#xD;
      and the control group (effect size d=0.59, alpha=.05, beta=.08). The randomization will be&#xD;
      performed by a blinded researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. Stage 1 will begin with the collection of the participants' demographic data&#xD;
      through a questionnaire and by conducting various tests to measure primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcome variables. Subsequently, the ergonomics of the home and the implementation of ADL&#xD;
      from both the experimental group and the control group will be assessed using the HTAS tool,&#xD;
      which was developed by the authors. For the development of the tool, a literature review was&#xD;
      performed using the PubMed electronic database and by reviewing different practice guides&#xD;
      about stroke. Subsequently, the HTAS tool was evaluated by a panel of experts composed of&#xD;
      occupational therapists, physiotherapists, nurses, caregivers, and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the assessment of each participant's home and his or her performance of ADL, the&#xD;
      therapist will provide the participants of the experimental group with a list of pieces of&#xD;
      advice related to the HTAS items that were evaluated negatively. The advice will be aimed at&#xD;
      changing the environment in which the participants execute the ADL. This may include&#xD;
      facilitation in the execution of the ADL, promoting the active use of the affected side of&#xD;
      the body in such execution, or to show them the most appropriate way of performing certain&#xD;
      tasks according to their situation after the stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the variables and the execution of the advised tasks will be carried out at&#xD;
      participants' homes 2 and 4 weeks following the initial assessment. Researchers will analyze&#xD;
      and compare the data obtained from the outcome variables of the experimental group and the&#xD;
      control group to check whether the educational intervention was effective in patients who&#xD;
      have suffered stroke and who have been discharged to their homes. If the hypothesis is&#xD;
      confirmed, the educational intervention would be implemented in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 For the pilot study in stage 2, one group will receive the app reminders on their&#xD;
      mobile phones (MPG) and another group will not (NMPG). Placement in the first group depends&#xD;
      on whether the participant has a mobile phone and if its characteristics are adapted to the&#xD;
      requirements of the study. The app will provide the advice previously given by the therapist&#xD;
      in the participants' homes. The timing of reminders will differ for each participant&#xD;
      depending on the amount of advice given. However, in the 4 weeks of the app being used, each&#xD;
      piece of advice will be given three times. The mobile phone will beep once for each piece of&#xD;
      advice and the participant must check and mark the option indicating whether he has or has&#xD;
      not complied with the advice. After this period, the outcome variables will be analyzed in&#xD;
      both groups to check whether there are differences between the MPGand NMPG groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 weeks, and after having removed the app from mobile phones of the MPG, we will&#xD;
      reanalyze the outcome variables. Will do this by testing both groups to see whether the&#xD;
      MPGparticipants have continued to perform the advised tasks provided by the therapist, and if&#xD;
      differences still exist between them and the NGS group. If so, a reminder system will be&#xD;
      implemented in the NMPG.&#xD;
