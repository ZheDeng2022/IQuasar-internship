    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trametinib and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 work in treating&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma that has come back (relapsed) or that does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment (refractory). Trametinib and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 may stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the antitumor activity of trametinib determined by overall response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      in patients that are stratified into groups based on: biomarker positive (neuroblastoma RAS&#xD;
      viral [v-ras] oncogene homolog [NRAS], v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog&#xD;
      [KRAS], v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 [BRAF] mutated) and biomarker negative&#xD;
      (without NRAS, KRAS, BRAF mutation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR) in the two&#xD;
      stratified groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To document ORR after the addition of GSK2141795 (Akt inhibitor GSK2141795) to trametinib&#xD;
      in patients who have developed progressive disease or have achieved less than a partial&#xD;
      response (PR) after 4 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate PFS and DOR in patients receiving trametinib plus GSK2141795. IV. To&#xD;
      evaluate the safety profile of trametinib with and without GSK2141795.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the relationship between clinical response and pharmacodynamic (PD) markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the relationship between v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene&#xD;
      homolog (MAF) expression as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR),&#xD;
      chromosomal abnormalities detected by florescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and clinical&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the role of integrin beta7 as a biomarker of MAF expression. IV. To explore&#xD;
      the relationship between objective clinical response as well as progressive disease and the&#xD;
      tumor mutational profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore mechanism of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/v-akt Murine Thymoma Viral&#xD;
      Oncogene Homolog 1 (AKT) and retrovirus-associated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence&#xD;
      (RAS)-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK)&#xD;
      activation and correlate these with clinical response and PD markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the feasibility of extracting circulating free tumor DNA (cfDNA) from&#xD;
      peripheral blood and detecting RAS and RAF mutations using cfDNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with&#xD;
      progressive disease or who achieve less than PR after 4 courses may also receive Akt&#xD;
      inhibitor GSK2141795 PO daily on days 1-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;

                  mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; 90 mmHg which cannot be controlled by anti-hypertensive&#xD;
                  therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known cardiac metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C&#xD;
             virus (HCV) infection (with the exception of chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection,&#xD;
             which will be allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study drug must not be administered to pregnant women or nursing mothers; women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy and use effective methods&#xD;
             of contraception; men with a female partner of childbearing potential must have either&#xD;
             had a prior vasectomy or agree to use effective contraception; if a female patient or&#xD;
             a female partner of a patient becomes pregnant while the patient receives trametinib,&#xD;
             the potential hazard to the fetus should be explained to the patient and partner (as&#xD;
             applicable); these potential risks may also apply to GSK2141795&#xD;
