  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed indication for GSK1940029 is topical treatment of acne, the early clinical plan&#xD;
      will evaluate the irritation potential of GSK1940029 (Study SCD117225 - 3 Part study); and&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GSK1940029 (Study SCD117226 - 2 Part study),&#xD;
      after topical administration on healthy subjects and acne patients. Study SCD117225 will be a&#xD;
      randomized, single-blind, three part study, to evaluate the primary irritation potential&#xD;
      (Part 1), cumulative irritation potential (Part 2) of two concentrations of GSK1940029 gel&#xD;
      applied to the intact skin of healthy subjects, and the facial irritation potential of one or&#xD;
      two concentrations of GSK1940029 applied to the face of acne patients (Part3). In Part 1 and&#xD;
      Part 2 the following 6 treatments will be applied using individual patches: (A) 200&#xD;
      milligrams (mg) of 0.3% GSK1940029 gel, (B) 200 mg of 1% GSK1940029 gel, (C) 200 mg of&#xD;
      0.3%/1% vehicle gel only (vehicle control), (D) 200 microliters (µL) of sterile distilled&#xD;
      water (negative irritant control), (E) 200 µL of - 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) in&#xD;
      sterile distilled water for Part 1/0.1% SLS in sterile distilled water for Part 2 (positive&#xD;
      irritant control), and (F) Patch only (patch control). Each treatment will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of six designated locations on either upper arm or other locations, such as the lower or&#xD;
      upper back, within each subject. The same treatment will be reapplied to the same location on&#xD;
      subsequent days. Each treatment will be applied daily for 2 days in Part 1, and daily for 21&#xD;
      days in Part 2. In Part 3, each patient will apply a thin coat of one or two concentration of&#xD;
      GSK1940029 gel or vehicle to acne affected facial/neck skin by hand, once daily for 28 days.&#xD;
      Parts within Study SCD117225 and Study SCD117226 will have interdependencies. No significant&#xD;
      primary irritation signal in Study SCD117225 Part 1 would allow initiation of Study SCD117226&#xD;
      Part 1 (single dose application). Once safety, tolerability and exposure information are&#xD;
      determined in Study SCD117226 Part 1, Part 2 of Study SCD117225 may be initiated along with&#xD;
      Part 2 (14-day repeat dose application). No significant cumulative irritation signal (study&#xD;
      SCD117225 Part 2) in combination with adequate 14-day safety (study SCD117226 Part 2) would&#xD;
      allow initiation of Part 3 of Study SCD117225.&#xD;
