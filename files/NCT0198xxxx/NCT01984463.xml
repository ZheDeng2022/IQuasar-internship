    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the impact of epidural morphine on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence and severity of shoulder pain following a thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for additional analgesics, such as opioids for the relief of shoulder pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Its safety profile compared to epidural fentanyl following a thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic hypothesis of this study is that an infusion of epidural bupivacaine and morphine&#xD;
      initiated after the induction of anesthesia and continued until 72 hours postoperatively will&#xD;
      reduce the incidence and severity of shoulder pain following a thoracotomy when compared to&#xD;
      an epidural infusion of bupivacaine and fentanyl.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite adequate epidural analgesia, up to 97% of patients undergoing thoracotomy will&#xD;
      experience ipsilateral shoulder pain. Although this pain is well recognized, its cause&#xD;
      remains unclear. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this pain, including&#xD;
      somatic and visceral as well as phrenic nerve nociception. The phrenic nerve arises from the&#xD;
      third to the fifth cervical nerves and provides the sensory innervation for the mediastinal&#xD;
      and diaphragmatic pleura and pericardium. Patients will complain of a constant, moderate to&#xD;
      severe aching pain, in the posterior deltoid and in the suprascapular region, ipsilateral to&#xD;
      the surgery. Different treatments have been used to alleviate post-thoracotomy shoulder pain,&#xD;
      but few of these efforts have been proven effective and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixture of epidural bupivacaine and fentanyl is considered the standard of care for&#xD;
      post-thoracotomy analgesia in our center. The infusion is started after induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia with a bolus dose followed with a continuous infusion and bolus doses as needed&#xD;
      for the following days. To optimize the use of epidural analgesia after thoracotomy, it would&#xD;
      seem well-advised to try to reach higher dermatomes. This could possibly be achieved by using&#xD;
      a different opioid in combination with bupivacaine in the epidural infusion. Morphine could&#xD;
      be an interesting agent in order to reach cervical spinous dermatomes probably involved in&#xD;
      the genesis of post-thoracotomy shoulder pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized. Prior to the induction&#xD;
      of general anesthesia, a thoracic epidural catheter will be inserted under local anesthesia&#xD;
      between the fourth and the eight spinous processes. Correct placement of the epidural will be&#xD;
      assessed. A bolus dose of fentanyl 100 mcg or morphine 3 mg will be given by the epidural&#xD;
      catheter as per randomization. The epidural infusion will be initiated at a rate of 0.1&#xD;
      mL/kg/hr before surgery and continued postoperatively until the surgical drains are removed&#xD;
      or for a maximum of five days. To relieve thoracic pain, the epidural infusion rate will be&#xD;
      adjusted up to a maximum of 12 mL/hr, with boluses of 0.05 mL/kg as needed. Hydromorphone&#xD;
      will be used postoperatively as rescue analgesia for shoulder pain. All patients will receive&#xD;
      standardised doses of acetaminophen for the first 48 hours following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival in the recovery room, correct placement of the epidural will be reassessed. During&#xD;
      the immediate postoperative period, the intensity of pain will be assessed using a Verbal&#xD;
      Numeric Pain Scale (0-10). Pain will be assessed at 2,4,8,12 and 24 hours after surgery and&#xD;
      daily thereafter, for a total duration of 4 postoperative days. Interference of pain with&#xD;
      daily activities will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) at 24 hours following&#xD;
      surgery. Signs of neuropathic pain will be assessed using the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic&#xD;
      Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) scale at 24 hours following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side-effects attributable to analgesia will be recorded. Arterial blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected every 8 hours for the first 24 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
