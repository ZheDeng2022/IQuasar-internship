      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third of the most common cancers and the second leading cause&#xD;
      of cancer death in western countries. CRC is diagnosed at metastatic stage in approximately&#xD;
      35% of cases, while about 20% to 50% of patients diagnosed at earlier stage (stage II and&#xD;
      III) will develop distant metastasis subsequently. Treatment efficacy is usually evaluated by&#xD;
      computer tomography (CT) scan with RECIST criteria and dosage of carcinoembryonic antigen&#xD;
      (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9, which were performed every two weeks during the&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The management of treatment for metastatic CRC need the development of early&#xD;
      biomarkers to evaluate the efficacy in order to avoid unnecessary toxicity in case of early&#xD;
      chemotherapy resistance. In this prospective study, the investigators will compare the&#xD;
      monitoring of circulating tumor DNA with the results of CT scan according the RECIST criteria&#xD;
      and the blood level of CEA and CA 19-9. The investigators carried out a microfluidic digital&#xD;
      polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay to measure the specific somatic genomic alterations in&#xD;
      plasma to identify the circulating tumor DNA.&#xD;

      Description Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a real public health problem in the world. In Western&#xD;
      countries, CRC is the third of the most common cancers and the second leading cause of cancer&#xD;
      death. The prognosis of CRC is closely associated with the tumor stage at diagnosis. Despite&#xD;
      widespread screening program, the CRC is diagnosed at metastatic stage in approximately 35%&#xD;
      of cases, while about 20% to 50% of patients diagnosed at earlier stage (stage II and III)&#xD;
      will develop distant metastasis subsequently. For these patients with metastatic CRC,&#xD;
      improved surgical techniques, advances in cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens (fluoropyrimidin,&#xD;
      oxaliplatin and irinotecan) and the progress of targeted therapies (antiangiogenic and&#xD;
      anti-EGFR therapies) have increased survival and improve the quality of life. These patients&#xD;
      are usually treated every 2 weeks with these chemotherapy regimens and the tumor response are&#xD;
      evaluated every 2 months by computed tomography (CT) scan using the RECIST criteria (Therasse&#xD;
      P, J Natl Cancer Inst 92:205-216, 2000). These morphological criteria determine several tumor&#xD;
      response: complete remission (CR) is the disappearance of all lesions, partial response (PR)&#xD;
      is the reduction of at least 30 % of the sum of the largest diameters of all lesions targets,&#xD;
      progression disease (PD) is increased by at least 20 % of the sum of the largest diameters of&#xD;
      target lesions or appearance of new lesions, and stable disease (SD) corresponds to the lower&#xD;
      decrease in 30% or higher than 20 % of the sum of target lesions (P Therasse, J Natl Cancer&#xD;
      Inst 92:205-216, 2000). Treatment should be changed in case of PD, while is usually continued&#xD;
      in case of objective tumor response or control disease. Moreover, carcinoembryonic antigen&#xD;
      (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 are serum biomarkers that are clinically useful to&#xD;
      evaluate efficacy of treatment in some patients with metastatic CRC but have a sensitivity of&#xD;
      only 50 to 70%. Therefore, in case of early tumor resistance to treatment, PD will be&#xD;
      objectified as CT scan only after 2 months of treatment, exposing the patient to unnecessary&#xD;
      toxicity that could be sometimes severe. Early biomarkers of tumor response are needed for&#xD;
      better management of treatment for patients with metastatic CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRC is characterized by highly specific genetic alterations. Some molecular alterations may&#xD;
      be predictive (tailoring the protocols of chemotherapy) or prognostic (evaluating the&#xD;
      severity of the disease) biomarkers useful in the therapeutic management of these patients.&#xD;
      For example, KRAS tumor mutation was associated with a lack of response to anti-EGFR targeted&#xD;
      therapies (Lievre A, J Clin Oncol 2008, 26:374-9; Lievre A, Cancer Res 2006,66:3992-5), while&#xD;
      BRAF mutation are prognostic (Van Cutsem E, J Clin Oncol 2011, 29:2011-19). Specific genetic&#xD;
      alterations in the tumor can also be detected from the circulating tumor DNA of patients with&#xD;
      CRC (Lecomte T, Int J Cancer 2002, 100:543-8). Indeed, circulating DNA fragments carrying&#xD;
      tumor specific sequence alterations (circulating tumor DNA) are found in the fraction of&#xD;
      blood, representing a variable and generally small fraction of the total circulating DNA.&#xD;
      Recently, a study showed that circulating tumor DNA was an informative, inherently specific,&#xD;
      and highly sensitive biomarker of monitoring for metastatic breast cancer treatment (N Engl J&#xD;
      Med. 2013;368:1199-209). However, to our knowledge, analysis of circulating tumor DNA to&#xD;
      monitor metastatic CRC was not performed yet. The aim of our study is to determine a&#xD;
      biomarker evaluating precociously the response to chemotherapy by the monitoring of the&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods Results of CT imaging, levels of CEA and CA 19-9, and serial whole-blood&#xD;
      samples were collected prospectively from patients undergoing therapy for metastatic CRC. DNA&#xD;
      extracted from archival tumor tissue samples was analysed to identify somatic genomic&#xD;
      alterations (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, TP53, PI3KCA, APC, SMAD4 …). Blood samples were collected in&#xD;
      EDTA tubes every two weeks before each cycles of chemotherapy. Blood samples were processed&#xD;
      within 2 hour after collection and were centrifuged to separate the plasma from the&#xD;
      peripheral-blood cells. DNA was extracted from plasma. To measure the DNA carrying specific&#xD;
      somatic genomic alterations in plasma, the investigators carried out a microfluidic digital&#xD;
      polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay (Taly V, Clin Chem 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the monitoring of circulating tumor DNA with the results of CT&#xD;
      scan according the RECIST criteria and the blood level of CEA and CA 19-9.&#xD;
