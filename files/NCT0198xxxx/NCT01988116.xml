  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn more about how treatment with vitamin D can affect iron&#xD;
      metabolism and blood levels of two hormones that control iron levels, hepcidin and&#xD;
      hemojuvelin in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron is an essential mineral which is a major component of proteins that carry oxygen in the&#xD;
      blood. Problems with iron metabolism can lead to low blood levels (anemia), which can&#xD;
      commonly happen in people with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New research over the last decade has uncovered a new hormone called 'hepcidin', which is&#xD;
      made in the liver and released into the blood. Hepcidin controls how much iron is in the&#xD;
      blood by preventing the absorption of iron from food. Blood levels of hepcidin C are found to&#xD;
      be high in people with CKD, and a recent small study in people with normal kidney function&#xD;
      showed that treatment with vitamin D decreased hepcidin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another protein, known as 'hemojuvelin', has been recently discovered and is also thought to&#xD;
      control the amount of iron in the blood. The relationship between vitamin D and hemojuvelin&#xD;
      has never been studied before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators would like to examine the effects of vitamin D on iron&#xD;
      metabolism and blood levels of hepcidin C and hemojuvelin in individuals with CKD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron homeostasis is tightly regulated in humans. Iron is mostly recycled from hemoglobin,&#xD;
      myoglobin and other enzymes. Since humans lack the capacity to excrete excess iron, it must&#xD;
      be intricately regulated at the site of its absorption in the duodenum and proximal jejunum.&#xD;
      In the last decade, hepcidin has emerged as a master regulator of iron homeostasis. It&#xD;
      decreases iron absorption from the gut mucosa by limiting its transport from the enterocyte&#xD;
      across the basolateral membrane into the circulation. It does so by down-regulating the&#xD;
      synthesis or promoting internalization of a basolateral membrane protein 'Ferroportin', the&#xD;
      only known cellular iron exporter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D is hypothesized to exert a significant and independent effect on the iron&#xD;
      metabolism. In the CKD population, low vitamin-D levels independently correlate with the&#xD;
      severity of anemia. Hepcidin C levels are found to be elevated in the CKD population.&#xD;
      Mechanisms underlying the effect of vitamin D on iron homeostasis potentially include vitamin&#xD;
      D induced expression of erythropoietin receptors, increased proliferation of erythroid&#xD;
      precursors, and reduction in hepcidin C levels due to reduction in IL-6 from the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D. More recently, a study revealed direct relationship&#xD;
      between vitamin D replacement and a sustained fall in hepcidin C levels. The same group of&#xD;
      researchers found the above relationship to be due to a direct effect of vitamin D on&#xD;
      hepcidin expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemojuvelin (HJV) is a protein encoded by the HFE2 gene and is found in the membrane bound&#xD;
      and the soluble form (sHJV) in the humans. Mutations in the HJV gene are responsible for&#xD;
      Juvenile Hemochromatosis. It is an upstream regulator of hepcidin transcription and appears&#xD;
      to be essential for hepcidin expression in the hepatocytes and has important role to play in&#xD;
      iron homeostasis. Recently, an assay has become available to measure the sHJV levels in the&#xD;
      serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, we know that hepcidin plays a central role in iron homeostasis and recent studies&#xD;
      have given us insight into the role hemojuvelin and vitamin D play in iron metabolism, to&#xD;
      date, no studies have examined the effect on vitamin D replacement on hepcidin, hemojuvelin&#xD;
      levels and iron metabolism in individuals with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Treatment with an activated vitamin D analog in the individuals with CKD&#xD;
      results in a statistically significant fall in hepcidin C levels as compared to individuals&#xD;
      provided with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Treatment with an activated vitamin D analog results in decreased levels of&#xD;
      soluble hemojuvelin in individuals with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Vitamin D replacement in the individuals with CKD results in improved iron&#xD;
      parameters as compared to the placebo.&#xD;
