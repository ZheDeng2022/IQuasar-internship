      Adenocorticotrophic Hormone provides safe and effective treatment to induce disease remission&#xD;
      in rheumatoid arthritis patients with active disease due to an inadequate response to&#xD;
      methotrexate.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic&#xD;
      drugs such as methotrexate to control joint pain and swelling. Often times rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis patients experience inadequate response to methotrexate with acute or persistent&#xD;
      joint pain and swelling. In these patients, alternative or additional immunosuppressive&#xD;
      therapy is needed to induce disease remission. In the present clinical trial, ACTHAR is being&#xD;
      studied to induce disease remission on rheumatoid arthritis patients who have inadequate&#xD;
      response to methotrexate therapy.&#xD;
