      The impact of medications used for secondary stroke prevention relies heavily upon patient&#xD;
      adherence. Adherence is defined as &quot;the extent to which a person's behavior - taking&#xD;
      medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed&#xD;
      recommendations from a health care provider.&quot; It is said that optimal adherence to&#xD;
      medications may reduce the risk of a poor outcome by 26%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study which is a non-pharmacologic behavioral study is to encourage&#xD;
      adherence to medications in stroke survivors by tailored and specific SMS reminders. (Short&#xD;
      Text Messages). These SMS reminders will support and assist stroke patients to take&#xD;
      medications as prescribed and on time. We hypothesise that SMS will improve the adherence of&#xD;
      patients to stroke medications by 2 points on the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke remains a major cause of death and disability globally, accounting for 46.6 million&#xD;
      disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. More than 85% of all stroke-related deaths&#xD;
      occur in low- and middle-income (LMI) countries. In a study from our center in Pakistan, the&#xD;
      all-cause mortality due to stroke was 12.9% in the first year. Vascular causes in general and&#xD;
      recurrent stroke in particular accounted for the bulk of the mortality cases. Recurrence of a&#xD;
      stroke in Pakistan is documented to be as high as 53% in the first year, as opposed to&#xD;
      international rates of approximately 30% in the first month. Evidence based guidelines&#xD;
      recommend risk factor control with antiplatelet agents, anti-hypertensive medications, lipid&#xD;
      lowering drugs and appropriate anti-diabetic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke recurrence.&#xD;
      When taken together, the combination of an antihypertensive, statin and antiplatelet agent&#xD;
      can reduce total stroke risk by 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the impact of drugs used for secondary stroke prevention relies heavily upon patient&#xD;
      adherence. Adherence is defined as &quot;the extent to which a person's behavior - taking&#xD;
      medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed&#xD;
      recommendations from a health care provider.&quot; It is said that optimal adherence to&#xD;
      medications may reduce the risk of a poor outcome by 26%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study which is a non-pharmacologic behavioral study is to encourage&#xD;
      adherence to medications in stroke survivors by tailored and specific SMS (Short Text&#xD;
      Messages) reminders. These SMS reminders will support and assist stroke patients to take&#xD;
      medications as prescribed and on time. We hypothesise that SMS will improve the adherence of&#xD;
      patients to stroke medications by 2 points on the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention is as follows: Drug reminder SMS will be sent to the participants in the intervention arm customised to their stroke prescription. These SMS will be interactive in a way that the participants will have to answer back if they have taken their medicine or not in a &quot;Yes/No&quot; format. Moreover behaviour change SMS will also be sent to the intervention arm twice weekly. In addition , Participants will be encouraged to take medication using a taxonomy of behavioral change intervention techniques.</description>

          -  Give informed consent&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
