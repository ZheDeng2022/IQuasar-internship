  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest during pregnancy is rare but may result in poor maternal and fetal outcome.&#xD;
      Because of its rare occurrence and ethical issues this topic is not very well studied and&#xD;
      many questions pertaining to maternal resuscitation remain unanswered. One of the challenging&#xD;
      aspects of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a term pregnant patient is the ideal positioning&#xD;
      during chest compressions. International societies have made recommendations regarding&#xD;
      management of pregnant patients during cardiac arrest. They advocate the use of left lateral&#xD;
      position with 30 degrees tilt or manual uterine displacement. However these recommendations&#xD;
      are not based on high level of evidence. Ultrasound has been used to visualize the change in&#xD;
      diameter of great vessels to determine the volume status or adequacy of blood circulation of&#xD;
      these patients. This approach can be used to study the adequacy of blood circulation of&#xD;
      pregnant patients in different positions. The objective of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      change in Inferior vena cava diameter obtained with pregnant women in either the left lateral&#xD;
      tilt or in the supine position with a manual uterine displacement, compared to the left&#xD;
      lateral position and the supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the inferior vena cava diameter obtained in the supine position with&#xD;
      manual left uterine displacement would be larger as compared to that obtained with women&#xD;
      positioned with a 30-degree tilt.&#xD;

      Using the non-invasive technology of ultrasound we will be able to determine the degree of&#xD;
      aorto-caval compression in pregnant women placed in different positions. The results of this&#xD;
      study will help us to determine the optimal patient positioning for each individual. This in&#xD;
      future may help us in improving outcomes not only during labor and anesthesia, but also&#xD;
      during maternal resuscitation in critical cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will help us to determine the best technique to minimize&#xD;
      aorto-caval compression in the term pregnant patient. The results of this study will be&#xD;
      useful to establish firm maternal resuscitation guidelines. We will be able to determine the&#xD;
      optimal maternal position during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and this may improve both&#xD;
      maternal and fetal resuscitation outcomes.&#xD;
