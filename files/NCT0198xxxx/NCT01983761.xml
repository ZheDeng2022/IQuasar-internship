      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is safe and feasible to transplant&#xD;
      patients with one of two units of cord blood that has been changed in the laboratory before&#xD;
      it is given. Only patients with leukemia, lymphoma or myelodysplastic syndrome will be&#xD;
      allowed on this study. The secondary goal is to obtain the preliminary efficacy outcome.&#xD;
      Researchers also want to learn if using cord blood that has been changed can help to control&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One cord blood unit will not be changed before it is administered to you. The cord blood unit&#xD;
      that will be altered will be changed to use sugar that is found in small amounts in blood&#xD;
      cells. It plays a role in telling transplanted cells where they should go in the body. Adding&#xD;
      more sugars to the cord blood cells in the laboratory helps the cord blood cells find their&#xD;
      way to the bone marrow faster. This process is called fucosylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Conditioning&quot; is the chemo and other medicines and will be given to patients to prepare to&#xD;
      receive cord blood transplant cells. This prevents immune system from rejecting the cells.&#xD;
      Conditioning will be started before the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATG is a protein that removes immune cells that cause damage to the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clofarabine is designed to interfere with the growth and development of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludarabine is designed to interfere with the DNA of cancer cells, which may cause the cancer&#xD;
      cells to die. This chemotherapy is also designed to block your body's ability to reject the&#xD;
      donor's bone marrow cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melphalan and busulfan are designed to bind to the DNA of cells, which may cause cancer cells&#xD;
      to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMF and tacrolimus are designed to block the donor cells from growing and spreading in a way&#xD;
      that could cause graft versus host disease (GVHD -- a condition in which transplanted tissue&#xD;
      attacks the recipient's body). This may help to prevent GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab is designed to attach to cancer cells, which may cause them to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase I study for treatment of patients (N=25) with hematologic malignancies and MDS who&#xD;
      are candidates for dual-cord UCBT is ongoing at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center under an&#xD;
      Investigator-initiated IND Application, E.J. Shpall, MD, PI. Since August, 2012, Preliminary&#xD;
      results indicate that ASC-101 UCBT is well-tolerated and no ASC-101 related untoward adverse&#xD;
      events have been observed. To date, the median time to neutrophil engraftment (N=9) is 15&#xD;
      days, and the median time to platelet engraftment (N=9) is 33 days. The trial remains&#xD;
      ongoing.&#xD;

      Central Venous Catheter Placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will first have a central venous catheter (CVC) placed. A CVC is a sterile flexible tube&#xD;
      that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will&#xD;
      explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate&#xD;
      consent form for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy, some of the other drugs in this study, and the cord blood transplant will&#xD;
      be given by vein through your CVC. Blood samples will also be drawn through your CVC. The CVC&#xD;
      will remain in your body for about 2-5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, your doctor will choose one of the following 2 study&#xD;
      plans based on the disease and your age and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludarabine/Clofarabine/Busulfan/Rituximab/Total Body Irradiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are between 1 and 80 years of age and can receive high-dose chemotherapy, and your&#xD;
      doctor agrees, you will receive fludarabine, clofarabine, busulfan, ATG, total body&#xD;
      irradiation, and possibly rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are receiving this study plan medication, blood may be drawn to check levels of&#xD;
      busulfan 1 or more times over the 4-day course of treatment. No more than 1 teaspoon will be&#xD;
      taken at each blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day0 Admit, IV hydration, rituximab 375 mg/m2 (B cell malignancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day1 Fludarabine 10 mg/m2, clofarabine 30 mg/m2, busulfan AUC 5,000&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day2 Fludarabine 10 mg/m2, clofarabine 30 mg/m2, busulfan AUC 5,000&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day3 Fludarabine 10 mg/m2, clofarabine 30 mg/m2, busulfan AUC 5,000&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day4 Fludarabine 10 mg/m2, clofarabine 30 mg/m2, busulfan AUC 5,000, rabbit ATG 1.25&#xD;
           mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day5 Low-dose TBI 2 Gy in AM, rabbit ATG 1.75 mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day6 Rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day7 Rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day8 Cord blood infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludarabine, Melphalan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day0 Admit, hydration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day1 Fludarabine 40 mg/m2 IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day2 Fludarabine 40 mg/m2 IV, rabbit ATG 1.25 mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day3 Fludarabine 40 mg/m2 IV, rabbit ATG 1.75 mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day4 Fludarabine 40 mg/m2 IV and Melphalan 140 mg/m2 IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day5 Rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day6 Cord blood infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day -3, you will receive mycophenolate mofetil as a tablet by mouth 2 times a&#xD;
      day. If you are not able to take the tablet by mouth, you will receive MMF by vein over 2&#xD;
      hours 2 times a day. If you do not have GVHD at Day 100 after your cord blood transplant, the&#xD;
      dose of MMF will be gradually lowered. If you have GVHD, MMF may be stopped 7 days after the&#xD;
      GVHD is controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day -2, you will receive tacrolimus by vein as a continuous (nonstop) infusion&#xD;
      until you are able to take it by mouth. You will then take tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day&#xD;
      for about 6 months. After that, your tacrolimus dose may be gradually lowered if you do not&#xD;
      have GVHD. Your doctor will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day 0, you will receive filgrastim (G-CSF) through a needle under the skin 1 time&#xD;
      a day every day until your white blood count begins to recover. Filgrastim is designed to&#xD;
      help cells in the bone marrow to divide, which helps raise white blood cells counts more&#xD;
      quickly, lower fever, and decrease the risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be checked for possible reactions to the transplant and study drugs, including&#xD;
           GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check for CMV antibodies,&#xD;
           and for genetic tests to learn if the donor's cells have &quot;taken&quot;. The routine blood&#xD;
           tests will be repeated as often as the doctor thinks is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will need to stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks. After you leave the hospital, you&#xD;
      will continue as an outpatient in the hospital area, which means you will have to stay close&#xD;
      enough to be able to come back for any visits for about 100 days after the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study suits you and you agree to join, you will be in it for one year after your&#xD;
      transplant. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side&#xD;
      effects occur, if the cord blood is infected and cannot be transplanted, if you are unable to&#xD;
      follow study directions, or if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Fucosylation is not an FDA-approved process. It is&#xD;
      currently being used for research purposes only. Fludarabine, busulfan, clofarabine,&#xD;
      melphalan, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and rituximab are FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available to be given to patients with leukemia or lymphoma having a cord blood transplant.&#xD;
      Total body irradiation is delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 25 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson&#xD;
      Cancer Center, Scripps Green Hospital,University Hospitals Case Medical Center, and Texas&#xD;
      Transplant Institute.&#xD;
