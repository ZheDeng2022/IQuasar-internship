      This study is designed to determine the efficacy of Fexinidazole as an oral treatment in&#xD;
      Visceral Leishmanisasis sudanese adults patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this proof of concept study will allow to make a decision on whether to&#xD;
      proceed with clinical development of Fexinidazole for visceral leishmaniasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected disease and it is fatal if left untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently the first line treatment in East Africa was 30 days of Sodium Stibogluconate&#xD;
      which can be cardiotoxic. Since 2010 WHO recommended Sodium Stibogluconate and Paromomycin&#xD;
      for 17 days which is a shorter treatment but there remains the toxicity associated with these&#xD;
      drugs. The second line treatment is Ambisome given as 6-10 intravenous infusions, whilst this&#xD;
      has a better safety profile than other VL regimens it is expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So there is an urgent need for short course oral treatment for VL particularly in the East&#xD;
      African region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fexinidazole is a 2 substituted 5-nitroimidazole formulated for oral administration.&#xD;
      Fexinidazole through its metabolites has demonstrated potent activity againts L. donovani&#xD;
      intracellular amastigotes in vitro and in vivo in a visceral leishmaniasis mouse model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose selected for this study (1800 mg/1200 mg for 4/6 days) has been based on the dose&#xD;
      selected for a phase II trial on Human African Trypasonomiasis. It is albeit well tolerated&#xD;
      and is one dose level below the maximum tolerated dose level established in phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed and will be analysed according to a sequential method known as the&#xD;
      triangular test, using day 28 data. This sequential design allows for repeated interim&#xD;
      analysis (every 10 patients). The null hypothesis is that the proportion cured is less than&#xD;
      or equal to 75%. The primary endpoint is initial cure at day 28. The primary population for&#xD;
      interim analyses and interim decision making will be the per protocol population.In the final&#xD;
      analysis of cumulative patient data, Intention to Treat and Per Protocol Population analyses&#xD;
      will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional 6 months (day 210) follow up outcome is still an important secondary&#xD;
      endpointfor the final decision on whether to proceed with clinical development of&#xD;
      Fexinidazole for VL.&#xD;
