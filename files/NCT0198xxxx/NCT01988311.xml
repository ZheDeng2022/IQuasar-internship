  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to finalize methods for a larger study being planned for the future.&#xD;
      This research is being done to characterize performance of tasks, brain functioning, and the&#xD;
      effects of psilocybin in individuals with a long-term meditation practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three different parts of the pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effects of psilocybin on psychological function: This version of the pilot study will&#xD;
           involve 1 or 2 day-long psilocybin sessions, and several meetings and data assessment&#xD;
           visits. You will make a total of about 5 to 10 visits to our research unit (the BPRU on&#xD;
           the Johns Hopkins Bayview Campus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Performance on behavioral and cognitive tasks: This version of the pilot study will&#xD;
           involve completing various behavioral and cognitive tasks at our research unit. You will&#xD;
           make a total of about 1-10 visits to our research unit (the BPRU on the Johns Hopkins&#xD;
           Bayview Campus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Brain functioning: This version of the study will involve 1 to 3 brain imaging (MRI)&#xD;
           measurements. You will make a total of about 2 to 5 visits to our research unit (the&#xD;
           BPRU on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Campus). The MRI measurements will be taken at the&#xD;
           F.M. Kirby Research Center at the Kennedy Krieger Institute (across the street from the&#xD;
           Johns Hopkins Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who are between the ages of 25 and 80 years old, who have a current, regular&#xD;
      meditation practice, and who meet the medical requirements may join.&#xD;
