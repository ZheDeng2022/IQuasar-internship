    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how well children with OCD can be helped&#xD;
      using therapy that requires less clinic visits. The investigators are testing a Stepped-Care&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (SC-CBT) approach in which children receive a full course of&#xD;
      parent-led, therapist-guided treatment for OCD. The goal is to see if therapy can be done in&#xD;
      fewer visits to the clinic. Children receiving SC-CBT will start with Step One, which&#xD;
      includes three therapy sessions over six weeks. Those who do not get better in Step One will&#xD;
      &quot;STEP UP&quot; to Step Two which involves coming in to meet with a therapist for the remaining&#xD;
      sessions. Youth receiving SC-CBT will be compared to youth receiving standard CBT in the&#xD;
      clinic through this study. It is expected that Stepped Care will be an acceptable,&#xD;
      cost-effect, and feasible treatment with outcomes similar to standard CBT.&#xD;

      Below is a summary of assessment and interventions as part of the study (separated by&#xD;
      condition). Two thirds will receive SC-CBT, one-third standard CBT (determined at random&#xD;
      following the initial phone screen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Phone Screen (with parent)&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Informed Consent and Initial Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Randomization to either SC-CBT or Standard CBT&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Treatment Phase (either 1 or 2 determined at random following 'C')&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SC-CBT&#xD;
&#xD;
           Children who are randomized into SC-CBT will receive Step One:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3-in-office sessions - 1 hour each (over 6 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  6 weekly phone calls (15 minutes or less)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post assessment (at the end of the 6 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3-month follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
           Children are &quot;stepped up&quot; to Step Two of SC-CBT if we determine more therapy is needed&#xD;
           (following the post assessment). Step Two is a continuation of therapy and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  9-in-office weekly sessions - 1 hour each (over 9 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post assessment (after session 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3-month follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard CBT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who are randomized into the standard CBT group will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-in-office weekly sessions - 1 hour each (over 12 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Midpoint Assessment (after 6 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post assessment (at the end of the 12 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3-month follow up&#xD;

    <description>All participants in this arm receive Step One which includes 3-in-office sessions lasting 1 hour each over 6 weeks and 6 weekly phone calls lasting 15 minutes or less. The in-office sessions are devoted to psychoeducation, cognitive therapy, and hierarchy development. These sessions will include all procedures of the standard therapist-delivered CBT but will be parent-led, therapist guided; thus, the parent is delivering evidence-based strategies with clinician guidance.&#xD;
Children are then &quot;stepped up&quot; to Step Two of SC-CBT if it is determined that more therapy is needed following the post assessment. Step Two is a continuation of therapy and will include 9 additional in-office weekly session lasting 1 hour each over 9 weeks. These sessions will be therapist-led and are devoted to exposure and response prevention.</description>

    <description>All patients in this arm will receive 12 sessions of therapy over 12 weeks using the evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy protocol in POTS (2004). Sessions 1-3 do not include exposures and are devoted to psychoeducation, cognitive therapy, and hierarchy development. Sessions 4-12 involve exposure and response prevention exercises specific to each youth.</description>
