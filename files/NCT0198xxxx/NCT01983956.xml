  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is assumed that an early palliative care structured by SENS (a systematic, problem-based&#xD;
      assessment system) in addition to standard oncology care compared with standard oncology care&#xD;
      alone relieves distress in patients with advanced cancer at the end of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the effectiveness of early palliative care&#xD;
      intervention, structured by SENS (a systematic, problem-based assessment system) in addition&#xD;
      to standard oncology care, compared with standard oncology care alone to relieve distress a)&#xD;
      in patients with advanced cancer until death, and b) in caregivers. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      are to determine whether the introduction of SENS improves quality of life, prolongs overall&#xD;
      survival, ameliorates distress of caregivers, reduces health care costs and medical resource&#xD;
      utilization (less aggressive treatment in the last weeks of life).&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (performed by specialist palliative care teams): The structured approach&#xD;
      intervention is based on NCCN Practice Guidelines for Palliative Care, part of Gold Standard&#xD;
      Framework (GSF) and the WHO definition of Palliative Care. It supports the assessment of&#xD;
      areas and complexity of concerns from the patient perspective, determining priorities and&#xD;
      structures the support needed. SENS stands for: Symptom-management, instruction for self&#xD;
      administration of medication etc. End of life decision-making: explicit definition of own&#xD;
      goals and priorities; Network organization including anticipatory planning of emergency&#xD;
      situations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Support of the carers: implementation of support systems for the caring family members&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standardized intervention (based on prepared educational tool kit including a patient&#xD;
      prompt sheet) is performed by a palliative care physician and nurse collaboratively after&#xD;
      randomization and consent. The intervention is undertaken only once (after baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire and before first follow-up questionnaire). There is a total of 4 questionnaires&#xD;
      in the first 6 months. In addition, patients will receive usual oncology care throughout the&#xD;
      study period (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Oncology care (performed by oncological out- and inpatient clinics): Usual care&#xD;
      incorporates a routine assessment according to national protocols, which assesses overall&#xD;
      symptoms and current complaints from other domains. Participants assigned to usual care may&#xD;
      meet with the palliative care service on request according to established practice but&#xD;
      without following the SENS approach (subgroup analysis will be performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main eligibility criteria&#xD;

&#xD;
      Outcomes Primary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distress over six month as measured with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#xD;
           (NCCN) Distress thermometer Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General&#xD;
           (FACT-G)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palliative Outcome Scale (POS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location of death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health care utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the effectiveness of early palliative care&#xD;
      structured by SENS (a systematic, problem-based assessment system) in addition to standard&#xD;
      oncology care compared with standard oncology care alone to relieve distress in patients with&#xD;
      advanced cancer at the end of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine whether the introduction of SENS improves quality&#xD;
      of life and prolongs overall survival in these patients, reduces health care costs and&#xD;
      medical resource utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the nested qualitative study is to identify characteristics and&#xD;
      reasons for the added value as well as failure of a compulsory problem-based assessment&#xD;
      system (SENS) in advanced cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Multicenter, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized-controlled trial with a nested&#xD;
      qualitative study (content analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palliative care with a structured approach (SENS model) based on the&#xD;
      bio-psycho-social-spiritual model of care. The approach supports the assessment of areas and&#xD;
      complexity of concerns from the patient perspective, determines the priority and structures&#xD;
      the support needed. The intervention is performed by palliative care physicians and nurses&#xD;
      collaboratively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm: Patients in the usual care group will receive routine oncology care throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the usual care group will receive routine oncology care throughout the study. This incorporates a routine assessment according to the standard SAKK - protocol which assesses overall symptoms. Patients are not seen by nurses during a routine visit to the outpatient clinic unless they need a blood withdrawal or any intravenous or subcutaneous treatment. Only nursing staff of the palliative care unit is familiar with using the SENS-assessment instrument. Participants assigned to usual care may meet with the palliative care service on request according to established practice.</description>
