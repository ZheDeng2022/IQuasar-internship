  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer, largely the result of cigarette smoking, is the leading cause of cancer death in&#xD;
      the United States, killing over 160,000 people in 2010, more than breast, colorectal, and&#xD;
      prostate cancer combined. Since only 10% of heavy smokers develop lung cancer and 20% of lung&#xD;
      cancers develop in nonsmokers, it is thought that genetic predisposition plays an important&#xD;
      role. This study proposes to examine the genetic correlation between nasal and bronchial&#xD;
      epithelium and to identify a patient's risk for lung cancer earlier.&#xD;

      Lung cancer, largely the result of cigarette smoking, is the leading cause of cancer death in&#xD;
      the United States, killing over 160,000 people in 2010, more than breast, colorectal, and&#xD;
      prostate cancer combined. Since only 10% of heavy smokers develop lung cancer and 20% of lung&#xD;
      cancers develop in nonsmokers, it is thought that genetic predisposition plays an important&#xD;
      role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without screening, lung cancer is only detected at an early stage 10% of the time,&#xD;
      translating into a 7% cure rate. Published studies of screening for lung cancer using CT&#xD;
      scans show that it is detectable at an early stage 85% of the time, translating into a cure&#xD;
      rate over 60%. However, in a sample population of 1000 smokers over the age of 60 (high risk&#xD;
      individuals), 233 will have suspicious abnormalities on CT scans, but only 27 had lung&#xD;
      cancer. Two concerns are apparent. First, among the 233 individuals with suspicious&#xD;
      abnormalities on CT, how does one choose the ones suspicious enough for biopsy, surgery, or&#xD;
      other invasive procedures? Generally, follow-up CT scans over several months are used to&#xD;
      assess the abnormalities for growth, since growth is a characteristic of malignancy.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, repeated CT scans involve financial cost and potential radiation risk. An&#xD;
      additional technique which is able to predict predisposition to lung cancer, if combined with&#xD;
      the ability of CT scans to detect abnormalities in real time, could prove to be a powerful&#xD;
      platform to efficiently screen for lung cancer and reduce its mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung cancer develops as a consequence of a series of genetic injuries to the cells lining the&#xD;
      airways which cause these bronchial cells to grow in a malignant manner, unchecked, resistant&#xD;
      to normal homeostatic controls. By studying the gene expression signature of airway&#xD;
      (bronchial) lining cells, differences are observed between normal nonsmokers, individuals&#xD;
      exposed to smoke second-hand, and smokers who have developed COPD (chronic bronchitis and&#xD;
      emphysema). Some genetic changes in bronchial lining cells near a lung cancer are specific to&#xD;
      lung cancer --- the &quot;field effect.&quot; Obtaining bronchial lining cells for genetic analysis&#xD;
      requires an invasive and expensive procedure, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and therefore&#xD;
      bronchoscopically acquired bronchial lining cells are not suitable for screening of the&#xD;
      public for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lining cells of the nose, the nasal epithelium, which is part of the human airway, have&#xD;
      many similarities to bronchial epithelium, but they are much more accessible. A gentle&#xD;
      scraping of the nasal lining involves no risk to the patient, less cost, and, it is hoped,&#xD;
      will provide the same genetic information as the bronchial lining cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to examine the genetic correlation between nasal and bronchial epithelium&#xD;
      in the hopes of developing an office-based test to identify a patient's risk for lung cancer.&#xD;
      It is hoped that the genetic analysis of nasal epithelium may be combined with the other risk&#xD;
      factors for lung cancer such as cigarette smoking, age over 50 years, and an obstructive&#xD;
      ventilatory impairment noted on pulmonary function tests to find the ideal (or enriched)&#xD;
      population to screen with CT to detect early lung cancer, thus reducing the financial cost,&#xD;
      radiation exposure, and risk of invasive procedures to a minimum, furthering the ultimate&#xD;
      goal of &quot;personalized medicine.&quot;&#xD;
