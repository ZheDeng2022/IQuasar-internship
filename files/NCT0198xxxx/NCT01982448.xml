    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study randomizing patients with stage I with T1 &gt; 1.5 cm, stage II or III&#xD;
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) to preoperative cisplatin versus paclitaxel. The study&#xD;
      is designed to evaluate the ability of the Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) assay to&#xD;
      predict pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin and paclitaxel are active in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Despite&#xD;
      different mechanisms of action, effective predictive biomarkers to preferentially inform drug&#xD;
      selection have not been identified. The homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) assay&#xD;
      (Myriad Genetics, Inc.) detects impaired double-strand DNA break repair and may identify&#xD;
      patients with BRCA1/2-proficient tumors that are sensitive to DNA-targeting therapy. The&#xD;
      primary objective of TBCRC 030 was to detect an association of HRD with pathologic response&#xD;
      (residual cancer burden (RCB)-0/1) to singleagent cisplatin or paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective phase II study enrolled patients with germline BRCA1/2 wild-type/unknown&#xD;
      stage I-III TNBC in a 12-week randomized study of preoperative cisplatin or paclitaxel. The&#xD;
      HRD assay was carried out on baseline tissue; positive HRD was defined as a score &gt;=33.&#xD;
      Crossover to an alternative chemotherapy was offered if there was inadequate response.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible&#xD;
             to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pathologic documentation of invasive breast cancer by biopsy (FNA alone is not&#xD;
             adequate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. AJCC clinical stage I with T1 &gt; 1.5 cm, stage II or III invasive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants with multicentric or bilateral disease are eligible if at least one&#xD;
             lesion meets stage eligibility criteria for the study and no tumor is HER2-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Tumors must be HER2 negative defined as HER2 0 or 1+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC)&#xD;
             assays and /or lack of gene amplification by FISH defined as a ratio &lt; 2 on invasive&#xD;
             tumor by local review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ER and PgR status by IHC must be known. Tumor must be ER and PR negative (≤5%&#xD;
             staining) by local review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known BRCA1/2 (BReast CAncer) status is not required for study entry. However patients&#xD;
             known to have a germline deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation should be encouraged to consider&#xD;
             a preoperative trial specifically designed for BRCA1/2 carriers, if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Breast imaging should include imaging of the ipsilateral axilla. For subjects with a&#xD;
             clinically positive axilla, a needle aspiration, core biopsy or SLN procedure will be&#xD;
             performed to confirm the presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For patients with a clinically negative axilla, baseline assessment of the axilla will be&#xD;
        performed at the discretion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For patients with pathologically positive axillary lymph nodes prior to preoperative&#xD;
        therapy, a level I and II lymph node dissection at the time of definitive surgery is&#xD;
        recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Patients with a prior history of contra-lateral breast cancer are eligible if they have&#xD;
        no evidence of recurrence of their initial primary breast cancer within the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        10. Women ≥ 18 years of age. 11. ECOG performance status ≤1 (see Appendix A). 12.&#xD;
        Laboratory Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 / mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/ mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN), for patients with Gilbert syndrome,&#xD;
             direct bilirubin will be measured instead of total bilirubin&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ALT, AST ≤3.0 x ULN ALK Phos &lt;2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 cc/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Use of an effective means of contraception is required in subjects of childbearing&#xD;
             potential since study agents are known to be teratogenic. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately. Women of child-bearing potential and men&#xD;
             must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been&#xD;
             disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk&#xD;
             for recurrence of that malignancy and did not receive prior chemotherapy. Individuals&#xD;
             with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5&#xD;
             years: cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient must be willing to undergo mandatory research biopsy and blood draw. Prior to&#xD;
             biopsy procedures patients must be able to be off medications that could increase the&#xD;
             risk of bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants with axillary adenopathy only are not eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior chemotherapy: Prior non-taxane or platinum containing chemotherapy will be&#xD;
             allowed if the prior exposure was at least 5 years ago and the exposure is thought not&#xD;
             to potentially interact with the primary outcome of the trial or put the patient at&#xD;
             undue risk, and should be reviewed with study PI on a case by case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any prior treatment for the current breast cancer, including chemotherapy, hormonal&#xD;
             therapy, radiation or experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ipsilateral breast recurrence, unless prior treatment consisted of excision alone for&#xD;
             DCIS or breast conserving treatment and hormonal therapy for DCIS or invasive breast&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ongoing use of any other investigational or study agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Peripheral neuropathy of any etiology &gt; grade 1 (NCI CTCAE Version 4.0- Appendix B)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Significant hearing loss that would prevent cisplatin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Renal dysfunction for which exposure to cisplatin would be unsafe or require cisplatin&#xD;
             dose modification (i.e., Cre &gt; 1.5 mg/dl or GFR &lt; 60 cc/min).&#xD;
