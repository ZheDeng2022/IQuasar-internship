  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational research has linked physical activity with faster recovery, improved quality of&#xD;
      life, and greater survival; however, little is known about the effects of physical activity&#xD;
      in pre-operative, peri-operative, or post-operative treatment contexts and there is a need&#xD;
      for interventions to improve patient outcomes across the cancer treatment continuum. Three&#xD;
      propositions derived from basic research, epidemiological evidence, and clinical practice&#xD;
      informed our intervention development efforts: (1) Patient outcomes will be enhanced by&#xD;
      interventions that increase physical activity (i.e., standing, walking) across the cancer&#xD;
      treatment continuum (i.e., pre-operative, peri-operative, post-operative). (2) Reducing&#xD;
      sedentary behavior (i.e., seated or reclined activities involving minimal energy expenditure)&#xD;
      will enhance patient outcomes both by increasing physical activity and by stimulating&#xD;
      additional adaptive physiological responses to reduced sedentary time (responses which are&#xD;
      independent of physical activity-induced responses). (3) Patients with gastrointestinal&#xD;
      cancers often suffer functional limitations that limit their independence and their health&#xD;
      behaviors are strongly influenced by the family environment so interventions that engage&#xD;
      caregivers (e.g., spouses) will be more effective than those that target patients/survivors&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

      Phase 1 Screening and Baseline Assessment in Clinic Patients will be recruited by their&#xD;
      physician upon diagnosis and immediately after the Penn State Surgical Oncology team presents&#xD;
      then with the surgical treatment option. The patient must be able to identify an adult&#xD;
      caregiver. The caregiver must be someone who is willing to participate in the study for the&#xD;
      intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled by the research assistant, the participant will complete an intake&#xD;
      questionnaire to capture demographic information. The participant will then be given a tablet&#xD;
      computer, training on how to use it to complete the questionnaires at the beginning and end&#xD;
      of each day, an activity monitor with materials for securing it, and training on how/where to&#xD;
      affix it on the leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will use educational materials delivered at the initial enrollment session&#xD;
      and in daily &quot;facts of the day&quot; presented electronically to heighten awareness of (1) the&#xD;
      risks of insufficient physical activity and excessive sedentary behavior, and (2) the&#xD;
      expected beneficial outcomes of increased physical activity and reduced sedentary behavior.&#xD;
      These messages should are designed to increase intentions to engage in physical activity and&#xD;
      to limit sedentary behavior (motivational phase). Although intentions are necessary for&#xD;
      behavior change, a recent review of experimental evidence indicates that they are not&#xD;
      sufficient. In the volitional phase, people translate those intentions into action by&#xD;
      developing actions plans that specify when/where/how they will act (e.g., after lunch I will&#xD;
      go on a 30 min walk around my neighborhood) and coping plans that specify how they will&#xD;
      overcome anticipated barriers to desired behavior (e.g., if it rains after lunch, I will go&#xD;
      to the mall to walk for 30 min). Repeated planning of this nature is the basis for breaking&#xD;
      existing behavioral habits and forming newer (and hopefully more adaptive) ones. We have&#xD;
      already developed an electronic daily planning tool that can be used at the beginning of each&#xD;
      day to form action and coping plans for the target behaviors in this intervention. In the&#xD;
      first two months of this project, we will tailor this existing planning tool for the target&#xD;
      population by drawing from existing and emerging research on strategies for and barriers to&#xD;
      health behaviors among cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will not receive the educational or daily planning components of the&#xD;
      motivational intervention. They will, however, engage in self-monitoring by virtue of wearing&#xD;
      activity monitors and using tablet computers to provide self-report data on their physical&#xD;
      activity and sedentary behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient's surgery while staying at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center, the study&#xD;
      coordinator will provide the caregiver with behavioral goals to help the patient recover from&#xD;
      his/her surgery, and additional information about how the caregiver can support the patient's&#xD;
      behavior change efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Intervention Period&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the duration of the study, participant will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete beginning-and end -of-day questionnaires on the tablet computer. The beginning&#xD;
           of day questionnaire will evaluate the patient's intentions and plans for daily physical&#xD;
           activity. The end of day questionnaire will evaluate actual physical activity completed&#xD;
           daily as well as the patient's physical, emotional, and social well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wear and activity monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in the experimental group the research assistant will also:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deliver the educational intervention for patients and caregivers during their first&#xD;
           visit after they have signed the consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Train patients how to use the daily planning tool prior to the beginning -of- day prior&#xD;
           to the beginning-of-day questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theoretical basis for our intervention draws from both social-cognitive theory (i.e.,&#xD;
      Health Action Process Approach [HAPA]) and self-determination theory. The Health Action&#xD;
      Process Approach differentiates between motivational and volitional phases of action control.&#xD;
      In the motivational phase, people form intentions or goals for their behavior based on&#xD;
      factors such as risk awareness and outcome expectations. In this study, we will use&#xD;
      educational materials delivered at the initial enrollment session and in daily &quot;facts of the&#xD;
      day&quot; presented electronically to heighten awareness of (1) the risks of insufficient physical&#xD;
      activity and excessive sedentary behavior, and (2) the expected beneficial outcomes of&#xD;
      increased physical activity and reduced sedentary behavior. These messages should are&#xD;
      designed to increase intentions to engage in physical activity and to limit sedentary&#xD;
      behavior (motivational phase). Although intentions are necessary for behavior change, a&#xD;
      recent review of experimental evidence indicates that they are not sufficient. In the&#xD;
      volitional phase, people translate those intentions into action by developing actions plans&#xD;
      that specify when/where/how they will act (e.g., after lunch I will go on a 30 min walk&#xD;
      around my neighborhood) and coping plans that specify how they will overcome anticipated&#xD;
      barriers to desired behavior (e.g., if it rains after lunch, I will go to the mall to walk&#xD;
      for 30 min). Repeated planning of this nature is the basis for breaking existing behavioral&#xD;
      habits and forming newer (and hopefully more adaptive) ones. We have already developed an&#xD;
      electronic daily planning tool that can be used at the beginning of each day to form action&#xD;
      and coping plans for the target behaviors in this intervention. In the first two months of&#xD;
      this project, we will tailor this existing planning tool for the target population by drawing&#xD;
      from existing and emerging research on strategies for and barriers to health behaviors among&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-determination theory posits that social factors, such as family relationships, can also&#xD;
      influence motivation. Our recent work using experience sampling methodology and accelerometry&#xD;
      has shown that spouses' autonomy support for patient physical activity and the spouse's level&#xD;
      of physical activity were associated with patients' greater daily moderate physical activity&#xD;
      and steps taken Individuals whose family members or health care providers show autonomy&#xD;
      support for increasing physical activity and decreasing sedentary behavior are more likely to&#xD;
      make those changes for reasons that come from within themselves and are freely chosen.&#xD;
      Because close family members influence the emotional and physical well-being of patients,&#xD;
      their inclusion in behavioral interventions is logical and has the potential to boost the&#xD;
      effects of those interventions. In this study, caregivers will be educated about the&#xD;
      importance of autonomy support in behavior change and strategies for supporting their&#xD;
      partner's autonomy around physical activity and sedentary behavior change across the stages&#xD;
      of treatment. This education will be delivered by the nurse coordinator at the initial&#xD;
      education session following enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collectively, these three components of patient education, daily planning, and caregiver&#xD;
      education were assembled to strengthen intentions for desired health behaviors (motivational&#xD;
      phase of behavior change), to increase the likelihood that such intentions will translate&#xD;
      into action (volitional phase of behavior change), and to provide social resources that&#xD;
      support behavior change in both of those phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will not receive the educational or daily planning components of the&#xD;
      motivational intervention. They will, however, engage in self-monitoring by virtue of wearing&#xD;
      activity monitors and using tablet computers to provide self-report data on their physical&#xD;
      activity and sedentary behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention period the study coordinator will also contact the patient via phone&#xD;
      weekly to ask questions related to the patients safety including questions about frequency of&#xD;
      falls mild/moderate/severe, chest pain, dizziness, musculoskeletal soreness or pain, and&#xD;
      changes in swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Follow-Up Telephone Call&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research assistant will call the participant 30, 60, and 90 days after surgery to assess&#xD;
      the frequency of hospital readmission or emergency room visits since being discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: Follow- Up Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      21 days after discharge form the hospital, participants and caregivers will complete a brief&#xD;
      questionnaire that we will mail to them with a self-addressed stamped envelope.&#xD;
