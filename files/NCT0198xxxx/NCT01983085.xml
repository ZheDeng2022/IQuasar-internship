  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the safety and efficacy of a nitric oxide (NOx) generating dressing&#xD;
      on superficial partial thickness (SPT) wounds. Nitric oxide has a range of effects on the&#xD;
      body including vasodilation and angiogenesis. It is also a potent antimicrobial. This 160&#xD;
      patient, randomised, controlled clinical study will assess the ability of a simple 2 part,&#xD;
      NOx generating dressing to improve healing in SPT burn wounds and SPT skin graft donor site&#xD;
      wounds compared to standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study of a new wound dressing for superficial partial thickness (SPT)&#xD;
      wounds. The dressing consists of 2 stable layers that when placed together release Nitric&#xD;
      Oxide. In preclinical studies NOx delivery has caused significant vasodilation, angiogenesis&#xD;
      and demonstrated potent anti-microbial activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre, 160 patient, randomised, controlled study. There are 2 arms to the&#xD;
      study. 80 patients will have treatment applied to a SPT burn wound and 80 patients will have&#xD;
      treatment applied to a SPT graft donor site wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The controls will be intra-individual. Each patient will have their wound divided into 2,&#xD;
      half of the wound being treated with the NOx dressing, the other half treated with standard&#xD;
      of care. The positioning of the dressings will be randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NOx dressing will be changed at least every 2 days and the standard of care changed&#xD;
      according to normal clinical practice and patients will be treated until the wound is healed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The size of the wound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eepithelialisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trans-epidermal water loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 and 12 month follow up with assessment of scarring.&#xD;
