  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to determine whether biopsy using radiofrequency is a procedure suitable&#xD;
      for this patient selection. Findings from biopsy will be correlated with the conventional&#xD;
      surgery ones. If the technique is validated to predict the presence or absence of residual&#xD;
      tumor, breast surgery could be avoided in cases of absence of tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a set of at least 4 different diseases, currently known as intrinsic genomic&#xD;
      subtypes. Two of them are the so-called HER2-enriched, characterized by the HER-2 oncogene&#xD;
      amplification, and the basal-like, which correlates closely with some of the triple negative&#xD;
      tumors (TNBC). These subtypes are very sensitive to the primary medical treatment&#xD;
      (neoadjuvant or Presurgical). The use of modern medical treatments as initial treatment, can&#xD;
      allow the complete disappearance of cancer in the breast and axilla (pathologic complete&#xD;
      response, CPR) in 40% of patients with TNBC and around 60% of patients with HER2-positive&#xD;
      tumors in stage II and III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need of local surgery in patients where the tumor disappeared completely (CPR) after&#xD;
      primary medical treatment, is recently questioned, the improvement is not clear and&#xD;
      radiotherapy could be sufficient to assure the locoregional disease control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of conventional diagnostic techniques (MRI, ultrasound, mammography and PET) is not&#xD;
      enough reliable to determine the pathological complete response, making difficult to adopt an&#xD;
      attitude of surgical abstention. The existence of a minimally invasive technique that could&#xD;
      reliably determine the absence of cancer after primary medical treatment surgery, could avoid&#xD;
      the surgery in these cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous biopsy guided by ultrasound radiofrequency is a technique that allows the&#xD;
      complete resection of breast lesions up to 2 cm of diameter with minimal aggression to the&#xD;
      mammary gland from the area of the initial tumor after the neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies report the use of this technique in patients with breast cancer. Results show&#xD;
      a good tolerability of the technique by the patients and suggest that it would not only&#xD;
      reduce the need of the re-excision, but also reduce the rate of local recurrence due to&#xD;
      radiation absence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy using radiofrequency could be useful to confirm CPR in patients with triple-negative&#xD;
      and HER2-positive tumors and several luminal B tumors and good response previously determined&#xD;
      by conventional methods (MR in particular). Despite that, new prospective studies to analyse&#xD;
      the reliability in patients selection with CPR and could avoid the traditional surgery are&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm this hypothesis, a group of 100 treated patients with unicentered tumors in stages&#xD;
      II or III and good response determined by MR after 6 cycles of treatment (less than 2 cm&#xD;
      apparent residual injury) will be consecutively subjected to radiofrequency biopsy and the&#xD;
      surgery previously established for each case (Tumorectomy or mastectomy). Before surgery, the&#xD;
      sentinel node will be biopsied in order to define the surgical treatment on the axilla (none&#xD;
      in case of negative sentinel node, axillary lymphadenectomy if positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor samples obtained by percutaneous radiofrequency and mastectomy-Tumorectomy biopsy&#xD;
      will be studied thoroughly to define the correlation between the two.&#xD;
