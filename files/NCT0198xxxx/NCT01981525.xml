      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Li Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant cancer&#xD;
           predisposition disorder. Four main cancer types including sarcoma, adrenocortical&#xD;
           carcinoma, breast cancer, and malignant brain tumors commonly characterize LFS but the&#xD;
           syndrome can include other cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metformin is an oral biguanide drug that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of&#xD;
           type II diabetes. Metformin has been associated with reduced cancer risk in several&#xD;
           epidemiologic studies and reduced cancer mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metformin decreases circulating insulin and IGF1, and promotes glucose uptake in&#xD;
           skeletal muscle and inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver. Elevations in circulating&#xD;
           insulin and IGF1 levels have been associated with increased cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical research in animal models shows that metformin may be more toxic in cancer&#xD;
           cells that have lost p53 function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lifetime risk of cancer in LFS patients with germline TP53 mutations is estimated to be&#xD;
           up to 70% by age 60, with women having excess lifetime cancer risk (up to 100%) compared&#xD;
           to men (up to 80%). There are currently no approved chemopreventive agents for patients&#xD;
           with LFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metformin has been shown to be safe and tolerable in diabetic and non-diabetics, and may&#xD;
           be an ideal candidate for chemoprevention of cancer in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the tolerability of oral daily metformin in patients with LFS caused by&#xD;
           germline TP53 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if 8 weeks of daily metformin administration has any effect on circulating&#xD;
           IGF-1, insulin, and IGFBP3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have a germline TP53 mutation and provide documentation of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a pilot study to assess the tolerability of daily oral metformin administration&#xD;
           in patients with LFS caused by germline TP53 mutations and to study the effect of&#xD;
           metformin on biomarker levels in these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the absence of intolerable toxicity, a minimum of 22 patients will take metformin by&#xD;
           mouth for a total of 14 weeks and then discontinue metformin for 6 weeks. The total time&#xD;
           on study will be 20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be assessed for biomarker levels (IGF-1, insulin, IGFBP3) by blood sample&#xD;
           at baseline, and weeks 0 and 8.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All TP53 germline mutation positive adult patients will be eligible for this study.&#xD;
             All patients must have a documented TP53 germline mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of cancer must be in remission, with surgery completed at least&#xD;
             6 months prior to enrollment and chemotherapy completed at least 1 year prior to&#xD;
             enrollment (except for basel cell carcinoma of the skin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. The doses of metformin used in this study&#xD;
             exceed the maximum recommended daily dose for the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1 or Karnofsky greater than or equal to 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes*: greater than or equal to 3,000/microL*&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count: greater than or equal to 1,500/ microL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets: greater than or equal to 100,000/ microL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin: Within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT) / ALT(SGPT): less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit&#xD;
                  of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine: Within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance: greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73m(2) if serum&#xD;
                  creatinine &gt; institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: If leukopenia is idiopathic and no other significant co-morbidities&#xD;
                       exist patients will not be excluded on the basis of their WBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metformin is a category B drug and can be used to treat gestational diabetes. Levels&#xD;
             of metformin excreted in breast milk appear to be low and not clinically significant.&#xD;
             However, for protocol safety reasons, we will not be enrolling pregnant and/or nursing&#xD;
             women in this study as metformin as has not been extensively evaluated in non-diabetic&#xD;
             pregnant and nursing women. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Women&#xD;
             who are nursing will be advised to discontinue breastfeeding if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with metformin. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform Drs. Annunziata or Walcott, or protocol&#xD;
             physicians/study team at NCI and her primary care provider immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        GENERAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had stem-cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of metformin or other anti-diabetic agents, or hypersensitivity or allergy&#xD;
             to metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of chronic alcohol use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to metformin or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacological management.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA for 13C-MBT STUDIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for 13C-MBT studies in addition to general exclusion criteria&#xD;
        (pertaining to effects of oral uptake of the administered substrate or mitochondrial&#xD;
        function in the liver):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastric paresis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Short gut syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inflammatory bowel disease*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Celiac sprue&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pancreatic insufficiency or disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any malabsorption disease/syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic PPI use or H2 blocker use that cannot be temporarily discontinued (at least 48&#xD;
             hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any acetaminophen, aspirin, NSAID, or statin use within 2 days of testing (known to&#xD;
             affect mitochondrial function)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drugs that interfere with mitochondrial function if they are unable to be discontinued&#xD;
             48 hours prior to (13)MBT testing will be excluded for this test only but eligible for&#xD;
             the rest of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any oral steroid use within 2 weeks of testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic alcohol use** defined as &gt; 2 standard drinks per day (more than 2 beers, 2&#xD;
             glasses of wine, or 2 shots of liquor per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inflammatory bowel disease will be exclusion for the (13)C-MBT only, because even&#xD;
                  if well controlled we do not know the effect chronic inflammation in the bowel&#xD;
                  and steroid use may have on the test. The test analyzes exhaled CO2 in the breath&#xD;
                  and this can be affected by diet (carbohydrate heavy), exercise, and certain&#xD;
                  pathologies like liver disease. Also pro-inflammatory mediators have been shown&#xD;
                  to cause hepatocellular injury that may also interfere with results of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The test is currently being studied as an early detection, non-invasive&#xD;
                       method for liver cirrhosis. Therefore, patients who have had chronic alcohol&#xD;
                       use consistent with a regular pattern of alcohol consumption may have&#xD;
                       underlying liver disease that may affect the CO2 measurement. Further,&#xD;
                       alcohol changes the NADH/NAD ratio intracellularly and studies have shown&#xD;
                       that alcohol can inhibit methionine oxidation. Previous protocols utilizing&#xD;
                       the (13)C-MBT have excluded patients who consume greater than 20 g/day of&#xD;
                       alcohol. A standard drink is equivalent to approximately 14 g/day of alcohol&#xD;
                       (one 12 oz beer, one 5 oz glass of wine, or one shot of liquor). This&#xD;
                       information was obtained from the National Institute of Health/National&#xD;
                       Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA):&#xD;
&#xD;
        http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Practitioner/pocketguide/pocket_guide2.htm). We will&#xD;
        also evaluate LFTs and should clinical concern arise, check PT/PTT and albumin. Patients&#xD;
        with normal liver function and no substantial history of alcohol abuse will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR 31P-MRS STUDIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Although patients will need to sign a separate informed consent to undergo the (31)P-MRS&#xD;
        studies the list below includes some of the general exclusion criteria as information for&#xD;
        the caring physician. Exclusion criteria for (31)P-MRS studies in addition to general&#xD;
        exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to perform exercise with dominant leg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia and/or inability to lie flat in MRI machine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metal medical implantable device or other MRI incompatible materials&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index under 19 or over 45&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior stem cell transplantation&#xD;
