      Sepsis is one of the most frequent reasons for referral to emergency departments (EDs)&#xD;
      worldwide. The incidence of sepsis is likely to rise in the upcoming years. Sepsis has a&#xD;
      tendency to become more serious when left untreated with a high mortality rate, exceeding&#xD;
      even those of myocardial infarction and stroke. Therefore, much effort has been put in to&#xD;
      start with appropriate therapy as early as possible. Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) in&#xD;
      the emergency department with fluid resuscitation, administration of&#xD;
      vasopressors/vasodilators and intravenous antibiotics in patients with severe sepsis and&#xD;
      septic shock has indeed decreased mortality substantially. Emergency medical services (EMS)&#xD;
      personnel have already made a significant difference in improving care for patients with&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome, multiple trauma and stroke. Patients with severe sepsis or septic&#xD;
      shock could also benefit greatly from timely pre-hospital care. Earlier recognition and&#xD;
      initiation of treatment by EMS personnel may improve survival even more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, the first hour of ED presentation seems to be the most critical hour.&#xD;
      Administration of antibiotics and fluid resuscitation in the pre-hospital setting will reduce&#xD;
      the time to administration substantially. In adults, to the best of our knowledge, no studies&#xD;
      on the effect of pre-hospital administration of antibiotics have been performed. In children&#xD;
      with meningitis, some uncontrolled studies show contradictory results, most probably due to&#xD;
      bias by severity. We propose a non-blinded randomised multicentre clinical trial study on the&#xD;
      efficacy of early, pre-hospital intravenous administration of broad spectrum antibiotics&#xD;
      (ceftriaxone), which are effective against a wide variety of infectious pathogens that cause&#xD;
      most common community-acquired infections) in patients referred to the ED with suspected&#xD;
      severe sepsis or septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate whether early, pre-hospital administration of antibiotics, together&#xD;
      with training of ambulance personnel in recognizing and initiating treatment reduces 28-day&#xD;
      mortality in patients referred to the ED with suspected severe sepsis or septic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Non-blinded randomized multicentre clinical trial nested within a stepped wedge&#xD;
      design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All patients above the age of 18 years, with suspected severe sepsis or&#xD;
      septic shock and transferred to the ED by ambulance, are eligible for study inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: prehospital antibiotics (ceftriaxone 2000 mg intravenously)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: 28-day mortality, hospital length of stay, admission to&#xD;
      intensive or medium care unit (ICU/MC), time to administration of antibiotics. Follow up of&#xD;
      one year. QoL after one month after discharge.&#xD;

      Introduction Sepsis is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases in the world,&#xD;
      causing more deaths than AIDS, breast cancer and prostate cancer put together (8-10). Despite&#xD;
      the fact that the mortality of sepsis is ten times higher than myocardial infarction and to&#xD;
      five times higher than stroke, relatively little attention is given to sepsis (23-25). In&#xD;
      recent years successful clinical care management pathways have been developed for patients&#xD;
      suffering from a myocardial infarction, stroke or a trauma. Even though there is strong&#xD;
      evidence in scientific literature to support the need for a series of time-dependent actions,&#xD;
      for sepsis this is still not the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 13 September 2012, the first ' World Sepsis Day ' was held with as main objective : 'to&#xD;
      increase awareness for sepsis as a potentially lethal condition, which should be considered&#xD;
      as a medical emergency ' (26). Prompt recognition and treatment are extremely important for&#xD;
      improving survival, while patients who survive sepsis can still continue to suffer from&#xD;
      physical or psychological symptoms. The likelihood and severity of these complications&#xD;
      depends on a number of factors including the severity of sepsis and the length of stay in&#xD;
      hospital stay and in ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition Sepsis is defined as a proven or strongly suspected infection that is associated&#xD;
      with a 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome ' (SIRS) (29,30). SIRS exists if at least two&#xD;
      of the four criteria are met: abnormal body temperature, increased heart rate (over 90 beats&#xD;
      per minute), increased respiratory rate (more than 20 per minute) and an abnormal white blood&#xD;
      cell (WBC) count. There are different degrees of sepsis on the basis of severity. Sepsis may&#xD;
      develop to severe sepsis or septic shock, if treatment is not timely initiated. Severe sepsis&#xD;
      is defined as sepsis with failure of one or more organ systems and septic shock and severe&#xD;
      sepsis with persistent low blood pressures despite adequate resuscitation. In particular&#xD;
      organ failure and shock cause high mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Netherlands, more than 10,000 patients with sepsis are admitted to a hospital&#xD;
      annually, with an average length of stay (LOS) of 15 days. The medical costs being&#xD;
      approximately $ 20,000 per person, the total cost of severe sepsis in the Netherlands is&#xD;
      estimated at nearly 170 million per year (1-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality can be very high if sepsis is not timely or adequately treated, especially among&#xD;
      the vulnerable elderly population. The mortality rates vary from 20 to 60 percent, depending&#xD;
      on the age and other underlying diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Even in the VUmc the&#xD;
      mortality rates are almost up to 40%. Multiorgan failure due to sepsis and septic shock is&#xD;
      the leading cause of death in the ICU (31,32). The incidence of sepsis has increased in&#xD;
      recent years and it is expected that this trend will continue, partly due to the aging&#xD;
      population and partly because of increasing numbers of immune-compromised patients who are&#xD;
      highly susceptible to all kinds of (opportunistic) infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Goal Directed Therapy (EGDT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of antibiotics was a major step forward in the treatment of sepsis, causing a&#xD;
      mortality decrease by approximately 25 percent (33,34). It is noteworthy that in the decades&#xD;
      hereafter very little progress in the treatment of sepsis was made, until the introduction of&#xD;
      the 'Early goal directed therapy (EGDT). A study by Rivers and colleagues (4) shows that by&#xD;
      applying EGDT during the first six hours after detection of sepsis, an absolute mortality&#xD;
      reduction of almost 16% is achieved. This EGDT consists of a number of interventions, which&#xD;
      have the purpose to optimize hemodynamics as quickly as possible by means of tight monitoring&#xD;
      of arterial / venous pressures and oxygen saturation. The cornerstones of this treatment&#xD;
      include aggressive fluid resuscitation, administration of vasopressors, giving protective&#xD;
      ventilation and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Several large clinical trials&#xD;
      have confirmed the value of EGDT with sometimes even greater mortality reduction (35-38).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival Sepsis Campaign Timely recognition and rapid treatment of sepsis appears crucial,&#xD;
      but recognizing sepsis still remains a challenge: the symptoms are often non-specific and&#xD;
      various other diseases might fit as well. Therefore the &quot;Surviving Sepsis Campaign&quot; (SSC) was&#xD;
      launched in 2003 (13), with the aim of creating awareness for sepsis for better recognition&#xD;
      and treatment of sepsis to improve the prognosis. Through this campaign a directive was&#xD;
      developed wherein a somewhat modified form of the EGDT was incorporated. This directive also&#xD;
      states that broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible, preferably&#xD;
      within one hour after arrival in the emergency room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite extensive attention in the last few years (major campaigns of VMS) in shortening time&#xD;
      to administration of antibiotics (the so called &quot;onset to needle time&quot;), there are still&#xD;
      delays in the start up of antibiotic therapy in the emergency department (ED) (6-7). EDs are&#xD;
      still not functioning optimally, with waiting times sometimes exceeding 6 hours. This is also&#xD;
      the conclusion of the report: 'Haastige spoed niet overal goed' from 2004 (Inspectie der&#xD;
      Volksgezondheid). Herein EDs in the Netherlands are described as the weakest link in the&#xD;
      emergency care, and in addition according to this report, little progress in the quality of&#xD;
      care in the emergency department was made from 1994 to 2004. After much effort and&#xD;
      recommendations, progress was made in the last few years but not sufficiently enough (see&#xD;
      report '' Ziekenhuizen goed op weg met implementatie normen voor afdelingen spoedeisende&#xD;
      hulp' &quot;). Our study will therefore be able to contribute to the improvement of both&#xD;
      in-hospital and pre-hospital acute care chain. Not only will we save costly time in the trip&#xD;
      till reaching the hospital, but moreover we will also overcome (potential) delays in the&#xD;
      emergency department by starting therapy in the ambulance. Delays which can amount from one&#xD;
      to even six hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why antibiotics should be administered early? The first hour of presentation in the emergency&#xD;
      room, also known as the 'Golden Hour' seems to be the most critical one in the treatment of a&#xD;
      septic patient. Retrospective studies have shown that rapid antibiotic administration could&#xD;
      mean better chance of survival as well as a reduction in the chance of lasting physical&#xD;
      problems. Moreover, rapid intervention may shorten hospital stay as well and even prevent the&#xD;
      need for ICU admission (1-5). In daily practice however, implementation of the SSC directives&#xD;
      is not always easy, and there may be several reasons to delay the start of treatment (6.15).&#xD;
      The so-called 'onset to needle time' can be as high as several hours. A recent pilot study in&#xD;
      the VUMC showed that 25% of patients had to wait longer than three hours at the emergency&#xD;
      department before treatment was initiated with antibiotic therapy (16). Not only in the pilot&#xD;
      study of our university but also in a retrospective study conducted by Kumar and colleagues&#xD;
      only 32.5% of the patients received the first gift within the first 3 hours (6) Any delay in&#xD;
      the administration of antibiotics, causes an increase in mortality rate with almost 8 percent&#xD;
      per hour!(6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The later the treatment is initiated, the greater the chance of multiorgan failure. Besides&#xD;
      higher mortality-rates, multiorgan failure is directly correlated with more complications,&#xD;
      longer hospital stay and higher use of costly healthcare facilities (10). Therefore it is&#xD;
      probably important that the onset to needle time is as short as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover in the long term sepsis can cause much damage (17-20). Patients who survive sepsis&#xD;
      often suffer for months of complications that arise during or after a prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization in intensive care (eg. critical illness neuropathy, problems with speech or&#xD;
      swallowing by prolonged ventilation). The quality of life can also sharply deteriorate after&#xD;
      experiencing sepsis (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important point to note is that all the studies which state that early antibiotic&#xD;
      administration is associated with improved survival, were retrospective and uncontrolled&#xD;
      studies, making occurrence of selection bias probable. One of the reasons why the doctors may&#xD;
      not be very keen on initiating the antibiotics early (before a definitive diagnosis is made)&#xD;
      may be the fact that they consider current evidence insufficient and incomplete. In order to&#xD;
      investigate the optimal timing of antibiotic administration, prospective randomized&#xD;
      controlled studies should be performed at the emergency department. However, it may be&#xD;
      unethical to randomize patients and delay initiation of antibiotic therapy at the ED. An&#xD;
      alternative and perhaps a better option is to perform a prospective randomized trial in the&#xD;
      pre-hospital setting, i.e in the ambulances. In current practice, initiation of antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy starts at the emergency department (ED) and not in the ambulances. Pre-hospital&#xD;
      antibiotic administration on the one hand may be a solution to avoid delays in treatment at&#xD;
      the ED and on the other hand a way to finally perform a randomised trial to examine the&#xD;
      effect of onset to needle time on clinical endpoints such as improved survival, shorter&#xD;
      hospital stay and better quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-hospital care, even in sepsis? Ambulance personnel have already made a significant&#xD;
      contribution in improving care for patients with acute coronary syndrome, stroke and multiple&#xD;
      trauma (42, 43). Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock can also benefit from early&#xD;
      pre-hospital care (44). Pre-hospital care is the initial medical care, which is given by&#xD;
      ambulance personnel once they reach the patient. Since time plays a crucial role in the&#xD;
      treatment of sepsis, early recognition and initiation of treatment by the ambulance personnel&#xD;
      may help to reduce mortality. The provision of pre-hospital care is associated with a shorter&#xD;
      start-up time of EGDT and antibiotic therapy in the hospital (44-47). In addition, it appears&#xD;
      that this pre-hospital care leads to quicker achievement of an optimal blood pressure, and&#xD;
      oxygen saturation. Therefore, it can be expected that by the administration of broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotics in the ambulance, the survival of sepsis can be improved by greatly reducing the&#xD;
      time to the administration of the necessary antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date no randomized controlled trials on the effect of antibiotics in the pre-hospital&#xD;
      settings on adults have been conducted. In children with meningitis some uncontrolled studies&#xD;
      have been done. In the studies by Strang and Cartwright (50,51), a clear beneficial effect on&#xD;
      survival is seen after pre-hospital administration of antibiotics by general practitioners.&#xD;
      Hamden and Sorensen (52.53) on the contrary showed that administration of antibiotics in the&#xD;
      pre-hospital setting was associated with worse outcomes. A possible explanation for these&#xD;
      divergent results is that there occurred a strong selection bias. The group of children&#xD;
      receiving pre-hospital antibiotics could be in a more critical stage of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A definitive answer to the question whether administration of antibiotics in pre-hospital&#xD;
      setting is effective, can only be obtained by a prospective randomized controlled trial. In&#xD;
      this form of study selection bias can be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, recognition of sepsis is difficult, Suffoletto et al investigated how accurately the&#xD;
      ambulance personnel in Pennsylvania were able to recognize a serious infection, the negative&#xD;
      predictive value was 93%. In contrast, 69% of the patients with a severe infection were&#xD;
      missed (8). A pilot study in Maastricht showed (54), that this situation can probably be&#xD;
      extrapolated to the Netherlands as well: a large proportion of patients with septic shock was&#xD;
      in fact not recognized as such and transported with a B-ride (low priority ride). The&#xD;
      information transfer is hereby often incomplete or not entirely accurate (from the general&#xD;
      practitioner to the ambulance personnel/hospital or from the ambulance to the ED) causing&#xD;
      substantial delays in initiating treatment. Therefore, much can be gained by training&#xD;
      ambulance personnel and getting them skilled enough in recognizing sepsis and improving the&#xD;
      transfer of information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Consortium&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through an intensive collaboration of some major Dutch medical centres and ambulance&#xD;
      services, a research consortium has been established to start a nationwide project in the&#xD;
      form of a multicentre randomized trial: the PHANTASi trial (PreHospital ANTibiotics Against&#xD;
      Sepsi) This consortium has a joint goal namely evaluating the effect of early administration&#xD;
      of antibiotics in patients with suspected sepsis in the pre-hospital setting compared to that&#xD;
      with the regular treatment. Our hypothesis in this study is that administration of&#xD;
      antibiotics in the pre-hospital setting will significantly shorten the time to administration&#xD;
      of antibiotics, which subsequently will lead to improved survival. In addition, the&#xD;
      pre-hospital administration of antibiotics shortens hospital stay which, simultaneously has a&#xD;
      favorable effect on the cost and quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of this project Sepsis is a major global health problem with an increasing&#xD;
      incidence and high mortality rate. While in the past decades, modern medicine has become&#xD;
      increasingly sophisticated, and the treatment and care around diseases, such as heart failure&#xD;
      and cancer is greatly improved, treatment of sepsis remains a problem with a high mortality.&#xD;
      Early administration of antibiotics in critically ill patients with sepsis could possibly&#xD;
      change that. It is not clear what the best time of administration should be, because how&#xD;
      early is early? Moreover, in practice it often happens that the time limits are not, or not&#xD;
      sufficiently monitored closely, whilst increasing the risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the treatment of an acutely ill patient requires teamwork and an optimally&#xD;
      functioning acute-care chain. Through this project it will be possible to investigate whether&#xD;
      pre-hospital antibiotic therapy leads to better outcomes for this category of seriously ill&#xD;
      and vulnerable patients.&#xD;
