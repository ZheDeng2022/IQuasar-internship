  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label study assessing the 24-hour IOP patterns using TF in&#xD;
      patients undergoing anti-VEGF injection for the treatment of neovascular AMD (age related&#xD;
      macular degeneration). The study will be proposed to patients with AMD and patients with AMD&#xD;
      and concomitant open angle glaucoma (OAG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two stages. In both stages, patients will remain ambulatory&#xD;
      and will be encouraged to follow a schedule as close to their usual lifestyle as possible,&#xD;
      with the exception of particular activities such as caffeine intake, playing wind&#xD;
      instruments, yoga and strenuous exercise. A patient diary will be distributed for the capture&#xD;
      of patient activities during the TF pattern recording. Upon completion of each session, the&#xD;
      CLS (contact lens sensor) will be removed and a final ophthalmic examination will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage of the study, 20 patients with neovascular AMD with an IOP in the normal&#xD;
      range and no concomitant glaucoma will be recruited. After having signed and dated the&#xD;
      patient informed consent form, patients will undergo an initial ophthalmic examination. One&#xD;
      eye will be selected for the study. If both eyes are eligible, the study eye will be selected&#xD;
      in random manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 20 AMD patients will receive two 24-hour recording sessions (S) with the TF CLS, at&#xD;
      monthly interval. In the first session (S1) anti-VEGF injection will be carried out according&#xD;
      to the study center standard protocol. For the second 24-hour TF recording session (S2),&#xD;
      patients will be randomly distributed into three groups. Group A, consisting of 5 patients,&#xD;
      will receive anti-VEGF injection with a different anti-VEGF substance as compared to S1.&#xD;
      Group B, also consisting of 5 patients, will receive anti-VEGF without sclerotomy occlusion&#xD;
      after injection as compared to S1. Finally, group C, including 10 patients, will receive&#xD;
      anti-VEGF in a different dose (injection volume) as compared to S1. The randomization ratio&#xD;
      between groups A, B and C is 1:1:2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study duration for an eligible patient in the first stage of this study is&#xD;
      limited to 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If in the first stage of this study an injection protocol is identified that provokes&#xD;
      significantly lesser elevation on the TF pattern, the alternative injection protocol will be&#xD;
      evaluated against the current standard protocol. For the second stage, 30 patients of whom 15&#xD;
      with neovascular AMD and 15 with neovascular AMD and concomitant OAG will be recruited. After&#xD;
      giving informed consent and confirmation of eligibility, all patients will receive two&#xD;
      24-hour TF CLS recording sessions (S3 and S4) at monthly interval, during which anti-VEGF&#xD;
      injection according to the standard and alternative protocol will be carried out in random&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study duration for a patient in the second stage of the study is limited to 5&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been planned to recruit 20 eligible patients in the first stage within 12 weeks&#xD;
      from the date of initiation. The second stage will recruit 30 patients within 16 weeks. Hence&#xD;
      the overall study duration from the first patient accrued into the study until last patient&#xD;
      out equates to about 33 weeks. Allowing for a database lock within 4 weeks of study&#xD;
      completion, a preliminary statistical report on the primary efficacy endpoint is foreseen&#xD;
      within 2 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
