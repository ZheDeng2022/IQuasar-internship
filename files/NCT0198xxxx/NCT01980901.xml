  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Post-Approval Study (PAS) will evaluate the &quot;real world&quot; data on the Ovation™/Ovation&#xD;
      Prime™ Abdominal Stent Graft System along with the long-term data collected from the IDE&#xD;
      cohort to monitor the long-term safety and effectiveness of the device.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the long term safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Ovation™/Ovation Prime™ Abdominal Stent Graft System for the endovascular treatment of&#xD;
      infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms in a post-approval environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical objective of the study is to evaluate the long term safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      the Ovation™/Ovation Prime™ Abdominal Stent Graft System assessed at 5 years through freedom&#xD;
      from Aneurysm-Related Mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will evaluate the physician training program for modifications based&#xD;
      on IDE and post-approval experience.&#xD;
