  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how a single dose of sildenafil cream (SST-6006) is&#xD;
      absorbed and eliminated by the body, with and without the use of a condom, compared to a&#xD;
      single oral sildenafil dose and to evaluate the safety of sildenafil cream.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Willing and able to sign and date the written informed consent form (ICF) before any&#xD;
             study-specific screening procedures are performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Men between the ages of 18 to 55 years, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body mass index (BMI = weight [kg]/height [m]2) between 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive&#xD;
             and body weight of at least 50 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Nonsmoker or past smoker who has been abstinent for 6 months before study Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have a high probability for compliance with and completion of the study, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Healthy as determined by the investigator based on medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, and a normal 12-lead&#xD;
             ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Resting supine systolic blood pressure between 90 and 140 mmHg and resting supine&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure between 50 and 90 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must be able to achieve a successful erection&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence or history of any disorder that may prevent the successful completion of the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic,&#xD;
             genitourinary, or psychiatric disease, or other unstable medical condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening&#xD;
             arrhythmia within 6 months prior to study Day 1, or a history of coronary disease&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Subjects with retinitis pigmentosa and subjects with sickle cell anemia or related&#xD;
             anemias, even if they feel clinically well at the time of screening. Subjects with&#xD;
             retinitis pigmentosa will be identified by specifically asking whether they have the&#xD;
             condition, if there are visual signs and symptoms of the condition (including&#xD;
             questioning subjects as to whether they have difficulty seeing at night or in low&#xD;
             light, and if they have any visual field deficits that indicate a loss of peripheral&#xD;
             or central vision), or if there is a family history&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with anatomical deformations of the penis such as angulation, cavernosal&#xD;

          6. History of orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension present at the screening&#xD;
             visit, defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure greater than 20 mm Hg and a drop&#xD;
             in diastolic blood pressure greater than 10 mm Hg with a change in position from&#xD;
             supine to standing&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A history of erectile dysfunction or a prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;

             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the test article&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Acute disease state (eg, nausea, vomiting, fever, or diarrhea) within 7 days before&#xD;
             study Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of drug abuse within 1 year before study Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of alcoholism within 1 year before study Day 1, admitted alcohol abuse, or&#xD;
             average consumption of more than 2 standard units of alcohol per day (a standard unit&#xD;
             equals 12 ounces of beer, 1Â½ ounces of 80-proof alcohol, or 6 ounces of wine)&#xD;
&#xD;

             prescription or OTC drugs at the direction of a health care provider, that provider&#xD;
             should be consulted before medications are stopped for the purposes of study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Positive serologic findings for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies (HIV),&#xD;
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibodies (HCV)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Positive findings of urine drug screen (eg, amphetamines, barbiturates,&#xD;
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, and opiates) or alcohol screen&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Participation in a clinical trial within 30 days before study Day 1&#xD;
