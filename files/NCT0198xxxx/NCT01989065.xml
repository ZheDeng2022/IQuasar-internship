      Outpatient childhood obesity treatment has limited efficacy. This study aims to improve the&#xD;
      health habits of parents of obese 5-12 year old children enrolled in the Duke Healthy&#xD;
      Lifestyles Program by delivering educational and supportive text messages to the parent's&#xD;
      mobile device.&#xD;

      Protocol Title Healthy Lifestyles Program for You (HLP4U): Augmenting childhood obesity&#xD;
      treatment through provider-to-parent text messaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance One in three children in the US are overweight or obese, a condition known to&#xD;
      increase the risk of adult obesity and chronic disease. Behavioral treatment of pediatric and&#xD;
      adolescent obesity is strongly recommended, and in research settings treatment has shown&#xD;
      efficacy in reduction of child body mass index (BMI) and improved long-term health outcomes.&#xD;
      However, clinical treatment models must operate within the constraints of the outpatient&#xD;
      practice, and are limited in their ability to deliver the same intensity of intervention or&#xD;
      outreach. Not surprisingly, clinic-based treatment of child obesity is less effective than in&#xD;
      research settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Motivational Interviewing&quot; (MI) has emerged as a promising clinical method for improving&#xD;
      health outcomes in childhood obesity treatment. &quot;Motivation&quot; is defined as an individual's&#xD;
      expressed intention to change, and is divided into three measurable elements: importance,&#xD;
      confidence, and readiness. The theoretical framework of MI focuses on the interpersonal&#xD;
      aspects of behavioral change between patient and provider. MI emphasizes provider empathy,&#xD;
      support for patient autonomy, exploring ambivalence and reinforcing change talk. Several&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that childhood obesity treatments that use MI effectively are more&#xD;
      likely to achieve improved child outcomes than those who do not. These outcomes include&#xD;
      decreased BMI,6 increased physical activity, and improvements in parental confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Healthy Lifestyles (HL) program is an AAP Stage 2-4 childhood obesity program3 located in&#xD;
      Durham, NC. Children with BMI above the 95th percentile are referred to HL by their primary&#xD;
      provider. The Healthy Lifestyles clinical protocol has been described elsewhere. In short,&#xD;
      children aged 22 years and under with BMI â‰¥ 95th percentile are referred by their primary&#xD;
      physician to the multidisciplinary HL clinic for treatment of obesity and related&#xD;
      co-morbidities. The intervention involves monthly visits for one year to meet with medical,&#xD;
      dietary, exercise and behavior specialists all certified in Motivational Interviewing.&#xD;
      Despite the comprehensive model, and despite consistent delivery of behavior change&#xD;
      counseling using motivational interviewing, the Healthy Lifestyles model does not lead to&#xD;
      significant decreases in body mass index. Less than 25% of patients who initially enroll&#xD;
      complete treatment. These outcomes are similar to other comprehensive child obesity programs&#xD;
      nationally. There is a clear need for effective treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rapidly evolving field of study is investigating the use of healthcare provider-to-text&#xD;
      messages to augment patient behavior change. Text messaging is attractive, in part, because&#xD;
      text penetrance to mixed ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic populations is high, and 80-81% of&#xD;
      sent messages are read with a mean response time of 6 minutes. Text messages as simple&#xD;
      reminders can lead to improvements in patient compliance with medications and immunizations.&#xD;
      Text messages targeting behaviors can decrease TV viewing time among young children when&#xD;
      texts are delivered to the parent. Text messages can also improve self-efficacy when they&#xD;
      offer encouragement, recognize the difficulty of change, and congratulate the patient on&#xD;
      change. To date, no studies have investigated the use of provider-to-parent text messages&#xD;
      utilizing MI theory to increase the effectiveness of childhood obesity treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A randomized, controlled, non-blinded clinical trial design will be utilized. The&#xD;
      study team will identify qualifying parents as they arrive for their child's first scheduled&#xD;
      clinic appointment to the Duke Healthy Lifestyles Program. The team has previously obtained&#xD;
      IRB approval to approach Healthy Lifestyles families who qualify for research studies&#xD;
      (Healthy Lifestyles Notification of Research, PRO00031251).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study interventions A trained research assistant will collect all measures as described&#xD;
      below, either through chart review or direct questioning of the parent. A registered nurse&#xD;
      will collect the food recall measure (USDA) and perform the 3-minute step test; both are in&#xD;
      accordance with current clinical protocol. Subjects will be randomized to the intervention or&#xD;
      control group using a random number generator (Excel, 2010). Subjects randomized to the&#xD;
      control group will receive usual care, which includes a lifestyle counseling visit,&#xD;
      educational materials, and goal-setting by a physician and dietician, with follow up in 1&#xD;
      month. Subjects randomized to the intervention group will receive usual care as above PLUS&#xD;
      daily text messages on their designated mobile device for four weeks. The content of the&#xD;
      messages will provide information to parents on general health behaviors and offer supportive&#xD;
      guidance. Text messages will be delivered through the use of an application (GoogleVoice)&#xD;
      that is accessible to the investigator on a mobile or web-based system. The text message will&#xD;
      be delivered directly to the parent's message inbox, and does not require the parent to&#xD;
      download any software or applications. Patients may opt-out at any time by replying STOP to a&#xD;
      text message. Rules for texting and opt-out instructions will be provided in writing.&#xD;
      Subjects will be permitted to respond to the PI text. Subjects will be informed that the PI&#xD;
      is not able to answer any medical, appointment, or treatment questions, and if asked, will&#xD;
      reply with the office phone number for appropriate triage. An appointment reminder for the&#xD;
      follow up visit will be texted to both intervention and control groups 2 days prior to the&#xD;
      scheduled visit. Subjects will repeat a subset of measures at the time of presentation for&#xD;
      care at the HL clinic at the follow up visit, or if they do not present for care, will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone to complete the follow up measures.&#xD;
