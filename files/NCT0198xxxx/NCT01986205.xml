    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether 40 hyperbaric oxygen sessions has effect on&#xD;
      long-term symptoms after brain injury. This study will enroll 90 individuals with persistent&#xD;
      problems 6 months to 10 years after a brain injury. These individuals will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either oxygen or air in a pressurized hyperbaric chamber. Participants will receive&#xD;
      40 daily hyperbaric chamber sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a series of tests and questionnaires before they begin their chamber&#xD;
      sessions, after they complete 40 sessions, and 6 months after they joined the study. These&#xD;
      tests include computer-based and pencil-and-paper questionnaires and thinking tests, brain&#xD;
      imaging, a neurological examination, and an eye exam. Participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      provide blood for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 6-month tests are complete, all participants will receive 40 hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
      sessions, then undergo the same tests at 9 months and 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind study with a subsequent open-label&#xD;
      intervention period to explore whether a course of hyperbaric oxygen can ameliorate&#xD;
      persistent symptoms after brain injury. In this study, adult men and women with persistent&#xD;
      symptoms 6 months to 10 years after injury will be randomized to receive 40 hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
      sessions (100% oxygen at 1.5 atmospheres absolute, 60 minutes door-to-door) or sham chamber&#xD;
      sessions (room air chamber excursion at near-ambient pressure, 60 minutes door-to-door).&#xD;
      Chamber sessions will be provided Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, and participants&#xD;
      will have up to 12 weeks to complete their 40 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated before the chamber sessions, at 13 weeks, and at 6 months.&#xD;
      Assessments include self-administered questionnaires, neuropsychological function, a brief&#xD;
      neurological examination, electroencephalography, visual function tests, and a&#xD;
      neuro-optometry evaluation. These outcome tools will measure symptoms and deficit at the time&#xD;
      of enrollment and subsequent evaluations, and provide insight into whether hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
      can play a role in recovery from brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participants have completed their 6 month evaluations, they will enter an open&#xD;
      intervention group, receiving 40 hyperbaric sessions at 1.5 atmospheres absolute for 60&#xD;
      minutes. Participants will have up to 12 weeks to complete these sessions. Participants will&#xD;
      be evaluated after the second set of chamber sessions (at 9 months and again at 12 months).&#xD;
      Individuals will then be assessed annually until study closure (12-month follow-up of the&#xD;
      last enrolled participant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide blood for long-term storage of serum, plasma, and DNA&#xD;
      for future investigations, including apolipoprotein E genotype.&#xD;
