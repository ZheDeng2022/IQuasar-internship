  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical validation study is aimed at establishing a birch pollen challenge in the&#xD;
      Fraunhofer ECC in patients allergic to birch pollen. The symptoms will be recorded on a&#xD;
      validated symptom score as Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), allowing to determine whether&#xD;
      the challenge is dose dependent and reproducible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a mono-center, single-blind, placebo controlled study assessing nasal symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with allergic rhinitis upon exposure to birch pollen in an environmental challenge&#xD;
      chamber during a 4 hour challenge period with different concentrations of birch pollen versus&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with allergic rhinitis to birch pollen will be recruited from the Fraunhofer ITEM&#xD;
      database or the surrounding communities. After the screening evaluation eligible subjects&#xD;
      will undergo six challenge sessions in the environmental challenge chamber at intervals of at&#xD;
      least one week. In order to determine dose response, the concentration of birch pollen in the&#xD;
      atmosphere of the challenge chamber will be varied from 1000 birch pollen/m³ in the first&#xD;
      period, 2000 birch pollen/m³ in the second period, 4000 birch pollen/m³ in the third period,&#xD;
      8000 birch pollen/m³in the fourth period to 0 birch pollen/m³ (only air) in the fifth period.&#xD;
      In order to investigate reproducibility in addition to dose response, a challenge with one&#xD;
      concentration previously used will be repeated in period six. The dose will be chosen by the&#xD;
      Investigator according to the observed nasal symptoms. According to previous experience with&#xD;
      grass pollen (Dactylis glomerata) the target symptom level for TNSS is around 6. Therefore,&#xD;
      the dose to study reproducibility will be chosen where the average mean TNSS of the last two&#xD;
      hours will be closest to six. If two doses are equally close, the higher dose will be chosen&#xD;
      because this will allow to optimize the particle monitoring technique. In this regard, it is&#xD;
      better to have a high particle concentration in order to separate specific particles from&#xD;
      unspecific particles (originating from the subjects themselves).&#xD;

             non-smokers for at least the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic rhinitis to birch pollen. Subjects with mild intermittent asthma&#xD;
             controlled with occasional use of as-needed short-acting beta-agonists can be&#xD;
             included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal lung function (FEV1 ≥ 80 % predicted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive skin prick test for birch&#xD;
