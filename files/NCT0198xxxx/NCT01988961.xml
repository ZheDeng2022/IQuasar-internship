      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of a subset of the length-109 probe set&#xD;
      panel (a genetic test) in predicting response to golimumab treatment in participants with&#xD;
      moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, golimumab, belongs to a group of medicines known as tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      (TNF) inhibitors and is approved in the United States, European Union, and Canada for&#xD;
      treatment of UC. Studies have shown that people respond differently to treatment with TNF&#xD;
      inhibitors and furthermore, some people may not actually respond to treatment. Tests which&#xD;
      could predict the likelihood of response to golimumab prior to treatment would be of benefit&#xD;
      to people with UC. This is an open label (physicians and participants know the identity of&#xD;
      the assigned treatment), multicenter study to evaluate the accuracy of a genetic test (a&#xD;
      subset of the length-109 probe set panel) in predicting response to golimumab treatment in&#xD;
      patients with moderately to severely active UC. The study will consist of a screening phase,&#xD;
      an open label treatment phase (Week 0 to Week 50), and a follow-up visit at Week 58. A subset&#xD;
      of the length-109 probe set panel will be tested on samples obtained from colonic biopsies&#xD;
      taken prior to treatment with golimumab for all participants at screening. All participants&#xD;
      enrolled in the study will receive subcutaneous golimumab from Week 0 to Week 50; at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator, participants will be given the option to self-administer&#xD;
      golimumab from Week 6 onwards. Blood and fecal samples will be taken at various time points&#xD;
      during the study; colonic biopsies will be taken at screening, Week 6, and Week 30; and&#xD;
      endoscopies will be performed at Week 0, Week 6, and Week 30. The study duration for each&#xD;
      participant is expected to be approximately 58 weeks. Participant safety will be monitored&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;

    <description>The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve is a mathematical model used to measure the accuracy of a test. The accuracy of a subset of the length-109 probe set panel (a genetic test administered at screening) is being evaluated in terms of its ability to predict mucosal healing at Week 6. An area of 1.0 represents a perfect test; an area of 0.5 represents a test that is no better at predicting mucosal healing than &quot;flipping a coin&quot;. Areas above 0.5 represent increasing accuracy.</description>
