  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a highly prevalent disorder in those recovering from alcoholism. It has been&#xD;
      associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as an increased risk of relapse back&#xD;
      to the drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), a non-pharmacologic approach is the&#xD;
      recommended standard of care for insomnia. Some preliminary studies have shown that CBT-I may&#xD;
      be efficacious for insomnia during recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study proposes to use a standard 8-week CBT-I to treat the insomnia with a&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up at 3- and 6-months (after treatment). Further, it will evaluate if&#xD;
      an improvement in the insomnia is associated with an improvement in the underling alcoholism&#xD;
      and the daytime functioning. On an exploratory basis, the association of a first-degree&#xD;
      family history of alcoholism with the insomnia severity and treatment response will also be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will be Veterans with alcohol dependence during their first year of&#xD;
      recovery, 21-65 years old, with ISI total score of 15 or more, medically and psychiatrically&#xD;
      stable, and without dependence on other drugs (with the exception of nicotine and marijuana).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will consist of a single-blind trial comparing CBT-I against a behavioral&#xD;
      placebo intervention (Quasi-Desensitization Therapy, QDT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments conducted over a month will comprehensively evaluate for the addiction,&#xD;
      psychiatric, sleep and medical disorders, as well as for a family history of alcohol&#xD;
      dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subject is seen to be eligible for the study he will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      CBT-I or the QDT arm, and treated for the next weeks. The primary outcome measure for&#xD;
      insomnia will be the Insomnia Severity Index. The primary outcome measure for alcohol&#xD;
      dependence will be the percent days abstinent (on the Time Line Follow Back measure, TLFB),&#xD;
      and the daytime symptoms will be assessed using the Short Form-12 item scale (SF-12, for self&#xD;
      reported well-being), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, for depressive symptoms), and the&#xD;
      State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, for anxiety symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the treatment phase, subjects will be followed up 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
      later, to assess for changes over time in their insomnia, alcohol use, and daytime&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index - Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks, 3 months post-treatment, and 6 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): This 7-item (0-4 Likert scales) measure yields a total score of 28. The norms for the scale are as follows: 0-7 represents no clinically significant insomnia; 8-14 represents sub threshold insomnia; 15-21 represents clinical insomnia (moderate severity); 21-28 represents clinical insomnia (severe). The scale provides a measure of severity of insomnia (overall), a measure of insomnia subtype, a measure of the diurnal effects of insomnia, and a measure of sleep &quot;satisfaction&quot;. The ISI will be completed at baseline and for all the subsequent study-related visits.</description>

    <measure>Change in Percent Days Abstinent (PDA) on the Time Line Follow Back Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks, 3 months post-treatment and 6-months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Time Line Follow Back measure (TLFB): The TLFB provides assessment of drinking using a calendar format for the number of standard alcoholic beverages consumed per day. A standard drink, as defined by the National Institutes of Health, is 12 oz of regular beer, 5 oz of regular wine, or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits (e.g. whiskey). Numerous indices may be derived from the TLFB, such as the Percent Days Abstinent (PDA) proposed in this study. The PDA is derived as the percentage of days an individual reports being abstinent from alcohol within a given assessment time period.</description>

    <description>Eight Session CBT-I: Cognitive Behavioral therapy is conducted in 8 individual sessions with the study clinician. Session 1 serves as an orientation. No active treatment is delivered at this time. Sessions 2 &amp; 3 are used to deliver the three main components of the intervention which are Sleep Restriction (SRT), Stimulus Control, and Sleep Hygiene. All but two of the remaining sessions are dedicated to the titration of total sleep time and to ensuring patient adherence. One session (session 5) entails the delivery of a specific form of cognitive therapy. The final session (session 8) is used to engage in a relapse-prevention didactic, i.e., to review first, how insomnia becomes chronic and second, the strategies that are likely to abort an extended episode of insomnia.</description>

    <description>This form of placebo therapy has been commonly used in prior studies investigating behavioral interventions for insomnia. The therapist presents the QDT as a means to eliminate &quot;conditioned arousal,&quot; occurring after nocturnal arousal using 8 sessions on a weekly basis. The therapist initially helps the subject to develop a chronological 12-item hierarchy of commonly practiced activities on awakening at night, like opening eyes and clock watching. As a next step, the subject develops 6 imaginable scenes of himself/herself engaged in neutral activities like reading a newspaper. The therapist then helps the subject pair the neutral scenes with the items from the 12-item hierarchy, which is then practiced by the subject 2 hours before bedtime.</description>

        <description>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): This 7-item (0-4 Likert scales) measure yields a total score of 28. The norms for the scale are as follows: 0-7 represents no clinically significant insomnia; 8-14 represents sub threshold insomnia; 15-21 represents clinical insomnia (moderate severity); 21-28 represents clinical insomnia (severe). The scale provides a measure of severity of insomnia (overall), a measure of insomnia subtype, a measure of the diurnal effects of insomnia, and a measure of sleep &quot;satisfaction&quot;. The ISI will be completed at baseline and for all the subsequent study-related visits.</description>

            <description>Eight Session CBT-I: Cognitive Behavioral therapy is conducted in 8 individual sessions with the study clinician. Session 1 serves as an orientation. No active treatment is delivered at this time. Sessions 2 &amp; 3 are used to deliver the three main components of the intervention which are Sleep Restriction (SRT), Stimulus Control, and Sleep Hygiene. All but two of the remaining sessions are dedicated to the titration of total sleep time and to ensuring patient adherence. One session (session 5) entails the delivery of a specific form of cognitive therapy. The final session (session 8) is used to engage in a relapse-prevention didactic, i.e., to review first, how insomnia becomes chronic and second, the strategies that are likely to abort an extended episode of insomnia.&#xD;

            <description>This form of placebo therapy has been commonly used in prior studies investigating behavioral interventions for insomnia. The therapist presents the QDT as a means to eliminate &quot;conditioned arousal,&quot; occurring after nocturnal arousal using 8 sessions on a weekly basis. The therapist initially helps the subject to develop a chronological 12-item hierarchy of commonly practiced activities on awakening at night, like opening eyes and clock watching. As a next step, the subject develops 6 imaginable scenes of himself/herself engaged in neutral activities like reading a newspaper. The therapist then helps the subject pair the neutral scenes with the items from the 12-item hierarchy, which is then practiced by the subject 2 hours before bedtime.&#xD;

        <description>Time Line Follow Back measure (TLFB): The TLFB provides assessment of drinking using a calendar format for the number of standard alcoholic beverages consumed per day. A standard drink, as defined by the National Institutes of Health, is 12 oz of regular beer, 5 oz of regular wine, or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits (e.g. whiskey). Numerous indices may be derived from the TLFB, such as the Percent Days Abstinent (PDA) proposed in this study. The PDA is derived as the percentage of days an individual reports being abstinent from alcohol within a given assessment time period.</description>
