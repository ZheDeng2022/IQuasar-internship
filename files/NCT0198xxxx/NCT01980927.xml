  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small number of chiropractors, who align only the atlas C-1, or &quot;top&quot; vertebra in the&#xD;
      spine, practice the National Upper Cervical Chiropractic Association (NUCCA) atlas correction&#xD;
      procedure. This procedure uses a precise, non-invasive, gentle touch technique to correct&#xD;
      misalignment of the atlas. Although NUCCA practitioners have long used this procedure in the&#xD;
      treatment of headache, it has not been formally studied using clinical trials. There is some&#xD;
      data indicating that NUCCA correction can increase intracranial compliance. This intracranial&#xD;
      compliance can be measured by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study before and then after&#xD;
      a NUCCA procedure. In this study, the investigators hope to show that the correction of an&#xD;
      atlas misalignment will increase intracranial compliance in subjects with migraine.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 18-65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be naive to Upper Cervical Chiropractic care. Other forms of chiropractic care in the&#xD;
             past are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have migraine with or without aura.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have between 10-26 headache days per month over the last 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have at least 4 separate headache episodes per month, with episodes separated by at&#xD;
             least 4 hours of painfree time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have at least 8 days per month with pain of levels greater than or equal to 4/10 for&#xD;
             part of the day, or have attacks successfully treated with migraine specific&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be candidates suitable for NUCCA therapeutic intervention because of atlas&#xD;
             displacement as assessed by NUCCA investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects on acceptable pharmacological prophylaxis must either remain on a stable dose&#xD;
             throughout the study, or stop the prophylactic medication one month before entering&#xD;
             the baseline period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the investigator would&#xD;
             make the subject unsuitable for enrolment, because of inability to comply with study&#xD;
             requirements or possible confounding of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Headache on more than 26 days per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute medication overuse as defined by the International Classification of Headache&#xD;
             Disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe cervical spine degeneration as assessed by cervical spine x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia or any condition that contraindicates an MRI scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, brain surgery, or other&#xD;
             central nervous system disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other chronic pain disorder which might interfere with headache assessment or study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of significant hypo- or hypertension as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject on a beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, or other medication which the&#xD;
             investigator considers might alter cerebral vascular regulation. Triptans are allowed,&#xD;
             but must not be taken within 24 hours (48 hours for frovatriptan) before an MRI study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of substance abuse or dependence within 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in a research study or within the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any spinal chiropractic care outside of the study protocol is prohibited during the&#xD;
             baseline and treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of botulinum A within 4 months of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
