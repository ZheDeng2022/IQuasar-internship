  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain is a major challenge for patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (HSCT) and is related to more fatigue, more physical disability, poorer quality of&#xD;
      life, and poorer medical adherence. There is a need to examine strategies for managing pain&#xD;
      in HSCT patients that can complement existing analgesic regimens. Strong evidence suggests&#xD;
      that cognitive and behavioral factors play an important role in HSCT patients' ability to&#xD;
      manage their pain. The investigator has found that HSCT patients having low levels of&#xD;
      confidence (i.e., self-efficacy) in their ability to control pain and high use of maladaptive&#xD;
      coping strategies (i.e., pain catastrophizing) experience increased pain and disability. A&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention that modifies patients' cognitive and behavioral pain coping&#xD;
      strategies may benefit HSCT patients. Protocols, particularly Pain Coping Skills Training&#xD;
      (PCST), have been developed for reducing pain and improving quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      persistent pain. However, HSCT patients with persistent pain face a number of unique&#xD;
      challenges that must be considered when applying a PCST protocol. The investigator proposes&#xD;
      to develop and test a Mobile Health Pain Coping Skills (mPCST) protocol for HSCT patients&#xD;
      with persistent pain to meet the challenges of HSCT patients with pain as they transition&#xD;
      from hospital based care to their home environment. The first aim of this study is to use an&#xD;
      iterative development model to design a mPCST intervention protocol for HSCT patients that&#xD;
      targets increasing self-efficacy for pain control and decreasing pain catastrophizing. The&#xD;
      study team will use focus groups with patients and HSCT providers to guide development along&#xD;
      with user testing with HSCT patients having pain. The second aim of this study is to use a&#xD;
      small randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and engagement&#xD;
      in the developed mPCST protocol. The third aim is to obtain an estimate of the effect size of&#xD;
      the developed mPCST protocol on decreased pain, pain disability, physical disability, and&#xD;
      adherence to post-transplant lifestyle recommendations impacted by pain when compared to a&#xD;
      standard care control condition. Proposed innovative features of the mPCST protocol that will&#xD;
      be developed include: extensive input from PCST and HSCT experts and HSCT patients with pain;&#xD;
      an initial session prior to discharge with subsequent sessions occurring at home via&#xD;
      video-conferencing; incorporation of strategies to decrease the impact of pain on adherence&#xD;
      to critical post-transplant lifestyle recommendations; a real-time daily assessment system&#xD;
      with subsequent tailored feedback. If the developed mPCST protocol demonstrates feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, engagement, and promising effect sizes to influence pain and other indices of&#xD;
      quality of life, a larger NIH grant will be sought to examine this protocol in a larger&#xD;
      sample of patients, test the protocol against an active treatment, and investigate a broader&#xD;
      array of outcomes (e.g., medication adherence). This mPCST protocol could also be examined in&#xD;
      other patient populations with pain facing similar challenges (e.g., live far from medical&#xD;
      center, travel limitations).&#xD;
