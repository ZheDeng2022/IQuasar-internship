    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT), to&#xD;
      determine if six month supplementation of olive oil can improve the health of the blood&#xD;
      vessels and improve long term health of the heart and blood vessels, in patients requiring&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).&#xD;
