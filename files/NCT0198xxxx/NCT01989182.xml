  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled study being conducted in China to&#xD;
      evaluate improvement of lung function after treatment with the Spiration Valve System as&#xD;
      compared to medical management in the control group. The control group will be evaluated in&#xD;
      the same manner as the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Spiration Valve is a small, umbrella-shaped, one-way valve that is placed inside the&#xD;
      airways of one lung. It is used to redirect air from the less healthy to the more healthy&#xD;
      parts of the lung. This helps to reduce over-inflation and may improve overall lung function&#xD;
      and quality of life for people living with emphysema.&#xD;
