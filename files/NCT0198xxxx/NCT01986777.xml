    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, study testing whether LDX improves cognitive&#xD;
      function and EF in 20 postmenopausal women who report onset of cognitive difficulties after&#xD;
      oophorectomy (with or without subsequent chemo/adjunctive therapy). Brain imaging is included&#xD;
      at critical time points to obtain objective data regarding effects of LDX as well as&#xD;
      potential predictors of resilience in the face of oophorectomy.&#xD;

      Participants will be asked to undergo three brain-imaging scans throughout the course of the&#xD;
      study. Once they are deemed eligible for participation based on two assessment visits, they&#xD;
      will be scheduled for their baseline test day. On this they, they will be asked to under a&#xD;
      series of cognitive tests following by a brain-imaging scan. They will then take the first&#xD;
      dose of either the LDX or placebo, wait for 3 hours and then undergo another brain-imaging&#xD;
      scan to assess acute changes to memory/cognition due to the study drug. They will then come&#xD;
      in for three 30-minute check-in visits during weeks 2, 4 and 6 on the study drug. They will&#xD;
      be asked to undergo a final scan and series of cognitive tasks during weeks 8-10 on the study&#xD;
      drug. They will then be discharged from active study participation. All participants,&#xD;
      regardless of randomization, will be offered a consultation with the study MD and optional&#xD;
      prescription for 4-weeks of treatment with LDX.&#xD;
