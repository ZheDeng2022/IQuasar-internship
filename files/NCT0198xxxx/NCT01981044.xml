  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, single-arm, post-market on-label clinical study of a 510(k)-cleared&#xD;
      device. Subjects will be followed for 24 months post SERI placement during index hernia&#xD;
      repair surgery. Study visits will occur at screening, from SERI implantation through hospital&#xD;
      discharge and then post SERI implantation at month(s) 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 for all&#xD;
      enrolled subjects.&#xD;
