  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) and Moxifloxacin (a commonly used antibiotic) have&#xD;
      both been shown independently to affect heart activity in healthy volunteers as recorded by&#xD;
      ECG. i.e. Both cause prolongation of the QTc interval which is a measure of the time between&#xD;
      the start of the Qwave and the end of the Twave during a heartbeat cycle. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators want to find out whether moxifloxacin and hyperglycaemia cause QTc prolongation&#xD;
      in Type 1 diabetic patients. The investigators also want to assess whether C-peptide (a&#xD;
      fragment if insulin normally found in the blood but not present in the blood of Type 1&#xD;
      diabetics) has the opposite effect on heart activity i.e it shortens the QTc interval will&#xD;
      reverse the effect of QTc prolongation in Type 1 diabetes as this may be useful for&#xD;
      preventing 'dead in bed' syndrome also known as 'Sudden Cardiac Death' which is more common&#xD;
      in diabetic patients compared to healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators previous research (Taubel et al., 2013) has shown that in healthy&#xD;
      individuals glucose by itself can prolong (with C-peptide antagonising the effects) the QT&#xD;
      interval, which has long been used as a clinical index of the duration of ventricular&#xD;
      repolarisation. This observation warrants serious attention because it suggests that high&#xD;
      glucose levels by themselves may be pro-arrhythmogenic. To investigate whether glucose has an&#xD;
      effect on cardiac repolarisation, it would be advantageous to test this in an environment&#xD;
      uncomplicated by C-peptide. In order to elucidate the effects of glucose on the QTc in the&#xD;
      absence of C-peptide, the investigators will use diabetic patients who are no longer able to&#xD;
      release endogenous C-peptide. This will allow better understanding to whether (1) the well&#xD;
      established QTc prolongation caused by moxifloxacin is exaggerated by elevated levels of&#xD;
      blood glucose, which would be important for evaluating the risk in diabetic patients using an&#xD;
      IKr blocking drug such as moxifloxacin, and (2) to investigate whether C-peptide substitution&#xD;
      will reverse or attenuate the effect in the presence of moxifloxacin. Using the conditions of&#xD;
      a formal TQT study, the investigators would also want to confirm the QTc prolonging effects&#xD;
      described in Gordin et al. (2008) and whether in this setting C-Peptide substitution will&#xD;
      reverse or attenuate the glucose effect on QTc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a phase I, single centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, open-label, crossover&#xD;
      study designed to evaluate the effect of glucose and C-peptide on cardiac repolarisation&#xD;
      using a hyperglycaemic clamp and a single 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin as a positive control&#xD;
      in non-elderly male and female patients with type I diabetes. The results from this study&#xD;
      will form the basis for decisions for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP and applicable&#xD;
      regulatory requirements including EU GMP requirements for investigational medicinal&#xD;
      product(s) (IMPs).&#xD;
