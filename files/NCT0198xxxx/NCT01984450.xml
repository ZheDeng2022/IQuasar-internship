      Study Title: A study to compare two articular cartilage repair techniques in the knee joint:&#xD;
      Autologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis (ACIC) Vs. Mesenchymal Cell Induced Chondrogenesis&#xD;
      (MCIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: We start with the hypothesis that both treatments are equally effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design: This is a prospective study. The participating patients will be divided into&#xD;
      two groups, each group receiving either one of the treatment modalities. This study will not&#xD;
      be randomised or blinded. Both procedures will be done at the Spire Alexandra Hospital by&#xD;
      Professor A. A Shetty, who is one half of the team that devised both techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Participants: All participants will be from patients attending Professor Shetty's&#xD;
      clinic at the Spire Alexandra Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Sample Size: 50 patients in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up duration: The participating patients will be followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years following the surgery by visits to the clinic and&#xD;
      assessed clinically. The surgical outcomes will be measured by by IKDC, KOOS and Lysholm&#xD;
      scores; cartilage growth will be measured by the MOCART score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Trial Period: Two to three years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To establish superiority, if any, of either procedure over the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: At the end of the 2 year follow up for all participating patients.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Articular cartilage repair in the knee is aimed at young patients with area(s) of&#xD;
      cartilage loss and no deformity of the knee. These patients aren't indicated for a knee&#xD;
      replacement. Articular cartilage repair leads to improvement of symptoms of pain, locking and&#xD;
      function. Traditionally, articular cartilage repair has always involved exposing the entire&#xD;
      knee joint with an arthrotomy. This, though effective, would lead to a large scar, longer&#xD;
      hospital stay, longer rehabilitation and its associated complications. Also, the use of Bone&#xD;
      Marrow Aspirate Cells (BMAC) for the purpose of cartilage repair has long been debated with&#xD;
      both sides having valid arguments and good surgical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE: Both procedures in this study are performed in one stage, arthroscopically and as&#xD;
      day case procedures, which offers minimal scarring and quicker recovery. This automatically&#xD;
      confers a significant advantage over the traditional surgical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To correct the articular cartilage defect, the ACIC method requires autologous Atellocollagen&#xD;
      (a protein based structure), while the MCIC method uses concentrated BMAC taken from the&#xD;
      patient's iliac crest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both procedures have shown encouraging results in terms of pain relief, cartilage growth and&#xD;
      improved function. Since one technique utilises a protein based reagent and the other&#xD;
      involves mesenchymal cells, this study aims to ascertain if either technique is superior to&#xD;
      the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This study aims to compare two techniques of articular cartilage repair in the&#xD;
      knee, namely Autologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis (ACIC) and Mesenchymal Cell Induced&#xD;
      Chondrogenesis (MCIC). The principal objective of is to ascertain and assess the superiority,&#xD;
      if any, of either surgical technique over the other. The superiority will be assessed with by&#xD;
      the certain scoring systems (IKDC, KOOS, Lysholm and MOCART) measured pre- and&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on which procedure the patient chooses to have, they will be allotted to either the&#xD;
      ACIC or the MCIC group. The patient is followed up in the clinic at the Spire Alexandra&#xD;
      Hospital at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years following the surgery&#xD;
      and their progress is documented by questionnaires and clinical examination. MRI scans are&#xD;
      done at one and two years to assess the extent of cartilage growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL TECHNIQUES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis (ACIC):&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACIC is a single stage arthroscopic procedure. It is done as a day case? procedure and the&#xD;
      patient is admitted a few hours before the procedure. The anaesthetic method depends is the&#xD;
      Anaesthesiologist's prerogative and depends on the patient's general health. Under sterile&#xD;
      conditions in an operating theatre, the arthroscopic instruments are introduced inside the&#xD;
      knee joint. As assessed previously by MRI scans, the area of cartilage defect is debrided by&#xD;
      curettage, shaving and burring and then microfractured. The ACIC method utilises autologous&#xD;
      Atellocollagen, a protein based structure, mixed with thrombin and fibrinogen to form a gel&#xD;
      which coats the area with a cartilage defect. The entry ports are then closed and the knee is&#xD;
      covered with a sterile dressing. The patient is transferred to the surgical recovery ward&#xD;
      and, when medically stable, then transferred to their room on the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from the hospital, the patient is advised partial weight bearing on the&#xD;
      operated leg for 6 weeks after the surgery. They also undergo 5 sessions of physiotherapy.&#xD;
      Surgical clips and sutures are removed at 2 weeks following the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal Cell Induced Chondrogenesis (MCIC):&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCIC is a single stage arthroscopic procedure. It is done as a day case? procedure and the&#xD;
      patient is admitted a few hours before the procedure. The anaesthetic method depends is the&#xD;
      Anaesthesiologist's prerogative and depends on the patient's general health. Under sterile&#xD;
      conditions in an operating theatre, the arthroscopic instruments are introduced inside the&#xD;
      knee joint. As assessed previously by MRI scans, the area of cartilage defect is debrided by&#xD;
      curettage, shaving and burring and then microfractured. The MCIC method involves aspiration&#xD;
      of Bone Marrow Aspirate Cells (BMAC) from the patient's iliac crest (hip bone) and&#xD;
      concentrating the cells by centrifugation in the operation theatre itself. The BMAC are then&#xD;
      mixed with thrombin and fibrinogen to form a gel which coats the area with a cartilage&#xD;
      defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from the hospital, the patient is advised partial weight bearing on the&#xD;
      operated leg for 6 weeks after the surgery. They also undergo 5 sessions of physiotherapy.&#xD;
      Surgical clips and sutures are removed at 2 weeks following the surgery.&#xD;
