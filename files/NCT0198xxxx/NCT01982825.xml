      Tobacco use is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Because smokers who quit by age&#xD;
      30 have cancer death risk similar to non-smokers, promoting cessation early in life is&#xD;
      critical. U.S. colleges/universities, enrolling &gt;14 million students/year (40% of those aged&#xD;
      18 to 24), are an important venue to reach young adult smokers. While daily tobacco use in&#xD;
      the U.S. has declined to 18.1%, nondaily smoking (smoking on some days but not every day) is&#xD;
      increasing, particularly among young adults and African Americans. Moreover, young smokers&#xD;
      and nondaily smokers (half of young adult smokers), respectively, are less likely to seek&#xD;
      help in quitting; thus, innovative strategies are needed to assist cessation early in life,&#xD;
      particularly among those who may not be motivated to quit or seek help. Unfortunately, no&#xD;
      research has focused on developing a cessation intervention that addresses a broad range of&#xD;
      smoking patterns (nondaily to daily smoking) or diverse campus settings among ethnically&#xD;
      diverse student populations. Web-based interventions offer promise in helping college&#xD;
      students to quit, given high rates of Internet use and web capacity to provide tailored&#xD;
      cessation messages. A novel approach to delivering cessation information via the web might be&#xD;
      to address broader lifestyle issues and apply market research strategies to identify market&#xD;
      segments of smokers (groups of people with similar interests, goals, values) in order to&#xD;
      target and engage these groups more effectively. Applying this strategy to an online&#xD;
      cessation intervention should enhance both intervention use and processing of intervention&#xD;
      messages, leading to greater abstinence rates. The investigators aim to: (1) develop and&#xD;
      refine a tailored web-based intervention for smoking cessation targeting college students&#xD;
      with a range of smoking levels; (2) test the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of the&#xD;
      intervention among college student smokers; and (3) determine the potential effect of the&#xD;
      intervention on smoking cessation, smoking level, quit attempts, and contextual factors.&#xD;

      Tobacco use is the leading cause of cancer death. Because smokers who quit by 30 have cancer&#xD;
      death risk similar to non-smokers, promoting cessation early in life is critical. U.S.&#xD;
      colleges/universities, enrolling &gt;14 million students/year (40% of those aged 18 to 24), are&#xD;
      an important venue to reach young adult smokers. While daily tobacco use in the U.S. has&#xD;
      declined to 18.1%, nondaily smoking (smoking on some days but not every day) is increasing,&#xD;
      particularly among young adults and African Americans. Moreover, young smokers and nondaily&#xD;
      smokers (half of young adult smokers9), respectively, are less likely to seek help in&#xD;
      quitting; thus, innovative strategies are needed to assist cessation early in life,&#xD;
      particularly among those who may not be motivated to quit or seek help. Unfortunately, no&#xD;
      research has focused on developing a cessation intervention that addresses a broad range of&#xD;
      smoking patterns (nondaily to daily smoking) or diverse campus settings among ethnically&#xD;
      diverse student populations. Web-based interventions offer promise in helping college&#xD;

      cessation messages. A novel approach to delivering cessation information might be to address&#xD;
      broader lifestyle issues and apply market research strategies such as those used by the&#xD;
      tobacco industry to identify market segments of smokers (groups of people with similar&#xD;
      interests, goals, values) in order to target and engage these groups more effectively.&#xD;
      Applying this strategy to an online cessation intervention should enhance both intervention&#xD;
      use and processing of intervention messages, leading to greater abstinence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: To develop and refine a tailored web-based intervention for smoking cessation&#xD;
           targeting young adults representing a range of sociodemographic backgrounds,&#xD;
           particularly including those from low SES and African American backgrounds, and a range&#xD;
           of smoking levels (i.e., nondaily, low-level smokers to daily, heavy smokers) attending&#xD;
           college.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To test the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of the intervention among a&#xD;
           sample of college student smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: To determine the potential effect of the intervention on smoking cessation,&#xD;
           smoking level, quit attempts, and contextual factors (e.g., mood, alcohol use, social&#xD;
           factors) among a sample of college student smokers from various backgrounds and smoking&#xD;
           patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be addressed through three phases. Phase 1 will involve the development of&#xD;
      the web-site infrastructure, securing incentives, developing website content (dramas,&#xD;
      stories), and developing the tailored feedback infrastructure. Phase 2 will involve expert&#xD;
      feedback, which will be integrated into the next program version. Phase 3 involves a 6-week&#xD;
      trial among a small sample of young adults at two college campuses (university;&#xD;
      community/technical college) in Georgia (N = 200). At end-of-intervention, we will assess&#xD;
      usability, acceptability, and feasibility of the program; smoking status and level; and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors related to smoking (e.g. alcohol use, mood). Assessments of smoking&#xD;
      status/level and psychosocial factors will also be conducted at 6 weeks post-intervention.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes in the trial are usability, acceptability, and feasibility&#xD;
      (self-reported and observed website utilization [check-in, activity]). Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include: (1) message processing (self-reported attention to messages, perceived relevance,&#xD;
      and other message use items);19 (2) 7-day and 30-day point prevalence abstinence at&#xD;
      end-of-treatment (6 weeks) and at 6-week follow-up (12 weeks) in order to appropriately&#xD;
      examine cessation among daily and nondaily smokers; (3) smoking level at 6 and 12 weeks; (4)&#xD;
      number of quit attempts since baseline; and (5) change in other contextual factors (mood,&#xD;
      alcohol use, social aspects).&#xD;

    <description>Bi-weekly (MTh) for 6 weeks, participants will receive an email asking them to report number of cigarettes smoked, alcoholic drinks, engagement in physical activity, and overall mood the two-three days before.

    <description>Control participants will receive bi-weekly emails (MTh) over 6 weeks but in the context of a standard smoking cessation website. Because we are primarily testing the check-ins, tailored feedback, and market research-based mini-drama and other web content, we feel that this control group will isolate the hypothesized active elements of our program.</description>
