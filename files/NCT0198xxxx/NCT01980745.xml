    <textblock>
      Autoimmune hepatitis is an autoimmune chronic liver disease whose treatment includes the use&#xD;
      of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly azathioprine, and corticosteroids. When properly&#xD;
      treated, patients have a good survival. One of the major problems related to its treatment is&#xD;
      the the high rate of relapses after stopping therapy that has lead to biochemical and&#xD;
      histological remissions, close to 80%. Many authors recommend continuous treatment throughout&#xD;
      life, resulting in the occurrence of many side effects. Chloroquine is a drug with&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties already used in the treatment of other extrahepatic autoimmune&#xD;
      liver diseases. There are some reports in the literature about its beneficial use in liver&#xD;
      diseases such as chronic hepatitis B, and a pilot study in patients with autoimmune&#xD;
      hepatitis, in which its use was associated with a 6.49 times lower risk of disease recurrence&#xD;
      when compared with patients in whom treatment was discontinued after remission. Our purpose&#xD;
      is to investigate, in a double-blind randomized trial with placebo, whether chloroquine&#xD;
      prevents the recurrence of AIH in patients with histological remission after discontinuation&#xD;
      of conventional treatment and to evaluate the occurrence of side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic disease with a progressive destruction of hepatic&#xD;
      parenchyma, leading to cirrhosis and high mortality in the absence of specific treatment. It&#xD;
      has been demonstrated that the treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine provides&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory improvement, reduction of histological inflammatory activity on liver&#xD;
      biopsy and an increased survival. The life expectancy of correctly treated patients can&#xD;
      approach that of age- and gender-matched controls. One of the features of AIH is the high&#xD;
      rate of recurrence after discontinuation of treatment in patients who achieved histological&#xD;
      remission. The chances of recurrence reach up to 50% at 6 months and 70% after one year, and&#xD;
      the rates of sustained remission, are limited to 10 to 15% in 5 years. Thus, most patients&#xD;
      require maintenance treatment to prevent recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chloroquine is a drug of the group of 4-aminoquinolines, synthetic derivatives of quinine and&#xD;
      constituent of the bark of the Cinchona tree. Chloroquine accumulates in tissues in&#xD;
      considerable amounts. In animals, from 200 to 700 times the plasma concentration can be found&#xD;
      in liver, spleen, kidneys and lungs. As a weak base, it accumulates intracellularly,&#xD;
      particularly in lysosomes with a consequent increase in pH within these organelles, which&#xD;
      could contribute to its toxicity. Lysosomal lamellar bodies are observed in tissues affected&#xD;
      by chloroquine, such as retina and neuromuscular system. Chloroquine inhibits the absorption&#xD;
      and the binding of mitochondrial calcium, alters the membrane permeability and the transport&#xD;
      of enzymes to the lysosomes. Apparently there are other mechanisms to explain its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory action; such as the interference with the release of TNF from mononuclear&#xD;
      phagocytes by inhibiting gene expression and the down-regulation of TNF receptors, by&#xD;
      delaying their transport to the cellular surface. Due to these mechanisms of action,&#xD;
      chloroquine has anti-inflammatory activities and therefore is used in diseases such as&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In liver diseases, chloroquine was&#xD;
      used in patients with hepatitis B with normalization of the levels of aminotransferases and&#xD;
      of the prothrombin time during treatment and relapse after drug discontinuation. Chloroquine&#xD;
      was also evaluated in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda and despite the clinical and&#xD;
      biochemical improvement, liver biopsies remained unchanged after one year of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous pilot study was performed in our institution, and published in 2005, with&#xD;
      chloroquine diphosphate for the maintenance treatment of AIH. In this study, 14 patients with&#xD;
      a biochemical and histological remission were treated with chloroquine diphosphate 250 mg/day&#xD;
      for at least 12 months or until disease recurrence, and compared with 18 historical controls,&#xD;
      which was held in discontinuation of treatment after remission. The chance of relapse was&#xD;
      6.49 times higher in the historical controls when compared with patients in the group treated&#xD;
      with chloroquine (72.2% versus 23.5%, p = 0.031). The use of chloroquine was safe in patients&#xD;
      with liver cirrhosis without decompensation, and there were no serious adverse events within&#xD;
      two years of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common adverse effects of chloroquine are mild and transient such as&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, dizziness, blurry vision and fatigue. The more severe&#xD;
      reactions described are itching, cardiovascular manifestations, dyskinesias, eye injuries,&#xD;
      neuromuscular disorders and hearing loss. Among the most feared adverse effects of&#xD;
      chloroquine, are the eye injuries, usually associated with chronic treatment. They may&#xD;
      consist of changes in the retina, lens, cornea and optic nerve. Usually they remain stable&#xD;
      after drug withdrawal, if the drug is discontinued in early stages. However, the retinal&#xD;
      damage can increase when found in advanced stages, and may progress even years after&#xD;
      cessation of chloroquine. It is believed that the chloroquine retinopathy can be prevented or&#xD;
      recognized in an early reversible stage with judicious use, appropriate doses and regular&#xD;
      ophthalmologic follow-up. It is recommended that the daily dose does not exceed 250 mg of&#xD;
      chloroquine diphosphate or 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine, and ophthalmologic evaluations are&#xD;
      carried out every 4 to 6 months. Despite the adverse effects and toxic reactions described&#xD;
      above, there is a consensus in most studies with chloroquine that it is a well tolerated&#xD;
      drug, provided that the appropriate dosage guidelines and regular eye examinations are&#xD;
      followed. With these cautions in mind, its use rarely causes serious side or irreversible&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether chloroquine prevents the risk of&#xD;
      recurrence of AIH in patients in remission after discontinuation of conventional treatment,&#xD;
      in prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, and to evaluate the occurrence of side&#xD;
      effects from the use of chloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be included patients had to satisfy the following criteria simultaneously: a diagnosis of&#xD;
      probable / definite AIH (according to the criteria of the international AIH Group), normal&#xD;
      liver function and absence of clinical signs of decompensated liver disease ( ascites,&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatocellular carcinoma); biochemical&#xD;
      (aminotransferase levels within the normal value for at least 18 months) and histological&#xD;
      remission in liver biopsy (periportal inflammatory activity less than 2) in the presence of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment; men or non-pregnant women and women with no intention to become&#xD;
      pregnant; willing to participate in the study. An explanation of this study will be made to&#xD;
      patients. For their enrollment, it is necessary that the patients are in accordance with the&#xD;
      proposed study, following the precepts of the Declaration of Helsinki. If patients refuse to&#xD;
      participate in the study, they will be treated following the traditional guidelines of our&#xD;
      service. We will exclude patients who stop the drug before six months for side effects,&#xD;
      patient's desire or loss of follow up. Treatment will be discontinued in case of pregnancy,&#xD;
      patient's desire, side-effects or relapse of AIH. Recurrence was defined as a sustained&#xD;
      increase in liver enzymes, greater than or equal to two times the upper normal value&#xD;
      (according to the criteria of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated by exact Fisher test to compare the treatment and placebo&#xD;
      groups considering the relapse percentage varying between 25% to 40% and 65% to 80%,&#xD;
      respectively. Thus, the sample size was obtained between from 30 to 128 patients for each&#xD;
      group considering the power of 80% and the statistical significance level of 5%. The&#xD;
      statistical analysis will present mean and standard error for quantitative variables and&#xD;
      percentages for qualitative variables as descriptive measures. The survival analysis will be&#xD;
      performed,through of simple Cox regression and multiple Cox regression with treatment as a&#xD;
      fixed covariate, to test the effect of treatment considering patients' characteristics on the&#xD;
      relapse risk from the beginning of treatment to the relapse in a period of 3 years. In a&#xD;
      second step, survival analysis will be repeated for patients that finished or stopped the&#xD;
      treatment for side effects to verify if the absence of relapse during treatment is due the&#xD;
      patients' characteristics. Furthermore, the proportions of side effects will be compared&#xD;
      between the groups by exact Fisher test. A p-value less than 5% will be considered of&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive placebo or chloroquine, under the name of drug A or&#xD;
      drug B. Information on the composition of the tablets is kept secret with the Pharmacy's&#xD;
      staff of Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo School of Medicine. The treatment&#xD;
      regimen that led to the histological remission will be maintained for a month, in association&#xD;
      with drug A or B, at which time it will be withdrawal. Patients who were taking&#xD;
      ursodeoxycholic acid to achieve remission will remain in use of this drug during the study.&#xD;
      Drugs A or B will be maintained until disease recurrence (persistent changes of&#xD;
      aminotransferases greater than twice the normal value) or until three years if biochemical&#xD;
      tests are normal, or until the time that patient want to remain in the study. If there is&#xD;
      recurrence of the disease, the patient will be excluded from the study and will receive the&#xD;
      treatment they received previously. All patients will have visits every 30 days during the&#xD;
      first six months after using drug A or drug B in monotherapy, with routine blood tests&#xD;
      performed. After then, consultations will be every two months. All complaints will be&#xD;
      recorded and the number of tablets will be counted at each visit to assess adherence and to&#xD;
      account for failures in taking the medication. Every patient will be treated by the doctors&#xD;
      responsible for the study, laboratory tests will be performed in the Central Laboratory of&#xD;
      the hospital in which the protocol will be performed and will be available online for&#xD;
      consultation. In the case of side effects, the drug may be stopped at the request of the&#xD;
      patient or according to medical advice. All patients will undergo to initial ophthalmologic&#xD;
      evaluation followed by six-monthly evaluations. The drug will be withdrawal, if changes&#xD;
      suggestive of retinopathy are observed. After the end of treatment, patients will be followed&#xD;
      over the next five years due to the risk of late onset of retinopathy.&#xD;
