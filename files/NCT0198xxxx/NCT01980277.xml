  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall rationale of this study evaluating tolerance and efficacy of LY2780301 in&#xD;
      combination with paclitaxel in HER2-negative, inoperable locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer (MBC) is based on :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the medical need in this population with either hormonal-resistant or unsensitive and/or&#xD;
           rapidly progressive disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the preclinical evidences for involvement of PI3K/AKT pathway in tumor progression and&#xD;
           drug resistance, including taxanes as well as its potential reversion by AKT inhibition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the high level of frequency of PI3K/AKT activation in HER2-negative MBC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the in vitro and in vivo preclinical activity of LY2780301, and its synergistic&#xD;
           combination with various anticancer agents, including taxanes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the favourable profile of tolerance of LY2780301 in phase I trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly paclitaxel is conventionally administered at 80 mg/m²/week and is a standard treatment&#xD;
      in breast cancer (BC) As described above, LY2780301 500 mg once daily has been established as&#xD;
      the RP2D in phase I single agent trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of pharmacodynamic activity was noted at 400-500 mg QD. Conservatively, the first&#xD;
      dose level to be explored will be LY2780301 400 mg QD and paclitaxel 70 mg/m²/week.&#xD;

      RATIONALE OF THE STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for LY2780301 in combination with&#xD;
           weekly paclitaxel in HER2-negative, inoperable locally advanced or MBC patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to estimate the objective response rate (ORR) of the combination in first-line treated,&#xD;
           HER2-negative, inoperable locally advanced or MBC patients. In addition, this study will&#xD;
           assess the role of PI3K/AKT/S6 pathway activation as potential predictive factor for&#xD;
           response to LY2780301 in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be a phase Ib/II prospective, multicentre, open label, uncontrolled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib will use a continuous reassessment method (CRM) design, allowing to reach safely and&#xD;
      quickly the MTD and the RP2D of the combination, but ensuring the treatment of at least 18&#xD;
      patients to secure the tolerance profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will estimate antitumor activity in the overall patient population and in patients&#xD;
      with activation of PI3K/AKT/S6 axis, allowing to examine its potential value as predictive&#xD;
      biomarker&#xD;
