  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRM-151 is an investigational drug that is being developed for possible use in the treatment&#xD;
      of myelofibrosis (MF), a disease in which the bone marrow, which is the organ in the body&#xD;
      that makes blood cells, is replaced by fibrosis, or excess scar tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on whether PRM-151 has an effect on the MF&#xD;
      disease, whether it is safe in patients with MF, and how well it is tolerated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage 1 of this study has completed. Stage 1 was an open-label, Simon two stage, Phase 2&#xD;
      study to determine the efficacy and safety of two different dose schedules of PRM-151 in&#xD;
      participants with PMF and post ET/PV MF. There were two treatment cohorts, each assigned to&#xD;
      one of two dose schedules receiving either single-agent PRM-151 or PRM-151 in combination&#xD;
      with ruxolitinib. Participants were assigned to a weekly or every four week dosing schedule&#xD;
      by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      three different doses of PRM-151 in participants with PMF and post ET/PV MF. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of three doses: 0.3 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of PRM-151. This&#xD;
      is the second stage of an adaptive design study as defined in FDA Draft Guidance for&#xD;
      Industry: Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics, February 2010.&#xD;
      Modifications to dose levels, schedule, and regimen have been made in Stage 2 based on data&#xD;
      from Stage 1.&#xD;
