    <textblock>
      Cannabis sativa is one of the most ancient psychotropic drugs known to humanity. Although&#xD;
      most Western countries have outlawed the use of cannabis according to the UN Convention of&#xD;
      Psychotropic Substances, an increasing number of states in the USA, Canada and several&#xD;
      European countries allow the medicinal use of cannabis subject to a doctor's recommendation.&#xD;
      In oncology, the beneficial effects of treatment with the plant or treatment with medicine&#xD;
      produced from its components are related to symptoms of the disease: pain, nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, loss of appetite and weight loss. There is only partial clinical evidence of the&#xD;
      efficacy of cannabis for these indications. In Israel, according to Ministry of Health&#xD;
      regulations, permission to use medicinal cannabis for oncology patients can be given for two&#xD;
      indications: to relieve disease-related symptoms in advanced disease or during chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment to reduce side effects. The indications are very wide and allow a great deal of&#xD;
      freedom for the physician's decisions, but also cause high demands for cannabis from&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cannabis plant and the synthetic drugs based on the plant are considered to be medically&#xD;
      safe. Most of the adverse effects are related to the fact that the plant and the drugs are&#xD;
      psychoactive. Among the effects named were dizziness, euphoria, difficulty concentrating,&#xD;
      disturbances in thinking, memory loss, and loss of coordination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we published the results of a prospective, observational study evaluating the&#xD;
      medical necessity for medicinal cannabis treatment in cancer patients on supportive or&#xD;
      palliative care. No significant side effects, except for memory lessening in patients with&#xD;
      prolonged cannabis use (p=0.002), were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a phenomenon of cognitive decline that&#xD;
      patients may experience during or after chemotherapy. Memory loss and lack of concentration&#xD;
      and attention are the most frequent symptoms encountered. Evidence suggests that CRCI is of&#xD;
      significant concern to patients and has become a major quality-of-life issue for survivors,&#xD;
      with estimates of its frequency ranging from 14-85% of patients. The influence of cannabis&#xD;
      use on cognitive functions of oncology patients has never been tested. Theoretically, the&#xD;
      combination of chemotherapy and cannabis can cause severe reduction in cognitive functions in&#xD;
      additive or synergistic ways. However, this hypothesis, too, has never been tested, although&#xD;
      the number of patients using cannabis during chemotherapy treatments in Israel and in other&#xD;
      Western countries is growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of current research: The main goal of the study is to evaluate prospectively the level&#xD;
      of reduction in cognitive function of cancer patients who are on active oncology treatments&#xD;
      and use cannabis, comparing to a group of patients without cannabis treatment. The second&#xD;
      goal is to identify high-risk groups for cognitive impairment due to cannabis use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: The study will be comprised of a cannabis user group that will include&#xD;
      patients who will come for guidance sessions before being issued with a cannabis license and&#xD;
      a control group of patients on active oncology treatments, meeting the same inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria (except for cannabis use), and willing to complete the same pack of&#xD;
      questionnaires and cognitive tests at the same three time points. All patients will sign an&#xD;
      informed consent form. The study includes questionnaires on quality of life (EORTC-Q30),&#xD;
      anxiety, depression (HADS) and fatigue (BFI), and cognitive tests (MoCA, DSST, Digital Finger&#xD;
      Tapping) administered by the nurses who give guidance on cannabis according to the patient's&#xD;
      language (Hebrew, Russian or Arabic). The nurses will have a short guidance course on &quot;how to&#xD;
      do cognitive tests&quot; and a monthly meeting with a neuropsychologist to test the quality of the&#xD;
      cognitive tests. The questionnaires and cognitive tests will be done on the day of entering&#xD;
      the study (T0) and after 3 (T3) and 6 months (T6). The patients will be asked not to use&#xD;
      cannabis in the 12 hours before the interviews after 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The sample size was built to show a difference of 1.1 points in the MoCA test&#xD;
      (half the SD for the normal population) between two groups after three months of cannabis&#xD;
      use. The number of patients needed with a power of 80%, β≤0.05 and SD=3.1 (the SD for mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment in the MoCA test) is calculated at 42 patients in each group (total 84&#xD;
      patients). Due to an expected drop-out of 20%, the number of patients to be included in the&#xD;
      study is 101.&#xD;

      Cannabis sativa is one of the most ancient psychotropic drugs known to humanity. Evidence of&#xD;
      the use of cannabis for medicinal and ceremonial purposes goes back 4000 years. In 1854, the&#xD;
      plant appeared in the United States Dispensatory and was sold freely in pharmacies in Western&#xD;
      countries. It also appeared in the British Pharmacopoeia as an extract and tincture for over&#xD;
      100 years. In 1942, cannabis was removed from the United States Pharmacopoeia and, with that,&#xD;
      its legal medicinal use was stopped. Only in 1971 did Britain and most of the European&#xD;
      countries outlaw the use of cannabis according to the UN Convention of Psychotropic&#xD;
      Substances [1]. Regardless, a rising number of states in the USA, Canada and several European&#xD;
      countries allow medicinal use of cannabis subject to a doctor's recommendation. Along with&#xD;
      the popularity of the cannabis plant as an effective treatment for disease symptoms in&#xD;
      oncology patients and for various medicinal indications unrelated to cancer patients, there&#xD;
      is growing evidence to demonstrate interest in the use of cannabinoids in medicine, although&#xD;
      high quality studies are still missing. In oncology, the beneficial effects of treatment with&#xD;
      the plant, or treatment with medicine produced from its components, are related to symptoms&#xD;
      of the disease: pain, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite and weight loss. The clinical&#xD;
      evidence of the efficacy of cannabis for these indications is only partial. Improvement in&#xD;
      mood swings and sleep disorders has also been reported, although these were not goals of the&#xD;
      research [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a basic difficulty in conducting randomized, double-blind statistical power research&#xD;
      in products that are extracted from plants. This difficulty arises from the lack of a driving&#xD;
      economic source and from difficulty in reaching set standards regarding the product and its&#xD;
      quality over time, the method of consumption, and the diversity of the population. In Israel,&#xD;
      according to Ministry of Health regulations, permission to use medicinal cannabis for&#xD;
      oncology patients can be given for two indications: to relieve disease-related symptoms in&#xD;
      advanced disease or during chemotherapy treatment in order to reduce side effects. The&#xD;
      indications are very wide and allow a great deal of freedom for the physician's decisions,&#xD;
      but also cause high demands for cannabis from patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cannabis plant and the synthetic drugs based on the plant are considered to be medically&#xD;
      safe. The main reason for this is the lack of cannabis receptors in the brain stem, a fact&#xD;
      that prevents life-threatening side effects which exist, for example, in morphine-based&#xD;
      drugs. The side effects can be divided into acute and chronic, and are a result of prolonged&#xD;
      use of cannabis. As cannabinoid receptors are present in other tissues throughout the body,&#xD;
      adverse effects include redness of the eyes, tachycardia, bronchodilation, muscle relaxation,&#xD;
      and decreased gastrointestinal motility [3]. Most of the adverse effects are related to the&#xD;
      fact that the plant and the drugs are psychoactive, mostly depending on their concentration&#xD;
      and on the THC dosage. Among the effects named were dizziness, euphoria, difficulty&#xD;
      concentrating, disturbances in thinking, memory loss, and loss of coordination [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we published the results of a prospective, observational study evaluating the&#xD;
      medical necessity for medicinal cannabis treatment in cancer patients on supportive or&#xD;
      palliative care. Of the 211 patients who had a first interview, only 131 had the second&#xD;
      interview, 25 of whom stopped treatment after less than a week. All cancer- or anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatment-related symptoms showed significant improvement (p&lt;0.001). No significant side&#xD;
      effects, except for memory lessening in patients with prolonged cannabis use (p=0.002), were&#xD;
      noted [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a phenomenon of cognitive decline that&#xD;
      patients may experience during or after chemotherapy [6]. Memory loss and lack of&#xD;
      concentration and attention are the most frequent symptoms encountered [7]. Other complaints&#xD;
      include difficulties with multi-tasking, organizing and planning, as well as difficulty in&#xD;
      thinking and other subtle cognitive changes [8]. CRCI is now one of the most common&#xD;
      post-treatment symptoms reported by breast cancer survivors and may also represent the most&#xD;
      troublesome symptom [9]. Evidence suggests that CRCI is of significant concern to patients&#xD;
      and has become a major quality-of-life issue for survivors, and estimates of its frequency&#xD;
      range from 14% to 85% of patients [10]. For some cancer survivors, the cognitive effects of&#xD;
      chemotherapy linger on for years after treatment, and even mild impairment may impact the&#xD;
      survivors' ability to function, both at home and at work [9,10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influences of cannabis use on cognitive functions of oncology patients have never been&#xD;
      tested. Theoretically, the combination of chemotherapy and cannabis can cause severe&#xD;
      reduction in cognitive functions in additive or synergistic ways. However, this hypothesis&#xD;
      has never been tested, although the number of patients using cannabis during chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatments in Israel and in other Western countries is growing.&#xD;
