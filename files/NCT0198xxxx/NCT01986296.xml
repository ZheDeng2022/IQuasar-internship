      The goal of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, single site, feasibility study is&#xD;
      to develop and collect data to evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of this&#xD;
      treatment using this ExAblate transcranial System in the treatment of Medication-Refractory&#xD;
      OCD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of MRI-guided&#xD;
      focused ultrasound thermal ablation of a designated area in the brain of patients suffering&#xD;
      from medication-refractory OCD, using the ExAblate transcranial system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ExAblate system is a medical device that involves a focused ultrasound system and an MRI&#xD;
      scanner. ExAblate delivers a pulse of focused ultrasound energy, or sonication, to the&#xD;
      targeted tissue. For OCD Patients: one or more thermal lesion will be created on one of the&#xD;
      following targets: Anterior cingulate cortex, Anterior Limb of internal Capsule, Ventral&#xD;
      Striatum or Subgenual Cingulate Cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment begins with a series of standard diagnostic MR images to identify the location&#xD;
      and shape of tumor to be treated. The ExAblate computer uses the physician's designation of&#xD;
      the target volume to plan the best way to cover the target volume with small spots called&#xD;
      &quot;sonications&quot;. These treatment spots are cylinder shaped. Their size depends on sonication&#xD;
      power and duration. During the treatment, a specific MR scan, which can be processed to&#xD;
      identify changes in tissue temperature, provides a thermal map of the treatment volume to&#xD;
      confirm the therapeutic effect. The thermal map is used to monitor the treatment in progress,&#xD;
      and confirm that the ablation is proceeding according to plan, thus closing the therapy loop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ExAblate transcranial operates a helmet-shaped transducer (currently utilizing&#xD;
      1000-element phased array transducer) positioned above the subject head. The ExAblate&#xD;
      transcranial system also includes means to immobilize the subject head, cool the interface&#xD;
      water, and software for CT analysis and phase correction computation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent and screening, eligible subjects will proceed to the treatment. All&#xD;
      subjects will be followed at Day 1, 7 days, 1 month, 6 months and 1, 2 and 3 years. At follow&#xD;
      up visits, patients will be evaluated for general health, neurological changes (including&#xD;
      MMSE exam),and efficacy measurements as well as for device/procedure related adverse events&#xD;
      that may have occurred during the follow-up period. Six (6) month and 1, 2 and 3 year follow&#xD;
      up visits will also include Full Battery Cognitive/Neurological Testing.&#xD;

    <description>Effectiveness of the ExAblate Transcranial MR-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment of medication-refractory OCD will be determined using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Scale (Y-BOCS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) from examinations at baseline and through 6-Months post-ExAblate treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>36 month</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of the ExAblate transcranial treatment will be determined by an evaluation of the incidence and severity of device and procedure related complications from the first / treatment day visit through the 6-Months post-treatment time point. All Adverse Events (AEs) will be reported and categorized by investigators as definitely, probably, possibly, or unrelated to the device, procedure, or post-surgical changes in neurological status. Alternative treatments resulting from post-surgical changes in neurological status will be reported.</description>
