  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral cancer represents the sixth most common cancer worldwide whilst in Pakistan it ranks the&#xD;
      second most common cancer in either gender. Histologically, over 90% of oral cancer lesions&#xD;
      are squamous cell carcinomas which are diagnosed on the basis of histopathological analysis.&#xD;
      However, proliferation kinetics and nucleolar status are not clearly delineated by routine&#xD;
      H&amp;E examination; thus making use of various proliferation markers imperative for the purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nuclear organizer regions (AgNORs) are associated with proliferative activity and represents&#xD;
      as a diagnostic aid in oral malignancies. Similarly, methyl green pyronin (MGP) stain has&#xD;
      also been valuable as a complement in routine histopathological studies of several neoplastic&#xD;
      entities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphometric techniques offer an opportunity to quantify nuclear changes associated with&#xD;
      malignancy and may provide an objective basis for grading the tumors. The present study is&#xD;
      planned to analyze the morphometric parameters of the MGP stain in oral squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, and in their various histological grades, and to assess if the MGP staining&#xD;
      parameters could give information on the aggressiveness of the malignant lesions of oral&#xD;
      cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sections from thirty cases of squamous cell carcinoma along with thirty cases of normal oral&#xD;
      mucosa will be evaluated for methyl green pyronin (MGP) and AgNOR staining. Morphometric&#xD;
      analysis of various MGP staining and AgNOR parameters would be performed using micrometer.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of the results will be carried out using SPSS. Quantitative variables&#xD;
      will be expressed as mean Â± Standard Deviation. Frequencies and percentages will be given for&#xD;
      qualitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that oral squamous cell carcinoma will exhibit significantly higher MGP&#xD;
      staining and AgNOR staining parameters than normal mucosa of the oral cavity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Oral cancer, a major global health problem holds the sixth position worldwide with a marked&#xD;
      variation in its geographic distribution. It is ranked as the third most frequent cancer in&#xD;
      the developing world after stomach and cervical cancers. Amongst oral cancers, oral squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma accounts for over 90% of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out of the developing counties, Indo-Pak subcontinent amounts to one third of the global oral&#xD;
      cancer burden. Carcinoma of the oral cavity in Pakistan, one of the high-risk countries is&#xD;
      the second most frequent cancer in either gender. With differential distribution among&#xD;
      sub-populations, it represents 8.8% of all reported cancer cases. The most predominant risk&#xD;
      factors include tobacco smoking, betel chewing and alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and specific diagnostic tools are two innovative approaches for early detection of&#xD;
      oral cancer. Conventional oral examination and clinical evaluation remains the foundation of&#xD;
      screening approaches whereas surgical biopsy followed by histological analysis is attributed&#xD;
      to be the gold standard for diagnosing malignant oral lesions. Furthermore, some adjunctive&#xD;
      techniques may contribute to the diagnosis of oral cancer. Of these vital staining, DNA&#xD;
      analysis, chemiluminescence, tissue fluorescence, light-based detection systems and&#xD;
      biomarkers are now on the forefront.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers have been valuable in revealing additional information about tumor pathology,&#xD;
      including the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, angiogenesis, apoptosis and cell&#xD;
      proliferation. Aberrations in proliferation kinetics are the most imperative factor during&#xD;
      tumor progression. Three main categories of cell proliferation markers include growth&#xD;
      fraction markers like Ki67, cycle-specific markers like PCNA(Proliferating Cellular Nuclear&#xD;
      Antigen), and cell cycle time markers like AgNOR. During malignancy, proliferation and&#xD;
      protein synthesis is mainly controlled by the nucleus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nucleolar Organizer Regions (NORs) are loops of DNA on the short arms of acrocentric&#xD;
      chromosomes that presumably are associated with cell proliferation. Some of the NOR&#xD;
      associated proteins are argyrophilic and can be demonstrated as black dots by the silver&#xD;
      staining technique and the structures thus demonstrated are known as AgNORs. The AgNOR&#xD;
      quantitative parameters provide information about the velocity of cell proliferation during&#xD;
      cell cycle. Neoplastic progression is affected more by the rate of cell proliferation, rather&#xD;
      than the proliferative activity per se.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although AgNOR staining and AgNOR quantification are valuable methods in histopathological&#xD;
      evaluation of malignancies, certain limitations have also been associated with this&#xD;
      technique. Such AgNOR associated shortcomings include nucleolar affinity for silver stain&#xD;
      obscuring the individual AgNORs in cases of intense staining, overlapping of variable degree&#xD;
      between high and low grade tumors, difficulty in discerning doublets or clusters by light&#xD;
      microscopy, misinterpreted stain deposition as proliferative activity along with some&#xD;
      technical problems of staining and fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methyl Green Pyronin (MGP) stain is a differential stain used for selective staining of DNA&#xD;
      and RNA. Methyl green binds specifically to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), staining nuclei&#xD;
      green, while pyronin is specific for ribonucleic acid (RNA), staining nucleoli red. Methyl&#xD;
      green pyronin stain has also been used to distinguish between proliferating and&#xD;
      dedifferentiated non-proliferating cell nuclei. Similarly to assess the degradation of DNA in&#xD;
      thyroid follicular epithelial cells, this stain has also proven to be useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphometry has been a significant advancement in delineating sequence of events responsible&#xD;
      for cancer progression. Variations in nuclear and cellular size and shape have greater&#xD;
      implications in the assessment of neoplastic lesions. Methyl Green Pyronin (MGP) stain has&#xD;
      been attracting attention in the recent times as it has been used to evaluate various nuclear&#xD;
      morphometric parameters in breast neoplasms. By using methyl green-pyronin staining, not only&#xD;
      the inadequacies associated with AgNOR staining can be lessened but also the morphometric&#xD;
      parameters for evaluating changes in the nucleus and nucleolus during carcinogenesis can be&#xD;
      accomplished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far AgNOR staining appears to be a useful diagnostic tool in oral squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      for examination of nucleolar structure and variations in nucleolar activity. On the other&#xD;
      hand, MGP staining has been used in assessing the cancerous lesions of breast and thyroid&#xD;
      gland and recently has been extended to oral lesions. However, no studies have been&#xD;
      undertaken yet to evaluate and compare the morphometric parameters using these two stains&#xD;
      within normal oral epithelium and oral squamous cell carcinoma. Similarly, very few studies&#xD;
      have been undertaken regarding application of methyl green pyronin stain in oral pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence the current study has been planned to evaluate the morphometric parameters among normal&#xD;
      oral epithelium and oral squamous cell carcinoma using methyl green pyronin staining;&#xD;
      moreover these findings will also be compared with those of AgNOR staining. In this current&#xD;
      scenario, methyl green pyronin staining and morphometric analysis may go hand in hand to&#xD;
      provide a better diagnosis and early detection of oral cancer.&#xD;
