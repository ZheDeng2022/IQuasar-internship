      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Caring for a loved one is often stressful. Some studies show it may affect health and&#xD;
      emotions. Researchers want to know more about this but do not know the best way to gather&#xD;
      data. They want to know if an online survey is a good way to gather data from caregivers of&#xD;
      people receiving cancer treatment at the NIH Clinical Center. They want to know if there are&#xD;
      differences among caregivers depending on the type of cancer treatment the family member or&#xD;
      friend is receiving. They want to use this data to improve support programs for caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if an online study is a good way to get data from caregivers of people with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 years old and older who are taking care of a cancer patient at the NIHCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study period begins when the family member or friend begins a new cancer treatment&#xD;
           and continues for 6 months afterward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete an online survey 3-4 times. This will include questions about&#xD;
           caregiving, stress, emotions, and spirituality. The survey can be taken anywhere on a&#xD;
           computer. It will take about 30 45 minutes each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also answer general questions about themselves and their health. This&#xD;
           will be done over the phone with the study team. It will take 5 minutes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 65.7 million adults in America provide unpaid care to an individual who is&#xD;
      disabled or ill; 7% (an estimated 4.6 million) are caring for a cancer patient. A body of&#xD;
      evidence is accumulating that suggests the burden of caring for a family member across a&#xD;
      variety of cancer populations can be extremely stressful. The stress of caregiving can have&#xD;
      physical and psychological repercussions that can ultimately lead to increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Spousal caregivers of hospitalized individuals are at increased risk of dying&#xD;
      within a year of an acute hospitalization, and this risk appears to vary based upon&#xD;
      diagnosis. While some evidence suggests caregivers may place the patient s needs above their&#xD;
      own and neglect their own health in the process, the evidence regarding whether the stress of&#xD;
      caregiving is associated with unhealthy behaviors such as excessive use of alcohol or&#xD;
      increased use of tobacco is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the evidence clearly shows that caregiving is stressful and may be deleterious to one s&#xD;
      health, caregivers are not typically screened for physical and psychological health issues.&#xD;
      Most research regarding the stress of caregiving has focused on psychological outcomes&#xD;
      including caregiver burden and most research was conducted primarily during the survivorship&#xD;
      phase (treatment complete). Because no large studies have examined burden and health outcomes&#xD;
      in caregivers over time and across cancer diagnoses during and after the active treatment&#xD;
      period, the primary purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of collecting&#xD;
      web-based patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from unpaid informal caregivers of cancer patients&#xD;
      that examine the relationships between psychological, health behaviors and health outcomes&#xD;
      over time during the active treatment period. A number of secondary objectives will also be&#xD;
      addressed including: to explore differences among caregivers across cancer populations and&#xD;
      caregiver categories (for example, spousal caregivers versus parent or child caregivers;&#xD;
      single caregivers versus multiple caregivers), and to examine whether healthy behaviors&#xD;
      ameliorate the relationship between burden and health outcomes. By using a large variety of&#xD;
      measures and including a sample of caregivers from multiple cancer patient populations, we&#xD;
      hope to identify those populations most at risk as well as those areas (health outcomes and&#xD;
      behaviors) where caregivers might be most at risk for negative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be eligible for this protocol if they are adult informal caregivers to a&#xD;
      patient enrolled in a cancer treatment study at the NIH Clinical Center. Once informed&#xD;
      consent is obtained, the participant will be provided with information to access the PROMIS&#xD;
      assessment center to complete the secure web-based survey. Subjects will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires collecting information about caregiver burden and health outcomes at three&#xD;
      time points 1) Enrollment, which will coincide with start of treatment for cancer, 2) 3&#xD;
      months after Enrollment, and 3) 6 months after Enrollment. An optionoal &quot;Off-Study&quot;&#xD;
      questionnaire completion time point would be offered in the event that the caregiver or the&#xD;
      study team requests removal from study participation before the final time point.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will capture psychological and behavioral outcomes including: Caregiver&#xD;
      Reaction Assessment, NIH Toolbox measures on Loneliness, Self-Efficacy, Meaning &amp; Purpose,&#xD;
      and Perceived Stress, Family Caregiver Inventory Mutuality, Spiritual Perspective Scale,&#xD;
      Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile-II, and PROMIS measures for Global Health, Anxiety,&#xD;
      Depression, Sleep Disturbance, Fatigue, and Applied Cognition. A clinician interview will&#xD;
      assess basic demographic, health issues, use of alcohol and tobacco and the impact of&#xD;
      caregiving at each time point. A brief exit interview will be conducted at the conclusion of&#xD;
      participation; there will be no long term follow-up after the study participation period.&#xD;
      Exploratory, hypothesis-generating analyses will be performed using parametric and&#xD;
      non-parametric statistical techniques.&#xD;
