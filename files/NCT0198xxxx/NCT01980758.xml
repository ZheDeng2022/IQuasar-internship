      The proposed study aims to investigate the effects of laparoscopic gastric plication (LGP) on&#xD;
      excess body weight, body mass index, and weight-related medical and psychological&#xD;
      co-morbidities in obese adolescents. Additionally, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of this procedure (implemented within a multidisciplinary comprehensive lifestyle&#xD;
      modification program) on changes in the patients' medical status, psychosocial and&#xD;
      psychological functioning, physical fitness, and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Laparoscopic gastric plication performed on carefully selected obese adolescents within&#xD;
           a multidisciplinary treatment program providing pre and post-surgical behavioral and&#xD;
           psychological support and education will result in: a) initial and sustained reductions&#xD;
           in excess body weight and body mass index, b) improvements in psychological functioning,&#xD;
           physical fitness, and health-related quality of life, and c) reduction in weight-related&#xD;
           comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. LGP will be a safe procedure, with complication rates that are comparable to or lower&#xD;
           than what has been found in other published reports of surgical weight loss procedures&#xD;
           used in obese adolescents.&#xD;

      The complete study protocol, which is described in detail below, spans 3 years and includes&#xD;
      11 research assessment points (Pre-1, Pre-2, T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, and T8). Please&#xD;
      refer to Figure 2. Study Protocol from Enrollment to Post-Surgical Assessments. Select&#xD;
      pre-treatment assessments will be conducted initially (Pre-1), followed by a 2-month&#xD;
      pre-surgical education and lifestyle modification treatment program, consisting of four&#xD;
      visits with psychology, nutrition, exercise, and surgery. After successful completion of this&#xD;
      pre-surgical education program, a more comprehensive pre-surgical assessment by a surgeon&#xD;
      (Pre-2) will be conducted. If patients decide to pursue the study, in the two weeks prior to&#xD;
      surgery, participants will be asked to adhere to a pre-surgical diet, exclusion and inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be reviewed again by the study team, and verbal consent/assent will be&#xD;
      re-confirmed with adolescents and parent(s). Following surgery (T0), comprehensive follow-up&#xD;
      care will be provided via the multidisciplinary team at the Healthy Lifestyles Center (HLC)&#xD;
      at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University (CHoR at VCU). The&#xD;
      follow-up period will be divided into three phases: 1) Early Post-Operative Phase (0-5&#xD;
      months), 2) Late Post-Operative phase (6-12 months), and 3) Long-term Follow-up Phase (13-36&#xD;
      months). In conjunction with clinical follow-up, repeat standardized research assessments&#xD;
      will be conducted post-operatively at 1-2 weeks (T1), 6 weeks (T2), 3 months (T3), 6 months&#xD;
      (T4), 12 months (T5), 18 months (T6), 24 months (T7), and 36 months (T8). Specific screening,&#xD;
      pre-surgical, perioperative, and post-surgical study procedures at each time point are&#xD;
      described fully below and outlined in Figure 2 and Table 1. Additionally, all research&#xD;
      measures are described in detail in the Measures Section. If any participant requires any&#xD;
      additional visit during the time of this study, data from these visits will also be collected&#xD;
      for this study. Care directly related to the surgery and study will not be billed but other&#xD;
      medical issues such as hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and depression may&#xD;
      require management outside of the scope of the study and will be billed accordingly&#xD;
