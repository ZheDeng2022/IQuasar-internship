      Recent studies show that BCG vaccination reduces neonatal mortality by more than 40%. This&#xD;
      effect cannot be explained by prevention of tuberculosis, which is very rare among infants.&#xD;
      The protective effect of BCG vaccination is seen already within the first week. It seems that&#xD;
      BCG provides a non-specific beneficial immune modulation - thereby reducing overall&#xD;
      mortality. Mortality is very high among newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care&#xD;
      unit. If BCG has immediate beneficial effects on the immune system, vaccinating children with&#xD;
      BCG as early as possible may save lives. The investigators will test this hypothesis in a&#xD;
      randomized trial among newborns in Guinea-Bissau, randomizing newborns admitted to the&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit at the National Hospital 1:1 to BCG immediately or at discharge&#xD;
      (usual practice).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies in high-mortality areas have shown that the BCG vaccine is associated&#xD;
      with marked benefits in child survival. These results cannot be explained by prevention of&#xD;
      tuberculosis, which is rare during the firsts years of life. These observations have recently&#xD;
      been tested at the Bandim Health Project (BHP) in Guinea-Bissau in randomized trials among&#xD;
      low birth weight (LBW, &lt;2500 g) children. According to local practice, BCG is typically&#xD;
      postponed in LBW infants until 4-6 weeks of age. Results showed that providing BCG at the&#xD;
      time of discharge from the hospital compared with BCG later reduced neonatal mortality by&#xD;
      more than 40%. The protective effect started already within the first three days. Based on&#xD;
      verbal autopsies, BCG protected the children against neonatal septicemia and pneumonia.&#xD;
      Recent immunological studies have indicated that BCG induces epigenetic changes which&#xD;
      reprogram the innate immune system to increased pro-inflammatory responses against unrelated&#xD;
      pathogens; hence, BCG may indeed have a non-specific beneficial effect protecting against&#xD;
      other infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCG is recommended at birth by the World Health Organization (WHO), but is rarely given&#xD;
      immediately at birth. In Guinea-Bissau, at the National Hospital's maternity ward, children&#xD;
      are currently vaccinated at discharge. For children who are born healthy, this usually means&#xD;
      1-2 days after the delivery. However, very small children and ill children are admitted to&#xD;
      the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and often stay there for days to weeks before they&#xD;
      are discharged - and only receive BCG at the time of discharge. The mortality among children&#xD;
      in the NICU is alarmingly high - it was 14% (254/1877) among children admitted to the NICU&#xD;
      from November 2007 to May 2013 (unpublished data). A substantial number of children that died&#xD;
      had normal birth weight and high Apgar scores. In most cases the underlying cause of death&#xD;
      was infectious diseases, which could potentially be affected by BCG vaccination. Hence, the&#xD;
      present aim is to conduct a randomized trial at the NICU to study the effect of providing BCG&#xD;
      immediately (intervention group) versus BCG at discharge (control group). The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be mortality during hospital stay, with cause of death, growth and length of stay as&#xD;
      secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing BCG vaccination upon admission to newborn children in the NICU incubators, rather&#xD;
      than at discharge, is associated with 40% reduction in mortality at the NICU for children&#xD;
      weighing &gt;1250 g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized trial will be conducted by the Bandim Health Project in Guinea-Bissau, at the&#xD;
      NICU at the National Hospital Sim√£o Mendes. The Bandim Health Project (BHP) maintains a&#xD;
      health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) in six suburban districts of the capital of&#xD;
      Guinea-Bissau and covers approximately 102,000 inhabitants. All houses in the study area are&#xD;
      visited monthly to register new pregnancies and births. All children below 3 years of age are&#xD;
      followed through home visits every third month. The National Hospital where many women from&#xD;
      the study area give birth is a few kilometers away. The BHP has worked at the hospital's&#xD;
      maternity ward for many years, conducting trials of different health interventions and other&#xD;
      observational studies to reduce infant mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be randomly allocated (1:1) to BCG at admission or at discharge (as per current&#xD;
      standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BHP team is present at the maternity ward every day. The team will visit the NICU and&#xD;
      identify children admitted since their last visit. The mother will have the study explained&#xD;
      in the local language (Portuguese Creole), and also receive a written explanation in&#xD;
      Portuguese. She will be briefly interviewed about background factors (education, previous&#xD;
      deliveries, etc.). Anthropometric measures will be obtained and a Ballard score assessed by a&#xD;
      trained nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provided consent, the mother will draw a lot which indicates if the child will receive BCG&#xD;
      immediately or BCG at discharge as usual. To ensure equal distribution of different&#xD;
      categories of children and calendar time, randomization will be done in blocks within two&#xD;
      groups of children; a) children at the NICU who are in an incubator (most severely ill); b)&#xD;
      children at the NICU who are not in incubator (less ill, including also children born by&#xD;
      caesarean section whose mother is indisposed). Randomization will further be stratified by&#xD;
      sex and weight group (1250-1499g, 1500-1999g, 2000-2499g, 2500+ g) in blocks of 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after randomization, children who were allocated to BCG vaccine will be&#xD;
      vaccinated intradermally with 0.05 ml BCG vaccine (Statens Serum Institute, Denmark). The&#xD;
      control group will receive BCG at discharge. All children will receive oral polio vaccine&#xD;
      (OPV) at the time of BCG vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is therefore testing BCG+OPV at admission to the NICU (intervention arm) vs.&#xD;
      BCG+OPV at discharge from NICU (control arm). Same-sex twin pairs will receive the same&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BHP team will be in charge of randomization and vaccination. These procedures will take&#xD;
      place without the participation of the NICU staff. BCG vaccination leaves a small mark on the&#xD;
      skin of the child, which vanishes quickly, leaving no sign until a papule is formed several&#xD;
      weeks later. To further ensure blinding of hospital staff, a small gauze patch will be placed&#xD;
      over the injection site in both groups, for the entire hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      -At the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BHP team will visit the NICU every day and ascertain the vital status of all enrolled&#xD;
      children and that the plasters have not been removed. All clinical and biological parameters&#xD;
      registered by the NICU staff, including weight, temperature and respiratory frequency will&#xD;
      also be recorded. The main outcome is survival during the stay at the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -After discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the day of discharge, the BHP team will assure that all children randomised to the control&#xD;
      group receive BCG and OPV before leaving the hospital. The children being discharged will be&#xD;
      offered transport to their home. All included children included from Bissau will be followed&#xD;
      for adverse events, survival, growth and morbidity with home visits after 3 days, 2 months, 6&#xD;
      months and 12 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mortality data will be analyzed in Cox proportional hazards models. Due to the expected&#xD;
      high number of twins, all analyses will be adjusted for interdependency between twins. We&#xD;
      will analyze the overall effect of BCG on survival, and by cause of death. Length of stay and&#xD;
      weight gain at discharge among surviving children will be analyzed using linear regression.&#xD;
      To prevent bias which could arise if BCG was particularly beneficial for survival among the&#xD;
      smallest children, control and intervention children will be matched based on birth weight,&#xD;
      and pairs of children in which one child dies will be excluded from the analysis. There will&#xD;
      be a natural variation in the time from birth to enrolment into the trial. All analyses will&#xD;
      be adjusted for time from birth to enrolment. All analyses will be conducted stratified by&#xD;
      weight group, sex and season (dry (Dec-May) vs rainy (June-Nov)), since we have previously&#xD;
      observed that both factors may modify the response to BCG and other vaccines. It is a&#xD;
      secondary hypothesis that the early effect is strongest for boys and in the dry season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public health campaigns which also affect newborn children, for example polio vaccination&#xD;
      campaigns, could interfere with the trial. If such campaigns are implemented also for&#xD;
      children in the ICU, the children will be censored in the analysis at the time of the&#xD;
      intervention. Likewise if there are strikes, shortage of electricity or other events which&#xD;
      interfere with the health services, the children will censored in the analysis after&#xD;
      discussion with the DSMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NICU admits around 350-400 children per year who are placed in the incubators. Around 94%&#xD;
      weigh more than 1250 g. The median length of stay is 6 days. With a mortality of 12%, we&#xD;
      would need to enroll 1262 children to detect a 40% difference in mortality between&#xD;
      BCG-vaccinated and BCG-unvaccinated children with 80% power and a significance level of 5%.&#xD;
      This corresponds to 122 deaths. If mortality declines (as it has done over the last years in&#xD;
      the BHP study area), the event number would have to be slightly higher; with a mortality of&#xD;
      11% we would need to continue to 123 deaths to maintain the same power; if it declines to 10%&#xD;
      it would be 124 deaths, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this data, the investigators expect to reach the needed number of events during a&#xD;
      period of 4 years, taking into account that some children will have died before they can be&#xD;
      enrolled and some children will be too ill to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The study protocol has been approved by The Danish Central Ethical&#xD;
      Committee and the National Ethical Committee in Guinea-Bissau. The trial will be registered&#xD;
      at clinicaltrials.gov. In previous studies BCG was safe for LBW children and even more&#xD;
      beneficial among the smallest children. A local clinical monitor and a Data Safety and&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed.&#xD;
