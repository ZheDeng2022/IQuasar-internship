  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for&#xD;
      patients with a big or very big problem with tinnitus (a sensation of noise in the head).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, open-label, phase I clinical trial to estimate the treatment&#xD;
      effect size and to assess preliminary safety and tolerability of DBS in the caudate nucleus&#xD;
      (area LC) in adults with a big or very big problem (tinnitus functional index TFI&gt;50) with&#xD;
      chronic tinnitus. Up to 10 subjects will be implanted. The DBS stimulation parameters are&#xD;
      patient-specific and will be allowed to vary over the course of the treatment periods,&#xD;
      calibrated by the TFI. During Period I, stimulation will be continuous. During Period II,&#xD;
      there will be three stimulation OFF/ON epochs, where the stimulation will be turned OFF and&#xD;
      then turned back ON when the tinnitus loudness returns to a certain level (based on a change&#xD;
      in the TFI score). During Period III, stimulation will be &quot;on demand,&quot; i.e. controlled by the&#xD;
      subject and determined by subject preference. An important goal is to determine whether&#xD;
      tinnitus can be controlled through optimization of stimulation parameters.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Men and women between the ages of 22 and 75 years. Subjective, unilateral or bilateral,&#xD;
        non-pulsatile tinnitus of 1 year's duration or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) score greater than 50. Tinnitus unresponsive acoustical and&#xD;
        behavioral therapies. Prospective subjects must have received at least one acoustical&#xD;
        (masker, hearing aid, Neuromonics®) or behavioral therapy (cognitive behavioral, directive&#xD;
        counseling, tinnitus retraining therapy) to be eligible for study enrollment, but partial&#xD;
        response to conventional therapy does not exclude a prospective subject if the individual&#xD;
        meets the TFI &gt; 50 study participation threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) ≥ 26. Subjects of child-bearing potential using an&#xD;
        appropriate form of birth control acceptable to the research team and with a negative urine&#xD;
        pregnancy test or has undergone sterilization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Capacity to give informed consent. English-speaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients experiencing tinnitus related to untreated retrocochlear lesion, or other known&#xD;
        anatomic/structural lesions of the ear or temporal bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with hyperacusis or misophonia (hypersensitivity to loud noises). Hearing loss of&#xD;
        moderately severe or greater severity in either ear. History of seizure disorder or&#xD;
        currently under treatment for seizure disorder. Patients with cardiac pacemakers,&#xD;
        intracardiac lines, implanted medication pumps, implanted electrodes in the brain, other&#xD;
        intracranial metal objects with the exception of dental fillings, or any other&#xD;
        contraindication for obtaining a MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with an acute or chronic unstable medical condition which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
        PI, would require stabilization prior to or preclude DBS surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any active ear disease that, in the opinion of the PI, needs to be further&#xD;
        evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with psychiatric symptoms that, in the opinion of the study team, are not&#xD;
        adequately treated or would interfere with study activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any psychiatric co-morbidity that may complicate the interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy. Currently breast-feeding. Patients with tinnitus related to Workman's&#xD;
        Compensation claim or litigation-related event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients taking any medication(s), in the opinion of the PI, that is (are) deemed to be&#xD;
        etiologically related to the development of tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Preoperative neurophychological evaluation that indicates either of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Dementia - Using DSM-IV criteria of memory impairment and at least one of the following:&#xD;
        aphasia, apraxia, agnosia or disturbances in executive functioning. The cognitive&#xD;
        impairments must be severe enough to cause impairment in social and occupational&#xD;
        functioning and must represent a decline from a previously higher level of functioning. The&#xD;
        diagnosis of dementia will not be made if the cognitive deficits occur exclusively during&#xD;
        the course of a delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cognitive impairment (z &lt; -1.5) in multiple domains without dementia (i.e. patient is&#xD;
        functionally intact), but in the opinion of the study team would not or could not comply&#xD;
        with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) &gt; 29, indicating severe depression. Patients with a&#xD;
        history of claustrophobia that would interfere with MRI or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active alcohol and/or drug dependence or history of alcohol and/or ETOH dependence within&#xD;
        the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigators, confounds study results or&#xD;
        places the subject at greater risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
