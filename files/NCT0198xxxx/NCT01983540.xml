    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up of the primary series vaccination schedule in Study A3L24 (NCT01177722)&#xD;
      and booster vaccination in Study A3L27 (NCT01444781).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the long-term antibody persistence at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age following a&#xD;
           3-dose primary series vaccination of either DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T+Prevenar™ (PCV7)&#xD;
           +Rotarix™ or Infanrix hexa™+Prevenar™ (PCV7) +Rotarix™ vaccination at 2, 4, 6 months of&#xD;
           age and a booster vaccination of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T+Prevenar™ (PCV7) or Infanrix&#xD;
           hexa™+Prevenar™ (PCV7) at 12 to 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the long-term antibody persistence by group and by stratification on the age&#xD;
           at inclusion of the A3L27 booster study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the effect of one additional oral dose of stand alone poliovirus isotypes 1,&#xD;
           2 and 3 vaccine* on the antibody persistence immune response for poliovirus isotypes (4&#xD;
           vs 5 doses of poliovirus administered).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No investigational vaccine will be administered in the study. Subjects who were previously&#xD;
      randomized and completed the primary series, Study A3L24 and the booster study A3L27 will be&#xD;
      invited to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the vaccines administered during the preceding&#xD;
      trial (A3L27;) and SAEs related to A3L28 study procedures will be collected throughout the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No vaccine will be administered as part of this study.&#xD;
