  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome is a very common condition with multiple etiologies that includes systemic&#xD;
      and ocular disease that causes reduction in the production of tears, as well as increase in&#xD;
      tears evaporation. As a result of the various etiologies and large variability of dry eye's&#xD;
      clinical sign, it has been a challenge for practitioners to have a consistent system to&#xD;
      classify dry eyes and to have an appropriate and accurate measurement to quantify the&#xD;
      severity of dry eyes and its impact on patients' quality of life.6 To date, no study which&#xD;
      evaluates the extent of questionnaires correlates with changes in quality of life. With this&#xD;
      cross sectional interview study, we aim to determine the efficacy of the questionnaires as a&#xD;
      practical tool in our future clinical trials at our center.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a multifactorial condition that affects 5-35% of the population.1 Common symptoms&#xD;
      of this condition include eye irritation, heaviness of the eyelids, visual disturbances,&#xD;
      tearing and light sensitivity.2 This condition significantly decrease patient health related&#xD;
      quality of life (HRQOL). Clinical studies shown poor correlation between clinical test&#xD;
      symptoms and self perceived severity of the disease.7 Studies also have shown that utilities&#xD;
      of more severe dry eye similar to condition such as class III/IV angina affecting the QOL.6&#xD;
      Correlation between reduce quality of life and presenting symptoms is unknown compared to&#xD;
      other factors such as cost and inconvenience of treatment. This implicates on the management&#xD;
      of the condition. In addition, there is a significant socioeconomic burden. In 2009, 54,051&#xD;
      patients sought treatment for dry eye in the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC). In total,&#xD;
      the costs for dry eye medication amounted to $181,354.17.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although different questionnaires have been used in assessment of dry eye, to date, there has&#xD;
      been no study which evaluates the extent of questionnaires correlate with change in quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is particularly important since symptoms of dry eyes are episodic and questionnaires&#xD;
      administered at one time point may or may not reflect the true disease morbidity. Two of such&#xD;
      questionnaires are the SPEED questionnaires which consist of 2 questions graded on a scale of&#xD;
      0-3 on frequency and grade 0-4 on severity and SANDE questionnaires which consist of 3&#xD;
      questions based on symptoms of frequency and severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both of the questionnaires have been published and validated and utilized in the eye clinic&#xD;
      by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last few years, SNEC/SERI has built up a dedicated team of dry eye researchers for&#xD;
      trials and evaluation of diagnostic devices. There is an increasing interest internationally,&#xD;
      especially from industry, to partner us for testing of commercial products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical importance Dry eye is a common and growing public health problem with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and decrease in health related quality of life. Uncertainty in correlation between&#xD;
      decrease quality of life with presenting symptoms and factors such as cost and inconvenience&#xD;
      of treatment may implicate the management of the disease. For instance, if presenting&#xD;
      symptoms correlate poorly with the perceived quality of life, more emphasis should be placed&#xD;
      on making treatment more accessible and convenient. If there is a high correlation, the focus&#xD;
      should be making current treatments more efficacious to relieve presenting symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of this study will help us to decide the efficacy of the questionnaires use in&#xD;
      future clinical trials in our centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if the symptoms of dry eye assessed by the SPEED questionnaire correlate&#xD;
           with utility values (HRQOL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if the symptoms of dry eye assessed by the SANDE questionnaire correlate&#xD;
           with utility values (HRQOL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate if the extent of correlation with HRQOL differs significantly between SPEED&#xD;
           and SANDE questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prospective cross-sectional interview study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rationale Dry eye disease defined by The National Eye Institute Workshop as tear&#xD;
           deficiency and excessive tear evaporation that causes damage to the ocular surface and&#xD;
           is associated with symptoms and ocular discomfort.5 These symptoms causes adverse effect&#xD;
           on quality of life (HRQL) of patients resulting in inappropriate management. In order to&#xD;
           achieve a better correlation between dry eye symptoms and quality of life, investigators&#xD;
           aim to distinguish a sensitive quantitative tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods Interviewers who passed CITI will be trained in conducting the questionnaires to&#xD;
           assess patients' quality of life and utility values. A set guidelines will be taught to&#xD;
           prevent inter-examiner variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants and target sample size 200 symptomatic patients will be recruited for this&#xD;
           study from the dry eye clinic in SNEC. 100 patients from dry eye clinic in SNEC will be&#xD;
           assessed with SPEED and utility assessment, and another 100 patients from dry eye clinic&#xD;
           in SNEC will be assessed with SANDE and utility assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit schedules Basic eye assessments and interviewer-assisted questionnaires will be&#xD;
           done on the same day. There will be no repeat visits required.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Duration of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           One year&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment of Dry Eye Symptoms Basic biodata such as age, race, gender be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Tear break up time (TBUT) A drop of normal saline will be instilled on a fluorescein&#xD;
           strip (Fluorets) then shaken off so that no visible drop remains. The subject is asked&#xD;
           to look up before introduction of the fluoret into the inferior conjunctival fornix on&#xD;
           the right then left eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participant will blink a few times and close the eyes for few seconds. The&#xD;
           participant will then be asked to open the eyes, look ahead at the observer's forehead&#xD;
           and not blink for as long as possible. The break up time is defined as the time between&#xD;
           the lid opening and the first appearance of any dry spot on the cornea. The participant&#xD;
           will be requested to close his eyes for few seconds and the procedure will be repeated&#xD;
           for the left eye. Three reading will be taken and averaged&#xD;
&#xD;
           Corneal fluorescein staining score Assessment of positive fluorescein staining will be&#xD;
           assessed after recording TBUT. A scoring system will be applied as previously published&#xD;
           by Barr et al. (Barr 1999). Briefly, there will be 5 corneal zones and 4 conjunctival&#xD;
           regions as shown in Figure 1. The staining scale is 0-4, with 0.5 unit steps in each of&#xD;
           the zones. The 'total' staining score will also be averaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Schirmers I test This will be done with the standard strips currently used at SERI (5&#xD;
           mm wide with a notch for folding) (Sno strips, Bausch &amp; Lomb, France) without&#xD;
           anaesthetic. The strips will be positioned over the inferior temporal half of the lower&#xD;
           lid margin in both eyes at the same time.The study participant will be asked to close&#xD;
           their eyes during the test. Any excessive irritation signs or reflex tearing will be&#xD;
           noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dry eye Questionnaires Participants will be asked to score and fill up a dry eye&#xD;
           questionnaire that assesses the symptomatic severity of dry eyes in the participant and&#xD;
           the extent of its disruption to daily activities for the past one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two different questionnaires and utility assessment will be administered in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SPEED Questionnaire Consist of 2 questions on frequency and severity graded on a&#xD;
                scale of 0-3 on frequency and grade 0-4 on severity. The questionnaire allows&#xD;
                patient to rate from 0 which is never and 3 which is all the time in frequency and&#xD;
                0 as no problem and 4 as intolerable in severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SANDE Questionnaire Consist of 3 questions on frequency and severity. VAS will be&#xD;
                applied to evaluate dry eye symptoms as described by Schaumberg et al. (Schaumberg,&#xD;
                Gulati et al. 2007). As shown in Appendix A (question 1 to 3), the scores will be&#xD;
                recorded separately for frequency and severity of dry eye symptoms., patients will&#xD;
                be asked to mark &quot;X&quot; on a 100mm line that corresponds to the degree of the symptom.&#xD;
                A global score will be calculated by multiplying the frequency score by the&#xD;
                severity score and taking the square root of the result (to transform back to the&#xD;
                original scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Utility assessment Investigators will be using Time trade-off method in this study,&#xD;
                as approved by IRB and was used in Thermal pulsation system for treatment of&#xD;
                Meibomian Gland Dysfunction study (CRIB no: 2012/191/A). In addition, questions on&#xD;
                socioeconomics will be administered to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculation There will be no interim analysis. Analysis will be performed&#xD;
           after all the subjects have completed the questionnaires or have withdrawn from the&#xD;
           study. The distributions of the scores will be examined by histograms for normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pearson correlation coefficients (r) will be calculated between SPEED score (x) and&#xD;
           utility value (y) for these 2 groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Confidence intervals will be calculated at 95% confidence level. The confidence limits&#xD;
           are computed as;&#xD;
&#xD;
           Expected outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Difference in SPEED Questionnaire and SANDE Questionnaire that affects patient&#xD;
                health related quality of life (HRQOL)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Difference in both (SPEED and SANDE) questionnaires and utility values that affects&#xD;
                patient health related quality of life (HRQOL)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Schirmers I reading&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tear break up time (TBUT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Corneal fluorescein staining&#xD;
&#xD;
           Potential problems As the 2 questionnaires used are in English and there are no&#xD;
           validated translated questionnaires, we are limited to patients who are English-educated&#xD;
           only. For simplicity of using validated questionnaires, we would be concentrating on&#xD;
           English-educated patients for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dry eye signs correlate poorly with symptoms and patient may not have an understanding&#xD;
           of their true conditions making it more difficult to obtain accurate score. In our&#xD;
           conservative population, sensitive questions on utility may distress the patients and&#xD;
           therefore inability to answer the questions appropriately.&#xD;
