  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility of reducing fractions in early-stage laryngeal cancer has not previously been&#xD;
      prospectively studied, and we will therefore conduct a careful phase I bio-equivalent dose&#xD;
      fraction reduction study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled at each dose level will undergo routine evaluations to identify potential&#xD;
      toxicities as well functional voice analyses. Adequate waiting periods will be used to ensure&#xD;
      that fraction reduction does not proceed prior to observing toxicity. The purpose of the&#xD;
      study will be either to determine the maximal fraction reduction possible until a dose is&#xD;
      reached where a dose-limiting toxicity occurs. The initial dose and fractionation will be 50&#xD;
      Gy in 15 fractions with the goal to reduce number of fractions to a dose of 42.5 Gy in 5&#xD;
      fractions. The rationale for using 5 fractions is that it is tolerated in centrally located&#xD;
      lung tumors at a dose of 50 Gy in 5 fractions, and thus, is likely to be tolerated in large&#xD;
      calliber airways.&#xD;
