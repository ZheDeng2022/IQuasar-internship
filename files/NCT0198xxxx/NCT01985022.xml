      The major purpose of this study is to directly compare two parent intervention conditions for&#xD;
      children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders at 18 months of age to document the&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has suggested that earlier intervention may contribute to better outcomes&#xD;
      in autism. Answering the question &quot;how early?&quot; has significant health and educational&#xD;
      implications for age of screening for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and age of entry into&#xD;
      early intervention for children with ASD. With the increased number of young children&#xD;
      identified with ASD, there is a pressing need for evidence-based, manualized intervention&#xD;
      that is accessible to and implemented by parents within their natural environments. This&#xD;
      collaborative project is directed by Dr. Amy Wetherby at Florida State University and Dr.&#xD;
      Nathan Call at Emory University to compare the effectiveness of parent implemented&#xD;
      intervention for toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The major objective is to&#xD;
      directly compare two parent intervention conditions: 1) a parent-implemented intervention&#xD;
      (PII) offered in a 2-3 weekly sessions to teach parents treatment strategies to support&#xD;
      social communication skills within everyday routines, activities, and places for 25 hours a&#xD;
      week; and 2) an information, education and support group (IES) offered twice monthly.&#xD;
      Ninety-two children who 12 months of age and are at risk for developing an ASD because they&#xD;
      have an older sibling who has an identified ASD will participate. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from those children who are part of prerequisite studies on ASD in infancy that are&#xD;
      also being conducted at Emory University. Families will be randomly assigned to either PII or&#xD;
      IES at 12 months of age for a total of 9 months of intervention. The effectiveness of PII and&#xD;
      IES will be examined with growth trajectories of social communication and autism symptoms and&#xD;
      group outcomes on developmental level and adaptive behavior. The findings of this study will&#xD;
      provide evidence of the effects of parent implemented intervention beginning at 12 months of&#xD;
      age and substantiate that autism screening for toddlers is crucial for families to access&#xD;
      early intervention.&#xD;
