  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Phase I portion of this clinical research study is to find the highest&#xD;
      tolerated dose of the combination of lenalidomide, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and&#xD;
      dexamethasone that can be given to patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the Phase II portion of this study is to learn if ATRA when given in combination&#xD;
      with lenalidomide alone or with lenalidomide and dexamethasone can help to control multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In September 2015, the study was terminated due to slow accrual while still a Phase I study,&#xD;
      no additional registration or research performed under the Phase II portion of the study.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you joined this study. Up to 2 groups of up to 3-6 patients participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the Phase I portion of the study, and up to 58 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase I portion, the dose of lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and ATRA&#xD;
      you receive will depend on when you joined this study. The first group of participants will&#xD;
      receive the lowest dose level of the combination. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      of the combination than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This&#xD;
      will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the combination of lenalidomide and ATRA is&#xD;
      found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on&#xD;
      the therapy you were receiving before you began to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you were receiving lenalidomide alone, you will take lenalidomide and ATRA (Group A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you were receiving lenalidomide and dexamethasone when you started this study, you&#xD;
           will take lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and ATRA (Group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study, called induction, will have 3 cycles. After that is the&#xD;
      maintenance part of the study. You will be able to continue on maintenance for as long as the&#xD;
      doctor thinks it is in your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1-21 of each cycle, you will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days 1-21 of each cycle, you will take ATRA by mouth 2 times each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle (+/- 3 days), you will take dexamethasone by&#xD;
           mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1-21 of each cycle, you will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days 1-14 of each cycle, you will take ATRA by mouth 2 times each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group A, on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle (+/- 3 days), you will&#xD;
           take dexamethasone by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a dose of lenalidomide is missed or vomited, you should continue with the regular schedule&#xD;
      of the drug at the next dose, and a missed dose should NOT be made up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide capsules should be swallowed whole, and should not be broken, chewed or opened.&#xD;
      If you take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide, you should seek emergency medical&#xD;
      care if needed and contact study staff right away&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours to check the status of the disease (Day 1 only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between Days 19 and 21 of Cycle 1, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and blood (about 1&#xD;
      teaspoon) will be drawn to measure the levels of certain proteins for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On about Day 1 of Cycles 2-3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure proteins in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your doctor thinks it is needed, the visits may take place more often. You may have extra&#xD;
      visits at any time during the study if your doctor thinks it is needed for your care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Therapy Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a month during Maintenance Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure proteins in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive up to 3 cycles of the study drugs during induction. You may continue taking&#xD;
      the study drugs during maintenance for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over after the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you go off study for any reason, you will have an end-of-study visit. This is usually done&#xD;
      about 30 days after the last dose of the study drugs. At this visit, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine (over 24 hours) will be collected to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. ATRA is FDA approved and commercially available to treat&#xD;
      acute promyelocytic leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available to treat MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is FDA approved and commercially available to treat inflammation and allergic&#xD;
      conditions and to manage the symptoms of several types of leukemia and lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of ATRA, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 70 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
