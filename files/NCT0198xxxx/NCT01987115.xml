  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigger finger is a relatively common disorder affecting the hand. There is limited evidence&#xD;
      on the efficiency of traditional physiotherapy in treating this condition. Fascial&#xD;
      manipulation is a gaining momentum manual therapy method. To our knowledge the efficiency of&#xD;
      fascial manipulation techniques in the treatment of trigger finger was not reported. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to investigate the efficiency of the technique and to compare it&#xD;
      with the traditional physiotherapy treatment.&#xD;

      All adult patients diagnosed with a trigger finger by the primary investigator will be&#xD;
      eligible for the study. Criteria for diagnosing the condition are a history of catching of&#xD;
      the involved finger accompanied by pain over the A1 pulley on the volar aspect of the hand.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include patients with a locked finger (SST Grade IV on the Quinell&#xD;
      classification as modified by Green (18)), age younger than 18, traumatic trigger fingers&#xD;
      (post-surgery or fracture in the distal forearm or hand), patient with low pain tolerance&#xD;
      (hyperalgesia/allodynia etc.), trigger thumbs, multiple (more than 1) and recurrent trigger&#xD;
      fingers or patients who received additional treatments for this finger in the past year,&#xD;
      motor vehicle or work accidents or patients with additional compensation claims, patients&#xD;
      with conditions that may cause secondary catching including tumors involving the finger or&#xD;
      the joint, inflammatory conditions especially rheumatoid arthritis, and patients with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis involving the specific metacarpo-phalangeal joint. Patients who cannot commit&#xD;
      to attend the planned therapeutic sessions will also be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects will be informed of the study and consented will be obtained. The patients&#xD;
      will be randomized in two groups based on drawing a closed envelope from a box containing an&#xD;
      equal number of notes for the respective therapeutic protocols. Each patient will undergo 8&#xD;
      sessions of therapy over a period of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A protocol includes U.S. treatment delivered to the A1 pulley area (3 MHz, over 1cm²,&#xD;
      for 5 minutes), MP and PIP joint mobilization (for 5 minutes), eccentric stretching, and self&#xD;
      exercises at home (self-stretch and self-massage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B protocol will receive fascial manipulation including deep kneading of muscular fascia&#xD;
      at 3 centers of coordination (C.C) at: 1. C.C above the pronator teres muscle. (M.F unit of&#xD;
      INTRA-CUBITUS), 2. C.C above proximal part of pronator quadratus muscle, between the palmaris&#xD;
      longus and the flexor carpi radialis tendons (M.F unit of INTRA-CARPUS), 3. C.C in the&#xD;
      mid-palmar region between metacarpus 3-4 (M.F unit of INTRA-DIGIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data including the age and gender, and previous medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
      The duration of the symptoms and the fingers involved will be noted. The patients will&#xD;
      undergo a brief assessment including the determination of the SST according to the modified&#xD;
      Quinell classification, and the determination of the number of triggering events occurring in&#xD;
      10 active flexion/extension cycles. The grip power (average of 3 times) and pinch will be&#xD;
      measured using dynamometers. An x-ray of the involved hand will be obtained to rule out&#xD;
      concomitant conditions in the hand. The patients will be asked to fill a Quick Dash&#xD;
      questionnaire and a VAS chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar assessment will be repeated at 6 weeks by an independent assessor, who will be&#xD;
      blinded to the protocol which was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months from the end of the treatment a mail survey will be conducted in patients in whom&#xD;
      the treatment succeeded. The survey will include information about recurrence of the&#xD;
      condition (No recurrence, occasional pain or catching, or full recurrence) a VAS scale and&#xD;
      the Quick DASH questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We consider a difference of 1.5 points in VAS between the two treatment groups at 6 weeks to&#xD;
      be clinically significant. Assuming a 20% decrease in VAS with traditional physiotherapy,&#xD;
      considering an α value of 0.05 and a β value of 0.2 to obtain 80% statistical power, and&#xD;
      allowing for a 35% lost to follow-up, we plan to recruit 70 patients for this study, 35&#xD;
      patients in each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be recorded and the statistical analysis will be performed using the Microsoft&#xD;
      Excel Spreadsheet.&#xD;
