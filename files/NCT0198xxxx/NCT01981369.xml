  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effect of Dexmedetomidine sedation on the duration of&#xD;
      infraclavicular block in patients scheduled for surgery of elbow, forearm and/or hand. All&#xD;
      patients will receive infraclavicular block before the surgery and then they will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either Dexmedetomidine or Propofol sedation. Duration of the sensory&#xD;
      block will be evaluated in recovery room, 24 and 48 hours after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Dexmedetomidine sedation increases the duration of sensory infraclavicular block in&#xD;
      patients scheduled for upper limb surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Dexmedetomidine sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gives an adequate level of sedation during the surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduces the requirements of postoperative opioids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improves the quality of sleep on the night of the surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increases patients satisfaction regarding the anesthesia technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexmedetomidine sedation is safe and easy to use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexmedetomidine sedation provides less respiratory depression during the procedure.&#xD;

      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A randomized, prospective, double blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient groups Group 1 (control group) This group will have infraclavicular block and&#xD;
      sedation during surgery with intravenous Propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (intervention group) This group will have infraclavicular block and sedation with&#xD;
      intravenous Dexmedetomidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Informed consent: Recruitment will take place in the preoperative clinic or&#xD;
      surgical day care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: We estimate that 3 patients per week will be eligible and agree to&#xD;
      participate. One year should therefore provide adequate time for study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to present baseline characteristics for the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-test or Mann-Whitney U- test will be used to compare these baseline values between the two&#xD;
      groups. Quantitative data like pain scores and narcotic consumption will be compared using&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVA within the groups and two tailed unpaired t-test between groups (or&#xD;
      Mann- Whitney-U test if skewed distribution). The nonparametric data will be analyzed using&#xD;
      Chi squared test. P less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Continuous&#xD;
      variables will be assessed for normality and will be presented as mean (SD) or median with&#xD;
      interquartile range (IQR) as appropriate. Categorical variables will be assessed using&#xD;
      frequency tables and Fisher's exact test. The interval between the onset of the sensory block&#xD;
      and first analgesic request will be analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol: The study will be performed on patients undergoing ambulatory hand, forearm or&#xD;
      elbow surgery. After informed consent, the patients will be randomized to a study group using&#xD;
      a computer generated random number table and sealed envelope technique. Following this the&#xD;
      patients will be taken to the block room for performing the infraclavicular block, using&#xD;
      standard monitors that will include non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram and pulse&#xD;
      oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive ultrasound guided infraclavicular block with the standard protocol&#xD;
      of the Block Room in St. Joseph Hospital. After the block, the patient will be moved to the&#xD;
      operating room for the surgery where sedation with Dexmedetomidine or Propofol will be&#xD;
      started as per the randomization. In order to blind the patient, the syringe and tubing will&#xD;
      be covered with towels. The patients will be allocated to one of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Patients will receive intravenous Dexmedetomidine sedation bolus 0.5mcg/kg in 10&#xD;
      minutes and then 0.2-0.5 mg/kg/hr infusion. The infusion will be stopped 15 minutes before&#xD;
      the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Patients will receive intravenous Propofol sedation 50-100 mcg/kg/min infusion. The&#xD;
      infusion will be stopped 15 minutes before the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation score and hemodynamic profile during the surgery will be recorded every 15 minutes.&#xD;
      Oxygen will be provided through facial mask. Total dose of narcotic used will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgical procedure, patients will be moved to the Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU),&#xD;
      where an independent blinded observer not involved in the performance of the block or&#xD;
      intraoperative care of the patient, will follow up the patients in the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be assessed for the site and severity of pain at rest at the arrival in the&#xD;
      PACU. Pain score will be the Numerical Rating Score (NRS) on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is no&#xD;
      pain and 10 the worst pain ever experienced. Data regarding duration of surgery and the&#xD;
      duration of stay in PACU will also be collected from the nursing records. Opioids requirement&#xD;
      in PACU will also be collected from these records. Complications, if any will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be assessed for pain at the surgical site at the time of discharge from&#xD;
      PACU. They will also be given a diary to take home. Patient will be educated regarding the&#xD;
      NRS and asked to record in the diary after discharge from the PACU until 20:00 hours. They&#xD;
      will also be asked to record when they require first analgesic dose, the time of return of&#xD;
      sensation in dorsal area of the hand/finger and also the time when they are able to extend&#xD;
      the wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to take their oral rescue analgesic once the pain is score &gt;5/10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by phone 24 hours and 48 hours after their time of arrival in PACU&#xD;
      (time 0). They will be reminded regarding entry in the diary. They will also be asked about&#xD;
      quality of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction will be documented at 24 and 48 hours on a visual analogue scale where 0&#xD;
      is totally dissatisfied and 100 is totally satisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total participation time for the patients is for 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation The sample size is calculated for the primary outcome measure, which&#xD;
      is the duration of the sensory block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of sensory infraclavicular block when the local anesthetic is Ropivacaine is 402&#xD;
      (± 183) minutes (Abdallah et al. Anesthesiology 2016; 124:683-95). With an equivalence limit&#xD;
      (d) of 180 minutes and the calculation of the sample size with the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = f(α, β) × 2 × σ2 / d2 (non-inferiority) and n = f(α/2, β) × 2 × σ2 / (μ1 - μ2)2&#xD;
      (superiority) This showed 27 patients per group (non-inferiority) and 32 patients per group&#xD;
      (superiority), were required to ensure adequate sample size with an α of 2.5% and 95% power.&#xD;
      We plan to have 50 patients per group, considering a high non-compliance rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: This will be performed using a computer generated randomization and closed&#xD;
      envelope system. Patients will be randomized on the day of the surgical procedure. This study&#xD;
      will be double blind because patients, anesthesiologist performing the infraclavicular block&#xD;
      and the evaluator in the postoperative setting will not know the allocation group. The&#xD;
      anesthesiologist providing the sedation in the Operating Room will prepare the sedative&#xD;
      agents (Propofol and/or Dexmedetomidine) and will cover the infusions with drapes (Propofol&#xD;
      is a white solution, the only way to hide it is to cover it with drapes). This person will&#xD;
      not be blinded but will also not be part of the study.&#xD;
