    <textblock>
      Education for Equity (E4E)intervention intends to improve care delivery through a well&#xD;
      designed educational program that address not only the issues of diabetes care delivery to&#xD;
      Aboriginal patients with diabetes, but also the issues of effective cross-cultural and&#xD;
      culturally safe communication between healthcare providers and Aboriginal patients, and the&#xD;
      issues related to effective implementation of appropriate chronic disease management programs&#xD;
      for Aboriginal patients in a range of practice settings. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the E4E education program through measuring patient clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, patient experience with their doctors, and the changes in physicians' approaches to&#xD;
      care perceived by Aboriginal diabetic patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two waves of the E4E intervention will be delivered to family physicians who have Aboriginal&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes on and off reserves. A mix-method approach will be employed in&#xD;
      this evaluation study. Evaluation instruments include: (1) chart reviews and (2) patient&#xD;
      experience surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Chart review: A randomized, controlled, pre- and post intervention study design will be&#xD;
           used to evaluate the effect of the E4E intervention on type 2 diabetes clinical outcomes&#xD;
           of the Aboriginal patients. A retrospective chart audit will be used to gather the&#xD;
           clinical data from 12 months prior to and 12 month after the intervention, not including&#xD;
           the time during intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample Size for chart review: The primary outcome measure of HbA1C value will be used to&#xD;
           identify the impact of E4E intervention on the clinical outcome of Aboriginal patients&#xD;
           with type 2 diabetes. It is hypothesized that the A1C value would be reduced in the E4E&#xD;
           Intervention Group's patients whose A1C values are at or above 8.0% prior to the E4E&#xD;
           intervention (baseline) compared to the patients in E4E Late Intervention Control Group.&#xD;
           A 0.5% difference of patients' A1C values between these two groups will be a clinically&#xD;
           significant difference. The sample size needed to detect such a difference is estimated&#xD;
           to be 98 eligible patients charts with A1C at or above 8.0% from E4E Intervention Group&#xD;
           and 98 eligible patient charts from E4E Late Intervention Control Group, with an a=0.05&#xD;
           and ß=0.15. Given the proportion of 61.1% of Aboriginal patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
           having A1C at or above 8.0%, we need to review 163 patient charts to obtain 98 eligible&#xD;
           charts from each group. When 10 charts extractions per physician are performed, we need&#xD;
           17 physicians from each group. Considering a possible 20% loss to follow up, we need to&#xD;
           recruit 20 physicians from E4E Intervention Group and 20 physicians from E4E Late&#xD;
           Intervention Control Group, a total of 40 physicians to be invited to participate in&#xD;
           chart reviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment of physicians: After obtaining ethics approval from Queen's University&#xD;
           Research Office, we will recruit 8-10 physicians to participate in the project at each&#xD;
           potential site. Once recruitment is completed on each site, physicians will be&#xD;
           randomized into E4E Intervention Group and E4E Late Intervention Control Group (sham&#xD;
           comparator) who will participate in the second wave of E4E intervention 12 month later.&#xD;
           Letters of information and consent form will be sent to the physicians to obtain their&#xD;
           signed consent to participating in E4E chart review, patient survey and patient&#xD;
           interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection regarding chart reviews for diabetes: The evaluation team will require&#xD;
           the consenting physicians to create a list of all of their Aboriginal patients with type&#xD;
           2 diabetes using billing code 250, removing non-Aboriginal patients. This process can&#xD;
           either be managed by the practice (with staff being reimbursed for time required) or can&#xD;
           be conducted by the research staff at time of the chart audit. Each physician will then&#xD;
           be asked to review the list for accuracy. Random number generation will be used to&#xD;
           select charts at random from the list until the required number of eligible patient&#xD;
           charts has been identified. Chart reviewers will be trained staff from the evaluation&#xD;
           team and travel to each selected location to conduct chart audits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient experience survey: Two (2) patient experience surveys will be conducted to&#xD;
           evaluate the experience of Aboriginal patient with type 2 diabetes with his/her&#xD;
           physician, respectively at the point of 3-month after the E4E intervention and at the&#xD;
           point of 12-month after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size for patient experience surveys: An effective sample size needed for patient&#xD;
      experience survey, with an a=0.05 and power 85% (ß=0.15), is estimated to be 102 eligible&#xD;
      Aboriginal type 2 diabetic patients from E4E Intervention Group and the same number of&#xD;
      eligible Aboriginal patients from E4E Late Intervention Control Group. We will recruit 10&#xD;
      eligible Aboriginal patients from each of the physicians in E4E Group A and 10 eligible&#xD;
      Aboriginal patients from each of the physicians in E4E Group B. A total of 400 patients will&#xD;
      be recruited to participate in Patient Experience surveys. This sample size (200 from each&#xD;
      group) is more than sufficient to achieve 85% power even after allowing for drop out of&#xD;
      physicians and any unanticipated difficulties in patient recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection regarding patient experience surveys: The Patient Experience Surveys will&#xD;
      take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete and will be completed on the day of patient&#xD;
      visit. Patient Experience Survey is designed in two sections: pre-visit section and post&#xD;
      visit section. Consent needs to be obtained from patients in pre-visit section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The receptionist of the selected practice will notify eligible patients about the study,&#xD;
           and ask if they are willing to discuss with support/research staff about participating&#xD;
           in a Patient Experience Survey. If the patient is interested, the receptionist will&#xD;
           refer her/him to the onsite support/research staff, or provide access to a private phone&#xD;
           with toll free number to contact support/research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Support/Research staff will review the information letter with the patient and obtain&#xD;
           informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient completes the pre-visit section and sign on the consent before seeing the&#xD;
           doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After seeing the doctor, the patient will be asked to complete the post-visit survey and&#xD;
           return it to the support/research staff before leaving the clinic. For patients who are&#xD;
           not able to do so, they will be offered a choice to complete the survey by toll free&#xD;
           telephone or fill in a hard copy of questionnaire and mail it out by pre-paid mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular updates will be performed during data collection process to keep tack of&#xD;
           patients participation in the survey.&#xD;
