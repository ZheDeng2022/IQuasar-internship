      This is a Open label, two-arm, randomized, two agent, single center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product(s), Dose, Route, Regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bavituximab 3mg/kg IVqwk (IV every week) x 14 plus ipilimumab 3mg/kg IVq3wk (IV every 3&#xD;
      weeks) x 4 or ipilimumab 3mg/kg IVq3wk x 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of the following arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A-Bavituximab 3mg/kg IV over 90 minutes weekly x 2 followed by Bavituximab 3mg/kg IV over&#xD;
      90 minutes weekly x 12 plus ipilimumab 3mg/kg IV over 90 minutes every 3 weeks x 4. Total&#xD;
      number of treated patients will be 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B-Arm B-Ipilimumab 3mg/kg IV over 90 minutes day 1 followed three weeks later by&#xD;
      ipilimumab every 3 weeks x 3. Total number of treated patients will be 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 2:1 randomization of patients to have a 3 week lead-in treatment with&#xD;
      bavituximab followed by combination therapy of ipilimumab + bavituximab versus ipilimumab&#xD;
      alone. The assigned treatment will be given once subject is registered successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicities will be assessed via NCI's CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events)&#xD;
      v4.1 toxicity criteria. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be defined as drug-related grade&#xD;
      3-5 adverse events experienced within the first 12 weeks of study treatment. The maximal&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) will be exceeded if more than 30% of patients on the study experience&#xD;
      DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCR will be measured by irRC (Immune-related Complete Response) at weeks 15, 21, 27 using the&#xD;
      published algorithm. Disease control rate (DCR) includes complete response (CR), Partial&#xD;
      response (PR) and stable disease (SD). Months of survival (MOS) is measured from date of&#xD;
      entry into protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor MDSC (Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells), TAM and Treg content will be measured by IHC&#xD;
      (ImmunoHistoChemistry). Circulating MDSC, TAM and Treg content will be measured by flow&#xD;
      cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood cytokines will be measured by EIA (EIA test is a series of blood tests for&#xD;
      diagnosing HIV infection).&#xD;
