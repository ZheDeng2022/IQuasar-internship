      A prospective, open, multicenter,demonstrative of PrEP, which aims to assess the&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility and safety from chemoprophylaxis co-formulated emtricitabine /&#xD;
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC / TDF) administered orally, once daily, to MSM and&#xD;
      transgender women . The demonstration project aims to include 400 participants over 12&#xD;
      months, with 200 at IPEC-Fiocruz, 100 at CRT-SP and 100 at USP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects preliminarily eligible who choose to receive PrEP will be included after obtaining&#xD;
      the informed consent and confirmation of eligibility within 45 days after the screening&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once included, participants will be examined in a follow-up visit performed four weeks later&#xD;
      and evaluated for evidence of seroconversion to HIV, medication compliance and clinical&#xD;
      toxicity. The second follow-up visit will occur at 12th week and every 12 weeks successively&#xD;
      (quarterly). Quarterly visits include HIV testing, serum creatinine and counseling on&#xD;
      medication compliance and risk reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a total of 6 visits. In all visits will be assessed the risks, HIV testing will&#xD;
      be performed, monitoring of renal function and dispensing of the drug Truvada [emtricitabine&#xD;
      1 tablet (FTC) / tenofovir (TDF) (200/300 mg) once a day orally for 12 months].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have completed 12 months of follow-up or prematurely discontinue a PrEP will&#xD;
      be encouraged to return for a follow-up visit after discontinuation of medication for&#xD;
      monitoring of the status and evaluation of HIV as the resolution of side effects.&#xD;
