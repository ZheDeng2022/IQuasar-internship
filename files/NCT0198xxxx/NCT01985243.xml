  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent economic growth in Ghana, the prevalence of childhood malnutrition remains&#xD;
      high. Wasting prevalence affected 29% among 6- to 8-months-old infants in 2008. Poor&#xD;
      nutrition contributes to about one-third of child mortality, diminishes cognitive&#xD;
      development, and is a major determinant of maternal mortality. The specific objectives of the&#xD;
      5-year project are to: (1) enhance human capacity of government, civil, and private&#xD;
      institutions through improvement of knowledge and skills of personnel in agriculture,&#xD;
      nutrition and health, entrepreneurship, and pedagogy; (2) identify information needs of local&#xD;
      institutions that are not presently met and develop a representative and sustainable&#xD;
      longitudinal data system to support evidence-based decision-making in programs; (3) increase&#xD;
      vulnerable households' access to quality services in agriculture/fisheries, nutrition and&#xD;
      health, and finance; (4) implement integrated intervention activities to improve infant and&#xD;
      young child and adolescent nutrition outcomes; and (5) examine differential benefits of the&#xD;
      interventions for diverse vulnerable populations. The project comprises two major activities:&#xD;
      part I - the creation of a longitudinal data system to support evidence-based decision-making&#xD;
      in programs, and part II - the implementation of intervention activities to improve nutrition&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will include demographic, socioeconomic, health, diet, and nutritional status&#xD;
      information collected annually from a representative same of 1500 households with infants&#xD;
      (0-12 mo) and 1500 households with adolescents (9-12 y). The data will be analyzed and&#xD;
      presented rapidly each year to district program and policy leaders to assist them in&#xD;
      developing their activity plans for the following year.&#xD;

      This study will develop a district-level intervention package that builds capacity of local&#xD;
      institutions to improve economic well-being, food security, health and social and cognitive&#xD;
      development of populations living in rural Upper Manya Krobo District (UMKD) of Ghana. The&#xD;
      UMKD Geographic Information Systems Registry estimates a rural population of 74,290 in 190&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Of those UMKD communities that are accessible, 136 communities will be randomly&#xD;
           selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All households with infants 0-12 mo of age in a village will be invited to be enrolled.&#xD;
           We will continue to enroll households until we reach our sample size of 1500 households.&#xD;
           If necessary, we will expand our number of sampled communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All households with adolescents 10-15 y of age in a village, who are not part of the&#xD;
           infant cohort, will be invited to be enrolled. We will continue to enroll households&#xD;
           until we reach our sample size of 1500 households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment The survey will be carried out over one day for each community. The field staff&#xD;
      will briefly explain the purpose and study activity to the caregiver (parent or legal&#xD;
      guardian who is responsible for the child) of the target child. If the caregiver is&#xD;
      interested in participating, they will be given the consent form to read, or if illiterate,&#xD;
      the consent form will be read to them. They will be given time to ask questions and decide if&#xD;
      they wish to participate. For those who consent, they will sign the consent form or provide&#xD;
      their finger print as proof of consent. Adolescents will be asked to provide assent. Only&#xD;
      once consent (and assent for adolescents) is obtained, will the field staff begin the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The annual survey will consist of questions (drafts are attached) on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the household demographics, socioeconomic status, agricultural production, government&#xD;
           services use,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. mother's caregiving practices, microcredit use, business activities, physical and mental&#xD;
           health, anthropometry (weight, height), iron status&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. infant's diet, anthropometry (weight, height, circumference), iron status&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. adolescent's diet, anthropometry (weight, height, circumference), iron status,&#xD;
           educational activities, finance knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will be administered in the home with the child's caregiver, in a private&#xD;
      location. THe adolescent will be interviewed privately unless the mother requests to be&#xD;
      present. It is expected to be about 60-90 minutes in length. All data will be recorded solely&#xD;
      with the study identification number. The participant's name and home address will be kept&#xD;
      secure and separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THe interventions will take place with a subgroup of those participating in the annual&#xD;
      survey. Our two main integrated interventions target critical periods of the life course when&#xD;
      gender inequalities can have important effects on the short-term and long-term health of both&#xD;
      men and women. Our first intervention which will begin in January 2014 will offer intensive&#xD;
      nutrition, health, and agricultural training, along with provision of home gardens and small&#xD;
      animal husbandry to about 302 of our households with at least one child under the age of 1 y.&#xD;
      As these will be household-level interventions, both men and women and male and female&#xD;
      infants (and older siblings) living in these households will benefit from this intervention.&#xD;
      We will assess the extent to which women retain decision-making authority about the&#xD;
      allocation of these agricultural resources and whether they benefit their children's health&#xD;
      and nutrition, using our primary indicators of child diet and nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our second integrated intervention will focus on reducing anemia among female school-aged&#xD;
      children. The intervention will start after the baseline with the beginning of the school&#xD;
      year, September 2014. These interventions will benefit both girls and boys as boys also&#xD;
      suffer from high rates of anaemia in this district and both sexes continue to have a high&#xD;
      burden of parasitic infections. In addition, since older girls (starting in primary grade 4)&#xD;
      are less likely to stay in school and, hence, are disadvantaged with respect to their access&#xD;
      to these programs, we plan to implement a savings account intervention for girls who&#xD;
      successfully complete primary grade 5. The amount of the savings account will be relatively&#xD;
      small (e.g., to cover school uniforms) but along with opening these savings accounts girls&#xD;
      will gain financial literacy and learn the importance of savings accounts and budgets.&#xD;
      Increasing girls' education is one of the most effective ways to decrease child mortality.&#xD;
      According to a recent study, about half of the decline in child mortality in developing&#xD;
      countries since 1979 can be attributed to women's increased education. Moreover, since our&#xD;
      integrated intervention will include means to improve iron status of the girls, , we expect&#xD;
      to significantly lower rates of preconception rates of anaemia among these girls. This&#xD;
      intervention will help meet one of the key recommendations of The Lancet Maternal and Child&#xD;
      Nutrition Series, which notes that &quot;A clear need exists to introduce promising evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions in the preconception period and in adolescents in countries with a high burden&#xD;
      of undernutrition and young age at first pregnancies&quot; .&#xD;
