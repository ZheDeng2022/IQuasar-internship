      The purpose of this study is to measure and link cadence (number of steps taken in a minute)&#xD;
      to intensity of physical activity (e.g., low-intensity, moderate-intensity,&#xD;
      vigorous-intensity) in children and adolescents (6-20 years-old), and to identify the cadence&#xD;
      values corresponding to children's and adolescent's behavior during simulated free-living&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;

      Procedure - 1 visit - (approximately 3 hours in total)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of Testing: Participant must be FASTED - No food for 4 hours before visit. All of the&#xD;
      study procedures involving the participant will be completed in a single testing session&#xD;
      (one-day - approximately 3 hours) at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. If preferred,&#xD;
      two visits on separate days can be scheduled to complete the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening questions (approximately 3-5 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Participants (or their legal guardian) will be asked to answer several screening&#xD;
           questions to determine their eligibility for participating in CADENCE-KIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and weight measures data collection (approximately 10 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Height will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Body weight and body fat percentage will be measured using a specialized scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Waist circumference will then be measured using a measuring tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instrument attachment, treadmill walking, free-living activities (approximately 140&#xD;
           minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be fitted with 10 devices (Digi-Walker Pedometer, NL-1000&#xD;
                Pedometer, StepWatch Activity Monitor, SenseWear Armband, GT3X+ accelerometer,&#xD;
                GENEActiv Accelerometer, Actical Accelerometer, ActivPal Accelerometer, Polar Heart&#xD;
                Rate Monitor, K4b2 Portable Metabolic Unit) to measure/monitor physical activity&#xD;
                throughout the testing session.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will then complete several low intensity free-living activities while&#xD;
                their physical activity and oxygen uptake are concurrently assessed. Specifically,&#xD;
                participants will rest in a chair, watch a portion of a child-friendly movie while&#xD;
                seated in a chair, and color in a coloring book while seated in a chair. Each&#xD;
                activity will last for 5 minutes and a 2 minute rest will occur between each&#xD;
                activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will then complete a series of walking bouts on a treadmill while&#xD;
                their physical activity and oxygen uptake are concurrently assessed. The walking&#xD;
                bouts start at 0.5 miles per hour and end at 5 miles per hour (0.5 miles per hour&#xD;
                increments). Treadmill testing stops when the participant finishes the bout where&#xD;
                they naturally select to jog/run, or following the completion of the last bout at&#xD;
                5.0 miles per hour, whichever occurs first. A 2 minute rest will occur between each&#xD;
                treadmill bout.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will then complete three additional free-living activities where&#xD;
                physical activity and oxygen uptake continue to be concurrently measured.&#xD;
                Specifically, participants will step up and down on an aerobic step at 88 beats per&#xD;
                minute, dribble a basketball, and perform jumping jacks at 126 beats per minute (63&#xD;
                jumping jacks per minute). Each activity will last for 5 minutes and a 2 minute&#xD;
                rest will occur between each activity.&#xD;
