  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe trauma induces massive metabolic changes that are characterized by hypermetabolism&#xD;
      with increased energy expenditure and catabolism. Early enteral and, if necessary, parenteral&#xD;
      feeding is a major focus of modern intensive care medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After acute spinal cord injury, denervation of skeletal muscle leads to a massive loss of&#xD;
      muscle mass in the area below the level of injury. This dramatic muscle atrophy again leads&#xD;
      to a decrease in energy expenditure. Whereas other survivors of severe trauma typically&#xD;
      regain muscle mass during rehabilitation, spinal cord injury patients typically continue to&#xD;
      lose muscle mass over time, which also leads to changes in body composition. The time course&#xD;
      of these changes is not known. Continuing nutrition without adaption to the reduced energy&#xD;
      expenditure leads to weight gain and adiposity, exposing many chronic spinal cord injury&#xD;
      patients to the known unfavorable metabolic consequences. Knowledge of the time course of&#xD;
      these changes would help to provide adequate caloric intake to the patients and improve our&#xD;
      ability for nutrition counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan a prospective clinical trial in 25 acute spinal cord injury patients&#xD;
      to determine the changes in energy expenditure and body composition. Major inclusion criteria&#xD;
      are acute traumatic spinal cord injury, age 18-70, neurological level above L1, AIS (American&#xD;
      Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale) A, B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of energy expenditure, body composition and nutritional markers in venous blood&#xD;
      are scheduled 2, 6, 10 and 14 weeks after spinal cord injury and at the end of rehabilitation&#xD;
      (at the latest after 26 weeks).&#xD;
