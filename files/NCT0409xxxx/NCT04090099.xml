  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate pain relief after cardiac surgery increases morbidity and results in a high&#xD;
      incidence of persistent poststernotomy pain syndrome. The use of special opioid-based&#xD;
      analgesia causes adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, sedation, urinary retention,&#xD;
      respiratory depression and delayed tracheal extubation. Regional anesthesia techniques such&#xD;
      as pectoralis nerve block and serratus anterior block provide analgesia in the sternum and&#xD;
      pain relief in the lateral / posterior chest Wall. Erector spinae (ESP) block, a new and&#xD;
      simple myofascial block, provides wide multi-dermatomal sensory block. In the T5 spinous&#xD;
      process, bilateral ESP block provides analgesia from T2 to T9 sensory level, resulting in&#xD;
      both somatic and visceral analgesia by blocking both the dorsal and ventral of the spinal&#xD;
      nerves, including the sympathetic chain. This block may provide adequate analgesia for median&#xD;
      sternotomy because the main nerve supply to the sternal region is from T2 to T6. Median&#xD;
      sternotomy incision and mediastinal tube regions are the major source of pain in patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery. The anterior and posterior branches of the intercostal nerves&#xD;
      give nerves to the sternum. Parasternal local anesthetic infiltration around the sternum is&#xD;
      effective in providing early postoperative analgesia and reducing opioid requirements and&#xD;
      therefore has positive effects on healing. This simple and fast technique can be used even&#xD;
      for anticoagulated patients.&#xD;

      99 patients will be included in the study. Group C (Control, n = 31), Group ES (Erector&#xD;
      Spina, n = 31), Group PV (Paravertebral n = 31) will be randomized. A researcher will present&#xD;
      the patient distribution to patients in a sealed envelope (1: 1: 1 distribution ratio). This&#xD;
      envelope will be opened in the preoperative preparation room. It will be explained that&#xD;
      patients can receive both intravenous analgesia treatment and both blocks that are thought to&#xD;
      be done. Patients will be told to express the degree of postoperative pain in the&#xD;
      preoperative preparation room using a numerical scoring scale (NRS) between 0 and 10 (no pain&#xD;
      at 0, no pain at 10). The vascular access will be opened in the pre-operative preparation&#xD;
      room and 2 mg demizolam will be made. All preoperative cardiac drugs, except antiplatelet and&#xD;
      anticoagulants, will be continued until the morning of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic structures, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross clamp time, surgical time,&#xD;
      ejection / fraction values will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight and height of patients will be recorded (BMI). Preoperative, blood group and typing,&#xD;
      full hemogram, liver function tests, renal function tests, chest radiography,&#xD;
      electrocardiography, 2D transthoracic echocardiography and coronary angiography will be done&#xD;
      as routine investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet count, bleeding time, clotting time, prothrombin time, activated partial&#xD;
      thromboplastin time will be checked in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constructional blocks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ESP (Erector Spina Plane) Block Group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 2. Parasternal Block Group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control Group The control group will not receive any Erector Spina block and&#xD;
           Paravertebral Block. Only PCA (Patient Control Analgesia) and intravenous analgesic&#xD;
           (Morphine) drug will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same surgical and anesthesia team will manage the patients. 6 channel ECG and&#xD;
      non-invasive arterial pressure monitoring will be performed after the patients are admitted&#xD;
      to the operation room. A peripheral intravenous line with a 16-gauge needle and a right&#xD;
      radial artery with a 20-gauge needle will be performed. Blood will be taken for preoperative&#xD;
      blood gas. Midazolam 0.01 (mg / kg), fentanyl (5-8 μg / kg) and rocuronium (0.6 mg / kg) will&#xD;
      be used for induction of anesthesia. After anesthesia, central venous catheter and urinary&#xD;
      catheter will be inserted. During general anesthesia Sevoflurane will be used in the&#xD;
      air-oxygen mixture with a concentration of 50% oxygen. Normocapnic variation will be provided&#xD;
      (PCO2 = 35-45). A rocuronium 0.6 mg / kg will be used every 30 minutes. All patients will&#xD;
      undergo median sternotomy. Heparin 300-500 Units / kg to be administered. Activeted clotting&#xD;
      time (ACT) will be kept&gt; 400 throughout the procedure. Esophageal temperature will be&#xD;
      monitored. The mean arterial pressure throughout the operation will be maintained above 60 mm&#xD;
      Hg. Peroperative blood sample will be taken from the radial artery 3-5 minutes after the&#xD;
      cross-clamp is removed. Heparin will be neutralized with protamine 1: 1.3. After the&#xD;
      operation, patients will be transferred to the intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intensive care unit, patients will be extubated when the respiratory effort occurs,&#xD;
      when the patient is awake, blood gas values are within normal range, body temperature is&#xD;
      normal and hemodynamically stable. Morphine consumption by PCA and NRS scores will be&#xD;
      monitored and recorded at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours after extübation. MAP (Mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure), PH, PO2 (Blood gas) follow-ups will be recorded in the first blood gas, extubation&#xD;
      and postoperative 1,2, 4,6,12, 24 hours.Paracetamol 1 g and Tramadol 1mg/kg intravenously&#xD;
      will be administered to the patient if NRS&gt; 3 when the patient is extubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient's consciousness and hemodynamic status do not allow pain assessment, the&#xD;
      patient will be excluded from the study. After the surgery, the investigator who evaluates&#xD;
      NRS scores in the ICU will not know which group the patient is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral feeding at postoperative hour, intensive care unit stay day, Side effects Nausea,&#xD;
      Vomiting, Itching to be followed&#xD;
