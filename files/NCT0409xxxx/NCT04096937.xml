  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rural youth have heightened exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACES) such as poverty,&#xD;
      social isolation, chronic hunger, and drug use in the home. These threats can lead to&#xD;
      downstream problems with emotion regulation, substance abuse, and heightened vulnerability to&#xD;
      chronic disease. Resilience is the capacity to adapt positively in the face of such&#xD;
      disadvantage. Youth resilience interventions can buffer the negative effects of ACES.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, rural schools and other youth-serving agencies often have inadequate capacity&#xD;
      to provide such interventions. Thus, there is a critical need to develop cost-effective,&#xD;
      sustainable, and culturally-relevant youth resilience interventions that can be delivered by&#xD;
      trained personnel with dedicated time and resources. WVU, UK, and Save The Children have a&#xD;
      long-term goal to establish a sustained community-engaged research partnership to promote&#xD;
      resilience in Appalachian youth. This is a community-based participatory research&#xD;
      (CBPR)-guided study being conducted for the purpose of developing a culturally relevant,&#xD;
      intervention to promote Appalachian youth resilience. The intervention, called Journey of&#xD;
      Hope in Appalachia (JOHA), has as it's starting point Save The Children's evidence-based&#xD;
      Journey of Hope (JOH) program that targets youth experiencing acute stress from natural&#xD;
      disasters and similar events. This program will be culturally adapted to promote resilience&#xD;
      among Appalachian youth experiencing ACES. JOHA will incorporate positive aspects of&#xD;
      Appalachian culture (e.g., storytelling, theater, music) and will be designed for&#xD;
      sustainability and eventual dissemination by Save through the Appalachian Translational&#xD;
      Research Network (ATRN) and other regional Networks.&#xD;
