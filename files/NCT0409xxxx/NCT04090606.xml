  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal addresses several research priorities related to the regulatory authority of&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products as mandated by the Family&#xD;
      Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. Scientific evidence supports the important role&#xD;
      of tobacco and cigarette smoke carcinogens in the development of cancers associated with&#xD;
      cigarette smoking. Regulation of the levels of harmful constituents in cigarette smoke is one&#xD;
      of the tobacco control strategies that now can be employed by the FDA and may serve to reduce&#xD;
      tobacco carcinogen exposures in those smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit smoking.&#xD;
      Such regulation will require a valid and robust approach to the assessment of comparative&#xD;
      toxicity and carcinogenicity among various cigarette brands. This proposal will help develop&#xD;
      a testing approach that can produce meaningful predictions of changes in human exposure due&#xD;
      to changes in constituent levels in cigarette smoke, and hence serve as a reliable measure&#xD;
      for product regulation. Thus, the proposed research will generate findings and data that are&#xD;
      directly relevant to inform the FDA's regulation of the manufacture, distribution, and&#xD;
      marketing of tobacco products to protect public health. The human trial deals with Aims 2 and&#xD;
      3 of this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female adult smokers 18-65 years of age, who smoke at least 7 cigarettes per&#xD;
             day (to assure that biomarker levels are above the limit of quantitation) and do not&#xD;
             have plans to quit smoking in the next month;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoked the same brand for &gt;80% of their cigarettes over the course of at least 1 year,&#xD;
             and smoked not more than 20 cigarettes (1 pack) of a different brand within two weeks&#xD;
             prior to the eligibility screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not using any other nicotine or tobacco product;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are not taking any medications that affect relevant metabolic enzymes;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are not pregnant or nursing;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects have provided written informed consent to participate in the study&#xD;
             (adolescents under the age of 18 will be excluded because this project involves use of&#xD;
             tobacco products).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant immune system disorders, respiratory diseases, kidney or liver diseases or&#xD;
             any other medical disorders that may affect biomarker data;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent alcohol or drug abuse problems (to ensure alcohol and drug use does&#xD;
             not affect biomarkers of exposure and to maximize retention);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular tobacco use (e.g., greater than weekly) other than cigarettes;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently using nicotine replacement or other tobacco cessation products (to minimize&#xD;
             confounding effects of another product);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding (due to toxic effects from tobacco products)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Report smoking more than 1 pack (20 cigarettes) of a non-usual brand cigarette in the&#xD;

             the day before the clinic visit will be ineligible&#xD;
