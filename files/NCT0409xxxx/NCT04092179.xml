    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see how safe and tolerable, and to find the highest&#xD;
      or best dose, of an investigational combination of drugs called enasidenib and venetoclax, in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed (the cancer has come back) or refractory (the cancer does not respond&#xD;
      or have stopped responding to treatment) acute myeloid leukemia (AML, a type of blood&#xD;
      cancer). This study will also see how useful the combination of enasidenib and venetoclax is&#xD;
      in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will have two parts: Phase 1b and Phase 2. The part that patients may participate&#xD;
      in will depend on when they join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 1b portion of the study, small groups participants will receive increasing doses&#xD;
      of venetoclax in combination with a flat dose of enadisenib until the highest dose or best&#xD;
      dose of venetoclax that is safe and tolerable in combination with enadisenib is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 2 portion of the study, an additional group of participants will receive the&#xD;
      highest or best dose of venetoclax found in the Phase 1b portion of the study with a flat&#xD;
      dose of enadisenib to see how useful the combination is in treating relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;

    <description>Enasidenib and venetoclax will be taken by mouth (orally), once a day, every day, continuously.&#xD;
Every 28-day period will be called a cycle. Participants will start venetoclax alone on Cycle 1 Day 1 and continue the study drug alone until Day 15. On Day 15, participants will take enasidenib and venetoclax together and will continue to take the combination of study drugs until intolerable side effects or disease worsening.</description>

    <intervention_name>Enasidenib</intervention_name>
    <description>Enasidenib is a drug that blocks a protein called isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 2 from working. The family of IDH proteins have been indicated in the development of leukemia. By blocking IDH2, enasidenib may help stop cancer cells from growing. It is believed that the drug may be more useful in patients with a change (mutation) in their IDH 2 protein. The IDH2 gene (substances in the body that contain instructions for the proper development and function of cells) makes IDH2 proteins. As such, only patients with IDH 2 mutated gene are eligible for this study. Enasidenib is currently approved for the treatment of IDH2 mutated AML.</description>

    <description>Venetoclax is a drug that blocks a protein called B-cell lymphoma (BCL2) protein from working. BCL2 is a protein that helps control whether a cell lives or dies and is thought to help cancer cells to live. Blocking BCL2 is believed to help kill cancer cells. Venetoclax is currently approved for the treatment of type of blood cancer called chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received prior treatment.</description>
