      Which technique is best for partial hip replacement?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim of study: To compare two ways of performing partial hip replacement to see which one&#xD;
      allows patients to mobilise better and gives patients improved function after surgery. The&#xD;
      best approach is more likely to allow patients to maintain their independence and return to&#xD;
      their own homes after their injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: When someone breaks their hip they often need a partial hip replacement, also&#xD;
      known as hemiarthroplasty. To perform this operation surgeons need to cut through some&#xD;
      muscles to expose the hip joint and perform the partial replacement. Currently, clinical&#xD;
      guidelines suggest that this operation should be performed using a technique which involves&#xD;
      cutting muscles and tendons from the side of the hip. This is called the lateral approach.&#xD;
      Alternatively, a newer, modified technique can be used leaving all the major muscles intact&#xD;
      and this may cause fewer problems for the patient. There is no research evidence to prove&#xD;
      which approach is more beneficial. Patients and carers looking for information about this are&#xD;
      likely to become confused by the many opinions of surgeons speaking about preferred&#xD;
      techniques. It is therefore important to find out which technique is better for patients,&#xD;
      based on research rather than opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: We will randomly allocate patients who agree to be part of the study to have&#xD;
      one of the two techniques to partial hip replacement. We can then compare the impact of the&#xD;
      two techniques on how well and fully patients mobilise, the level of pain they experience,&#xD;
      and the safety of the techniques. We will also contact a number of patients from both&#xD;
      treatment groups to discuss their experience of the surgery in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and public involvement: This study was inspired by patients who said that mobility&#xD;
      and speed to regaining independence are the most important outcomes after surgery. Patients&#xD;
      and carers will continue to be involved throughout this study, to ensure that the study&#xD;
      results are relevant and important to people at risk of breaking their hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination: We will publish the results of this study widely in scientific and other&#xD;
      publications accessable to patients and all involved in the treatment of patients with hip&#xD;
      fractures. We will work with surgeons, carers and patients to ensure all appropriate networks&#xD;
      are aware of the results and that the outcomes are disseminated in an accessible way so that&#xD;
      practices can be changed based on the results of this study.&#xD;

    <measure>Oxford Hip Score (OHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post operative day 120</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Hip Score is a short patient-reported measure of function and pain following hip surgery (Dawson 1996).&#xD;

    <measure>De Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post operative day 3 and 120</time_frame>
    <description>The De Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI) assessment tool is a functional test that has been validated for acute hip fracture patient rehabilitation (De Morton 2013) and can be used in the early and late post-operative phases. In particular, it measures patient mobility with no reported ceiling effect. It is completed by a research nurse; hence cognitive impairment of the patient need not prevent its use.&#xD;
Raw Score Scale: 0-19 DEMMI Score Scale: 0-100 With higher scores indicating a better outcome</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulated Ambulation Score (CAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post operative day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Cumulated Ambulation Score (CAS) is a simple functional tool where patients are assessed daily on their ambulatory capacity by the treating rehabilitation team during the first three post-operative days, having been validated for use with acute hip fracture rehabilitation (Foss et al. 2006) and is intended to be used in the early rehabilitation phase, being applicable to patients of all cognitive levels. It will serve as a secondary outcome of which criteria are readily available in patients' records and will ensure no potential floor effect of evaluation from the DEMMI score.&#xD;
CAS Score Scale Range: 0-18, with higher scores indicating better outcomes</description>

Before the operation the surgical team make a clinically informed decision about whether the patient is able to consent to the operation themselves (not impaired) or lacks capacity (impaired) and will need a consultee to consent to surgery on their behalf. The outcome of this assessment (which is derived using the Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT)) is detailed in the patient's medical notes. A broad categorisation of 'impaired' (if patient required a consultee to consent to surgery) or not impaired (if patient was able to consent to surgery themselves) will be derived from the patient's medical notes, and recorded for this study.</description>
