    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia or Fibromyalgic Sindrome (FMS) is a chronic debilitating pain syndrome,&#xD;
      characterized by widespread chronic musculoskeletal pain and generalized painful&#xD;
      hypersensitivity, which may be associated with systemic, cognitive and psycho-emotional&#xD;
      somatic disorders. Etiology is not completely known. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is&#xD;
      anamnestic and clinical, without evident alterations at the objective examination or at&#xD;
      laboratory and radiology investigations. According last guidelines, the best approach to&#xD;
      treat FMS must be personalized and multidisciplinary, including pharmacological and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological interventions. Moreover, a correct treatment of comorbidities, practice&#xD;
      of bland physical activity or meditative discipline, as well as a pychological support are&#xD;
      very important in FMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the activity of some common therapeutic pathways&#xD;
      available for FMS: acupuncture and nutraceutical products; the latter are numerous on the&#xD;
      market and based on powerful antioxidants. In this case Migratens was chosen for its&#xD;
      composition: α-lipoic acid, polyvitaminic complexes (B and D group vitamins), coenzyme Q10,&#xD;
      magnesium and tryptophan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia or Fibromyalgic Sindrome (FMS) is a chronic debilitating pain syndrome,&#xD;
      affecting about 2-4% of the general population, with an average peak between 30 and 50 years,&#xD;
      but with a significantly higher prevalence, until about 8-10%, if considered only female sex&#xD;
      or greater age. Fibromyalgia is characterized by the presence of widespread chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain and generalized painful hypersensitivity, which may be associated with&#xD;
      systemic, cognitive and psycho-emotional somatic disorders, such as: asthenia, sleep&#xD;
      disorders, depression, anxiety, headache, paresthesia, dry eye, tachycardia, intercostal&#xD;
      pain, dyspnoea, gastrointestinal or gynecological or urological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etiology is not completely known, even if genetic, environmental, physical and emotional&#xD;
      factors seem to interact and promote an hypersensitive state, both at central and peripheral&#xD;
      level, leading to a functional disorder of pain modulation system. Sleep or immune system&#xD;
      disorders, focal tissue abnormalities, physical or psychological trauma seem to trigger the&#xD;
      disease, but many patients are not able to identify any apparent cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validated questionnaires, including the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), are used to&#xD;
      assess the impact of fibromyalgia on people's health and quality of life; in 2016 this survey&#xD;
      was revised (FIQR) to intercept almost the entire spectrum (domains) of problems related to&#xD;
      the disease and response to treatment, as well as to include other relevant parameters in the&#xD;
      evaluation of the FMS patient (eg assessment of cognitive functions, balance problems, etc.),&#xD;
      absent in the original version. In this scale the score of each item ranges from 0 to 10.&#xD;
      First block of questions concerns the physical function of the subject and the related&#xD;
      physical difficulties experienced in the last week; the subtotal score of first 9 items is&#xD;
      divided by three, therefore the maximum score is 30. Second domain concerns FMS impact on&#xD;
      general health in the last week and consists of two questions; the relative score remains&#xD;
      unchanged, so maximum score is 20. Third domain consists of 10 items concerning the severity&#xD;
      of main symptoms related to fibromyalgia experienced in the last week; addition of these is&#xD;
      divided by two, thus maximum score is 50. Sum of all three domains corresponds to the total&#xD;
      of the questionnaire and its interpretation is as follows: 0-42 mild FMS, 43-59 moderate FMS,&#xD;
      60-74 severe FMS, 75-100 FMS very serious. In this survey also depression is valuated, in a&#xD;
      scale from 0 (absence of mood disorder) to 10 (severe depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a visual representation of severity of pain felt by the&#xD;
      patient, indicated on a 10 cm long line, where one end indicates the absence of ache (0),&#xD;
      while the other corresponds to the worst pain imaginable (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According last guidelines, the best approach to treat FMS must be personalized and&#xD;
      multidisciplinary, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Drugs,&#xD;
      with off-label indication for fibromyalgia, are amitriptyline, duloxetine and pregabalin, in&#xD;
      monotherapy or combined. If there is no response, patients may try to employ analgesics and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatories as needed or use complementary and alternative therapies (for example:&#xD;
      acupuncture, transcranial stimulation or TENS, cannabinoid derivatives, nutraceutical&#xD;
      products, vitamin D supplementation). Moreover, a correct treatment of comorbidities,&#xD;
      practice of bland physical activity or meditative discipline, as well as a pychological&#xD;
      support are very important in FMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the activity of some common therapeutic pathways&#xD;
      available for FMS: acupuncture and nutraceutical products. The first one involves treating&#xD;
      the most painful areas with local, adjacent and distant points, as well as treating basic&#xD;
      condition, framed according to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). In clinical practice,&#xD;
      selection of acupoints must be based on diagnostic criteria of TCM and aimed to reduce&#xD;
      symptoms, therefore it must be personalized as much as possible, even if some points of&#xD;
      treatment are more frequent. Metal needles, placed into specific acupoints, modulate the&#xD;
      release of various pain neuromediators (serotonin, substance P, neuro peptide Y, endorphins),&#xD;
      in addition to activate a local and systemic anti-inflammatory effect, with further sedative&#xD;
      properties on pain. Moreover, there are evidences that acupuncture enhances the effect of&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment (antidepressants) and exercise on pain reduction of 30% (30 points&#xD;
      on a pain scale from 0 to 100), with almost null adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous nutraceutical products for fibromyalgia are available on the market; among these&#xD;
      Migratens was chosen for its composition: in fact it contains α-lipoic acid, a powerful&#xD;
      endogenous antioxidants, polyvitaminic complexes (B and D group vitamins) and coenzyme Q10,&#xD;
      essential for correct cellular functionality, magnesium and tryptophan, mineral and essential&#xD;
      aminoacid with positive effects on skeletal muscle system, sleep and mood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study expects to evaluate which of these treatment, acupuncture and nutraceutical&#xD;
      products, allow a pain reduction, but also an improvement of general well-being, with&#xD;
      positive effects on somatic or psycho-emotional symptoms, without significant side effects&#xD;
      added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WPI, SSS, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQR), Visual Analogic Scale are&#xD;
      instrument to estimate FMS severity at different time: at the fist patient evaluation, during&#xD;
      treatment time and at the end of the study, after at least three month free from therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty-one female fibromyalgic patients were recruited for this study and randomized for the&#xD;
      two possible treatments: 27 of them were assigned to Group A, for a therapy of three months&#xD;
      with Migratens (2 sachets/day), and 34 to Group B, treated with ten (one cycle) or twenty&#xD;
      (two cycles, with a month break between cycles) acupuncture sessions, carried out by the same&#xD;
      operator. The subjects assigned to the two groups follow the normal controls, during which&#xD;
      the participants have to indicate number, type and dosage of the symptomatic drugs taken in a&#xD;
      daily allowance. Another check will also be performed at six months from the beginning of&#xD;
      enrollment, after at least three months free of treatment. In fact, it is interesting to&#xD;
      understand which therapeutic strategy is most effective and which one presents a more lasting&#xD;
      pain reduction over time from the end of treatment to the subsequent follow-up.&#xD;
