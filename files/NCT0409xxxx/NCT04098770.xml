    <textblock>
      Combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) efficiently suppresses viral replication and markedly&#xD;
      decreases mortality among patients with HIV-1 infection/AIDS. While the advanced AIDS&#xD;
      patients with CD4+T cell count less than 200 cells/ÂµL often develop seriously opportunistic&#xD;
      infections (OIs), severe wasting syndrome, and other fatal complications, which are the major&#xD;
      causes of death in these patients. There has been no effective immune therapy for advanced&#xD;
      AIDS patients who had a high mortality rate even in the era of cART. This clinical trail is&#xD;
      to inspect the efficiency of allogeneic adoptive immune therapy for advanced AIDS patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) efficiently suppress viral replication and dramatically&#xD;
      decrease mortality of the disease in HIV-1/AIDS patients.1 While in cART naive patients with&#xD;
      chronic human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection often characterized by HIV-1&#xD;
      replication, immune activation and deficiency, which lead to profound and systematic&#xD;
      inflammation and pathoglogical change, especially in the AIDS patients with CD4 T count less&#xD;
      than 50/uL, who often develop deadly complications, which accounts for the major cause of&#xD;
      death group in spite of cART era. Up-to-date, there are no effective immune interventions to&#xD;
      restore host holistic immunity for advanced AIDS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pre-cARTera, HLA-matched lymphocytes or stem cell transplantation had been exploratively&#xD;
      used in AIDS patients. However, this kind of therapy failed for immunological reconstitution&#xD;
      due to the lack of antiviral therapy to suppress HIV-1 replication at that time. With the&#xD;
      advent of cART, allogeneic HLA-matched or mismatched lymphocytes or stem cell&#xD;
      transplantations were mainly used for AIDS patients with hematopoietic malignancies, the&#xD;
      Berlin and London patients were the cured pateints. However, allogeneic transplantation can&#xD;
      not be used outside the setting of hematopoietic malignancies. In addition, the high&#xD;
      frequency of GVHD (Graft-versus-host disease) owning to a transient or long-lasting&#xD;
      engraftment is inevitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, there has been no report of effective immune therapy for late-stage AIDS patients&#xD;
      with acquired immunodeficiency and severe opportunistic infections (OIs). The urgent&#xD;
      challenge is how to efficiently restore the host holistic immunity in AIDS patients at late&#xD;
      stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently developed a mismatched allogeneic adoptive immune therapy&#xD;
      (AAIT) protocol in combination with cART, and found that the treatment was safety and&#xD;
      tolerability in a phase I study. The purpose of this study is to further investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of allogeneic adoptive immune therapy (AAIT) for advanced AIDS patients. 120&#xD;
      patients received i.v. transfusion one round (2-3 times) of 2.0-3.0*10E8 cells/kg of MNSs as&#xD;
      the treated group, all of these patients received the conventional cART treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, the equal 120 patients received cART were used as control. The side effects, CD4 T&#xD;
      cell numbers, HIV viral load, clinical symptoms improvement, control of opportunistic&#xD;
      infections, AIDS-related events and non-AIDS related events will be evaluated during the&#xD;
      96-week follow up.&#xD;
