  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder that is characterized by&#xD;
      the repeated collapse of the upper airway during sleep, resulting in sleep deprivation.&#xD;
      Mandibular Advancement Appliances (MAA) or Oral Appliances (OA) is prescribed for the&#xD;
      patients with OSA and they have been shown to be effective. However, they rely entirely on&#xD;
      the patient's acceptance and use. The aim of this study is to assess whether interventions-&#xD;
      additional support approaches, will help patients use their MAA more as compared to those who&#xD;
      receive routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also will try and identify factors that help us to understand why some&#xD;
      patients choose to wear the MAA more than others. Adults (â‰¥40 years) with a confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index &gt;5) and referred for MAA therapy will be included in&#xD;
      this study. It is a multicentre study comprised of recruiting patients from secondary care.&#xD;
      Patients will be provided with information in relation to the study and written informed&#xD;
      consent obtained at their subsequent appointment for placement of MAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to Intervention Care (IC) and Standardised care (SC).&#xD;
      Patients will also be provided with a sleep diary to subjectively record their hours of sleep&#xD;
      and usage of MAA and an objective adherence record from the micro-sensor included in their&#xD;
      MAA design. Data indicating adherence will be collected and evaluated, both subjectively at&#xD;
      3- (T2) and 6-months (T3) and objectively by downloading the data stored within a&#xD;
      micro-sensor placed in the MAA device. At the end of the follow-up, the investigators also&#xD;
      plan to undertake a qualitative one-to-one interview with patients compliant (users) and&#xD;
      non-compliant (non-users) to identify their views of what helps and/or prevents their&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to assess whether special support approaches i.e. Interventions&#xD;
      influence patients with Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), to use the Mandibular Advancement&#xD;
      Appliance (MAA) or the anti-snoring mouth guard, more as compared to those who receive&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors such as mood, anxiety, stress, depression, socioeconomic status, and social support&#xD;
      play an important role in the ability of the patients to make decisions about using the&#xD;
      appliance. Thus, the investigators also aim to explore the potential role these factors play&#xD;
      in the decision-making process to help future patients make most of their treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting the selection criteria will be provided with a patient information leaflet,&#xD;
      explaining the whole study. Interested patients will be asked to sign the Informed Consent,&#xD;
      after which they will be randomly assigned into two groups- Intervention Care group (IC) and&#xD;
      Standardized Care group (SCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be provided with a sleep diary to record their hours of sleep and usage of MAA,&#xD;
      which will give a subjective record of the adherence (duration of usage of MAA) and an&#xD;
      objective record of the adherence will be collected from a sensor present in the MAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Initial Screening, the patient's age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and neck circumference&#xD;
      will be recorded. Patients in the IC group will receive a Health Pamphlet about OSA,&#xD;
      specially designed for this study. The IC group's knowledge of OSA will be assessed along&#xD;
      with their partner's. Patients in the IC group will be shown a 10 min video highlighting the&#xD;
      negative impact of OSA. While patients in the SC group will only be provided with a pamphlet&#xD;
      about OSA and MAA as per standard routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of both the group will be asked to complete questionnaires regarding their&#xD;
      personality, socioeconomic status, social support and quality of sleep and life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along the course of the treatment, patients in the IC group will be contacted by telephone at&#xD;
      3, 6, 18, and 21 weeks into the treatment to solve any technical problems with the appliance&#xD;
      and for verbal encouragement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both IC and SC groups will be called for follow-up at 3 and 6 months into the treatment. Data&#xD;
      indicating the hours of usage of the MAA will be collected at 3 and 6 months to assess&#xD;
      whether patients in the IC group wore the appliance for more hours as compared to those who&#xD;
      are in the SC group. Patients will also be required to complete questionnaires at follow-up&#xD;
      appointments. Data from the questionnaires will be analyzed to identify the factors&#xD;
      influencing patients adherence to MAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of follow-up, one-to-one interviews will be conducted with both (n=5-10) compliant&#xD;
      (users) and non-compliant (non-users) patients. It will comprise of questions, which will&#xD;
      address the following topics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's awareness of risks and benefits of OSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barriers and Facilitators of MAA therapy The interviews will be conducted face-to-face&#xD;
           and will be recorded using an audio recorder device and transcribed by a third party,&#xD;

    <description>Patients with mild-to-moderate sleep apnoea are treated with Mandibular Advancement Appliances [MAA] also known as Anti-snoring mouth guards or Oral appliances. These are best made to fit and use the teeth to hold them in place during sleep. They work by moving (in a gradual fashion) the bottom jaw forward, opening the airway at the back of the throat.&#xD;
Both the arms- Intervention arm and Standardized arm will be given the anti-snoring mouth guard. The usage of the device will be measured subjectively by providing a sleep diary to the participants to record the hour of the usage and objectively by downloading the data from a micro sensor chip embedded in the device.</description>
