  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study two different tablets for oral use of a known investigational medicinal&#xD;
      product, called semaglutide, will be tested. One is the current formulation and the other one&#xD;
      is a new formulation of semaglutide. Both will be administered as a tablet and are for the&#xD;
      treatment of diabetes. Currently, semaglutide is only prescribed as injections for the&#xD;
      treatment of diabetes in some countries. The aim of this study is to find out if the dosage&#xD;
      strength of the current formulation of semaglutide can be reduced in the new tablet&#xD;
      formulation. For this purpose, it will be measured how much semaglutide is taken up in the&#xD;
      body from the two (2) different tablet formulations each with three (3) different dosage&#xD;
      strengths. The tablet version of the study medicine is a new medicine that cannot yet be&#xD;
      prescribed. Participants will either get semaglutide in the current tablet formulation&#xD;
      previously tested in many large studies, or get the tablet that contains semaglutide in a new&#xD;
      formulation - which treatment is decided by chance. Participants will get one tablet per day&#xD;
      over 4 weeks in each of the 3 treatment periods (i.e. treatment in a total of 12 weeks). The&#xD;
      tablets should be taken in the morning together with half a glass of water (120 mL), after an&#xD;
      overnight fast of at least 6 hours (no food or drinks). Furthermore, water is not allowed&#xD;
      from 2 hours before dosing. After dosing participants must wait 30 minutes before they may&#xD;
      eat or drink. At home, participants must take their breakfast 30-45 minutes after dosing.&#xD;
