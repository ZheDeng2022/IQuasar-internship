  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of a postpartum intervention in increasing the maternal&#xD;
      well-being and self-efficacy of Italian women in the first one to six months after&#xD;
      childbirth, as well as in reducing postpartum depression and stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will use the motivational interviewing against high levels of daily stress.&#xD;
      One third of participants will be exposed to a 3,5 hours group intervention approximately 1&#xD;
      month after delivery, one third will be exposed to an individual intervention in the same&#xD;
      period and one third will receive no intervention. Participants will be followed with stress&#xD;
      and depression questionnaires.&#xD;

      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention, called &quot;HAPPY MAMA&quot;,&#xD;
      in reducing postpartum stress level, increasing the parenting self-efficacy and the maternal&#xD;
      well-being of Italian women in the first one to six months after childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be an experimental pilot field trial. The present research will be a&#xD;
      multi-centric study to be conducted in three different hospitals in Rome. The CONSORT&#xD;
      statement will be followed to perform the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria for participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following eligibility criteria will be applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant must be a woman aged 18 years old or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant must be able to communicate in Italian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They following exclusion criteria will be applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  women will be excluded from the study if they or their babies have serious health&#xD;
           problems;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the baby was born at &lt;37 weeks gestation, weighed &lt;2500 g;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the baby has the APGAR score &lt;7 immediately after birth. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
           from the Obstetrics Units of the following Hospitals: Teaching Hospital Umberto 1,&#xD;
           Teaching Hospital &quot;Casilino&quot; and &quot;S. Giovanni Calibita Fatebenefratelli&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore for organizational reasons, only mothers that live in Rome will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital recruitment of participants will be conducted at 0 to 3 days postpartum by the&#xD;
      researchers and research nurses using a brochure explaining the aim of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment period will in two weeks. Prior to study participation all women who agree to&#xD;
      participate will be asked to sign a written consent form and to provide a contact phone&#xD;
      number and email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      After taking the consent, the participants will be divided into three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group that will follow the &quot;Collective intervention group,&quot; that will be called &quot;G&quot;;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group that will follow the &quot;Individual intervention group,&quot; that will be called &quot;I&quot;;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  control group that will be called &quot;Control group&quot; (C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation of the women in the groups will be randomly. The investigators will create a&#xD;
      random number sequence using Epicalc 2000. A researcher will assign the participants to the&#xD;
      groups following the number sequence as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiples of three (3,6,9,12, etc.) in G;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiples of three+1 (1, 4, 7,10, etc.) in I;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple of three+2 (2, 5, 8, 11, etc.)in C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups will be matched for followed variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age (&gt;31 years, 31 is the mean age of Italian women at childbirth (ISTAT, 2017));&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vaginal delivery (Yes/No).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment period will be of two weeks. During the delivery hospital (T0), the&#xD;
      researchers will ask to sign consent forms from each participant and they will collect the&#xD;
      demographics information for matching and performing the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During T0 phase an unique code will be assigned to each women (for example a keyword composed&#xD;
      using the first three letter of her name and the last four numbers of her telephone number).&#xD;
      A check will be done of the uniqueness, and in case of overlap an adjustment it will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For organizational reasons, one researcher has a paper sheet that reported the codes&#xD;
      associated to the women's names.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the recruitment and the randomization phase, a message that contains the link to the&#xD;
      questionnaire will be sent by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire is created using a Google form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will be administered four times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At T1: About 30 days weeks after the hospital delivery and 15 days, the last women&#xD;
           recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For G: the questionnaire will be administered on-line with a phone message with a&#xD;
                link to the questionnaire. The message will be sent 2/3 days before the collective&#xD;
                intervention. The meeting will be performed about15 days after the last women&#xD;
                recruited;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For I: the questionnaire will be administered on-line with a phone message with a&#xD;
                link to the questionnaire. The message will be sent 2/3 days before the individual&#xD;
                intervention. The single intervention will be performed 30 days after the hospital&#xD;
                delivery (the 30 days is a hypothesis made considering that in the G group means&#xD;
                the time that has elapsed since of giving birth to the intervention is the median&#xD;
                range between 2 or 4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For women in the C group, the questionnaire will be administered online with a&#xD;
                phone message with a link to the questionnaire. The message will be sent 30 days&#xD;
                after the delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At T2: About two months after delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For G: the questionnaire will be administered online with a phone message with a&#xD;
                link to the questionnaire. The message will be sent about one month after the&#xD;
                collective intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For I: the questionnaire will be administered online with a phone message with a&#xD;
                link to the questionnaire. The message will be sent one month after the individual&#xD;
                intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For C: the questionnaire will be administered online with a phone message with a&#xD;
                link to the questionnaire. The message will be sent two months after the delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At T3: the questionnaire will be administered online with a phone message with a link to&#xD;
           the questionnaire. The message will be sent three months after the delivery (T3);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At T4: the questionnaire will be administered online with a phone message with a link to&#xD;
           the questionnaire. The message will be sent six months after the delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online questionnaire will be used to obtain socio-demographic data, characteristics of&#xD;
      breastfeeding practice, mother's confidence about their ability to successfully raise&#xD;
      children, and the information on stress and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to find the measurements of stress level, self-efficacy and depression in the&#xD;
      mothers, a literature search on Pubmed using following search terms &quot;maternal stress,&#xD;
      depression, self-efficacy AND (questionnaire or index or inventory)&quot; was conducted on 25th&#xD;
      March 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The search display 53 papers, after an analysis of the abstract and the full text the&#xD;
      researchers have composed a questionnaire that includes the following three validated scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale (KPCS) as a measure of the perceived parental&#xD;
           self-efficacy (PPSE), defined as ''beliefs or judgments a parent holds of their&#xD;
           capabilities to organize and execute a set of tasks related to parenting a child''. The&#xD;
           15-item scale, grounded in self-efficacy theory, was developed to assess PPSE of parents&#xD;
           with infants aged 0-12 months. Factor analysis revealed a three-factor structure,&#xD;
           composed of efficacy, support, and child development. An Italian version of the&#xD;
           questionnaire will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the Parental Stress Scale (PSS). The PSS scale consisted of 18 items rated on a 5-point&#xD;
           Likert scale. The total score was obtained by summing up the value for each item. A&#xD;
           higher score indicates a higher level of parental stress. An Italian version of the&#xD;
           questionnaire will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the Italian version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). This&#xD;
           questionnaire is used to measure maternal depressive symptoms. The EPDS is a self-report&#xD;
           screening measure to detect symptoms of postpartum depression. Scores &gt;12 on the EPDS&#xD;
           are correlated with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline, the questionnaire includes additionally a section of demographic variables.&#xD;
      The following characteristics will be collected: age, civil status (single or not),&#xD;
      employment (student/ worker/ no worker), educational level (middle school/ high school/&#xD;
      university), the birth date, primipara (yes/ no), number of children living at home and age,&#xD;
      vaginal birth (yes/no), Italian Region where she lives, city where she lives, ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women will be interviewed four times, always by phone call:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For G and I groups: About 2/3 weeks after the last women recruited and 2/3 days before the&#xD;
      intervention (T1); about two month after the delivery that it is about one month after the&#xD;
      intervetion(T2); three months after the delivery (T3); six months after the delivery (T4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the C group: About 2/3 weeks after the delivery(T1); about 30 days after delivery(T2);&#xD;
      three months after the delivery (T3); six months after the delivery (T4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAPPY MAMA Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collective level (G)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training carried out by a childcare worker and midwives with high experience in childcare&#xD;
      and home interventions, includes educational and mindfulness training and simulations of&#xD;
      typical events. Given the importance of communication skills training and better outcomes in&#xD;
      studies where skills practice has taken place, the interventionists developed their skills&#xD;
      through patient simulation and role-play scenarios with one another and the facilitators&#xD;
      before interacting with study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phases of the intervention can be educational and support-based, as needed. The&#xD;
      educational phase aims to provide information, demonstrations, and discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objectives The objective of the HAPPY MAMA intervention is to explore the effects of&#xD;
           early proactive parenting support strategies on mothers' confidence, stress, and mood.&#xD;
           The ultimate goal is to share and increase awareness of one's abilities: control and&#xD;
           autonomy are important for the final step of the process, the last step wants to put new&#xD;
           mothers in a position to implement strategies, and be able to pursue goals to restore&#xD;
           mental well-being&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Structure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phases of the intervention can be educational and support-based, as needed. The&#xD;
      educational phase aims to provide information, demonstrations, and discussions while&#xD;
      supporting phase aimed at providing social support, counseling, or consultation. The&#xD;
      intervention follows several steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Listening and establishing relationship phases. The first step is characterized by&#xD;
           listening and understanding the critical points from the new mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This requires the use of listening skills, empathy, authenticity, and acceptance. The&#xD;
           operator maintains a nonjudgmental approach and allows the woman to determine the need&#xD;
           for behavioral change, rather than offering unsolicited advice on the need for change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis of the problems The situation must be carefully evaluated, considering the&#xD;
           discomfort and emotional distress. The stress situation will be described in a&#xD;
           subjective way, from the new mother/s, and she/they will assign a grade of discomfort&#xD;
           for each problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment. The operator will carry out a multidimensional evaluation of the mother/s&#xD;
           within the dyad. The operator will evaluate the strategies implemented by the new&#xD;
           mother/s to face problems and the reasons of their failures; for example: how she&#xD;
           routinely handles organizational problems, how she experiences breastfeeding if there is&#xD;
           a lack of sleep and how she considers her family and support network.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The evaluation will have to consider the environment as a whole, with attention to&#xD;
           facilitators and barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Definition of the problem and the goal of the intervention The problems detected by the&#xD;
           operator will be explained and summarized to the participant/s. The operator only&#xD;
           explores ways to implement change once the woman/women expresses the desire and&#xD;
           confidence to change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shared identification of the mother/s' priority will lead to the definition of a tailored&#xD;
      plan aimed at achieving specific goals such as the reduction of the stress levels, the&#xD;
      decline of the sleep deprivation (hours of sleep per night), optimization of breastfeeding&#xD;
      (number, duration and quality), increased well-being (mental health, physical health).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies of concrete action and planned behavior will be provided adapted to the context&#xD;
      and styles of women/woman's coping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Length of the intervention will be 3 hours in one day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location and number of partecipans Group interventions will take place at the Department of&#xD;
      Public Health and Infectious Diseases of &quot;Sapienza&quot; University of Rome. Number of&#xD;
      participants: 20 (max).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual interventions will be carried out at the women's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be performed using frequencies and percentage for qualitative&#xD;
      variables. Moreover the measures of central tendency (mean or median) and of variability&#xD;
      (Standard Deviation, SD, interquartile range, IQR) will be computed in order to describe the&#xD;
      quantitative variables in each groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The univariate analysis will be used to compare groups (G, I and C) versus primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes. In particular, Kruskall Wallis's test will be applied to assess possible&#xD;
      difference of stress scores between the three groups; Chi-square's test will be applied to&#xD;
      assess possible independence between the three groups versus categorical variables, too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests for paired samples will be used to assess the possible changes of the stress score&#xD;
      during the follow-up of the G and I groups (baseline, T1, versus 2(T2), 3 (T3) and 6&#xD;
      (T4)months after the intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A linear regression model will be used in order to assess possible significant predictors of&#xD;
      the outcomes and a R2 will be computed as the indicator of the goodness of fit of the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significant level is fit at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
