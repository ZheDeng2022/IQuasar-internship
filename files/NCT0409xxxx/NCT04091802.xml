  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interdental papilla is very small but it has a great implication from an aesthetic view,&#xD;
      more specifically in the anterior region because it is always displayed during smiling. The&#xD;
      lack of interdental papilla due to periodontal disease or periodontal therapy leads to&#xD;
      aesthetic problems with food stagnation as well as phonetic problem due to the space that&#xD;
      allows passage of the air or saliva. Leukocyte-PRF (L-PRF) membrane was developed which&#xD;
      includes the majority of the platelets in addition to half of the leukocytes so that&#xD;
      lymphocytes as well as the platelet growth factors are trapped inside a fibrin network.&#xD;
      Multiple layers of L-PRF may have observable effect on tissue regeneration because it&#xD;
      increases the number of growth factors and acts as a strong scaffold which helps in creeping&#xD;
      of the cells along it as it remains active and in place for more than 7 days. Thus, the aim&#xD;
      of this study will be conducted to compare the effect of one layer versus multiple layers of&#xD;
      L-PRF in interdental papillary reconstruction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 20 patients will be selected who are caring about esthetics and concerned to go&#xD;
      through the management of eradication of &quot;black triangles&quot; by interdental papillae&#xD;
      reconstruction in esthetic zone and systemically free with Nordland's class I or II and The&#xD;
      vertical distance from the interdental contact point to the crest of the interdental bone is&#xD;
      ≥ 6 mm as measured by bone sounding, A band of keratinized tissue should be present around&#xD;
      the test teeth ≥ 2 mm, Gingival biotype of the area to be treated is ≥ 2 mm in thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol will be explained in details to all patients. Then a signed informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the patients. The data obtained from patients as well as the&#xD;
      results of the follow up will be kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be introduced to ethics' committee of Faculty of Dentistry Ain Shams&#xD;
      University and has to be approved before the start of the study Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio into two groups; (Group I) included 10 patients and (Group II)&#xD;
      included 10 patients. The computer-generated randomization assignment (blocks of 4) and&#xD;
      allocation concealment will be performed by sealed envelopes containing the randomization&#xD;
      number prepared by non involved member and sent to principle investigator to assign the&#xD;
      interventions to patients Group I: 10 patients will undergo interdental papillary&#xD;
      reconstruction using one layer of L-PRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: 10 patients will receive interdental papillary reconstruction using multiple layers&#xD;
      of L-PRF (Two or more according to the compressibility in which if ≥1mm, it needs one more&#xD;
      layer, and if ≤1 mm, then no need to more than 2 layers; it cannot be standardized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients will receive Phase I therapy including oral hygiene measures and scaling&#xD;
           and root planning whenever indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preparation of recipient site:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The preparation of the recipient site is similar to that described by Reddy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anasthesia of the surgical field.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A single vertical incision will be made in the buccal vestibule apical to the&#xD;
                mucogingival junction in the mid interproximal area of the papilla to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intrasulcular releasing incisions will be made on the teeth adjacent to the papilla&#xD;
                to be augmented and extend to the buccal and palatal aspects without altering the&#xD;
                integrity of the papilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The incisions will maintain the full height and thickness of the gingiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Papilla will be undermined carefully to maintain integrity and a space will be&#xD;
                created under the papilla by elevating it coronally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Preparation of L-PRF:&#xD;
&#xD;
           L-PRF will be prepared according to Chaukroun's et al. 2001. Immediately prior to the&#xD;
           surgery, 10 ml of blood (for each membrane) will be collected from the patient by&#xD;
           venipuncture of antecubital vein and then drawn quickly into sterile glass tube with no&#xD;
           anticoagulant and immediately centrifuged at 2700 rpm for 12 minutes at room temperature&#xD;
           by using the Intra-Spin centrifuge (Intra-Lock).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Then L-PRF clot will be removed by sterile tweezers and placed in Xpression™ kit for&#xD;
           gentle compression by gravity. Then L-PRF will be ready to be used after 5 minutes (For&#xD;
           group II, membranes will be sutured together before placement in the vertical incision).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Placement and suturing of L-PRF in the recipient site:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The L-PRF membrane will be trimmed to the desired shape and size and then placed under&#xD;
           the papilla and mucogingival complex through the vertical incision to fill the black&#xD;
           space.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Then incision will be closed with 5-0 polypropylene simple interrupted sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post operative management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will include pain control using anti-inflammatory and analgesics (Brufen 600 mg) when&#xD;
      needed and twice mouth rinse with chlorohexidine gluconate daily for one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Clinical and volumetric measurements will be carried out at baseline and after 6 months&#xD;
      follow up and esthetic assessment will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment will be Plaque score index (PI), gingival score index (GI), papillary&#xD;
      height from the tip of the papilla to mesial line angle, Nordland and Tarnaw classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      volumetric assessment will be with intraoral scan with CAD-CAM preoperative and 6 months&#xD;
      postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esthetic assessment will be done by means of the root coverage esthetic score (RES), this&#xD;
      score estimates five variables: gingival margin level (GM), the contour of the marginal&#xD;
      tissue (MTC), soft tissue texture (STT), location of mucogingival junction (MGJ), and&#xD;
      gingival color (GC). Zero, 3, or 6 points will be used for the estimation of the location of&#xD;
      the gingival margin, while a score of 0 or 1 point will be used for each of the other&#xD;
      variables.GM. Zero points = no root coverage (in which the gingival margin is in equal level&#xD;
      to the baseline or migrated apically); 3 points = partial coverage; 6 points = Complete&#xD;
      coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTC. Zero points = asymmetrical gingival margin (does not track the CEJ); 1point =&#xD;
      appropriate marginal contour/ scalloped gingival margin (tracks the CEJ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STT. Zero points = scar development; 1 point = absence of scar. MGJ. Zero points =MGJ is not&#xD;
      uniform with the MGJ of neighboring teeth; 1 point = MGJ is uniform with the MGJ of&#xD;
      neighboring teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GC. Zero points = tissue color differs from gingival color of neighboring teeth; 1 point =&#xD;
      normal color and unification with the neighboring soft tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the perfect esthetic score is 10. Satisfaction questionnaire, to score degree of&#xD;
      pain experienced during and after treatment and the degree of patient satisfaction with the&#xD;
      cosmetic results of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected blindly and subjected to statistical analysis.&#xD;

             Nordland and Tarnow classified the interdental papilla loss; the classification is&#xD;
