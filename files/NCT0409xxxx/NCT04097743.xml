  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to prescription opioid and opioid tapering as indicated are critical for safe&#xD;
      chronic opioid therapy for chronic pain, but this can be difficult for patients experiencing&#xD;
      prescription opioid craving. Because pain catastrophizing is proposed as a possible treatment&#xD;
      target by our and others' preliminary results, the proposed study aims to determine whether&#xD;
      pain catastrophizing is a treatment target to reduce prescription opioid craving and to&#xD;
      investigate whether negative affect and stress hormones are potential mediators. The findings&#xD;
      from the current study will inform whether a psychology intervention to lower pain&#xD;
      catastrophizing will reduce opioid craving, and whether psychological and physical distress&#xD;
      will be potential mediators of the treatment effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain and opioid overdose are two critical public health problems in the US. About 25&#xD;
      million adults (11%) suffer from chronic daily pain and up to 8 million use opioids to manage&#xD;
      chronic pain. Unfortunately, 46 people die daily from overdose of prescription opioids. For&#xD;
      safe chronic opioid therapy for chronic pain, physicians monitor patients' adherence to&#xD;
      prescription opioids, and reduce or discontinue the prescription as indicated. Yet, adherence&#xD;
      and cessation are not easy for some patients and one reason is opioid craving, a strong&#xD;
      desire or urge to use opioids. Our preliminary data show about 34% of patients on chronic&#xD;
      opioid therapy report craving. Craving is strongly associated with opioid misuse and negative&#xD;
      health outcomes. To date, we do not fully understand the underlying mechanisms of&#xD;
      prescription opioid craving in chronic pain sufferers, and psychological treatment targets to&#xD;
      reduce craving. Based on our pilot survey, patients endorsing craving reported greater pain&#xD;
      catastrophizing than those endorsing no craving. Our other survey study also reported a&#xD;
      positive link between pain catastrophizing and opioid craving in patients on chronic opioid&#xD;
      therapy for chronic pain conditions. Although these findings propose a possibility that&#xD;
      lowering pain catastrophizing may decrease opioid craving, cross-sectional observational&#xD;
      studies are limited in investigating a causal association. Potentially, pain catastrophizing&#xD;
      enhances stress-induced opioid craving because stress-induced opioid craving is a&#xD;
      well-established phenomenon in studies of addiction, and pain catastrophizing is associated&#xD;
      with greater pain and emotional distress in patients with chronic pain. Therefore, the&#xD;
      proposed project seeks to determine: a) the effect of pain catastrophizing on prescription&#xD;
      opioid craving in patients on chronic opioid therapy for chronic pain and b) psychological&#xD;
      (negative affect) and physiological (cortisol, norepinephrine) distress as potential&#xD;
      mediating variables. The proposed study will use the previously validated protocol to&#xD;
      temporarily induce and reduce pain catastrophizing and assess changes in opioid craving,&#xD;
      negative affect, and stress hormones before and after pain catastrophizing manipulation.&#xD;
      Additionally, this proposed study prospectively administers the protocol to reduce pain&#xD;
      catastrophizing by thinking about and rehearsing a coping statement daily for 7 days and&#xD;
      monitor daily opioid craving, opioid use and misuse, and negative affect for 14 days. The&#xD;
      current project is expected to characterize the role of pain catastrophizing in opioid&#xD;
      craving and opioid misuse, and pain catastrophizing as a critical psychological treatment&#xD;
      target for reducing prescription opioid craving and improving prescription adherence.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the protocol to manipulate pain catastrophizing can facilitate future research&#xD;
      to study causal mechanisms involved in pain catastrophizing and the protocol to rapidly&#xD;
      stabilize pain catastrophizing can be used clinically to improve the health outcome of&#xD;
      patients taking prescription opioid for chronic pain.&#xD;
