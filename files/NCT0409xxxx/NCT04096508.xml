  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal endoscopy is widely acknowledged as the most useful tool for diagnosing and&#xD;
      treating gastrointestinal mucosal lesions. It can not only observe the mucosa directly, but&#xD;
      also obtain tissue biopsy for pathological diagnosis. Although the importance of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy has been well understood, there are still a certain proportion of&#xD;
      people who are unwilling to undergo it due to the discomfort and anxiety during the&#xD;
      procedures. Music is multifunctional, which can alleviate people's depression, anxiety and&#xD;
      other negative emotions as well as help to maintain good mental health. Thus, in this study&#xD;
      we aim to investigate the role of music listening in gastrointestinal endoscopy in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial, especially for those patients who plan to undergo&#xD;
      therapeutic endoscopic procedures and try to improve the patients' experience.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to examine the function of music listening in the&#xD;
      procedures of gastrointestinal endoscopy. It was previously reported that music listening may&#xD;
      exert beneficial effects for patients who undergo gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, most&#xD;
      of the studies did not analyze the effects of the specific music type and listening time in&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures, respectively. This study&#xD;
      will test whether the specific music type and listening time before gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy could improve patients' experience of the procedure in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. The results may help to optimize the routine clinical practice at present.&#xD;
