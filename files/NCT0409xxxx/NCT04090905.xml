  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and purpose Post-operative AF (POAF) is considered a phenomenon rather than a&#xD;
      definite diagnosis and the current clinical guidelines have no specific recommendations&#xD;
      regarding its management. Few prospective studies have been performed in non-cardiac&#xD;
      conditions and consequences of POAF in patients without known heart disease is not well&#xD;
      described. However, recent data suggest an association between POAF in relation to&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery and increased post-operative mortality and stroke. POAF in relation to&#xD;
      abdominal surgery seems common (incidence: 8-18%); however, the true incidence is uncertain.&#xD;
      The available studies are few, heterogenous and often methodologically inadequate. The study&#xD;
      aims at reporting the true incidence of AF, and associated complications, in relation to&#xD;
      abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods Designed as a prospective, single-centre, cohort study of consecutive&#xD;
      adult patients undergoing acute or elective abdominal surgery at Department of Abdominal&#xD;
      Surgery at Bispebjerg Hospital. Patients who are pregnant or where follow-up is not possible&#xD;
      will be excluded. Patients will be examined pre-operatively by ECG and signal processed&#xD;
      surface ECG (wavECG). Heart rhythm monitoring will be worn from admission and until discharge&#xD;
      (preferably ≥72 hour post-operatively). Examinations are repeated 90 days post-operatively.&#xD;
      Additional follow-up will be based on patient charts for ≥12 months. Primary endpoint is&#xD;
      occurrence/recurrence of AF. The study will include 300 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective If more thorough heart rhythm monitoring of patients undergoing abdominal surgery&#xD;
      leads to identification of more patients with AF, routine continuous heart rhythm monitoring&#xD;
      should be considered recommended in upcoming guidelines to prevent associated complications.&#xD;

      Background and rationale Post-operative AF (POAF), i.e. new-onset AF that occurs secondarily&#xD;
      to surgery is considered a phenomenon rather than a definite diagnosis, and continuous&#xD;
      anti-coagulation is not recommended in AF of short duration and non-persistent AF.1,2 The&#xD;
      most recent guidelines from the European and American Societies of Cardiology has no specific&#xD;
      recommendation regarding management of secondary AF, though referral for an outpatient&#xD;
      cardiology clinic can be considered if the condition is not self-limiting.3,4 Despite this,&#xD;
      recent data from the Framingham population suggest that secondary AF is not a benign&#xD;
      condition,5,6 and some studies have found POAF in relation to non-cardiac surgery to be&#xD;
      associated with increased post-operative mortality and stroke.7-9 Currently few prospective&#xD;
      studies have been performed in non-cardiac conditions and consequences of secondary AF in&#xD;
      patients without known heart disease is not well described. POAF in relation to non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery is common with an average incidence of 10.94%.10 However, the true incidence of POAF&#xD;
      in relation to non-cardiac surgery is uncertain, as the available studies are few,&#xD;
      heterogenous and often methodologically inadequate.10 Different risk-stratification models&#xD;
      exist, however it is still challenging to accurately predict which patients will develop AF&#xD;
      both perioperatively and in the years following surgery.11-14 Important risk factors for&#xD;
      developing POAF is: age (age 65-74, OR 2.08; age &gt;85, OR 3.56), hypertension (OR 3.66), heart&#xD;
      failure (OR 1.64), thyroid disease (OR 6.29), laparotomy vs laparoscopy (OR 3.30) and&#xD;
      duration of surgery (&gt; 600 min, OR 1.38).10 The use of electrocardiogram (ECG) in risk&#xD;
      stratification for AF and stroke is not yet incorporated in clinical guidelines. However,&#xD;
      short and prolonged p-wave and p-wave terminal force in lead V1 (PTFV1) is correlated with&#xD;
      AF.15 Myovista (HeartSciences, Southlake, Texas, USA) is a novel ECG utilizing continuous&#xD;
      wavelet transform signal processing (wavECG) and can be used to prove left ventricular&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction (LVDD).16 LVDD is other studies associated with AF.17-20 These new&#xD;
      biomarkers might improve identification of patients at risk of developing POAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The study aims at reporting the true incidence of AF, and associated complications,&#xD;
      in relation to abdominal surgery. Concurrently, patients will be characterized by specialized&#xD;
      ECG analysis and wavECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Prospective, single-centre, cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing abdominal&#xD;
      surgery. Patients will be identified among elective and acute referrals for Department of&#xD;
      Abdominal Surgery at Bispebjerg-Frederiksberg Hospital. The Investigator (Department of&#xD;
      Cardiology at Bispebjerg-Frederiksberg Hospital) will ensure signed informed consent prior to&#xD;
      any study related examinations. Surgery will be performed at Department of Abdominal Surgery&#xD;
      at Bispebjerg-Frederiksberg Hospital independently of study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No randomization or placebo will be used. ECG measurements will be compared to existing data&#xD;
      from a healthy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG: PR-interval, p-wave area, PTFV1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  wavECG: LVDD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rhythm monitoring: AF&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations Consecutive patients attending the Department of Abdominal Surgery&#xD;
      at Bispebjerg-Frederiksberg Hospital will be invited to participate in the pre- and&#xD;
      post-operative examination programme. The study aim is to identify the true incidence of&#xD;
      peri- and postoperative AF. Hence, sample size calculations are uncertain. The expected&#xD;
      incidence of AF for non-oesophageal surgery patients is at least 7.63%.10 Pre-operative&#xD;
      p-wave indices have shown ability to predict POAF in cardiac surgery population of 105&#xD;
      patients (with incidence 11%).21 wavECG has been used to show LVDD in a study population of&#xD;
      188 patients referred for computed tomography angiography of the heart.16 The study will&#xD;
      include 300 patients. Follow-up will be at least 12 months. Parametric statistics is used as&#xD;
      normal distribution is expected with two-sample unpaired Student's t-test (continuous&#xD;
      variables) and Chi-square and Fisher's exact test (categorical variables) where appropriate.&#xD;
      Data is presented with mean (±standard deviation) for continuous variables and frequency&#xD;
      (percentages) for categorical variables. All tests are two-sided and a P-value &lt; 0.05 is&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. Furthermore, non-parametric Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      (time-to-event) curves will be produced and log rank test (chi-square and hazard ratio) will&#xD;
      be used for comparison. IBM SPSS version 22 will be used for statistical analyses.&#xD;
