      This proposed project is a prospective randomized controlled trial to examine the clinical&#xD;
      effects of pre-medical consultation structured diabetes self-care education program on&#xD;
      intervention group (IG) versus control group (CG) for patients with type 2 diabetes in a&#xD;
      specialist outpatient clinic of a regional hospital.&#xD;

      Protocol Revised Date: 23 April 2019&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is known as one of the major causes leading to&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, stroke, diabetes kidney diseases, blindness or non-traumatic lower&#xD;
      limb amputations. It is estimated that one in ten people to have diabetes and it has been&#xD;
      projected that one in three adults will develop type 2 diabetes by 2050. Similarly, the&#xD;
      prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in Hong Kong is estimated to be one in ten in&#xD;
      adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DM is a progressive metabolic disease and necessitates continuous medical care, diabetes&#xD;
      self-management education and skills training to prevent or delay development of acute and&#xD;
      chronic complications. Educating patients with diabetes in self blood glucose monitoring,&#xD;
      healthy eating, regular physical activities, medication adherence, stress management and&#xD;
      smoking cessation are important behavioral modifications required in diabetes self-care&#xD;
      education. Besides providing education, diabetes nurses provide support and discuss with&#xD;
      patients regarding their concerns and worries about diabetes and empower them to live their&#xD;
      life positively with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Service Gap&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diabetes with or without cardiovascular or renal comorbidities, are inevitably&#xD;
      a burden to healthcare system. In Hong Kong and most other countries, if not all, patients&#xD;
      are referred to specialist out-patient clinics (SOPC) for more advanced diabetes management&#xD;
      from either general out-patient clinics (GOPC) or private practitioners (GP). Hence, these&#xD;
      new case referrals from GOPC or GP are patients already have established DM on oral&#xD;
      anti-diabetic drugs and/or insulin injections and with diabetes complications. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      they have to wait for a long period of time, approximately one to two years before they could&#xD;
      be seen at SOPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of a diabetes nurse is recognized as providing diabetes education, individualized&#xD;
      care, self-care promotion, teaching physical skills and enhancing psychological support.&#xD;
      However, majority of DM patients are being first seen at general medical clinics, and only a&#xD;
      proportion of them will be referred by case medical practitioner to diabetes nurses for&#xD;
      education. In other words, the role of the diabetes nurses is quite 'passive' and the basic&#xD;
      education program may fail to cover all newly referred patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Hospital Authority (HA) report, the waiting time for stable case new case&#xD;
      booking in medicine specialist out-patient clinics from October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018&#xD;
      is the median 94 weeks (= 24 months = 2 years) to the longest 119 weeks (= 30 months = 2.5&#xD;
      years) for first time medical consultation at SOPC. Most of them are with suboptimal glycemic&#xD;
      control and/or co-morbidities, such as retinopathy or renal impairment at time of referral&#xD;
      made and necessitate earlier medical management. Burden of diabetes on public health care&#xD;
      system in Hong Kong is alarming. The number of patients with diabetes increased over 9,000&#xD;
      (31.5%) in five years from 2010 to 2015, with around 200,000 admissions for diabetes-related&#xD;
      complications, which accounts for 18% of all admissions and around one million SOPC visits,&#xD;
      which accounts for 14% of all SOPC attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the clinical triggers are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the impact of delivering pre-medical consultation nursing intervention or&#xD;
           diabetes education to these newly referred patients with type 2 diabetes at SOPC?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the effects of early nursing consultation and diabetes self-care education on&#xD;
           glycemic control and self-care in patients with type 2 diabetes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Pre-medical consultation structured diabetes self-care education programme can&#xD;
      provide significantly greater improvements in glycemic control and self-care behaviors in&#xD;
      adults with type 2 diabetes than usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of pre-medical consultation structured diabetes self-care&#xD;
           education programme on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the effectiveness of pre-medical consultation structured diabetes self-care&#xD;
           education programme on diabetes-specific self-care behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine acceptability and usefulness of the intervention protocol by conducting a&#xD;
           focus group interview on the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed evidence-based intervention protocol The findings of integrative review revealed&#xD;
      positive effects of diabetes education in improving glycemic control and promoting self-care&#xD;
      among adults with type 2 diabetes. An evidence-based protocol is developed based on these&#xD;
      findings to generate a structured diabetes self-care education programme for newly referred&#xD;
      patients before their first medical consultation at SOPC to improve glycemic control and&#xD;
      enhance self-care in adults with type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This will be a randomized controlled trial to examine the effects and&#xD;
      acceptability of a structured diabetes self-care education programme for type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      patients as an intervention group (IG) versus a control group (CG) of usual care in a&#xD;
      specialist out-patient clinic of a regional hospital.&#xD;

After signing written informed consent on day of diabetes complication screening, they will be randomized into CG (n=10 for pilot study; n=60 for main study) or IG (n=10 for pilot study; n=60 for main study) groups, using sealed envelope, opened by an independent staff, containing randomly generated computer codes for group assignment. All patients will undergo diabetes complication screening including examination of eye and feet, collection of blood and urine samples and filling in DM questionnaires at baseline, and HbA1c with diabetes self-care questionnaires at 24 weeks (for IG only) and 36 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
