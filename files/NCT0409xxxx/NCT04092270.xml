  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of peposertib when given together&#xD;
      with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with high or low&#xD;
      grade ovarian cancer that has come back (recurrent). Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving peposertib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with ovarian cancer compared to pegylated&#xD;
      liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of peposertib (M3814) in combination with&#xD;
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLD) and determine the recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) of the combination in women with recurrent ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of M3814&#xD;
      when given in combination with PLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate response to treatment (as defined by response rate and progression free&#xD;
      survival) with PLD exposure (in area under the curve [AUC]) and PLD associated toxicities in&#xD;
      women with recurrent high grade serous and low grade serous ovarian cancer treated in the&#xD;
      expansion cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of peposertib followed by a dose-expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive peposertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 or days 1-28 and&#xD;
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

                  human fetus are unknown and there is the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
                  abortifacient effects. For this reason, women and men of child-bearing potential&#xD;
                  must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
                  control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study treatment,&#xD;

                  woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
                  participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
                  immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
                  nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with peposertib (M3814),&#xD;
                  breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with peposertib&#xD;
                  (M3814)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac&#xD;
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be&#xD;
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue collected within the past 36&#xD;
             months prior to registration must be available for submission for deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
             acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are excluded from the dose-escalation phase of the study if they are eligible&#xD;
             for any available therapies known to confer clinical benefit&#xD;

             ineligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have received prior anthracyclines (doxorubicin or pegylated&#xD;
             liposomal doxorubicin) for treatment of their ovarian cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia, thyroid&#xD;
             dysfunction, or neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             start of treatment&#xD;

             potent CYP2D6 inhibitor/inducer, P-gp inhibitor, BCRP inhibitor, or potent CYP2C9&#xD;
             inhibitor/inducers are also prohibited are also excluded and may not be taken when on&#xD;
             study treatment. Patients may confer with the study doctor to determine if alternative&#xD;
             medications can be used. The following categories of medications and herbal&#xD;
             supplements must be discontinued for at least the specified period of time before the&#xD;
             patient can be treated:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C19: &gt;= 3 weeks prior to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C19: &gt;=1 week prior to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Substrates of CYP3A4/5 with a narrow therapeutic index: &gt;=1 day prior to study&#xD;
                  treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
                  regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the&#xD;
                  enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk&#xD;
                  of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
                  prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
                  herbal product. Patient Drug Interactions Handout and Wallet Card should be&#xD;
                  provided to patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot discontinue concomitant proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). Patients&#xD;
             may confer with the study doctor to determine if such medications can be discontinued.&#xD;
             These must be discontinued &gt;= 5 days prior to study treatment. Patients do not need to&#xD;
             discontinue calcium carbonate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving sorivudine or any chemically related analogues (such as brivudine)&#xD;
             are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received a live attenuated vaccine within 30 days of dosing with&#xD;
             peposertib (M3814)&#xD;

             or active infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because peposertib (M3814) is DNA-PK&#xD;
             inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with peposertib (M3814), breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with peposertib (M3814). These potential risks&#xD;
             may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant (uncontrolled) cardiac conduction abnormalities are excluded&#xD;
