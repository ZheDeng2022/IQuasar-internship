  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost half of critically ill patients experience delirium. Delirium is associated with&#xD;
      impaired cognition, mortality, and increased healthcare costs. Family members of critically&#xD;
      ill patients are also at risk for adverse consequences such as depression and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One strategy that may help improve outcomes is to engage family members in the prevention,&#xD;
      detection, and management of delirium. This study will employ an educational module to&#xD;
      educate families on delirium symptoms, how to identify delirium, and how to prevent and&#xD;
      manage delirium using non-pharmacological strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family delirium detection may result in earlier and more accurate recognition of delirium and&#xD;
      meaningful family involvement, and therein the potential for better patient and family&#xD;
      outcomes. We aim to determine the efficacy of employing family-administered delirium&#xD;
      prevention, detection, and management in the critically ill, compared to usual care. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that family-administered delirium prevention, detection, and management in the&#xD;
      critically ill will be superior to standard of care in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reducing psychological distress in family members,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. reducing the prevalence, duration, and severity of delirium in critically ill patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. increasing delirium identification in medical charts,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. increasing delirium knowledge in family members of critically ill patients, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. reducing the burden of delirium experienced by family members and caregivers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a parallel-group randomized control trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
      Consecutive, eligible patients admitted to 4 ICUs in Calgary, Alberta, Canada with at least&#xD;
      one family member present will be identified by discussion with the most responsible&#xD;
      attending physician and bedside nurse. All eligible and consenting family members will&#xD;
      receive standard care, which is an informational pamphlet on ICU delirium presented to all&#xD;
      patients and families upon admission. Participants in both the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups will also complete a demographics questionnaire, the Critical Care Family Needs&#xD;
      Inventory (CCFNI), the Barriers to Care Questionnaire in the ICU (BCQ-ICU), the Caregiver&#xD;
      Coping Strategies (CSS) questionnaire, and the Caregiver ICU Delirium Knowledge Questionnaire&#xD;
      (CIDKQ) upon enrollment. Additionally, all family members will complete the Delirium Burden&#xD;
      (DEL-B) questionnaire, Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (KPDS-10), Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) daily for a maximum of five&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members randomized to the intervention group will receive additional ICU delirium&#xD;
      education, whereas the control group will not. The intervention includes components of&#xD;
      delirium education, prevention/management and detection. Family members will receive&#xD;
      education by watching a 6-minute education video or reading an education booklet with a&#xD;
      trained research assistant on the signs of delirium, who is at risk, and what they can do to&#xD;
      prevent and manage it. They will practice identifying delirium with the Sour Seven&#xD;
      questionnaire using previously validated case vignettes of hypothetical ICU patients.&#xD;
      Delirium prevention and management will include a daily checklist of non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions to be completed by the family member. This will include an orientation protocol&#xD;
      (e.g., provide visual and hearing aids, orientation of day/time/location, familiar objects&#xD;
      from home, television during the day with daily news, non-verbal music), mobility protocol&#xD;
      (cognitive activities depending on the patient's ability), and an environmental protocol&#xD;
      (lights off at night and on during the day, ear plugs, noise reduction during the night). In&#xD;
      addition to non-pharmacological delirium prevention and management, this list will have a&#xD;
      checkbox indicating if the family caregiver notified any member of the bedside care team&#xD;
      about symptoms of delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members in both intervention and control groups will also complete follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires at 1-month and 3-months through an online link to a REDCap survey. These&#xD;
      questionnaires will include the Family Satisfaction for the Intensive Care Unit (FSICU),&#xD;
      KPDS-10, GAD-7, PHQ-9, and CIDKQ .&#xD;
