  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease affecting the central&#xD;
      nervous system. It is the leading cause of severe non-traumatic disability in young adults&#xD;
      (20-40 years). It affects more than 540,000 individuals in Europe and around 2.8 million&#xD;
      people worldwide. The etiology of MS remains unknown to date, but probably results from a&#xD;
      genetic predisposition associated with environmental factors (vitamin D deficiency, tobacco,&#xD;
      vaccines, stress, diet, ...). MS is a neurological disease in which demyelination and axonal&#xD;
      loss lead to many symptoms such as fatigue, spasticity, decreased sensitivity, muscle&#xD;
      weakness, balance disorders, oculomotor visuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), which is used to rate functional disorders in MS&#xD;
      patients, tends to underestimate these neurological disorders, which are often present in the&#xD;
      early stages of the disease and are an important issue. major in the management and evolution&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been shown that motor and cognitive disorders appear in the early stages of&#xD;
      the disease, yet these functions are not systematically evaluated in the early stages of the&#xD;
      disease. These isolated or associated disorders often lead to real difficulties in realizing&#xD;
      everyday activities. Since this disease affects young people who still have a professional&#xD;
      activity, it is important not to underestimate the presence of these functional and cognitive&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore necessary to seek more precise means of evaluation to detect certain&#xD;
      neurological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the evaluation of these functions participates in the follow-up of the patient and&#xD;
      makes it possible to better apprehend the evolution of these disorders in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the concept of double-task to measure and evaluate these&#xD;
      functional and cognitive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dual task (DT) , is defined by the simultaneous completion of two tasks, one called&#xD;
      &quot;primary&quot; and the other called &quot;secondary&quot;, for which the performance changes are measured.&#xD;
      The dual task paradigms are based on the assumption that two concurrently performed tasks&#xD;
      interfere if they use identical functional and / or brain subsystems. In the case of a&#xD;
      paradigm involving walking and another task, the interference is based on the assumption of&#xD;
      the joint play of attention. The primary task is then the &quot;attentional&quot; task and the&#xD;
      secondary task is represented by walking. Observed inferences are changes in the performance&#xD;
      of one or both tasks that are measured by comparing single and dual task performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of DT's capabilities would improve the early detection of motor disorders in&#xD;
      MS patients. Early identification of postural instability would make it easier to target care&#xD;
      and improve patient follow-up. Conducting work on the concept of DT would improve our&#xD;
      knowledge of this paradigm in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a better understanding of double-stained mechanisms in MS could offer training&#xD;
      programs&#xD;
