  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a Phase 1-2, open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation and&#xD;
      cohort-expansion study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and&#xD;
      antitumor activity of Zotatifin (eFT226) in subjects with selected advanced solid tumor&#xD;
      malignancies. The study will evaluate weekly 1-hour intravenous (IV) administration of&#xD;
      Zotatifin (eFT226). Treatment and study subject evaluations will be performed in 21 day&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 (dose escalation) will enroll subjects with an advanced solid tumor that is refractory&#xD;
      or intolerant to standard of care therapy, where the tumor is pancreatic adenocarcinoma (no&#xD;
      molecular typing) or any other solid tumor that has a documented activating mutation,&#xD;
      amplification, or fusion of HER2, ERBB3, FGFR1, FGFR2, or an activating mutation in KRAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned sequentially to increasing eFT226 doses. The starting dose of&#xD;
      eFT226 is 0.005 mg/kg administered IV weekly in 21 day cycles. eFT226 doses will be escalated&#xD;
      in subsequent cohorts after subjects enrolled in a given cohort have completed the 21-day&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period. Dose escalation in Part 1 will enroll&#xD;
      subjects based on 3+3 design, whereby 3 subjects will be initially enrolled and treated at&#xD;
      each dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain as robust a data set as possible regarding PK, safety and tolerability in a diverse&#xD;
      population prior to selecting the RP2D, the MTD and MTD-1 cohorts may be backfilled up to 15&#xD;
      subjects total in each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (Expansion Cohort) of the study will provide cohort expansion to further explore the&#xD;
      safety, pharmacology, and clinical activity of eFT226 monotherapy in subjects with previously&#xD;
      treated advanced solid tumor malignancies. Part 2 will be based on results observed in Part 1&#xD;
      and will be defined by amendment to the protocol.&#xD;

    <description>eFT226 is a novel small-molecule, investigational drug being developed by eFFECTOR Therapeutics as an anticancer therapy. eFT226 is a potent and selective inhibitor of eIF4A1-mediated translation and selectively regulates the translation of a subset of mRNAs based on sequence specific recognition motifs in their 5'-UTR. eIF4A1 inhibition by eFT226 downregulates expression of receptor tyrosine kinases and KRAS, leading to decreased signaling through the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. Preclinical efficacy testing of eFT226 demonstrates activity across models of solid tumor cancers with amplifications in HER2, FGFR1/2 and mutations in KRAS (including breast, NSCLC and CRC).</description>
