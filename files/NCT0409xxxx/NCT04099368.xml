  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to characterize the emergence of music appreciation in people who have&#xD;
      suffered hearing loss and have been provided with partial restoration of hearing through&#xD;
      cochlear implantation. Music appreciation is complex and transverses multiple domains&#xD;
      including hearing acuity, speech and language acquisition, and quality of life. By studying&#xD;
      these relationships in people who have been given partial hearing restoration, the&#xD;
      investigators will clarify the role of music for promoting recovery from debilitating loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cochlear implants are medical devices that restore a remarkable degree of hearing to people&#xD;
      who would otherwise be profoundly deaf. These devices generally restore enough hearing that&#xD;
      recipients can understand spoken speech even in noisy environments. However, most recipients&#xD;
      express dissatisfaction with music. This proposal centers on understanding the challenges&#xD;
      that implant users face and the strategies that they adopt as they learn to appreciate music&#xD;
      with this new way of hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research is organized into three aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Characterize music appreciation after cochlear implantation. The proposed research&#xD;
      balances qualitative and quantitative methods to examine the emergence of music appreciation&#xD;
      after cochlear implantation. Qualitative methods will include semi-structured interviews and&#xD;
      focus groups designed to clarify the obstacles that implant users face as they learn to&#xD;
      appreciate music with their new sense of hearing. Quantitative methods include surveys of&#xD;
      music appreciation and quality of life, and auditory assessments of music and speech&#xD;
      perception. The primary hypothesis is that music appreciation is predictive of key domains of&#xD;
      quality of life including positive affect and well-being, and satisfaction with social roles&#xD;
      and activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine if pitch training improves cochlear implant speech comprehension. The&#xD;
      proposed research tests for a causal relationship between pitch salience and key features of&#xD;
      speech perception including talker discrimination, prosody detection, and speech recognition&#xD;
      in competing speech. Cochlear implant users and their normal-hearing peers will take part in&#xD;
      a crossover study to determine if pitch training improves aspects of music and speech&#xD;
      perception compared to a visual task used as a control. The primary hypothesis is that pitch&#xD;
      training will improve speech comprehension for cochlear implant users, but not for their&#xD;
      normal-hearing peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Test the limits of pitch coding in cochlear implants. The proposed research bypasses&#xD;
      conventional sound processing to study the salience of pitch provided by electrode location&#xD;
      and stimulation rate. These two stimulation cues are the primary cues for providing a sense&#xD;
      of pitch to cochlear implant users. New research has shown that implant users are able to&#xD;
      learn to use this information to hear pitch with better resolution far better than previously&#xD;
      thought. The primary hypothesis is that cochlear implant users have a latent ability to hear&#xD;
      pitch associated with stimulation rate, but that they require experience to learn how to hear&#xD;
      this new information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each aim, psychophysical methods are combined with measures of EEG and near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy. The results will establish the importance of music training for improving&#xD;
      cochlear implant outcomes, both in terms of hearing abilities and quality of life. The&#xD;
      results will lead to changes in how music is encoded into implant stimulation, providing&#xD;
      better outcomes for recipients. More generally, this project will shape understanding of&#xD;
      neural coding of music and its role in social adjustment following traumatic experiences.&#xD;
