  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral and intestinal mucositis are major risk factors for the occurrence of fever during&#xD;
      neutropenia and bloodstream infections after intensive chemo- and radiotherapy. These&#xD;
      complications often require dose reductions or cause delay of treatment, and thereby&#xD;
      interfere with optimal anticancer treatment. Currently, there are no effective strategies to&#xD;
      prevent or treat mucositis and the related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has shown to be pivotal in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of mucositis and recently, it has been established in murine models that IL-1&#xD;
      inhibition significantly ameliorates chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently conducted a phase IIa study (AFFECT-1, NCT03233776) studying the&#xD;
      safety and maximum tolerated dose of anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist&#xD;
      in adult patients with multiple myeloma receiving high-dose melphalan (HDM) in the&#xD;
      preparation for an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) who are at high&#xD;
      risk for experiencing mucositis and fever during neutropenia (FN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since treatment with anakinra has shown to be safe in this study population, the&#xD;
      investigators will continue with a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled multicenter&#xD;
      phase IIb trial to establish efficacy in the management of fever during neutropenia and&#xD;
      mucositis.&#xD;
