          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 35.4 kg/m2, inclusive; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg&#xD;
             (110 lb), at the Screening visit; with a single repeat assessment of total body weight&#xD;
             (and hence BMI), on a separate day permitted to assess eligibility, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, prior bariatric&#xD;
             surgery,gastrectomy, ileal resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At Screening, participants with a positive result for human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;

             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined&#xD;

             product used in this study (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known prior participation (ie, randomized and received at least 1&#xD;
             dose of investigational product) in a study involving PF-06865571.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive urine drug test, for illicit drugs on Day -1,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At Screening or Day -1, a positive breath alcohol test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants with partners who are currently pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more&#xD;
             within 60 days prior to dosing and until the follow-up contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and&#xD;

             Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
