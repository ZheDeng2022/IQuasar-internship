  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients that have a type of cancer that arises from the liver, either&#xD;
      called hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma. The cancer has come back, has not gone&#xD;
      away after standard treatment or the patient cannot receive standard treatment. This research&#xD;
      study will use special immune system cells called TEGAR T cells, a new experimental&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from&#xD;
      infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special&#xD;
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with&#xD;
      viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. The&#xD;
      investigator found from preclinical research that they can put a new gene into T cells that&#xD;
      will help them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In our preclinical studies, several&#xD;
      genes were made called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called GC33 that&#xD;
      recognizes glypican-3, a protein found on almost all hepatocellular carcinoma cells and&#xD;
      hepatoblastoma cells (GPC3-CAR). In the laboratory the investigators have been doing research&#xD;
      into GPC3-CAR cells. They have selected the GPC3-CAR with the strongest ability to recognize&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma cells for this study. This is a safety study where&#xD;
      the investigator will be testing the ability of GPC3-CAR cells to identify and kill tumor&#xD;
      cells in patients. The investigators also tested the effects of adding the molecule&#xD;
      interleukin-15 (IL-15) alone or with another molecule called interleukin-21. The&#xD;
      investigators found that IL-15 alone or together with IL-21 can help GPC3-CAR T cells last&#xD;
      longer which helps them to kill more tumor cells. In this study the investigator will be&#xD;
      testing the ability of GPC3-CAR cells to identify and kill tumor cells in patients. This is a&#xD;
      study looking at safety and the investigators will therefore be starting with GPC3-CAR T&#xD;
      cells alone in a set of patients. The first set of patients will receive GPC3-CAR T cells&#xD;
      that also express IL-15. In the second group, the investigators will evaluate GPC3-CAR T&#xD;
      cells that express both IL-15 and IL-21. If the investigators are able to safely give GPC3-&#xD;
      CAR T cells, they will increase the dose of the combination cells in other patients. The&#xD;
      product or dose level of cells that the participant will receive is based on when they are&#xD;
      enrolled on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GPC3-CAR T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of GPC3-CAR T cells that is safe, to&#xD;
      see how long they last in the body, to learn what the side effects are and to see if the&#xD;
      GPC3-CAR T cells will help people with GPC3-positive hepatocellular carcinoma or&#xD;
      hepatoblastoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A maximum of 42 subjects will participate in the treatment part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect up to 180 mL of the participants blood. The investigators will&#xD;
      use this blood to grow T cells. They will grow the T cells and use a retrovirus (a special&#xD;
      virus that can carry the GPC3 CAR gene into the T cells) to genetically engineer them. After&#xD;
      the CAR gene are put into the T cells, the investigators will make sure that they are able to&#xD;
      kill hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma cells in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to proliferate and&#xD;
      accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells&#xD;
      in circulation. Because of that, participants will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      (Cytoxan) and fludarabine for 3 days before receiving the T-cell infusion. These drugs will&#xD;
      decrease the numbers of the participants' T cells before the investigator infuse the GPC3-CAR&#xD;
      T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT THE INFUSION WILL BE LIKE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After making these cells, they were frozen. If the patient agrees to participate in this&#xD;
      study, they will be scheduled to be treated, the cells will then be thawed and injected into&#xD;
      the participant over 5 to 10 minutes. The participant will receive the GPC3-CAR T CELLS 48-72&#xD;
      hours after completing the chemotherapy. The participant may be pretreated with Tylenol&#xD;
      (acetaminophen) and Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Tylenol and Benadryl are given to prevent a&#xD;
      possible allergic reaction to the T cell administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose escalation study, which means that investigator does not know the highest dose&#xD;
      of GPC3-CAR T cells that is safe. To find out, the investigator will give the cells to at&#xD;
      least 3 participants at one dose level. If that is safe, the investigator will raise the dose&#xD;
      given to the next group of participants. The dose each patient gets will depend on how many&#xD;
      participants get the agent before that patient and how they react. The investigator will tell&#xD;
      each patient this information. This will help the patient think about possible harms and&#xD;
      benefits. Since the treatment is experimental, what is likely to happen at any dose is not&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the Treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Houston&#xD;
      Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests before treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam and History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EKG (electrocardiogram) to assess heart function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function and blood clotting (INR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patient is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) they will do a test to&#xD;
           measure the levels of the virus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test (if the patient is a female who can get pregnant)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the patient's tumor by scans (CT/MRI) and the tumor marker&#xD;
           alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), if the patient's tumor produces this protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests during and after treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams and History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function and blood clotting (INR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patient is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), the investigator will do a&#xD;
           test to measure the levels of the virus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the tumor maker alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), if the patient's tumor produces&#xD;
           this protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the patient's tumor by CT/MRI scans (6 -8 weeks after the infusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP STUDIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will follow the participant during and after the injections. To learn more&#xD;
      about the way the T cells are working in the patient's body, up to 60 mL (12 teaspoons) of&#xD;
      blood will be taken from the participant before the chemotherapy, before the T-cell infusion,&#xD;
      3 to 4 hours after the infusion, 3 to 4 days after the infusion (this time point is optional)&#xD;
      at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks after the injection, every 3 months for 1&#xD;
      year, every 6 months for 4 years and then every year for the next 10 years. Total time&#xD;
      participation for this study will be 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time points listed above, if the T cells are found in the patient's blood at a&#xD;
      certain amount an extra 5 mL of blood may need to be collected for additional testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will use this blood to look for the frequency and activity of the cells that&#xD;
      they have given ; that is, to learn more about the way the T cells are working and how long&#xD;
      they last in the body. The investigator will also use this blood to see if there are any&#xD;
      long-term side effects of putting the new gene (chimeric antigen receptor, CAR) into the&#xD;
      cells. In addition to the blood draws, because patient's have received cells that have had a&#xD;
      new gene put in them, they will need to have long term follow up for 15 years so the&#xD;
      investigator can see if there are any long term side effects of the gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a year, the patient will be asked to have their blood drawn and answer questions about&#xD;
      their general health and medical condition. The investigators may ask the patient to report&#xD;
      any recent hospitalizations, new medications, or the development of conditions or illness&#xD;
      that were not present when the patient enrolled in the study and may request that physical&#xD;
      exams and/or laboratory tests be performed if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a tumor biopsy is performed for clinical reasons the investigators will&#xD;
      request permission to obtain excess sample to learn more about the effects of the treatment&#xD;
      on the patient's disease. In the event of death, the investigators will request permission to&#xD;
      perform an autopsy to learn more about the effects of the treatment on the patient's disease&#xD;
      and if there were any side effects from the cells with the new gene .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will obtain tumor biopsy for research purposes only.&#xD;
      Associated risk with the biopsy will be discussed with the participant in detail in a&#xD;
      procedure specific consent form. The investigators will test the sample to see if the&#xD;
      GPC3-CAR T cells can be found in the tumor and what effect they had on the tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient develops a second abnormal cancer growth, significant blood or nervous system&#xD;
      disorder during the trial, a biopsy sample of the tissue will be tested (if a sample can be&#xD;
      obtained).&#xD;
