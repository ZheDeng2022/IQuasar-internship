      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Epilepsy is a seizure disorder. Sometimes it is treated with surgery. During surgery,&#xD;
      electrodes are placed on or in the brain. Researchers want to learn more about memory and the&#xD;
      brain. They want to do tests on people who are having epilepsy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about memory and brain function by recording brain cell activity during&#xD;
      memory tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults age 18 - 65 who have medically intractable epilepsy and will have electrodes placed&#xD;
      to identify the source of their seizures. They must be currently enrolled in protocol&#xD;
      11-N-0051.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may do memory tests before the electrodes are put in, while they are in&#xD;
           place, and after surgery. Researchers may stimulate areas of the brain with small pulses&#xD;
           of electricity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will start recording brain activity at least 12 hours after electrodes are&#xD;
           placed. They will record while participants are awake and asleep. They will record&#xD;
           before, during, and after seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have up to 3 testing sessions daily over the 1-3 weeks the electrodes&#xD;
           are in place. Each session will last 20-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will play games on a laptop. Sometimes they may use a button or joystick.&#xD;
           This can be done in bed in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be given a list of words and asked to recall them in a short time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be given pairs of items and asked to remember how they are related.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be asked to learn their way around a virtual town on the computer.&#xD;
           Their eye movements may be tracked by a small camera.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are (1) to identify biomarkers of successful memory&#xD;
      encoding and retrieval, and (2) to identify brain regions that can be stimulated to affect&#xD;
      memory performance. The secondary objective is to identify biomarkers that can be used to&#xD;
      predict cognitive impairment following resection surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred (100) adult subjects with epilepsy who are enrolled in 11-N-0051 Epilepsy Surgery&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll individuals with drug resistant epilepsy who are enrolled in a separate&#xD;
      protocol, 11-N-0051 Epilepsy Surgery, and who will undergo a neurosurgical procedure in which&#xD;
      seizure activity and cognitive functions are mapped using intracranial electrodes in order to&#xD;
      guide resection of seizure generating tissue. In this procedure, surgeons place electrodes&#xD;
      solely based on clinical consideration with the goal of identifying the seizure focus (or&#xD;
      foci) and also for purposes of functional mapping using electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to administer computerized memory tasks during the intracranial EEG monitoring&#xD;
      period. Memory testing may also occur during other patient visits for protocol 11-N-0051.&#xD;
      This testing may occur during a pre-surgical outpatient visit or during Phase 1&#xD;
      (pre-implantation) monitoring, to establish baseline memory performance, or after the&#xD;
      resection surgery, to identify potential changes in memory performance due to the resection.&#xD;
      All testing associated with this protocol will be done during visits or hospitalizations for&#xD;
      11-N-0051, and this protocol involves no additional study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some memory test sessions will include low-intensity electrical stimulation of the brain&#xD;
      using the intracranial electrodes. During these sessions, brain stimulation trials will be&#xD;
      interleaved with non- stimulation trials in a randomized fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG recordings will be retrospectively analyzed for the presence of biomarkers that correlate&#xD;
      with successful memory performance, and test performance will be compared between the&#xD;
      stimulation and no-stimulation conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies described here are voluntary and for research purpose only. They will not&#xD;
      interfere with the clinical evaluation or decision-making process for epilepsy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are (1) to identify biomarkers of successful memory encoding and&#xD;
      retrieval, and (2) to identify brain regions that can be stimulated to affect memory&#xD;
      performance. The secondary outcome is to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict&#xD;
      cognitive impairment following resection surgery.&#xD;

        Patients who are considered for this protocol are those with medically intractable epilepsy&#xD;
        and currently enrolled in 11-N-0051 Epilepsy Surgery. The patient population for this study&#xD;
        is restricted to patients with medically intractable epilepsy because they require surgery&#xD;
        for their condition. All participants in this study will require invasive monitoring as&#xD;
        part of a clinical evaluation that may lead to subsequent resection of an epileptogenic&#xD;
        focus. Enrollment will be equitable among those individuals who meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
        and will not be based on race, ethnicity, or gender.&#xD;
