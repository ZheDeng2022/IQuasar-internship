  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researcher want to learn more about the change of physical activity of&#xD;
      hemophilia A patients treated with damoctocog alfa pegol. Patients enrolled in this study&#xD;
      will be wearing a small device measuring daily active time. Researcher will compare these&#xD;
      physical activity data with patient's clinical data including bleeding events to gain&#xD;
      information on how bleeding levels are related to the activity level of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to enroll about 80 patients who are at the same time also participating in the&#xD;
      HEM-POWR study (NCT03932201) evaluating the effectiveness and safety of damoctocog alfa&#xD;
      pegol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the change in physical non-sedentary activity as&#xD;
      measured by the ActiGraph CentrePoint Insight Watch (ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, Florida) after&#xD;
      1, 2 and 3 years of treatment with damoctocog alfa pegol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine the&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in intensity of physical activity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association between physical activities and clinical outcomes / patient-reported outcome&#xD;
           scores/ number of bleeds,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients achieving WHO-recommended levels of activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Actual wear time.&#xD;

This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014.
