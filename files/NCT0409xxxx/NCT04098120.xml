      the study is To determine the necessity of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in CKD(stage&#xD;
      III---V) and haemodialyzed patients with upper GIT symptoms&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Chronic Kidney disease (CKD) is Kidney damage for ≥3 months, as defined by structural &amp;or&#xD;
      functional abnormalities of the kidney, with or without decreased GFR or GFR &lt;60&#xD;
      mL/min/1.73m2 for ≥3 months, with or without kidney damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage Description GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) Stage I Kidney damage &gt;90 with normal or ↑ GFR Stage&#xD;
      II Kidney damage with 60-89 mild ↓ in GFR Stage III Moderate ↓ in GFR 30-59 Stage IV Severe ↓&#xD;
      in GFR 15-29 Stage V Kidney failure &lt; 15 &lt; 15 (or dialysis) Or on dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      - CKD virtually affect the functions of all systems in our human body and associated with&#xD;
      several deleterious effects on different systems which is due to multiple risk factors and&#xD;
      associated with several abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract involving all its&#xD;
      segments, which include : Esophagitis: is present in more than a the third of the third of&#xD;
      cases of uremic patients. It is due to increase of intra-abdominal pressure and reflux. The&#xD;
      treatment of these patients is not different from that given to the general population with&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitors, once the endoscopic study has been done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastritis and peptic ulcer:as In patients with CKD and haemodialyzed patients, serum levels&#xD;
      of gastrin are increased due to increased its secretion and decrease its excretion as it is&#xD;
      eliminated by the kidney; additionally, cholecystokinin and secretin may be elevated.&#xD;
      Noninvasive tests (H. pylori) have lower sensitivity in CKD so upper endscopy is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CKD and ESRD patients have more symptoms than general population.Specifically,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal distress symptoms and peptic ulcers . The recurrence of peptic ulcer disease&#xD;
      (PUD) after Helicobacter pylori eradication is higher in uremic patients than in non-uremic&#xD;
      patients, and patients with ESRD have higher complication rates after ulcer development .&#xD;
      Therefore, upper endoscopy should be performed in patients with these risk factors more often&#xD;
      to prevent severe complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding ( Haematemesis and&#xD;
      melena). Angiodysplasia: affects the microcirculation of the mucosa and sub mucosa of the&#xD;
      entire gastrointestinal tract. It is a frequent cause of bleeding in elderly patients, and&#xD;
      its incidence is increased in patients on dialysis. Which diagnosed mainly by upper endoscopy&#xD;
      as well as for the treatment with hemostasis techniques. The other option is angiography&#xD;
      embolization, .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The manifestations of GIT in patients with chronic kidney disease and haemodialyzed patients&#xD;
      varies from anorexia,nausea, vomiting they have aprevalance of around 60% )and GIT bleeding&#xD;
      and viral hepatitis so it is across sectional study on 60 patients including CKD&#xD;
      stage(III---V)and haemodialyzed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be subjected to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full history and clinical examination . 2) Laboratory tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. CBC .&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. liver function testes including PT,PC,INR&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. blood urea and serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. serum calcium and phosphorus&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. urine analysis. 3) abdominal ultrasonography 4) upper endoscopy&#xD;
