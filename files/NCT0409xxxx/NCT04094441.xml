  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;The usefulness of respiratory physiotherapy and its execution modalities remains highly&#xD;
      debated even though reviews of the literature show that respiratory physiotherapy is able to&#xD;
      improve the drainage of bronchial secretions and pulmonary function tests during cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis in periods of stability. Different physiotherapy techniques have been developed but&#xD;
      the choice of one or the other facing a patient can not currently be recommended. The&#xD;
      VirtualChest project, supported by a grant from the National Agency for Research (ANR), aims&#xD;
      to develop and validate a physical model of respiratory physiotherapy (6 stages including&#xD;
      model establishment pulmonary: bronchial tree and pulmonary mechanics and parietal [steps 1&#xD;
      and 3], a model of mucus [step 2] and modeling the effect of physiotherapy [step 5]). This&#xD;
      project is integrated with stages 3 and 5 of this broad project and aims to get on a limited&#xD;
      number of children with cystic fibrosis a proof of concept (prediction of drainage&#xD;
      efficiency) and especially to feed the proposed physical models in order to subsequent&#xD;
      optimization of the model (step 6). The choice cystic fibrosis of the child was justified by&#xD;
      the effect demonstrated respiratory physiotherapy, particularly on respiratory functional&#xD;
      criteria, and the fact that the parietal mechanics varies physiologically at this age.&quot;&#xD;

      &quot;The clinical study will consist in carrying out, before and after hospital respiratory&#xD;
      physiotherapy, a measure impedance of the respiratory system by forced oscillations (IOS,&#xD;
      impulsometry: measurement during tidal breathing) and a measurement anatomical dead space&#xD;
      (duration of the two measurements: 10 minutes). The physiotherapist will make an initial&#xD;
      diagnosis (degree of bronchial obstruction), fill a form describing the modalities of the&#xD;
      physiotherapy session (methods used) and will evaluate the sputum volume got. On a limited&#xD;
      number of children (n = 6), expiratory flow will be measured during the session of&#xD;
      physiotherapy ; these measures will be carried out in hypersecreting children able to support&#xD;
      a face mask during the session and having had or before have a chest CT scan within 6 months.&#xD;
      The objective is to establish a correlation between sputum volume and the degree of&#xD;
      improvement of functional respiratory parameters, to establish criteria of central and / or&#xD;
      peripheral effect of physiotherapy (&quot;&quot;simple&quot;&quot; modeling obtained from measurements impedance&#xD;
      of the respiratory system) and to obtain the flow rates necessary and sufficient to mobilize&#xD;
      bronchial secretions. The data from this phase will allow to fuel the &quot;&quot;complex&quot;&quot; physical&#xD;
      model (distribution mucus in the airways). Moreover, for each of the patients will be&#xD;
      recovered the possible scanner performed within ± 6 months of the physiotherapy session which&#xD;
      will allow the extraction of the morphology of the airways of the patient. The goal is to get&#xD;
      in at least 6 patients a specific morphology of the airways and determine if this morphology&#xD;
      implementation allows to improve the model compared to the use of generic modeling or airway&#xD;
      tree. A total of 30 elderly Cystic Fibrosis children at least 4 years will be prospectively&#xD;
      included.&quot;&#xD;
