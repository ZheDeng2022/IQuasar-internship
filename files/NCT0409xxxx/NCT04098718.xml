    <textblock>
      Exacerbations of asthma and COPD are an important cause of hospital admission and the main&#xD;
      cause of annual winter bed shortages. Despite current guideline treatment with prednisolone,&#xD;
      40% of patients require further treatment, 15% are readmitted and, of those hospitalised, 10%&#xD;
      die within 3 months, all by definition treatment failures. The investigators have shown that&#xD;
      there are two dominant patterns of airway inflammation in patients presenting with an acute&#xD;
      episode: infection associated neutrophilic airway inflammation; and non-infection related&#xD;
      eosinophilic airway inflammation. These patterns cannot be distinguished reliably by clinical&#xD;
      categories (i.e. asthma or COPD) or a standard clinical assessment but are identified by the&#xD;
      peripheral blood eosinophil count. These findings raise important questions that targeted&#xD;
      treatment based on the blood eosinophil count would result in more efficient and effective&#xD;
      management. However, even in patients with the right pattern of airway inflammation the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of prednisolone have to be offset against a high potential for harm, with&#xD;
      an estimated the number needed to harm as 5 for every 10 patients treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benralizumab is an interleukin-5 receptor-α monoclonal antibody, injected subcutaneously,&#xD;
      which rapidly reduces peripheral blood eosinophils for 90 days with a satisfactory safety&#xD;
      profile. Benralizumab treatment at stable state has been shown to increase&#xD;
      post-bronchodilator FEV1 and reduce the rates of severe exacerbations in patients with severe&#xD;
      eosinophilic asthma and improve lung function in patients with eosinophilic COPD.&#xD;
      Benralizumab is an attractive candidate for the acute treatment of eosinophilic&#xD;
      exacerbations, without the side-effects of prednisolone. The investigators propose to test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that, for participants who have a raised eosinophil count at exacerbation, a&#xD;
      single injection of Benralizumab alone or in combination with prednisolone will improve&#xD;
      clinical outcomes compared to prednisolone alone. The investigators will also study the&#xD;
      effect of prednisolone on symptoms, lung function and quality of life, in an exacerbation&#xD;
      when the eosinophil count is not raised.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD are an important cause of hospital admission and the&#xD;
      main cause of annual winter bed shortages; responsible for the majority of asthma and COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations. Despite current guideline recommendations, treatment with oral corticosteroids&#xD;
      (for both asthma and COPD exacerbations) and antibiotics (for COPD exacerbations) is not&#xD;
      wholly adequate, whilst a significant number of patients suffer side effects from these&#xD;
      medicines. Furthermore, almost 40% of patients with an exacerbation, treated in a standard&#xD;
      way with oral prednisolone, do not respond and require further treatment or re-treatment, and&#xD;
      depressingly following a severe COPD exacerbation, 10% die within 30 days. The risk of death&#xD;
      in patients with asthma is especially high in those who have poorly controlled asthm5. These&#xD;
      events are all by definition treatment failures or non-response and impact on patient&#xD;
      outcomes. In patients with COPD the outlook is particularly bleak following a second hospital&#xD;
      admission with a significant increase in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation in exacerbations of asthma and COPD&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now recognised that there are two dominant patterns of airway inflammation in patients&#xD;
      presenting with an acute wheezing illness: 1. infection associated neutrophilic airway&#xD;
      inflammation; and 2. non-infection related eosinophilic airway inflammation; both related to&#xD;
      asthma and COPD, with a predominance of non-infection related eosinophilic inflammation in&#xD;
      patients with asthma. These patterns of airway inflammation are very rarely seen together and&#xD;
      cannot be distinguished reliably by clinical categories (i.e. asthma or COPD) or a standard&#xD;
      clinical assessment. They can however be identified by the peripheral blood eosinophil count,&#xD;
      which is ≥2% in 90% of patients with eosinophilic airway inflammation and &lt;2% in a similar&#xD;
      proportion of patients with infection associated neutrophilic airway inflammation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, these types of inflammation are consistent within patients, whether assessed&#xD;
      when in the stable state or in the setting of an acute attack. Furthermore, patients with&#xD;
      eosinophilic inflammation have been repeatedly shown to have more exacerbations and that&#xD;
      incomplete suppression of eosinophilic inflammation leads to an accelerated time to next&#xD;
      exacerbation in COPD. These findings raise important questions about our current 'one size&#xD;
      fits all' approach to management of acute wheezing illnesses in patients with asthma and COPD&#xD;
      and suggest that targeted treatment based on effective reduction of inflammation would result&#xD;
      in more efficient and effective management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of exacerbations&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key component of treatment of the acute exacerbation event in patients with asthma and COPD&#xD;
      is systemic corticosteroids i.e. oral prednisolone often at a dose of between 30-50mg once&#xD;
      per day for 5 to 14 days. This is especially the case in patients with eosinophilic&#xD;
      inflammation at the onset of the exacerbation event. However, even in patients with the right&#xD;
      pattern of airway inflammation the beneficial effects of prednisolone have to be offset&#xD;
      against a high potential for harm. One study using systemic corticosteroids in the&#xD;
      exacerbation setting in patients with COPD estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) to&#xD;
      reduce 1 treatment failure episode as 10 whilst simultaneously reporting that the number&#xD;
      needed to harm (NNH) as 5. Adverse effects include significant hyperglycaemia, leading to&#xD;
      diabetes in approximately 8% of patients' treated; osteoporosis with recurrent prescription;&#xD;
      and treatment induced psychosis. Moreover, in a recent retrospective analysis of hospital&#xD;
      prescriptions for systemic corticosteroids, excluding patients with airways disease, the&#xD;
      incidence of patients with adverse events and harm in the first 30 days of a short course&#xD;
      prednisolone prescription was significantly high, with an incidence rate (95%CI) of sepsis of&#xD;
      5.3 (3.8 to 7.1); venous thromboembolism of 3.3 (2.8 to 4.0); and fracture rate of 1.9 (1.7&#xD;
      to 2.1). Additional difficulties with prednisolone include the short duration of action and&#xD;
      the requirement for treatment adherence. These factors increase the chance of relapse as a&#xD;
      result of recurrent eosinophilic airway inflammation and has been shown to be associated with&#xD;
      an increased time to next exacerbation in a single centre study of 230 COPD patients.&#xD;
      Alternative treatments that have a more secure, selective and prolonged beneficial effect are&#xD;
      thus needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benralizumab, an IL5 receptor alpha monoclonal antibody: benefit risk considerations and dose&#xD;
      justification Benralizumab is a humanized afucosylated monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed&#xD;
      towards the human interleukin-5 (IL5) alpha receptor sub-unit, found on eosinophils and&#xD;
      basophils. Afucosylation confers enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)&#xD;
      which results in highly efficient eosinophil depletion by apoptosis22. Single and repeated&#xD;
      doses of benralizumab in mild to severe asthma patients' results in rapid and sustained&#xD;
      depletion of blood eosinophils; repeat doses of benralizumab subcutaneously (SC) also&#xD;
      markedly reduced airway mucosal/submucosal and sputum eosinophil levels. Benralizumab 30 mg&#xD;
      SC every 8 weeks is currently approved for severe eosinophilic asthma patients age ≥ 18 whose&#xD;
      asthma is poorly controlled by high dose ICS/LABA therapy based on 3 Phase III trials&#xD;
      demonstrating improvements in the annual rate of asthma exacerbations, lung function, asthma&#xD;
      symptoms, quality of life, and OCS-sparing in OCS-dependent asthma patients. More recently,&#xD;
      the safety profile of benralizumab in severe eosinophilic asthma patients during a second&#xD;
      year of treatment was shown to be similar to that of the first year of treatment, with no new&#xD;
      safety concerns27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the only other study where single intravenous doses of benralizumab were tested vs.&#xD;
      placebo at the time of an asthma exacerbation, the proportion of patients with at least 1&#xD;
      exacerbation was not different from placebo. However, benralizumab reduced asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation rates vs. placebo by 49% (3.59 vs 1.82; P=.01) and resulting in hospitalization&#xD;
      by 60% (1.62 vs 0.65; P=.02) and was well tolerated. This may have been influenced by i) the&#xD;
      lack of efficacy in treating non-eosinophilic exacerbations and ii) the additional harm from&#xD;
      prednisolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a Phase 1 study in mild to moderate asthmatics with sputum eosinophilia (MI-CP166), a&#xD;
      cohort of patients received 100 or 200 mg of benralizumab SC or placebo dosed every 4 weeks&#xD;
      for 3 doses. In this study the incidence of all adverse events was similar between the&#xD;
      placebo and benralizumab groups. In a Phase 2b, dose-ranging study in uncontrolled severe&#xD;
      asthma (MI-CP220) compared the safety and efficacy of SC benralizumab at 2, 20 and 100 mg&#xD;
      with placebo. Investigational product was dosed every 4 weeks for the first three doses and&#xD;
      every 8 weeks for a further 4 doses. Both the benralizumab 20 mg and 100 mg treatment arms&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy to reduce exacerbations and improve lung function, symptoms and quality&#xD;
      of life in patients with high blood eosinophils compared to placebo. Treatment-emergent&#xD;
      adverse events were reported by a higher proportion of participants in the combined&#xD;
      benralizumab groups (277 of 385, 72%) than in the placebo groups (143 of 221, 65%) and&#xD;
      serious adverse events were reported by the same proportion of participants receiving&#xD;
      benralizumab as for placebo at 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2a study in moderate to very severe COPD patients with sputum eosinophilia&#xD;
      (MI-CP196) compared the safety and efficacy of benralizumab 100 mg SC to placebo dosed every&#xD;
      4 weeks for the first three doses and every 8 weeks for a further 5 doses. Benralizumab&#xD;
      demonstrated numerical, albeit non-significant, improvements in acute exacerbations, lung&#xD;
      function and quality of life in a sub-set of patients with high blood eosinophils. There was&#xD;
      little difference between groups in the total number of treatment-emergent adverse events,&#xD;
      the proportion of patients who reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, and&#xD;
      events with an incidence of 5% or greater. A higher incidence of serious treatment-emergent&#xD;
      adverse events were recorded in patients in the benralizumab group than in those in the&#xD;
      placebo group (14 vs 9 patients), although none of these events were considered by the&#xD;
      investigator to be benralizumab related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 100 mg SC dose of benralizumab was also extensively studied in two large Phase 3 trials32&#xD;
      [GALATHEA &amp; TERRANOVA] in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. Both studies did not&#xD;
      meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction of exacerbations. The&#xD;
      safety and tolerability findings in the studies were consistent with those observed in&#xD;
      previous trials with benralizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      As discussed above, prednisolone is the main stay of treatment for all patients with an&#xD;
      exacerbation of COPD. Previous work with a different IL-5 monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab)&#xD;
      has shown efficacy in preventing COPD exacerbations in patients with a raised eosinophil&#xD;
      count. As benralizumab is a novel agent for the treatment of COPD exacerbation, the trial&#xD;
      will included a combination arm to assess the potential added benefit of benralizumab to&#xD;
      prednisolone during an exacerbation of asthma and/or COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with asthma and/or COPD can sometimes have variable stability of their raised blood&#xD;
      eosinophil count34. The observational arm will thus have two purposes. The first aim of the&#xD;
      observation group will be to observe the clinical response to prednisolone when the&#xD;
      eosinophil count in not raised and to compare this to prednisolone alone treatment when the&#xD;
      eosinophil count is raised. It is believed and there is previous data to suggest that&#xD;
      corticosteroids are not beneficial for patients with a low eosinophil count and may be&#xD;
      harmful, although this remains to be the standard treatment for these patients. The second&#xD;
      aim of the observational group will be to allow us to maintain a pool of patients who could&#xD;
      potentially have an eosinophilic exacerbation in the future. As will be described further in&#xD;
      this protocol, patients would be eligible to consent if they have shown a raised blood&#xD;
      eosinophil count in the 2 years prior to consenting at Visit 1. The observational arm will&#xD;
      capture patients who did not have a raised eosinophil count at time of their first&#xD;
      exacerbation. They will then be allowed up to 4 non-eosinophilic exacerbations in the&#xD;
      observational group. Patients would be unlikely to have an eosinophilic exacerbation after 4&#xD;
      non-eosinophilic exacerbations and therefore would not continue to be tested during further&#xD;
      exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis being tested is that for patients with an exacerbation of asthma and/or COPD,&#xD;
      who have a raised peripheral blood eosinophil count (≥300 cells/uL), a single injection of&#xD;
      Benralizumab alone or in combination with prednisolone, will increase the rate of recovery&#xD;
      and reduce the rate of treatment failure, compared to prednisolone. This will also be&#xD;
      compared this with an observational arm of prednisolone treatment (usual care) of&#xD;
      non-eosinophilic exacerbations.&#xD;
