  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of administering a&#xD;
      single intravenous (IV) infusion dose of TAK-925 to adult participants with idiopathic&#xD;
      hypersomnia (IH).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study in participants with IH is called TAK-925. The study will&#xD;
      have 2-treatment crossover groups. The study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and tolerability of a single intravenous (IV) dose of Dose A&#xD;
      in participants with IH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 40 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment sequence groups as indicated below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-925 + Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo + TAK-925&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each treatment period, TAK-925 or placebo will be administered as a single 9-hour&#xD;
      IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multicenter study will be conducted in the United States and Japan. The overall duration&#xD;
      of treatment in this study is approximately 41 days including screening up to 28 days,&#xD;
      confinement for 6 days and end of study follow up telephone call on Study Day 11.&#xD;

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
