      Povidone Iodine solution is a nasal antiseptic. Its application has been shown to be&#xD;
      clinically safe, tolerable and effective against bacteria and fungi associated with chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of Povidone Iodine in this hard-to-treat patient&#xD;
      group. Furthermore, the study will also further evaluate any side effects that may occur with&#xD;
      the use of Povidone Iodine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and scientific rationale Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory condition&#xD;
      of the paranasal sinuses affecting millions of patients, resulting in billions of dollars&#xD;
      being spent annually in associated health care costs. Biofilm has been implicated in chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis recalcitrant to appropriate medical therapy and well-executed endoscopic sinus&#xD;
      surgery. The presence of biofilm results in patients having worse postoperative symptoms,&#xD;
      recurrent infections, and persistent inflammation. Biofilms are bacterial or fungi&#xD;
      communities surrounded by an extracellular polysaccharide matrix, which facilitates&#xD;
      attachment to mucosa, survival, protection and proliferation. This configuration allows for&#xD;
      resistance to innate host defenses and resistance to antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Povidone Iodine solution 5% (0.5% available iodine) by 3MTM has been specially formulated as&#xD;
      a nasal antiseptic. They have shown topical application to be clinically safe, tolerable and&#xD;
      to be rapidly bacteriocidal against aerobic gram positive and gram- negative bacteria&#xD;
      including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus&#xD;
      epidermidis, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) and&#xD;
      yeast(3M study 05-011100,05-011017, 05-011322).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine is the active antimicrobial component in PVP-I. It has potent bactericidal, fungicidal&#xD;
      and viricidal properties. It is an important element in the human body and is not known to be&#xD;
      an allergen. Therefore there are no true allergies to iodine but rare cases of intolerance.&#xD;
      In Japan, it is commonly recommended to gargle with PVP-Ito prevent upper respiratory&#xD;
      infections. A prospective study evaluating the effect of mouth rinsing on iodine absorption&#xD;
      and thyroid function showed that use of the mouthwash 4 times a day for 2 weeks or once a day&#xD;
      for 24 weeks did not affect thyroid function. An evidence based review of randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials and comparative studies determining the efficacy and risk associated with&#xD;
      PVP-I irrigations used in general surgery, cardiovascular surgery, urological surgery, and&#xD;
      orthopedic surgery found no significant risk were associated with the PVP-I irrigations other&#xD;
      than increasing serum iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of published data on the use of iodine during or after sinus surgery to&#xD;
      treat biofilm. This study aims to determine if topical PVP-I rinses will result in an&#xD;
      improvement in disease severity as determined by endoscopic scores (Modified Lund-Kennedy&#xD;
      score). Secondly, as biofilm has been recognized as a source of poor outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with recalcitrant chronic sinusitis (CRS), the study aims to determine if there's a&#xD;
      significant reduction in biofilm biomass (bacterial or fungal) within the sinuses of&#xD;
      recalcitrant CRS patients. In addition, the study will evaluate if there is a significant&#xD;
      symptomatic improvement with the use of iodine rinses post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine differences in Modified Lund-Kennedy (MLK) endoscopic score after 6 weeks of&#xD;
      using Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) sinus rinses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if the use of Povidone iodine (PVP-I) sinus rinses reduces the&#xD;
           number/density of biofilm colony forming units (bacterial or fungal) seen on mucosal&#xD;
           biopsy of the sinus with evidence of recalcitrant/recurrent chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)&#xD;
           after 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if the use of PVP-I sinus rinse improves disease specific quality of life&#xD;
           in recalcitrant/recurrent CRS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following information will be obtained from each participant&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Age Gender Smoking status&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thyroid function test (TSH and FT3/FT4 levels if indicated) at baseline and 6 weeks&#xD;
           Eosinophil and Basophil levels Serum IgE levels Bacterial and fungal cultures (at&#xD;
           baseline and 6weeks) History of sinus surgery Smell test at baseline and 6 weeks&#xD;
           Saccharin test (Baseline and after 6 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Conduct of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Upon enrollment in the study, demographic data and clinical data will be obtained. The&#xD;
           patient will be asked to fill out a SNOT-22 questionnaire, endoscopic pictures will be&#xD;
           taken, culture taken via a suction trap and a biopsy of the sinus lining evidently&#xD;
           affected by biofilm. The biopsy is painless and does not usually require local&#xD;
           anesthesia but will be used if requested by the patient. A single bite of the mucosa is&#xD;
           taken to remove tissue approximately 1x1mm. Bleeding is temporary and resolves&#xD;
           spontaneously. Baseline smell test (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification&#xD;
           Test) followed by a saccharin test is done. All of the above except for the saccharin&#xD;
           test and mucosal biopsy are a part of the routine clinical examination done for the&#xD;
           patients in the rhinology clinic. A saccharin test will be used to establish the&#xD;
           baseline cilia function, which is known to be denuded by biofilm13.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The biopsy will be examined for biofilm (density and type of colony forming units) by&#xD;
           scanning electron microscopy at the Centre for High-Throughput Phenogenomics at the&#xD;
           University of British Columbia (UBC), part of the UBC Imaging Labs27.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient will then be sent for baseline blood work (thyroid function test, IgE,&#xD;
           eosinophil and basophil levels) and instructed to rinse with PVP-I added to their&#xD;
           regular saline rinse. They will continue using the rinse for 6 weeks until they come&#xD;
           back for their follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will then be seen 6 weeks later. They will be required to fill out the SNOT-22&#xD;
           questionnaire and would undergo endoscopic examination, smell and saccharin test. A&#xD;
           biopsy is then taken from an adjacent site to the one taken upon enrollment in the&#xD;
           study. They will then be sent for repeat eosinophil, basophil, IgE and TFTs levels. A&#xD;
           blood test is a normal part of the evaluation done for the rhinology patient. The&#xD;
           addition of the TFT will not require more injections for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Management of Patient Care&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. Patients who experience&#xD;
           signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity to iodine, burning, itching, pain redness,&#xD;
           tiredness, nausea or vomiting will be asked to stop the rinses immediately. The reaction&#xD;
           will be noted and the code will be broken so that a discussion can occur between the&#xD;
           physician and the patient regarding the use of iodine with the nasal rinses. Patients&#xD;
           who meet any of the exclusion criteria that were not noted at the beginning of the study&#xD;
           will be removed from this study and the physician will discuss the future management&#xD;
           options with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
           Povidone Iodine (PVP-I)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dosing and Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
           PVP-I is provided in the form of a liquid at a concentration of 10% (1% available&#xD;
           iodine). 2 mL of PVP-I will be diluted into 250 mL of saline solution. The final&#xD;
           concentration of available iodine in the solution would be 0.008%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dose Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient will dilute 2 mL of 10% iodine into a 250 mL rinse bottle once a day&#xD;
&#xD;
           Duration of therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient will administer the PVP-I or Saline rinse for 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
           Side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
           The literature has some isolated reports of adverse reactions to iodine administration&#xD;
           to include burning, swelling, and pain. No documented episode of anaphylaxis due to&#xD;
           iodine has been identified in the literature. There are reports of TSH suppression with&#xD;
           excessive mouth gargles with iodine, however, this is quickly reverses upon cessation of&#xD;
           use.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Budesonide&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dosing and Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Budesonide is provided in nebules (1mg/2cc). Patients will place two nebules of&#xD;
           budesonide into the 250mls of saline&#xD;
&#xD;
           .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dose Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will administer the rinse once a day (2mg per day in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Duration of Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will administer the budesonide for the entire duration of the study (42 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Side Effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Budesonide is generally well tolerated. The most common side-effect is drying of the&#xD;
           nose, which may lead to nose bleeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inhaled budesonide may cause dysphonia, sore throat, and oralpharyngeal candidiasis.&#xD;
           Headaches, asthenia and pain have been attributed to inhale budesonide as well. There&#xD;
           are a number of ide effects which require consideration if topical budesonide reaches&#xD;
           similar plasma concentrations as oralbudesonide, which include: depression, aggression,&#xD;
           irritability, anxiety, psychosis, increased appetite, confusion, insomnia, nervousness,&#xD;
           sleep disorder, amnesia, somnolence, reduction in bone density, chest pain,&#xD;
           palpitations, tachycardia, dependent edema, facial edema, hypertension, flushing,&#xD;
           increased C-reactive protein, acne, alopecia, dermatitis, eczema, increased sweating and&#xD;
           skin disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on a retrospective study from our centre (St. Paul's Sinus Centre), that noted&#xD;
           change in MLK score for 69 patients who used PVP-I, we were able to calculate a sample&#xD;
           size for our prospective cohort study. 15 patients (30 sinus cavities) will be required&#xD;
           to have an 80% chance at detecting a statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.05) decrease&#xD;
           in MLK score. To account for a drop-out rate of 25% we plan to recruit 19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome will be the change in MLK score before and after PVP-I use for 6&#xD;
           weeks. Secondary outcomes will be patient-reported quality of life (SNOT-22) and&#xD;
           difference in biofilm CFUs. Descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD) will be used to&#xD;
           describe demographic characteristics of the patients. The difference in MLK scores,&#xD;
           CFUs, and SNOT-22 before and after treatment within and between groups will be analyzed&#xD;
           using paired and unpaired students t-tests based on the variance of the outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who experience signs and symptoms of iodine reaction will be noted and the code&#xD;
           will be broken so that a discussion can occur between the research supervisor and the&#xD;
           patient regarding the use of the topical iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients can contact the office anytime if they notice any of the signs or symptoms of&#xD;
           iodine reaction and will be seen by the research supervisor (or designate) within 24&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse Events (AE's)&#xD;
&#xD;
           All expected and unexpected adverse events will be recorded and graded by the research&#xD;
           supervisor. Stablechronic conditions, which are present prior to the clinical trial&#xD;
           entry and do not worsen, are not consideredadverse events and will be accounted for in&#xD;
           the patient's medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recording/Documentation of Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
           During each patient visit, the research supervisor will ask appropriate questions and&#xD;
           perform a physical exam to elicit any adverse events. The research supervisor will also&#xD;
           review blood work obtained from the patient. All reportable adverse events will be&#xD;
           recorded on appropriate case report form. The research supervisor will also write the&#xD;
           stop date, the severity of the AE and his judgment of the AE's relationship to the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serious Adverse Events (SAE's)&#xD;
&#xD;
           An SAE is defined as an AE meeting one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Death occurring between Day 0 and 42 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Life Threatening Event (defined as a participant at immediate risk of death at the&#xD;
                time of the event)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization between Day&#xD;
                0 and 42 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the event of SAE, the research supervisor will discuss with the patient (or next of&#xD;
           kin) whether there is a relationship between the study and the SAE. If there is a&#xD;
           relationship, the PI will be responsible for coordinating care for the patient until the&#xD;
           SAE has been addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pregnancy During the Trial Patients will be responsible for determining if they are&#xD;
           pregnant or become pregnant during the study. If patients notify the PI they are&#xD;
           pregnant, they will be removed from the study and the medical management options will be&#xD;
           discussed.&#xD;
