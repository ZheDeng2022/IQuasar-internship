    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dutasteride in reducing&#xD;
      drinking and heavy drinking in men and women with alcohol use disorder. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that dutasteride 1 mg per day will be well tolerated in this patient population&#xD;
      and that, compared to placebo treatment, dutasteride will result in a greater reduction in&#xD;
      drinks per week and in the frequency of heavy drinking days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heavy drinking remains a significant public health problem and is frequently under treated.&#xD;
      Although several medications have been shown to help patients stop or reduce drinking,&#xD;
      additional medication options are needed as there is considerable variability in&#xD;
      effectiveness or tolerability of existing medications for individual patients. Additionally,&#xD;
      identification of individual subject level predictors of efficacy are needed to better&#xD;
      personalize pharmacotherapy treatment recommendations. This study will seek to replicate and&#xD;
      extend our results showing efficacy of a novel medication dutasteride for reducing drinking&#xD;
      and will examine potential easily measured predictors of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dutasteride is a widely prescribed medication for benign prostatic hypertrophy and androgenic&#xD;
      hair loss that also modulates the elimination of cortisol and the production of some&#xD;
      neuroactive steroids. Changes in the regulation of cortisol and neuroactive steroids have&#xD;
      each been suggested as factors which may contribute to the maintenance of alcohol dependence.&#xD;
      Data from a recently completed first randomized placebo controlled trial of dutasteride for&#xD;
      AUD in a sample of male drinkers, indicates that dutasteride is well tolerated in alcoholics&#xD;
      and has efficacy in helping subjects reduce drinking. Additionally, results indicate that&#xD;
      dutasteride may be particularly helpful for patients who drink to cope with anxiety and&#xD;
      negative emotions, a group of patients with poor response to other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 24-week treatment study will use an innovative randomized placebo controlled step&#xD;
      therapy design to examine the safety and efficacy of dutasteride to reduce drinking by&#xD;
      treatment seeking women and men with hazardous levels of alcohol use. At 12-weeks placebo&#xD;
      non-responders will transition to dutasteride and dutasteride non-responders will transition&#xD;
      to naltrexone, an FDA approved medication with demonstrated efficacy for reducing heavy&#xD;
      drinking. 12-week responders (reduction in drinks/week of 60% or greater compared with&#xD;
      screening) will continue for an additional 12-weeks on their initial study medication&#xD;
      assignment (dutasteride or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will examine several baseline measures as predictors of&#xD;
      dutasteride efficacy, including drinking to cope, anxiety, adverse child events, and&#xD;
      perceived life stress as well as stress resilient vs. reactive genotypes of FKBP5 a chaperone&#xD;
      protein involved in regulation of glucocorticoid, androgen and progesterone receptor&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study consists of two 12-week phases, the first being a 12-week parallel-groups comparison of dutasteride and placebo to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dutasteride 1 mg/day in reducing the likelihood of drinking and heavy drinking in treatment-seeking men and women with alcohol use disorder. In the second 12-week phase, responders in phase 1 (defined as a â‰¥60% reduction in SD/wk for weeks 9-12 compared with screening) will continue on their initial medication assignment, while non-responder subjects treated with placebo in phase 1 will be given dutasteride during phase 2, and non-responder subjects treated with dutasteride in phase 1 will receive naltrexone daily in phase 2. This design maintains double blind conditions in both phases 1 and 2.</intervention_model_description>
