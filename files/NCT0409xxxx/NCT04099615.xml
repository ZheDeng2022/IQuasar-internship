  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion&#xD;
      does not always lead to good clinical and functional outcome, despite achieving complete&#xD;
      arterial recanalization. The rate of significant functional disability or death after three&#xD;
      months of an acute ischemic stroke still ranges from 40% to 67%. There is experimental and&#xD;
      clinical evidence that somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) are good indicators of cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of N20&#xD;
      response of SEPs prior to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) as a predictor of functional&#xD;
      independence at 90 days after endovascular treatment. Secondly, the investigators will study&#xD;
      whether SEPs may be neurophysiological markers of brain tissue in ischemic penumbra and&#xD;
      optimal collateral circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bilateral median nerve SEPs will be recorded before and continuously during MT in patients&#xD;
      with acute ischemic stroke and anterior large vessel occlusion. N20 response ipsilateral to&#xD;
      the cerebral hemisphere affected will be measured (qualitatively and quantitatively). The&#xD;
      adjusted predictive value of the N20 biomarker on functional independence after MT will be&#xD;
      analyzed by binary logistic regression and its predictive value on the full range of&#xD;
      disability by ordinal logistic regression. The investigators will construct different&#xD;
      regression models with other clinical predictors available at the prehospital setting and&#xD;
      with those determined after hospital admission to determine the independent predictive power&#xD;
      of the N20 response for a potential treatment decision-making. Finally, the investigators&#xD;
      will study whether SEP can be neurophysiological markers ischemic penumbra tissue and optimal&#xD;
      collateral circulation through its correlation with multimodal neuroimaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEPs recording is non-invasive technique that can be performed at the bedside of the patient.&#xD;
      The development of a portable device which could allow SEPs recording by sanitary staff (pre-&#xD;
      and intrahospitally) would provide early data about N20 value, speeding up streamline&#xD;
      decision making.&#xD;

      PROMISE (somatosensory evoked PotEntials MonItoring during the acute ischemic StrokE) is a&#xD;
      prospective, observational, single center study of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs)&#xD;
      monitoring with blinded clinical and neuroimaging evaluation of a cohort of patients with&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (MT). The study is&#xD;
      conducted under clinical routine protocols following the ESO and ASA guidelines (29). All&#xD;
      patients, or their surrogates, provide written informed consent for using their clinical data&#xD;
      for the research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed to confirm in a large cohort a diagnostic hypothesis previously&#xD;
      tested in a pilot academic study. The invention, as a solution to a specific technological&#xD;
      problem, novelty, usefulness, and non-obviousness, has been protected by an European patent.&#xD;
      The pilot study was founded by our academic Institution. This confirmatory study aims to&#xD;
      validate the presence of the N20 response on SEPs monitoring prior to- and during the&#xD;
      mechanical thrombectomy (MT) as a non-invasive and useful biomarker of functional recovery&#xD;
      after MT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Recruitment period has started in February 2018 and will be open until June 2020&#xD;
      since the project end is expected for December 2020. Eligible patients are older than 18&#xD;
      years with an score equal or less of 2 in the modified Rankin Scale, and an occlusion in the&#xD;
      anterior circulation (M1 or M2 segment of middle cerebral artery with or without ipsilateral&#xD;
      internal carotid artery (ICA) significant stenosis or occlusion diagnosed by CT angiography&#xD;
      (CTA) or angio-MRI) The study site is a certified comprehensive stroke center (CSC) that&#xD;
      treats more than 500 patients with acute stroke and performs more than 100 mechanical stroke&#xD;
      thrombectomy procedures annually and is staffed by trained neurointerventional technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 228 patients has been estimated to be necessary to demonstrate the utility of&#xD;
      SEPs. They are going to be recruited from acute stroke patients gone under urgent&#xD;
      thrombectomy in our center. Data of the patient is going to be register manually on paper and&#xD;
      electronically with a statistical program (SPSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical treatment and mechanical thrombectomy workflow. Intravenous alteplase is given within&#xD;
      4.5 hours in eligible patients following a model ship or drip and ship model with a DTN&#xD;
      target median time of less than 35 min. The target time from hospital arrival at the CSC to&#xD;
      groin puncture is 80 minutes or less and from study baseline neuroimaging to first&#xD;
      reperfusion is 90 minutes or less. MT is performed with stent retrievers or thrombus&#xD;
      aspiration. The use of general anesthesia or conscious sedation is left at the discretion of&#xD;
      the neurointerventional staff, but conscious sedation is preferred over intubation (30,31).&#xD;
      BP and vital signs are continuously monitored during the procedure. Patients are admitted at&#xD;
      acute stroke units (or ICU if needed) and treated following the European Stroke Organization&#xD;
      ESO guidelines(32)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and neuroimaging assessments All participants have standard assessments of&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, medical history, laboratory values and stroke severity by means&#xD;
      of NIHSS score at the moment of the admission. Time metrics from stroke onset to different&#xD;
      diagnostic and treatment interventions will be recorded during the acute phase. Basal&#xD;
      neuroimaging may be indistinctly noncontrast head computed tomography (NCCT) plus CTA,&#xD;
      multiparametric MR or perfusion CT (CTP) if MR is not available. In patients whose vascular&#xD;
      occlusion study confirming qualifying occlusion is performed beyond 4.5 hours of last seen&#xD;
      well or when the neurointerventional team is not immediately available in-hospital,&#xD;
      multiparametric MR or CTP are recommended prior to the endovascular treatment, although&#xD;
      treatment decision is only made following the ASPECTS score criteria. Follow-up NCCT or MR&#xD;
      scans are performed within 24 hours for assessment of infarct volume and to rule out&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage or malignant edema. CTA, MRA or TCD are used to confirm persisting&#xD;
      vessel revascularization at 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTP protocol is carried out on a 64 detector scanner (APV General Electrics, GE Medical&#xD;
      Systems; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) and includes CBF, CBV, MTT and TMax perfusion maps. MR&#xD;
      protocol is carried out on a 3 Tesla Siemens Magneton Verio with a 32-Channel Head Coil. MR&#xD;
      images include axial brain SWI/EPI-gradient recalled echo (GRE), DWI, fluid attenuation&#xD;
      inversion recovery imaging (FLAIR), Angio MR TOF, dMRA (dynamic postcontrast MR angiography)&#xD;
      and perfusion study, which is performed immediately after dynamic study. All images are&#xD;
      anonymised and stored in DICOM format. Blinded investigators to clinical outcome and SEPs&#xD;
      monitoring adjudicate all neuroimaging studies. Imaging investigators perform a visual&#xD;
      analysis of qualitative variables and quantitative analysis of post-processed variables:&#xD;
      firstpass permeability and perfusion maps. Post-process of DWI and perfusion sequences are&#xD;
      done by using Olea Sphere platform. In addition, RAPID software (iSchemaView, Redwood City,&#xD;
      CA) is used for emergent baseline and follow-up ischemic lesion volume calculation on MR-DWI&#xD;
      or CTP-rCBF maps and for the automatic evaluation os ASPECTS score on NCCT and DWI-MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-procedural imaging variables include volume and location of ischemic core and&#xD;
      hypoperfused tissue at baseline, severity of hypoperfusion, site of occlusion and degree of&#xD;
      collaterals according to the Arterial Collateral Grading Scale (ACG) if CTA or by using the&#xD;
      ASITN/SIR Collateral Grading System scale if dMRA is performed. Follow-up images include&#xD;
      volume and location of ischemic lesion, hemorrhagic transformation and arterial status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing: SEPs monitoring Evoked potentials recordings are performed by the intraoperative&#xD;
      monitoring system OSIRIS (Inomed Medizintechnik GmbH). SEPs recording are initiated in the&#xD;
      emergency room or the angiosuit before the groin puncture and endovascular treatment, and&#xD;
      continuous during the procedure. Because there may also be neurological damage during&#xD;
      reperfusion (33), SEPs recordings are prolonged until patient leaves the angiography room and&#xD;
      is transferred to the Acute Stroke Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both median nerves will be stimulated at wrist by means of surface adhesive electrodes. The&#xD;
      investigators use supramaximal stimulation defined as the intensity that causes visually&#xD;
      perceptible movement of the stimulated limb. The investigators apply square wave electrical&#xD;
      pulses of 0.2 ms duration at a frequency of 5.7Hz. The investigators used a rate of 6.7 Hz if&#xD;
      it is required according to the signal-to-noise ratio. SEPs are recorded in a referential&#xD;
      fashion from the C3' (right median nerve stimulation) and C4' (left median nerve stimulation)&#xD;
      positions and from a reference electrode at Fpz (international 10-20 system) or Cz'&#xD;
      electrodes (2 cm behind Cz). The investigators use needle electrodes in conscious patients or&#xD;
      &quot;cork screw&quot; electrodes in patients under general anesthesia during the thrombectomy&#xD;
      procedure (Figure 1). The signal was digitally filtered (5-200 Hz bandpass) and analyzed&#xD;
      within 80 msec time window poststimulus. Twenty to one hundred fifty trials were averaged&#xD;
      depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target signal is the presence of N20 response ipsilateral to the stroke site.&#xD;
      Secondarily, the investigators also measure the amplitude and latency of N20 response both&#xD;
      ipsilateral and contralateral to the stroke site. SEPs traces were analyzed at the moment of&#xD;
      their recording by the examinators. Later, they also were analyzed by another blinded&#xD;
      investigator to clinical outcome and SEPs monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor evoked potentials can not be performed because patients are awoke during the&#xD;
      endovascular procedure according to the current standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome The primary outcome is the functional independence at 7 days or discharge,&#xD;
      defined by the modified Rankin scale score 0- 2. This early and more feasible outcome has a&#xD;
      very high correlation with functional dependence at 90 days (Davalos A et al. Lancet Neurol&#xD;
      2017). Local certified assessors who are unaware of the SEPs monitoring findings evaluate the&#xD;
      primary outcome variable in each patient by means of a structured interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes Secondary clinical outcomes are the primary outcome evaluated at 90 days,&#xD;
      the severity of disability at 7 days and 90 days, according to the distribution of scores on&#xD;
      the modified Rankin scale (shift analysis), severe disability (score of 5) and death (score&#xD;
      of 6) are combined into a single, worst category; early dramatic response to treatment&#xD;
      (defined as a decrease in the NIHSS score of 8 or more points from baseline or an NIHSS score&#xD;
      of 0 to 2 at 24 hours); and neurologic improvement at 24 hours defined as a decrease in the&#xD;
      NIHSS score of 4 or more points from baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary neuroimaging variables are adjudicated infarct volume on CT or MRI at 24 hours;&#xD;
      postprocedural revascularization classified as modified TICI scale 2b or 3 (indicating&#xD;
      reperfusion of more than 50% of the affected territory); degree of vessel revascularization&#xD;
      on CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA) at 24 hours by using AOL scale or TCD by&#xD;
      using TIMI score. In a subgroup of patients with pre- and post-MT multimodal MR or CTP, it&#xD;
      will be calculated tissue perfusion recovery as the reperfusion index (TMax6s pre-MT x TMax6s&#xD;
      post-MT)/TMax6s pre-MT). Lately, baseline imaging variables are also studied as potential&#xD;
      predictors of recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety variables Safety outcomes are the rates of death and symptomatic intracranial&#xD;
      hemorrhage at 90 days, as confirmed on neuroimaging (CT or MRI) evaluated by blinded&#xD;
      investigators, according to the definition used in the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in&#xD;
      Stroke-Monitoring Study (SITS-MOST). Evaluators also use the definition of symptomatic&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage that was used in the second European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study&#xD;
      (ECASS II) An independent investigator adjudicates procedure-related complications. Blood&#xD;
      pressure variations during the procedure are also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis All analyses will be performed in the total monitored patients&#xD;
      (feasibility analysis). The primary measure of the effect size will be the unadjusted&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity (and their 95%CI) of the N20 response on SEPs prior to MT in&#xD;
      predicting functional independence at 7 days or at discharge if earlier after treatment in&#xD;
      patients with acute stroke and anterior large vessel occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our preliminary results, preestablished effect size is a true-positive rate of&#xD;
      positive detection (functional independence) of &gt; 92% (sensitivity) retaining a good rate of&#xD;
      true-negative of negative detection (functional dependence) &gt;90% (negative predictive value).&#xD;
      In order to maintain the 95% low confidence intervals over 85% in both proportions, and&#xD;
      considering a rate of negative detection of 28.6%, 228 patients are needed, 65 without N20&#xD;
      response and 163 with positive detection of N20 response. The adjusted predictive value of&#xD;
      the N20 biomarker on functional independence after MT will be analyzed by binary logistic&#xD;
      regression and its predictive value on the full range of disability (shift analysis) by&#xD;
      ordinal logistic regression. The investigators will construct different regression models&#xD;
      with other clinical predictors available at the prehospital setting and with those determined&#xD;
      after hospital admission, including clinical and easy assessable imaging predictors. This&#xD;
      analysis will give the independent predictive power of the N20 response for a potential&#xD;
      treatment decision-making. The investigators will also evaluate the predictive binary effect&#xD;
      of the N20 as a function of time from onset of symptoms to the first SEP stimulation and as a&#xD;
      function of time from onset of symptoms to revascularization. Secondary analyses will include&#xD;
      unadjusted association of N20 response with secondary clinical and neuroimaging outcomes and&#xD;
      safety variables.&#xD;
