  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with high grade glioma (HGG) or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma&#xD;
      (DIPG) or medulloblastoma or another rare brain cancer that expresses GD2. Because there is&#xD;
      no standard treatment at this time, patients are being asked to volunteer in a gene transfer&#xD;
      research study using special immune cells called T cells. T cells are a type of white blood&#xD;
      cell that help the body fight infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat cancer patients.&#xD;
      They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have found from previous research that we can put a new antibody gene into T cells that&#xD;
      will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. GD2 is a protein found on several&#xD;
      different cancers. When we and other researchers tested DIPG/HGG cancer cells we found that&#xD;
      many of these cancers also have GD2 on their surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study for neuroblastoma in children, we made a gene called a chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      (CAR) from an antibody that recognizes GD2. We put this gene into the patients' own T cells&#xD;
      and gave them back to 11 patients. We saw that the cells did grow for a while but started to&#xD;
      disappear from the blood after 2 weeks. We think that if T cells are able to last longer they&#xD;
      may have a better chance of killing tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will add a new gene to the GD2 T cells that can cause the cells to live&#xD;
      longer. We know that T cells need substances called cytokines to survive. We have added the&#xD;
      gene C7R that gives the cells a constant supply of cytokine and helps them to survive for a&#xD;
      longer period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other studies using T cells some researchers found that giving chemotherapy before the T&#xD;
      cell infusion can improve the amount of time the T cells stay in the body and therefore the&#xD;
      effect the T cells can have. This is called lymphodepletion and we think that it will allow&#xD;
      the T cells to expand and stay longer in the body and potentially kill cancer cells more&#xD;
      effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GD2.C7R T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of GD2-C7R T cells, and also to&#xD;
      evaluate how long they can be detected in the blood and what affect they have on brain&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To prepare the brain cancer specific T cells (GD2-C7R T cells), research staff will take some&#xD;
      blood from the patient. We will grow the GD2.C7R T cells by infecting the T cells with a&#xD;
      retroviral vector (a special virus that can carry a new gene into cells) containing one gene&#xD;
      that can recognize and kill brain cancer cells (GD2.CAR) and the new gene called C7R that&#xD;
      will help these cells survive longer. After the new genes have been put into the T cells, the&#xD;
      cells will be tested to make sure that they kill GD2-positive brain cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients on this study are required to have an Ommaya catheter in place prior to&#xD;
      treatment as a precaution. This is a special catheter that leads to the tumor, the cavity&#xD;
      left in the brain after surgical removal of the tumor, or into the fluid-filled space in the&#xD;
      brain. If a patient does not have such a catheter already, one will need to be placed to&#xD;
      allow for his/her treatment on this study. Catheter placement is done by a surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because we are growing the cells in the laboratory, we will also need to take blood to test&#xD;
      for infectious viruses such as hepatitis and HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), and we will&#xD;
      also ask patients to complete a questionnaire that is given to blood donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cells generated will be frozen and stored to give back to the patient. Because patients&#xD;
      will have received cells with a new gene in them patients will be followed for a total of 15&#xD;
      years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned a dose of GD2-C7R T cells. There is one dose where patients will&#xD;
      only receive GD2 T cells without the C7R. The assigned dose of cells is adjusted based on&#xD;
      body weight and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients will receive the GD2-(C7R) cells and also receive cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and fludarabine. These two drugs are standard chemotherapy medicines and may be given before&#xD;
      the T cells to make space in the blood for the T cells to grow after receiving them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will be given intravenously (through an i.v. needle inserted&#xD;
      in a vein or your central line) for 2 days and then fludarabine alone on the third day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given an injection of GD2-(C7R) T cells into the vein through an IV line&#xD;
      at the assigned dose. Before receiving the T cell infusion, the patient may be given a dose&#xD;
      of Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and Tylenol (acetaminophen). The infusion will take between 1&#xD;
      and 10 minutes. We will then monitor the patient in the hospital for at least 5 days. The&#xD;
      treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital.&#xD;
      The patient will need to stay in Houston for up to 4 weeks after the infusion so we can&#xD;
      monitor for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will have follow-up visits at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, then at months 3, 6, 9,&#xD;
      and 12, and then twice a year for the next 4 years and annually for the next 10 years for a&#xD;
      total of 15 years. The patient will also have scheduled disease evaluations after the T-cell&#xD;
      injection at week 6 and then as clinically needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After disease re-evaluation, the patient may be eligible to receive one additional dose of T&#xD;
      cells if the following criteria are met: (1) The disease has not gotten worse and/or it seems&#xD;
      the patient may benefit in the future from an additional dose. (2) The patient has not had a&#xD;
      severe side effect caused by the infusion of GD2-C7R T cells. The dose will be at the same&#xD;
      dose level as the first infusion and separated by at least 3 months such that we can make&#xD;
      sure there are no severe side effects between infusions. If the patient receives an&#xD;
      additional dose of GD2-(C7R) T-cells, then they will need to stay in Houston for up to 4&#xD;
      weeks after the infusion as well so we can monitor for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests before treatment--&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the tumor by routine MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests during and after treatment--&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and&#xD;
      afterwards:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the tumor by MRI imaging studies and spinal fluid analysis 6 weeks after&#xD;
           the infusion and repeat MRI imaging at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal Fluid Tests (optional): Spinal fluid may be drawn from the patient's existing Ommaya&#xD;
      reservoir at week 2 and between week 6 and week 8 and possibly other timepoints if helpful&#xD;
      for clinical care. This procedure can be done at the bedside under local anesthesia and 1-2&#xD;
      ml of spinal fluid (less than half a teaspoon) will be removed. Additional spinal fluid may&#xD;
      be removed if the pressure inside the brain is elevated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the GD2-(C7R) T cells are working and how long they last in the&#xD;
      body, an extra amount of blood will be obtained on the day that chemotherapy starts, the day&#xD;
      of the T-cell infusion(s) and at the end of the T-cell infusion(s), 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks&#xD;
      after the T-cell infusion(s) and every 3 months for the 1st year, every 6 months for the next&#xD;
      4 years and annually for the next 10 years. The amount of blood taken will be based on weight&#xD;
      with up to a maximum of 60 mL (12 teaspoons) of blood to be obtained at any one time. For&#xD;
      children, the total amount of blood drawn will not be more than 3 mL (less than 1 teaspoon)&#xD;
      per 1 kg of body weight on any one day. This volume is considered safe, but may be decreased&#xD;
      if the patient is anemic (has a low red blood cell count).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time points listed above, if the GD2-(C7R) T cells are found in the patient's&#xD;
      blood at a certain amount, an extra 5 mL (about 1 teaspoon) of blood may need to be collected&#xD;
      for additional testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has a procedure where tumor samples are obtained, like a blood is collected or&#xD;
      tumor biopsy, we will request a sample to be used for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive supportive care for any acute or chronic toxicities, including blood&#xD;
      components or antibiotics, and other intervention as appropriate.&#xD;
