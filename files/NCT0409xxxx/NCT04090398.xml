  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well radium-223 dichloride and paclitaxel work in treating&#xD;
      patients with advanced breast cancer that has spread to the bones. Radium-223 dichloride is a&#xD;
      radioactive drug that behaves in a similar way to calcium and collects in cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to the bones (bone metastases). The radioactive particles in radium-223 dichloride act&#xD;
      on bone metastases, killing the tumor cells and reducing the pain that they can cause. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving radium-223 dichloride and paclitaxel may work better in treating patients&#xD;
      with metastatic breast cancer compared to paclitaxel alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the combination of radium Ra 223 dichloride (radium-223 dichloride) and&#xD;
      paclitaxel improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to paclitaxel alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the time to the first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) (defined as 1st use of&#xD;
      radiation therapy to relieve skeletal symptoms, new symptomatic pathologic vertebral or&#xD;
      non-vertebral bone fractures, spinal cord compression, or tumor-related orthopedic surgical&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the objective response rate (ORR). III. To determine the safety of radium-223&#xD;
      dichloride with paclitaxel. IV. To measure overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not&#xD;
      limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES) and messenger ribonucleic (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq),&#xD;
      in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Investigate if molecular alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes are&#xD;
      associated with response to radium-223 dichloride, and.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. Investigate if loss of heterozygosity in triple negative tumors is associated with&#xD;
      response to radium-223 dichloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data&#xD;
      Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current&#xD;
      and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including&#xD;
      presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate change in level of total alkaline phosphatase, bone-specific alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase, and serum osteocalcin to response to radium-223 dichloride therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To examine the radium-223 dichloride bio-distribution and absorbed dose in each bone&#xD;
      metastatic lesions as well as elsewhere in the body including critical organs using&#xD;
      dosimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, blood, and nucleic acids obtained&#xD;
      from patients at the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) Biorepository&#xD;
      at Nationwide Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore the symptomatic adverse events (AE) for tolerability of each treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and&#xD;
      radium Ra 223 dichloride IV over 1 minute on day 1. Treatment with radium Ra 223 dichloride&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles and treatment with paclitaxel repeats every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months&#xD;
      for 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>Quantitative imaging biomarkers will be used for 18F-FDG-PET scan analysis as recommended. Two levels of SUV analysis will be performed: lesion level, in which SUV metrics will be extracted from each lesion ROI, and patient level, in which all lesions for a single patient will be grouped into a patient ROI before SUV analysis. Uptake will be quantified with maximal uptake (SUVmax), mean uptake (SUVmean), and total uptake (SUVtotal). For both ROI levels, SUVmax will be defined as the maximum SUV of the ROI and SUVtotal will be defined as the total summed SUV of the ROI normalized to voxel volume. SUVmean will be defined as the mean SUV within the lesion ROI or the mean of the SUVmean of all lesions within the patient ROI. For each SUV metric, response will be calculated as percent change from baseline to mid-treatment scans.</description>

             utilize, during the treatment period and for 6 months after last dose of radium-223&#xD;
             dichloride, 2 reliable and acceptable methods of contraception used simultaneously: a)&#xD;
             barrier method such as a) condoms (male or female) with spermicidal agent or b)&#xD;
             diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, combined with a highly effective&#xD;
             non-hormonal birth control method such as an intra-uterine device. Men treated or&#xD;
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception and not donate&#xD;
             sperm prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after&#xD;
             completion of Radium-223 dichloride&#xD;

             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior paclitaxel in metastatic setting within 2 years prior to Radium-223&#xD;
             dichloride start. No prior paclitaxel in adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting within 6&#xD;

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radium-223 dichloride is an alpha&#xD;
             particle-emitting radiopharmaceutical agent with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with radium-223 dichloride,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with radium-223&#xD;
             dichloride. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Imminent/established spinal cord compression, pathological fracture in weight bearing&#xD;
             bones or bone lesion with soft tissue component unless treated as appropriate with&#xD;
             radiation and/or surgery before starting on trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior hemibody external radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have an active infection requiring systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not use immunosuppressive medication =&lt; 7 days of registration, EXCEPT&#xD;
             for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g.,&#xD;
                  intra-articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses =&lt; 10 mg/day of prednisone or&#xD;
                  equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan&#xD;
                  premedication) is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a marked baseline prolongation of QT/corrected QT interval (QTc)&#xD;
             interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt; 480 milliseconds [ms])&#xD;
             (CTCAE grade 1) using Fridericia's QT correction formula&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (TdP) (e.g.&#xD;
             heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use of concomitant medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval&#xD;
