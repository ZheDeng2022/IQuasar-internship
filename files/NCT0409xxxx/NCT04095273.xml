  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test how well patients with advanced solid tumors respond to&#xD;
      treatment with elimusertib (BAY1895344) in combination with pembrolizumab. In addition&#xD;
      researchers want to find for patients the optimal dose of elimusertib in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, how the drug is tolerated and the way the body absorbs, distributes and&#xD;
      discharges the drug. The study medication, elimusertib, works by blocking a substance (ATR&#xD;
      Kinase) which is produced by the body and is important for the growth of tumor cells.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is an immunologic checkpoint blocker that promotes an immune response against&#xD;
      the tumor.&#xD;
