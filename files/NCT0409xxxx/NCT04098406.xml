  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy, safety, and PK/PD effects of CNM-Au8&#xD;
      as a disease-modifying agent for the treatment of ALS by utilizing electrophysiological&#xD;
      measures to detect preservation of motor neuron function. The primary endpoint is the mean&#xD;
      change in the average difference between active treatment and placebo from Baseline through&#xD;
      Week 36 evaluated by electromyography.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study of&#xD;
      the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients who are&#xD;
      newly symptomatic within 24-months of Screening and with a clinically probable or possible or&#xD;
      definite ALS diagnosis per the Awaji-Shima criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be screened over up to a 6-week period. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and none of the exclusionary criteria will be enrolled into the clinical study. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:1 into one of two groups: either active treatment with CNM-Au8 30 mg or&#xD;
      Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive their randomized oral treatment daily over thirty-six (36)&#xD;
      consecutive weeks during the Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be up to four study periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Up to a six (6) week screening period (Screening Period);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A thirty-six (36) week blinded randomized treatment period (Treatment Period);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Up to a forty-eight (48) week optional open-label extension period (Open-Label Period);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A four (4) week safety follow-up period following completion of either the Treatment or&#xD;
           Open-Label period or in the case of Early Termination (Safety Follow-Up Period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per protocol, all patients will receive their blinded and randomized oral treatment daily&#xD;
      over at least 36 consecutive weeks during the Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those patients not transitioning into the optional OLE period, patients will complete a&#xD;
      safety follow-up visit 4-weeks following study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent DSMB will be responsible for monitoring the safety of the study on a quarterly&#xD;
      basis and ad hoc at the request of the DSMB or the Sponsor (e.g., in the event of unexpected&#xD;
      SAEs) to review data throughout the Treatment Period. The DSMB may make recommendations on&#xD;
      the conduct of the study, including study termination. Appropriate procedures will be&#xD;
      detailed in a DSMB Charter.&#xD;
