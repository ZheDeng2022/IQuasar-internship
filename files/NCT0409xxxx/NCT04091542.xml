  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the HOBBIT trial, the investigators want to develop a technology that allows volunteers&#xD;
      to hold their breath for a long time. This technique will then be taught to patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer to be able to hold their breath long-term during the irradiation. After all,&#xD;
      research has shown that the heart is in a better position when the patient enters her breath&#xD;
      after a deep inhalation, as a result of which there is less unwanted radiation of the heart.&#xD;
      To develop this technique the investigators use healthy volunteers, who are asked several&#xD;
      times to hold their breath as long as comfortable. Before the respiratory arrest the&#xD;
      investigators allow these volunteers to hyperventilate, administer oxygen and cause&#xD;
      hyperinflation of the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers come back four times, on four consecutive days. The first day they receive a&#xD;
      short training. Afterwards oxygen is administered for a few minutes while the volunteers are&#xD;
      asked to hyperventilate. Afterwards, by using the learned technique, they must hold their&#xD;
      breath for as long as possible, comfortably. They should hold their breath 3 times in total&#xD;
      with a short break in between. The following days there is always a change in the preparation&#xD;
      protocol, compared to the previous study. Different parameters in the protocol will be&#xD;
      changed for different groups of volunteers, this is based on randomization. In this way the&#xD;
      effect of different parameters in the preparation of the AHS can be investigated. The&#xD;
      investigators will use this information to develop a new protocol for extending the duration&#xD;
      of breathing to two minutes and thirty seconds for use during radiotherapy treatment. The&#xD;
      method for finding the optimal technique is iterative optimization. This method follows a&#xD;
      process of development, testing, feedback and redevelopment cycles. Iteratively, these cycles&#xD;
      of development use the prior research to further elaborate the most promising discoveries and&#xD;
      drop paths that do not produce the desired result. During the development The investigators&#xD;
      listen to the input of different people: doctors, nurses, support staff, engineers and the&#xD;
      participants, to guarantee the usability of the technique on the radiotherapy device. Once&#xD;
      the researchers think they have found a solution that meets all the conditions, a group of&#xD;
      untrained volunteers are asked to implement the technique. With this the investigators&#xD;
      validate the technique for later use in breast cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy (RT) has an established role in breast cancer, complementing surgery and&#xD;
      systemic therapies to prevent recurrences and improve survival. Long-Term follow-up shows&#xD;
      that the beneficial effect on survival is weakened by radiation-induced cardiac and lung&#xD;
      cancer mortality, especially in patients with left sided breast cancer or requiring&#xD;
      irradiation of regional lymph nodes. Cardiac toxicity is of major concern because many&#xD;
      patients receive cardiotoxic systemic treatments like anthracyclines and trastuzumab. Dose&#xD;
      and volume of the heart exposed to radiation correlate with severity of cardiac toxicity. The&#xD;
      heart dose-volume parameters are highest for patients receiving left-side radiotherapy&#xD;
      especially if irradiation of the internal mammary lymph nodes is performed. Risk of (fatal)&#xD;
      ischemic heart attack increases linearly with mean heart dose with no known dose threshold.&#xD;
      In patients who receive left-side local treatment, heart dose is decreased by using prone&#xD;
      positioning or deep-inspiration breath hold (DIBH), or a combination of both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has shown that the heart shifts to an anatomical more favorable position in&#xD;
      DIBH, away from the breast, chest wall and internal mammary lymph nodes, reducing heart dose.&#xD;
      This advantage remains in prone positioning. The goal is to prolong the duration of a single&#xD;
      DIBH, to create a long-DIBH (L-DIBH). Possible advantages are better positioning of the&#xD;
      patient, execution of technically more difficult procedures and inclusion of regional lymph&#xD;
      node (locoregional) irradiation. Most patients can't sustain a DIBH long enough to perform&#xD;
      simulation with computed tomography (CT) and delineation during DIBH, so delineation of the&#xD;
      laser lines during CT-simulation is performed on the shallow breathing (SB) scan. During&#xD;
      positioning of the patient on the radiotherapy machine, a daily cone-beam CT (CBCT) is&#xD;
      performed. The duration of this CBCT is 40 seconds, maintaining DIBH during this period is&#xD;
      also hard for most patients. So currently the positioning at the moment of treatment is based&#xD;
      on the SB CT-scan, whilst the DIBH CT-scan is used for treatment. This could potentially&#xD;
      induce suboptimal positioning. Breath hold during CBCT positioning and CT-simulation and&#xD;
      delineation could minimize shifts in treatment position. The current DIBH schedules for whole&#xD;
      breast cancer radiotherapy without inclusion of the lymph nodes, use between three and six&#xD;
      DIBHs of 12 to 18 seconds. Longer DIBH could lead to less DIBHs and faster treatment&#xD;
      execution, which is especially important when the lymph nodes are included in the target&#xD;
      volumes. Locoregional irradiation, including the lymph nodes, requires between 10 and 14&#xD;
      DIBHs of 15-30 seconds which leads to a total treatment time of around 5 minutes. This&#xD;
      represents a substantial physical and mental effort for all but the most able patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research, the first phase of the Hyperventilation Oxygenation Breath hold in Breast&#xD;
      cancer Irradiation Treatment (HOBBIT) trail, will focus on finding a technique to assist&#xD;
      patients to maintain a long DIBH (L-DIBH) during radiotherapy. Other research has shown a&#xD;
      potential increase in duration of breath hold and reduction in rest time between DIBHs using&#xD;
      oxygen in combination with hyperventilation. There is a safe way to prolong DIBH to at least&#xD;
      5 minutes. However, the technique requires a long training period for the patient, and 15&#xD;
      minutes of mechanical ventilation before each treatment session, making the technique very&#xD;
      time consuming and resource intensive. The investigators hope to simplify the technique by&#xD;
      allowing patients to do multiple L-DIBHs during the 5 minutes of treatment time. The&#xD;
      investigators found from preliminary tests that using shorter L-DIBHs has several advantages,&#xD;
      firstly pre-oxygenation and induction of hypocapnia can be achieved in a shorter time,&#xD;
      secondly the duration of training is reduced, and thirdly a the costs are reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increase in blood pressure is the main risk of L-DIBH. No adverse events of L-DIBH have been&#xD;
      reported. In order to minimize the risks during testing, this research project was developed&#xD;
      in collaboration with the anesthesiology department, to ensure safety of the participants&#xD;
      during L-DIBH. For all subjects, vital parameters will be continuously monitored by medical&#xD;
      staff. Safety boundaries are in place which subjects are not allowed to cross during L-DIBH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to develop a new and easy technique for L-DIBH in prone and&#xD;
      supine position, feasible for daily use at our radiotherapy department. The purpose of the&#xD;
      technique is to allow locoregional treatment using a reasonable amount of L-DIBHs, increase&#xD;
      patient positioning and accuracy of radiation treatment, and further significantly reduce&#xD;
      heart toxicity for left sided cancer patients. The HOBBIT trial includes multiple phases. The&#xD;
      first phase is performed on healthy volunteers, different support techniques to prolong DIBH&#xD;
      will be tested. In the second phase the most optimal techniques to perform a L-DIBH will be&#xD;
      validated on breast cancer patients. Around 40 volunteers will be included in the first phase&#xD;
      of the HOBBIT trail, the final amount of volunteers depends on the amount of testing needed&#xD;
      to find a technique which fulfills all criteria for phase two. The second phase of the HOBBIT&#xD;
      trail will include breast cancer patients treated at our radiotherapy center. The&#xD;
      expectations from previous research is that the investigators will see a similar increase in&#xD;
      DIBH time, compared to healthy volunteers. The final goal is the use of the technique during&#xD;
      locoregional radiation therapy at the University Hospital of Ghent.&#xD;
