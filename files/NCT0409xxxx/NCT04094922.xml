  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who experience potentially traumatic events might develop long-lasting mental&#xD;
      health problems. Limitations to health care resources, particularly in the context of mass&#xD;
      disasters, indicate that self-help interventions could serve as important complementary&#xD;
      offers to people in need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the Swedish version of the Swedish version of&#xD;
      the PTSD Coach self-help smartphone application can reduce levels of posttraumatic stress and&#xD;
      related difficulties. The study is a randomized controlled trial in which participants'&#xD;
      levels of posttraumatic stress and related difficulties after three months use of PTSD Coach&#xD;
      will be compared to a waitlist condition. Additionally, in order to better understand the&#xD;
      interplay between app use and health status, participants in both groups will receive text&#xD;
      messages in which they are asked to respond to a small number of very brief questions about&#xD;
      specific behaviors and current health status for three weeks during the intervention period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A majority of humans experience a potentially traumatic event during their lifetime, and many&#xD;
      experience more than one. These events are of overwhelming emotional nature and have the&#xD;
      capacity to evoke intensive distress. For many people, the distress dissipates either&#xD;
      spontaneously or with the help from professional supports over the course of a couple of&#xD;
      weeks. However, a substantial minority of people go on to develop significant levels of&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic posttraumatic stress is often experienced together with clinical levels of other&#xD;
      forms of psychopathology such as depression or anxiety disorders and the chronic condition&#xD;
      can become debilitating over many years. There are effective interventions, however, they are&#xD;
      as of yet difficult to access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An uncontrolled pilot study of the Swedish PTSD Coach smartphone app indicated favorable&#xD;
      outcomes and feasibility of the intervention (Cernvall, Sveen, Johannesson, &amp; Arnberg, 2018).&#xD;
      The app includes four modules: psychoeducation, rating and monitoring of distress,&#xD;
      information about help and support, and strategies to cope with distress. The app is designed&#xD;
      to be used with or without internet connection and uses little space on the smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate whether the Swedish version of the PTSD Coach self-help&#xD;
      smartphone application is beneficial for people who experience elevated levels of&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress after a potentially traumatic event. The study is a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with two conditions. In the intervention condition, participants are allowed&#xD;
      free use of the PTSD Coach smartphone app. The control group is a waitlist condition. The&#xD;
      intervention will take place during three months and is powered to detect a between-group&#xD;
      effect size at the post-intervention assessment of d=0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also use an intensive longitudinal data collection method within the&#xD;
      intervention period in order to better understand the interplay between app use and health&#xD;
      status. Participants in both groups will receive text messages in which they are asked to&#xD;
      respond to six very brief questions about specific behaviors and current health status for&#xD;
      three weeks during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention period, participants across groups will be compared on a number of&#xD;
      outcome variables related to posttraumatic stress, other mental health issues, daily&#xD;
      function, and measures on healthcare consumption. The participants in the waitlist group will&#xD;
      then be given access to the PTSD Coach app and both groups will be followed for two&#xD;
      additional assessments after six and nine months.&#xD;
