    <textblock>
      Randomized treatment trial of baking soda or LithoLyte to determine if baking soda and&#xD;
      Litholyte are effective in raising 24 hour urine citrate and pH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Participants will not be required to attend any study visits outside of normal clinical&#xD;
      encounters. Participants enrolled in the study will be randomized to treatment upon&#xD;
      enrollment. Blocked randomization will be conducted, utilizing sex (M/F) and recurrent stone&#xD;
      former (Y/N) as algorithm variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to LithoLyte® will be provided 40 mEq of alkali in the form of&#xD;
      LithoLyte® and advised to take 20 mEq twice daily according to package instructions, once in&#xD;
      morning and once at bedtime; no requirements about proximity to meals are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to baking soda will be provided instructions for using baking soda to&#xD;
      provide 40 mEq alkali, to be accomplished by dissolving ¼ teaspoon baking soda in water or&#xD;
      other beverage (any amount) in the morning on an empty stomach and ½ teaspoon baking soda in&#xD;
      water or other beverage again at bedtime, also on an empty stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 24-hour urine results that are available upon enrollment will be used for&#xD;
      pre-intervention values. The 24-hour results from each participant's followup collection will&#xD;
      be used for post-intervention values. Thus, no extra encounters are required for&#xD;
      participation in the study. Additionally, no extra tests are required for participation in&#xD;
      the study as participants would normally complete a post-treatment 24-hour urine collection&#xD;
      anyway. Participants will be screened for eligibility, i.e., by pre-clinic review of&#xD;
      schedules and 24-hour urine results. Only those meeting inclusion criteria will be invited to&#xD;
      participate and enrolled, provided that informed consent is provided by signing the signature&#xD;
      page of the consent/authorization form. The treatment/intervention period is up to 90 days&#xD;
      (approximately 3 months). However, it should be noted that, as these are clinical&#xD;
      interventions that would be prescribed or recommended anyway, it is expected that&#xD;
      participants will continue treatment indefinitely and under supervision of urology and/or&#xD;
      Metabolic Stone Clinic providers. If the participant has failed the randomized therapy they&#xD;
      are assigned to, they will be clinically assigned a different treatment option and continue&#xD;
      to be followed up in routine fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete a medication questionnaire and log, as well as&#xD;
      the Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life (WISQOL) questionnaire. All study procedures are&#xD;
      considered standard of care, except for: randomization into treatment and the medication&#xD;
      questionnaire and log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Amendment Approved 11/16/2020 removed the UrocitK study arm; the investigators faced&#xD;
      challenges recruiting participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and the possibility of being&#xD;
      randomized into a prescription drug arm was causing many potential participants to choose not&#xD;
      to participate.&#xD;
