  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to describe the safety profile of velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV) in&#xD;
      participants with Gaucher disease type 1. Participants will be transitioning from other&#xD;
      enzyme replacement therapies or substrate reduction therapies to VPRIV. Some participants may&#xD;
      have already transitioned to treatment with VPRIV before this study started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, data on VPRIV will be collected from the medical records of participants who&#xD;
      already transitioned to VPRIV before this study started. Other participants will join this&#xD;
      study when they transition to VPRIV. All participants will be followed to allow for 12 months&#xD;
      of observation from time of transition to VPRIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sponsor will not be involved in how participants are treated but will provide&#xD;
      instructions on how the clinics will record what happens during the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) Following the Transition From Other ERTs/SRTs to VPRIV</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Number of participants transitioning from other ERTs/SRTs to VPRIV with AEs will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Use of Glucosylspingosine (Lyso-Gb1) Biomarker</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in use of Lyso-Gb1 by participants following the transition from other ERTs/SRTs to velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV) will be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Gaucher Disease Questionnaire Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Score at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Gaucher disease questionnaire (PRO) scores will be calculated for each adult participant. The questionnaire asks how much the participant is affected by the Gaucher disease. A total summated score is calculated and ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more severe impairment and worse quality of life.</description>
