COPD-12 sample: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) included in german claims database between april 2015 and march 2018, with follow-up of 12 months since index date (COPD-12).&#xD;
LABA: Long-acting beta agonist; LAMA: Long-acting muscarinic antagonist, ICS: Inhaled corticosteroids.</description>

        <population>All patients included in the COPD-12 sample, who received any long term-COPD treatment. Patients are reported by therapy line (arms are not mutually exclusive). The number of patients who received COPD-12 Fourth Line Therapy is less than 5% of the patient population (N=8238).

Serious Adverse Events and Other Adverse Events are not collected in the database. &quot;0&quot; total Number of Participants at Risk means &quot;Serious, and Other (Not Including Serious) Adverse Events were not monitored/assessed&quot;.</desc>
