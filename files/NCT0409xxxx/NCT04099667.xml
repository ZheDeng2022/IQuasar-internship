      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      a single-dose of MYOBLOC over a 1-year duration in adult subjects with lower limb monoplegia&#xD;
      or hemiplegia spasticity due to stroke or TBI, followed by an open-label extension safety&#xD;
      study of multiple doses. The primary goal is to assess efficacy of MYOBLOC versus placebo in&#xD;
      the treatment of adult lower limb spasticity. The secondary goals are: to establish a safe&#xD;
      and efficacious dose of MYOBLOC (administered intramuscularly as a single total dose, to&#xD;
      assess the duration of therapeutic response of MYOBLOC after a single administration, and to&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of MYOBLOC after multiple administrations at&#xD;
      13-week intervals over a minimum duration of 1 year.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Able to walk (with or without the use of a walking assistive device).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score greater than or equal to 2 in the ankle plantar&#xD;
             flexors of the affected lower limb at screening and at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Quadriplegia/tetraplegia, lower limb diplegia or triplegia.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. History of major joint contracture(s), in which, based on Investigator assessment, the&#xD;
             contracture(s) significantly contributes to joint immobility in the target limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known hypersensitivity to botulinum toxins type A or B or to any MYOBLOC solution&#xD;
             components.&#xD;

             regularly using an AFO 30 days or more before screening must be willing to maintain&#xD;
             use of the AFO through Week 4 of the DBP of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) or B (BoNT/B) treatment in the lower limb&#xD;
             identified for treatment within 24 weeks before screening. Prior BoNT/A or BoNT/B&#xD;
             treatment in areas other than the target limb is not exclusionary but must have&#xD;
             occurred at least 12 weeks before screening. Prior toxin exposure must have been&#xD;
             well-tolerated and without any significant long-term side effects in the case of&#xD;
             repeated prior exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Severe dysphagia (i.e., inability to swallow liquids, solids, or both without choking&#xD;
             or without medical intervention), or dysphagia with a history of aspiration pneumonia,&#xD;
             within 6 months before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Obstructive pulmonary disease with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced&#xD;
             vital capacity (FVC) &lt;70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Slow vital capacity &lt;60% of predicted.&#xD;
