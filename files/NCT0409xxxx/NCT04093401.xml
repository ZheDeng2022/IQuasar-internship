  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While current guidelines call for annual follow-up for patients with a history of basal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, compliance with these guidelines is imperfect. It is hypothesized that if patients&#xD;
      are informed of the quantitative risk of a subsequent basal cell carcinoma based on&#xD;
      individualized risk factors, the compliance rate for follow-up will improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess one-year compliance with requested follow-up&#xD;
      for patients with recent history of basal cell carcinoma, among those who receive standard&#xD;
      sun avoidance counseling and request for follow-up compared to those who receive, in&#xD;
      addition, an estimate of their mathematical risk of a subsequent basal cell carcinoma based&#xD;
      on individualized risk factors.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, single-blind study to evaluate the effect of informing subjects of&#xD;
      their individualized risk of a subsequent basal cell carcinoma on proportion of subjects who&#xD;
      achieve compliance with requested follow-up with a dermatology healthcare provider, defined&#xD;
      as in-person follow-up within 365 days following diagnosis of initial basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to &quot;intervention&quot; (knowledge of individualized risk) or&#xD;
      &quot;control&quot; (lack of awareness of individualized risk). Investigators will be aware of the&#xD;
      modelled risk of a subsequent basal cell carcinoma for all subjects, but only subjects&#xD;
      randomized to the &quot;intervention&quot; arm will be informed of their modelled risk. All subjects&#xD;
      will receive standard sun avoidance counseling and will be requested to follow-up no later&#xD;
      than 365 days from initial basal cell carcinoma diagnosis.&#xD;
