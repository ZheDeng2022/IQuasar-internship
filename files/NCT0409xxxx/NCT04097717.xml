  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to test a web-based decision support tool developed to enhance low-income&#xD;
      women's ability to make informed decisions about tubal sterilization that align with their&#xD;
      preferences, values and reproductive goals. Half of participants will receive usual care,&#xD;
      while the other half will use the web-based decision aid plus usual care. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that compared to women who receive usual care alone, women randomized to the&#xD;
      decision aid arm will have greater knowledge about sterilization and alternative options,&#xD;
      lower decisional conflict, and will be more satisfied with their contraceptive decision at&#xD;
      3-month follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Female surgical sterilization is the second most commonly used contraceptive method in the US&#xD;
      and is disproportionately used by low-income women and women of color. Whether the higher use&#xD;
      of sterilization in these populations reflects inappropriate overutilization is unclear. On&#xD;
      one hand, low-income and racial minority women frequently misunderstand the permanent nature&#xD;
      of sterilization, are often unaware of reversible contraceptive alternatives, and commonly&#xD;
      experience regret after the procedure- suggesting suboptimal decision making. On the other&#xD;
      hand, there is evidence of substantial unmet demand for sterilization among low-income women,&#xD;
      due to unique access barriers posed by Medicaid sterilization regulations, putting them at&#xD;
      high risk for unintended pregnancy and the adverse health and social consequences associated&#xD;
      with unintended pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicaid sterilization policy currently requires that all women requesting a federally-funded&#xD;
      procedure complete a standardized consent form at least 30 days prior to sterilization. This&#xD;
      policy was originally instituted in the 1970s to protect vulnerable women from coercive&#xD;
      sterilization practices by attempting to ensure informed and voluntary consent. However,&#xD;
      there is growing consensus that the policy is incapable of ensuring informed consent, and&#xD;
      that the mandatory 30-waiting period impedes access to desired sterilization for many&#xD;
      low-income women. The lack of a process that can ensure both informed consent and timely&#xD;
      access for sterilization procedures hampers progress toward reproductive health equity for&#xD;
      low-income women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to test a novel, web-based decision support tool to support low-income&#xD;
      women's ability to make informed and value-concordant decisions about surgical sterilization.&#xD;
      A decision support tool may be particularly useful in the context of sterilization decisions&#xD;
      because this is a preference-sensitive decision with permanent implications and because there&#xD;
      is a high level of misunderstanding about sterilization and limited awareness of alternative&#xD;
      options among women who have undergone the surgery, indicating critical gaps in the quality&#xD;
      of pre-sterilization counseling. Furthermore, patient-provider interactions may be&#xD;
      complicated by a broader social and historical context in which poor and minority women's&#xD;
      reproductive choices have not always been valued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multi-site randomized controlled trial to test the effect of the decision aid&#xD;
      plus usual care compared to usual care alone on decision quality among 350 racially-diverse,&#xD;
      low-income pregnant women considering a post-partum sterilization procedure. Participant&#xD;
      surveys will be utilized at three assessments points to evaluate outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its potential clinical utility, this research also has important policy&#xD;
      implications, as it can inform ongoing efforts to transform the current Medicaid policy by&#xD;
      offering a decision aid that is able to ensure informed decision making in vulnerable&#xD;
      populations, thereby allowing the investigators to ultimately replace the current Medicaid&#xD;
      consent form with this scalable tool. Once there is a tool to safeguard women with an&#xD;
      evidence-based process for ensuring informed consent, further progress can be made in&#xD;
      potentially shortening or waiving the mandatory 30-day waiting period that has restricted&#xD;
      access to desired sterilization for many low-income women.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a randomized controlled trial in which participants will be assigned to one of two groups (intervention arm or usual care arm) in parallel for the duration of the study. All participants will be asked to complete assessments at three separate time points [immediately after using the decision aid (for those in the intervention arm) when participants are less than 24 weeks gestation (Time 1); in the 3rd trimester between 32-36 weeks gestation (Time 2); and three months postpartum (Time 3)].</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participant responses to 10 True/False items adapted from previously published studies of tubal sterilization knowledge and informed by in-depth interviews with women about sterilization decision making. Items assess knowledge about tubal sterilization and alternative contraception options and will be coded as correct vs. incorrect, with &quot;Don't Know&quot; being coded as an incorrect response. The percentage of correct responses across the 10 questions will be calculated for each participant. The score range is 0 to 100%.</description>

    <description>Assessed by participant responses to the low literacy version of the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). The DCS is a validated measure to assess participants' decisional conflict in medical decision-making. The DCS low literacy version includes 10 items about experience of conflict, with &quot;Yes&quot; = 0, &quot;unsure&quot; = 2 and &quot;No&quot; = 4. All 10 items are a) summed; b) divided by 10; and c) multiplied by 25. Scores range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict).</description>
