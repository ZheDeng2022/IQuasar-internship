  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with Idiopathic CD4 lymphopenia (ICL) have lower numbers of a type of white blood cell&#xD;
      called CD4 cells. White blood cells fight against infections. Low levels of CD4 cells may&#xD;
      make a person more likely to get sick. There are no approved treatments for ICL. Researchers&#xD;
      think a drug called belimumab may be able to help in specific situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if belimumab is safe for people with ICL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 65 who have ICL and are participating in NIH protocol 09-I-0102 (EPIC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and medication history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire about mental health and depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a baseline visit. This will include some repeats of the screening&#xD;
      tests. They may also have leukapheresis: Blood will be taken from a needle in one arm and&#xD;
      passed through a machine that separates out the white blood cells. The rest of the blood will&#xD;
      be returned through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 8 doses of belimumab through IV: A needle will insert a thin&#xD;
      plastic tube into an arm vein. Belimumab will be given through the IV line. The first 3 doses&#xD;
      will be given every 2 weeks. The other 5 will be given once every 4 weeks. Participants will&#xD;
      have a physical exam and blood and urine tests at each dosing visit. They will be monitored&#xD;
      for up to 4 hours after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 follow-up visits, at around 8, 16, and 24 weeks after the last dose&#xD;
      of belimumab. They will have a physical exam and blood and urine tests. Once they finish this&#xD;
      protocol and they will continue to be followed under 09-I-0102 (EPIC study).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic CD4 lymphopenia (ICL) is characterized by persistent low CD4 counts, frequently in&#xD;
      combination with CD8, natural killer, or B cell lymphopenia. It is considered a heterogeneous&#xD;
      disorder with manifestations that can include autoimmunity, invasive fungal infections or&#xD;
      infections with human papillomavirus, and malignancies typically related to infections. The&#xD;
      exact etiology of ICL remains unclear and there is no specific treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data from our group revealed a high prevalence of antilymphocyte antibodies in many of&#xD;
      the ICL patients evaluated. The targets of these antibodies remain unknown and are being&#xD;
      investigated. On some occasions, these antibodies have the ability to cause&#xD;
      antibody-dependent cytotoxicity or complement activation, both mechanisms that can cause cell&#xD;
      death. Although it is unclear if these antibodies are the cause (or perhaps more likely the&#xD;
      effect) of lymphopenia, it is plausible they play a significant pathogenic role and at a&#xD;
      minimum may be hampering lymphocyte compensatory mechanisms for expansion and improved&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune deficiency and the unclear role of autoantibodies preclude aggressive&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment (eg, corticosteroids) for ICL. Therefore, a rational approach to&#xD;
      treatment is belimumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets Blys (also call BAFF for B-cell&#xD;
      activating factor), expressed on activated B cells and plasma cells. Belimumab is approved by&#xD;
      the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus (SLE) who have evidence of autoantibodies and has shown efficacy in both&#xD;
      reducing symptoms and leading to a modest decrease in autoantibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open-label prospective single-arm study, ICL patients with laboratory evidence of&#xD;
      antilymphocyte antibodies will be recruited. Belimumab will be administered by intravenous&#xD;
      infusion for 6 months with an extended follow-up of an additional 6 months. Administration of&#xD;
      the study drug will follow the SLE scheme of 10 mg/kg at study entry, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and&#xD;
      monthly thereafter (8 doses total). Three additional visits approximately every 2 months will&#xD;
      complete the 52-week study. Clinical safety evaluations with immunologic and serologic&#xD;
      testing will be performed at all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will assess the safety of belimumab in ICL and also help in better&#xD;
      understanding the role of autoantibodies in ICL pathogenesis. This knowledge could&#xD;
      substantially improve rationale and design of novel therapeutic interventions in ICL.&#xD;
