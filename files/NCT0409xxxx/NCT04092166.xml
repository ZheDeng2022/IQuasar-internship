  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether participation in an 8-week structured&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation program can increase cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, prospective single center study to assess the utility and efficacy&#xD;
      of cardiac rehabilitation in patients with AF. All participants will receive the same medical&#xD;
      care and standard baseline education which includes an hour long one on one session with a&#xD;
      nutritionist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also receive the guide book, Lifestyle Guide to Healing the Heart, at their&#xD;
      baseline visit as part of their education&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent to participate in the study and signing a consent form to&#xD;
      participate in the Phase 3 cardiac rehabilitation program, participants will undergo a&#xD;
      baseline assessment of their functional status using the functional capacity NuStep test. The&#xD;
      NuStep test will be conducted at the Valley Hospital at baseline and after 8 weeks using the&#xD;
      NuStep TRS 4000 machine - a stationary bike machine that also engages one's arms by pushing&#xD;
      and pulling arm handles. Participants will sit in the NuStep machine and bike on level 4 (a&#xD;
      low to moderate level) for 6 minutes, if possible. However, participants will be encouraged&#xD;
      to step as quickly as possible during this time period. Participants will be asked about any&#xD;
      discomfort before, during and after the test. The participant's METS are calculated directly&#xD;
      by the machine based on the watts while exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of improvement of the participant's METS over the course of the 8-week program&#xD;
      will produce a greater understanding of the effect of a structured cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      program on cardiorespiratory fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this baseline assessment, participants will then be randomized to undergo usual&#xD;
      care or an 8-week (24-session) Phase 3 cardiac rehabilitation program at the Valley Health&#xD;
      System Center for Health &amp; Wellness in Mahwah. Eight weeks later, participants will undergo&#xD;
      repeat assessment of functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will be administered the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on&#xD;
      Quality-of-life (AFEQT) survey at baseline, 6-months and 12-months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also undergo a 1-week Zio XT Holter monitor at the same time points (baseline,&#xD;
      6-months and 12-months). The Zio XT Holter monitor is a small, discreet comfortable patch&#xD;
      that sticks on a participant's chest to test for any arrhythmias, such as AF duration and&#xD;
      burden. The Zio XT Holter monitor will be available through commercial (HIPAA-compliant)&#xD;
      remote monitoring portals and will not be stored locally in Valley Health System. However, in&#xD;
      the future this may change and the Zio XT Holter monitor data will be stored as part of the&#xD;
      participant's electronic medical record.&#xD;
