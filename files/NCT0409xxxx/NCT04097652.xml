    <textblock>
      The clinical study with UMC119-06 is designed to investigate the safety in patients with&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke (&quot;AIS&quot;). This will be a dose escalation, open-label, single-center&#xD;
      study in adult with acute ischemic stroke. UMC119-06 is ex vivo cultured human umbilical cord&#xD;
      tissue-derived mensenchymal stem cells product which is intended for treatment of acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second most important cause of mortality and morbidity in the world. Currently,&#xD;
      the standard treatment for ischemic stroke is an intravenous tissue plasminogen&#xD;
      activator(tPA; alteplase) and/or endovascular thrombectomy. However, the therapeutic time&#xD;
      window for these treatments is narrow. Besides, endovascular thrombectomy requires&#xD;
      specialized stroke expertise and endovascular skills. Less than 5% of ischemic stroke&#xD;
      patients are treated by these therapy and not all patients achieve good outcomes. There is&#xD;
      still a lack of therapy for the reduction disability from stroke. In 2018, at least 40&#xD;
      clinical trials intent to treat ischemic stroke using cell therapy. In particular, MSCs have&#xD;
      shown great potential in the reduction disability from acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Meridigen&#xD;
      is developing UMC119-06, a mesenchymal stem cell derived from human umbilical cord for the&#xD;
      treatment of AIS disease.&#xD;
