    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib with cediranib or AZD6738 works in treating&#xD;
      patients with germline BRCA mutated breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (advanced or metastatic). Olaparib, cediranib, and AZD6738 may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) of olaparib plus cediranib and olaparib plus&#xD;
      ceralasertib (AZD6738) combinations in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      with germline BRCA (breast cancer susceptibility gene) mutations who have been previously&#xD;
      treated with PARP inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of olaparib in combination with cediranib and in&#xD;
      combination with AZD6738 in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer with germline&#xD;
      BRCA mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess duration of response (DOR) to treatment. III. To assess best response. IV. To&#xD;
      estimate progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate BRCA1 expression at baseline and on progression. II. To evaluate hypoxia&#xD;
      markers at baseline and on progression. III. To evaluate levels of angiogenesis/ inflammatory&#xD;
      markers including VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) at baseline and on progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate novel markers of resistance and response to PARP inhibitor in baseline and&#xD;
      upon progression of disease in tumor tissue that are identified by the investigator's basic&#xD;
      science collaborator's ongoing studies in vitro and in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at baseline and on progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib PO once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 and ceralasertib PO QD on days 1-7.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

    <description>Defined as proportion of patients with reduction in tumor burden (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. The exact two-sided 95% confidence interval for the ORR will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Will analyze aggregate data from selected arms of the trial using Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression to identify study factors related to outcomes including response and PFS. Hazard ratios and odds ratios with their 95% confidence intervals and p-values will be reported. Model assumptions will be verified.</description>

    <description>Will be done using Fisher's exact tests, Mann-Whitney U tests or McNemar's test will be applied depending the type of data we observe. For the pre- and post- therapy biomarker and outcome analysis, paired t- test or Wilcoxon signed-rank will be applied for the continuous variables. McNemar's test will be applied for categorical variables. Fisher's exact test will be applied for the association between hypoxia positivity and objective response.

             diseases, active bleeding diatheses, renal transplant, or active infection including&#xD;
             any patient known to have hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions is not required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the treating investigator would interfere with&#xD;
             evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study&#xD;
             results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to an AZD 6738 and cediranib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled seizure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following cardiac criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Resting electrocardiography (ECG) indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible&#xD;
                  cardiac conditions, as judged by the investigator (e.g., unstable ischemia,&#xD;
                  uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, corrected QT&#xD;
                  interval by Fridericia (QTcF) prolongation &gt; 450 milli-second, or patients with&#xD;
                  congenital long QT syndrome or family history of unexplained sudden death under&#xD;
                  40 years of age)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of&#xD;
                  resting ECG (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients at risk of brain perfusion problems, e.g., carotid stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with relative hypotension (&lt; 100/60 mm Hg) or clinically relevant orthostatic&#xD;
             hypotension (&gt;= 20 beats per minute change in pulse including a fall in blood pressure&#xD;
             of &gt;= 20 mm Hg associated with dizziness, syncope, and blurred vision, from lying down&#xD;
             or sitting to standing). Uncontrolled hypertension requiring clinical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast feeding/lactating/pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressed on or recurred within 1 months of completing platinum-based chemotherapy in&#xD;
             metastatic setting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional exclusion criteria for olaparib + cediranib: Patients may not have evidence&#xD;
             of coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis. Therapeutic anticoagulation for prior&#xD;
             thromboembolic events is permitted. The clinical indication for therapeutic&#xD;
             anticoagulation must be clearly documented prior to enrollment and must be discussed&#xD;
             with the principal investigator (PI). Given the increased risk of serious bleeding&#xD;
             from cediranib, patients who are on more than or equal to 2 anti-thrombotic agents,&#xD;
             including but not limited to anti-platelet agents (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug&#xD;
             [NSAID]s/aspirin, clopidogrel), heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH),&#xD;
             warfarin, and a direct thrombin inhibitor, will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional exclusion criteria for olaparib + AZD6738: A diagnosis of ataxia&#xD;
             telangiectasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 3 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have&#xD;
             recovered from any effects of any major surgery&#xD;
