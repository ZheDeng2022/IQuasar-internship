  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled study in subjects&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes using multiple daily injection (MDI) insulin therapy. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to either receive the DC App and BD Nano 2nd Gen pen needles (intervention) or&#xD;
      continue their standard of care using their current pen needle and diabetes management&#xD;
      (control). The study will consist of four visits and two scheduled phone calls across a total&#xD;
      of 10 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At Visit 1 (Day -14) site staff will screen and enroll qualified subjects, provide a BGM&#xD;
      (Accu-Chek Guide) and attach a blinded flash glucose sensor (Libre Freestyle) to the back of&#xD;
      the arm. Subjects will complete any applicable baseline Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)&#xD;
      questionnaires and be sent home with no changes to their current therapy. While at home&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to test blood glucoses using the provided BGM and continue their usual&#xD;
      insulin dosing before returning to clinic for Visit 2. Visit 2 will consist of randomization&#xD;
      (Interventional Group or Control Group). The control group will be continued on their current&#xD;
      pen needle and receive standard visit education as needed. The intervention group will be&#xD;
      trained on the use of the DC App and be switched to BD Nano 2nd Gen pen needle. During weeks&#xD;
      3 through 8, subjects in both groups will continue their usual insulin routine, with the&#xD;
      control group adhering to their usual practice of managing their diabetes and the&#xD;
      intervention group utilizing the DC app for relevant educational content and tips plus using&#xD;
      the BD Nano 2nd Gen for all insulin injections. During Visit 3 subjects will get a 2nd fGM&#xD;
      sensor placed and be instructed to continue their insulin routine for the final 2 weeks.&#xD;
      Visit 4 is the last visit where subjects will have their fGM removed, return the BGM,&#xD;
      complete applicable PRO surveys, an injection technique questionnaire and be discharged.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Attitude Toward Diabetes - Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES) From Baseline to End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -14) and Study End (Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>A standardized questionnaire including 8 questions with response categories of 'strongly disagree', 'somewhat disagree', 'neutral', 'somewhat agree', and 'strongly agree'. An overall score for the DES is calculated by summing all of the item scores and dividing by 8 for a possible score range of 1-5 where a higher score indicates a higher level of empowerment.</description>

    <measure>Change in 24 Hour Average Blood Glucose From Baseline to End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -14 through Day -1) and Study End (Day 42 through Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>Freestyle Libre Pro blinded flash glucose monitoring will be used to assess change in average 24 hour blood glucose between groups Subjects will wear Libre sensors on the backs of their arm for the 2 weeks at the beginning of the study and 2 weeks at the end of the study.</description>

    <measure>Blood Glucose Values in Range of &lt;54 mg/dL at Baseline Compared to End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -14 through Day -1) and Study End (Day 42-through Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>Data collected by the flash glucose monitor were used to calculate percent of time in range to compare differences between groups at baseline and study end. For example, Time below 54 mg/dl is calculated in the following manner: Number of all glucose data points below 54 mg/dl / total number of glucose data points X 100. Since data points are all 5 minutes apart, this calculation provides the percentage of time in that range.</description>

    <measure>Insulin Delivery System Rating Questionnaire (IDSRQ) Scores at Baseline and End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -14) and Study End (Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>A standardized questionnaire including several questions with ordinal response scales from 1 to 4 and 1 to 5. The IDSRQ has seven sub-scales (satisfaction, interference of treatment with daily activities, diabetes-related worries, clinical efficacy, psychological well-being, social burden, and treatment preference). Each sub-scale is calculated as a mean of their corresponding items with scores ranging from 0-100. Higher scores represent higher levels of satisfaction, perceived clinical efficacy, and psychological well-being, interference with daily activities, diabetes-related worries, and social burden.</description>

    <measure>Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale for Diabetes (ARMS-D) Questionnaire Scores at Baseline and Study End</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -14) to Study End (Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>A standardized questionnaire including 11 multiple choice questions. The ARMS-D yields a total score plus two sub-scale scores (refill sub-scale and medication taking sub-scale. Items 1-10 are scored as follows: 1= none of the time, 2 = some of the time, 3 = most of the time, and 4 = all of the time. Item 11 is reversed scored. The ARMS-D total is a sum of all items for a possible score ranging from 11-44. The ARMS-D refill sub-scale is a sum of 4 items for a possible score ranging from 4-16. The ARMS-D medication taking sub-scale is a sum of 7 items for a possible score ranging from 7-28. Lower scores indicate better adherence.</description>

    <description>A questionnaire including 16, 5-point Likert Scale questions where 1 indicates strongly disagree and 5 indicates strongly agree. This questionnaire yields a total satisfaction score plus three sub-scale scores (mobile app satisfaction, pen needle satisfaction, and injection management system satisfaction). The total score ranges from 16-80. The mobile app and pen needle satisfaction sub-scale score range from 6-30 and is a sum of all items in the associated sub-scale. The management system sub-scale score ranges from 4-20 and is a sum of all items in the sub-scale. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction.</description>

        <description>Data collected by the flash glucose monitor were used to calculate percent of time in range to compare differences between groups at baseline and study end. For example, Time below 54 mg/dl is calculated in the following manner: Number of all glucose data points below 54 mg/dl / total number of glucose data points X 100. Since data points are all 5 minutes apart, this calculation provides the percentage of time in that range.</description>

The IDSRQ has seven sub-scales (satisfaction, interference of treatment with daily activities, diabetes-related worries, clinical efficacy, psychological well-being, social burden, and treatment preference). Each sub-scale is calculated as a mean of their corresponding items with scores ranging from 0-100. Higher scores represent higher levels of satisfaction, perceived clinical efficacy, and psychological well-being, interference with daily activities, diabetes-related worries, and social burden.</description>

        <description>A standardized questionnaire including 11 multiple choice questions. The ARMS-D yields a total score plus two sub-scale scores (refill sub-scale and medication taking sub-scale. Items 1-10 are scored as follows: 1= none of the time, 2 = some of the time, 3 = most of the time, and 4 = all of the time. Item 11 is reversed scored. The ARMS-D total is a sum of all items for a possible score ranging from 11-44. The ARMS-D refill sub-scale is a sum of 4 items for a possible score ranging from 4-16. The ARMS-D medication taking sub-scale is a sum of 7 items for a possible score ranging from 7-28. Lower scores indicate better adherence.</description>
