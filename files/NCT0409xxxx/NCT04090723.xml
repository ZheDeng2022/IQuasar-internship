  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unhealthy alcohol use among women with and at risk for HIV can interrupt critical steps in&#xD;
      the HIV prevention and care continuum, is associated with HIV transmission risk behaviors,&#xD;
      and contributes to health disparities. Thus it is critical to accurately identify alcohol use&#xD;
      and implement alcohol interventions among women with and at risk for HIV to optimize health&#xD;
      outcomes. The proposed pilot study will examine the implementation and effects of a computer&#xD;
      delivered brief alcohol intervention with peer navigation/Community Health Worker compared to&#xD;
      usual care on alcohol use, linkage to health services, and uptake of HIV prevention&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women account for 1 in 4 people living with HIV (PLWH) in the United States, and while&#xD;
      African American (AA) women comprise only 14% of the US female population, African American&#xD;
      women account for greater than 60% of women living with HIV (WLWH). Unhealthy alcohol use&#xD;
      interrupts critical steps in the HIV prevention and care continuum (HPACC) and thus&#xD;
      contributes to significant health disparities among at-risk and WLWH. The investigators have&#xD;
      developed theory-based, in-person and computer-delivered brief interventions (CBI) for at&#xD;
      risk and WLWH with alcohol use, demonstrating drinking reduction. However behavioral and&#xD;
      structural barriers to optimal uptake of alcohol interventions and engagement in the HPACC&#xD;
      remain, including mental health comorbidity and low knowledge, access, and use of HIV&#xD;
      prevention practices such as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The goals of this proposal&#xD;
      are two-fold: 1) to build on the investigators' current community partnerships to determine&#xD;
      how to optimally implement evidence based alcohol treatment for at risk and WLWH in&#xD;
      Baltimore, and 2) to determine whether the addition of information, motivational and peer&#xD;
      navigator/Community Health Worker support related to comorbid mental health, and HIV&#xD;
      prevention practices can enhance CBI and improve alcohol and HPACC outcomes among at risk and&#xD;
      WLWH. To achieve these goals the investigators will use a Community Based Participatory&#xD;
      Research (CBPR) approach, engaging patient and community stakeholders during all aspects of&#xD;
      study development, and community pilot testing. In collaboration with the investigators'&#xD;
      Community Advisory Board (CAB), the investigators will: 1) adapt the investigators' current&#xD;
      CBI to address gaps in the HIV prevention and care continuum (CBI-CC). The investigators will&#xD;
      conduct focus groups with both at risk and WLWH to tailor intervention manuals. 2) The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a pilot study of CBI-CC and peer navigation among 30 at-risk or&#xD;
      WLWH with unhealthy alcohol use. The investigators hypothesize that the CBI-CC will result in&#xD;
      reduction in drinking and heavy drinking days, increase linkage to substance use, and mental&#xD;
      health services and HIV pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and increase use of HIV prevention&#xD;
      practices including condoms and PrEP. Through this U34 planning grant the investigators will&#xD;
      partner with key stakeholders in the community to build capacity to deliver effective,&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions at the nexus of alcohol and HIV for at risk and WLWH with&#xD;
      alcohol misuse, and improve engagement in the HIV prevention and care continuum.&#xD;
