      The investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of Pd-1 Monoclonal&#xD;
      Antibody and HPV Vaccine in the patients with cervical cancer who fails in or can not endure&#xD;
      the standard treatment&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase II study is a research which treat cervical carcinoma patients who recurred after&#xD;
      at least one prior chemotherapy regimen with Sintilimab and HPV Vaccine. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      is objective response rate; secondary endpoints are Progression-Free Survival, Overall&#xD;
      Survival and duration of response. Efficacy will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1;&#xD;
      progression-free survival is the time from study entry to time of progression or death,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first; overall survival is the time from study entry to time of death or the&#xD;
      date of last contact,. Furthermore, exploratory studies will be performed on archival tumor&#xD;
      material (PD-L1 expression, next-generation sequencing).&#xD;
