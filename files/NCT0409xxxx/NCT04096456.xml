  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most pediatric gastroenterologists use an endoscopic pull technique to place gastrostomy&#xD;
      tubes. We assessed an endoscopic gastropexy technique for gastrostomy tube placement that&#xD;
      allows immediate placement of a low profile gastrostomy tube or gastro-jejunostomy tube. The&#xD;
      procedure involves endoscopy with the placement of three T-fasteners that are placed through&#xD;
      the skin into the stomach, placating and securing the stomach to the abdominal wall. This&#xD;
      attachment process promotes formation of a stable gastrostomy tract, facilitating an&#xD;
      immediate placement of a low profile gastrostomy button or gastro-jejunostomy tube. Serial&#xD;
      dilators are then used to obtain the desired diameter of the ostomy for the tube placement.&#xD;
      The gastropexy technique is most often associated with laparoscopic procedures involving&#xD;
      gastric volvulus or complicated GERD, but little has been published investigating the&#xD;
      outcomes of pediatric gastrostomy tube placement with the use of the gastropexy technique.&#xD;

      This is a retrospective chart review. We will review charts of patients who underwent&#xD;
      gastrostomy with gastropexy and primary percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement with pull&#xD;
      through technique and compare immediate complications such as (pain, bleeding, and&#xD;
      infection), and long term complications such as (feeding problems, pain, death, infection,&#xD;
      bleeding and granulation), and for readmission in the 3 months following placement. Our&#xD;
      control group will be the patients with primary percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement with&#xD;
      pull through technique compared to the outcomes of the gastrostomy with gastropexy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria is pediatric patients requiring an alternate means of nutrition with&#xD;
      gastrostomy placement. Subjects ages 0-17 years of age. Data created starting 01/01/2005 to&#xD;
      07/31/2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that do not meet inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Most pediatric gastroenterologists use an endoscopic pull technique to place&#xD;
      gastrostomy tubes. We will assess an endoscopic gastropexy technique for gastrostomy tube&#xD;
      placement that allows immediate placement of a low profile gastrostomy tube or&#xD;
      gastro-jejunostomy tube. The procedure involves endoscopy with the placement of three&#xD;
      T-fasteners that are placed through the skin into the stomach, placating and securing the&#xD;
      stomach to the abdominal wall. This attachment process promotes formation of a stable&#xD;
      gastrostomy tract, facilitating an immediate placement of a low profile gastrostomy button or&#xD;
      gastro-jejunostomy tube. Serial dilators are then used to obtain the desired diameter of the&#xD;
      ostomy for the tube placement and a low profile gastrostomy button of appropriate size is&#xD;
      placed. We will review complications both long term and short term of both the primary&#xD;
      percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement with pull through technique compared to the outcomes&#xD;
      of the gastrostomy with gastropexy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of GI cases at the Children's Hospital of San Antonio will be performed by PI and&#xD;
      research staff to identify eligible patients. The subject record will be accessed and data&#xD;
      recorded. The information recorded will be coded in the event a subject record requires&#xD;
      subsequent reviews to obtain data. The subject record will be coded in order to protect&#xD;
      subject PHI confidential. Please see section S for the data collection tool. The chart review&#xD;
      will include records created starting 01/01/2005 - 06/26/2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Local: 150, Worldwide: 150 The sample size is the any patient who underwent a&#xD;
      gastrostomy with gastropexy or primary percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement with pull&#xD;
      through technique by the gastroenterologists at the Children's Hospital of San Antonio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: The primary comparison is the difference between immediate complications such&#xD;
      as (pain, bleeding, and infection), and long term complications such as (feeding problems,&#xD;
      pain, death, infection, bleeding and granulation) to evaluate efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      gastrostomy with gastropexy.&#xD;
