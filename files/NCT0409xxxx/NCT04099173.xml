    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether a Brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention for&#xD;
      Suicidal Ideation (MB-SI) will result in short or longer-term reduction in suicidal ideation&#xD;
      (SI) and/or suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) as well as improvements in secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU).&#xD;

    <measure>Measure P1: Mean difference in Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention and one month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if there is a significant difference in the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort. The total Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale score can range from 0 to 25, with higher values indicating greater intensity. Longitudinal generalized linear mixed models will be used for the primary analyses. We estimate a total of two time points (baseline and one month follow-up) for the primary outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure S1: Number or category of patient and intervention characteristics</measure>
    <time_frame>throughout the study</time_frame>
    <description>Demographic data extraction will include gender, age, race, ethnicity, religious preferences, service branch, service connection, percent of service connection, number and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, substance abuse disorder (SUD) diagnosis, medical diagnosis, and number of medical diagnosis. In addition, the following factors will also be tracked: the group the participant has been placed in, admission date, consent date, the four intervention dates ( if participant is placed in the treatment group), post-intervention date, and one-month post-intervention date. These measures will be incorporated into the longitudinal generalized linear mixed model.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure S2: Number of psychiatric hospitalizations, emergency room visits for psychiatric illness, and emergency room visits</measure>
    <time_frame>before the Inpatient Psychiatric Unit (IPU) admission, one-month before the IPU admission, and one-month after the discharge from the IPU</time_frame>
    <description>The number of psychiatric hospitalizations, emergency room visits for psychiatric illness, and emergency room visits, as measured by retrospective review of the electronic medical record, among the MB-SI + TAU cohort will be compared to the TAU only cohort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure S3: Mean difference in TMS among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and one month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if there is a significant difference in state or trait mindfulness, as measured by the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS), among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort. The TMS consists of 2 subscales: curiosity and decentering. Altogether, the TMS includes 13 statements rated on a scale from 0 = not at all, to 4 = very much. Higher values represent higher state of mindfulness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure S4: Mean difference in ERQ among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention and immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if there is a significant difference in the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort. ERQ is a 10-likert-type items designed to measure respondents' tendency to regulate emotions in two ways: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Scoring is kept continuous and each facet's scoring is kept separate. Higher scores indicate greater capacity for emotional regulation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure S5: Mean difference in Five Facet Mindfulness among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and one month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if there is a significant difference in Five Facet Mindfulness among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort. Five Facet Mindfulness is a scale of 15 items, scores can range from 15 - 75, and higher scores indicate a greater capacity for mindfulness.</description>
