      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of adding&#xD;
      interleukin 12 (IL-12) gene therapy and L-NMMA to pembrolizumab in patients with early-stage&#xD;
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) receiving standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy given before breast cancer surgery is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It&#xD;
      shrinks the breast tumor so it is easier to remove during surgery. Docetaxel is often used&#xD;
      for the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Unfortunately, a lot of breast tumors do not&#xD;
      shrink with chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a type of treatment that stimulates your own immune system to attack cancer&#xD;
      cells. Your immune system is normally your body's first defense against threats like cancer.&#xD;
      However, sometimes cancer cells produce signals that prevent the immune system from detecting&#xD;
      and killing them. Pembrolizumab helps your immune system so it can detect and attack cancer&#xD;
      cells. Chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab has been shown to be better than chemotherapy alone&#xD;
      for shrinking breast tumors before surgery. To increase the cancer-fighting ability of your&#xD;
      immune system, you will be given 1 or 2 more treatments. These include IL-12 gene therapy and&#xD;
      L-NMMA.&#xD;
