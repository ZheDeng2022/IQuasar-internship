        Clinical Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject must voluntarily sign and date the approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior&#xD;
             to collection of study data or performance of study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must be either male or non-pregnant female ≥18 years of age with an expected&#xD;
             lifespan sufficient to allow for completion of all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must be willing and able to comply with protocol requirements, including all&#xD;
             study visits and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject must require peripheral vascular occlusion at an arterial target embolization&#xD;
             site(s) that can be treated with the CATERPILLAR™ Arterial Embolization Device&#xD;
             according to the Instructions for Use (IFU). Note: More than one target embolization&#xD;
             site may be treated per subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Angiographic Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The target embolization site(s) must be located in a native arterial vessel(s) with&#xD;
             the intended arterial vessel diameter ranges shown in the IFU, as assessed by the&#xD;
             Investigator (via visual estimate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The target embolization site(s) must have a landing zone sufficient to accommodate the&#xD;
             device implant lengths shown in the IFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinical Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject's access vessel(s) preclude safe insertion of the delivery catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject's target embolization site(s) is located within a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject's target embolization site(s) is located within the head, neck, heart or&#xD;
             coronary vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject's target embolization site(s) is located across highly locomotive joints&#xD;
             or muscle beds (e.g. elbow, hip, knee, shoulder, thoracic inlet/outlet).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject's target embolization site(s) is located in a high-flow vessel where, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator, there may be significant risk of migration and&#xD;
             unintended (non-target site) occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to contrast media that cannot be&#xD;
             adequately pre-medicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the device materials&#xD;
             including: cobalt, chromium, nickel, titanium, platinum, iridium, polyurethane or&#xD;
             polyethylene.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject will receive anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy (e.g. direct thrombin&#xD;
             inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors, vitamin K antagonists) before, during and/or after&#xD;
             treatment with the study device, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would&#xD;
             clinically interfere with the study endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject has a known uncontrolled blood coagulation or bleeding disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The subject has an unresolved systemic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject's required pre-operative laboratory tests and/or physical examination&#xD;
             indicate abnormal results, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would clinically&#xD;
             interfere with the study endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The subject has a connective tissue disorders (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome), arteritis&#xD;
             (e.g. Takayasu's Disease) or another circulatory disorder, which, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator, would clinically interfere with the study endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The subject has another medical condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             may cause him/her to be non-compliant with the protocol, may confound the data&#xD;
             interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy insufficient to allow for the&#xD;
             completion of study procedures and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or another device&#xD;
             study that has not completed the study treatment or that clinically interferes with&#xD;
             the study endpoints. Note: Studies requiring extended follow-up visits for products&#xD;
             that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not&#xD;
             considered investigational studies.&#xD;
