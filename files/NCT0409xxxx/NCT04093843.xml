      The purpose of this study is to find alternative treatments for patient's suffering from&#xD;
      depression after having a stroke.This study aims to show that accelerated rTMS is a safe,&#xD;
      effective,and convenient treatment for patient's suffering from post-stroke depression in the&#xD;
      acute to subacute phase. This will be an open label trial and thus all participants will&#xD;
      receive the active rTMS intervention.&#xD;

      The primary objectives of this project are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the efficacy TMS in PSD. We hypothesize that there will be a decrease in the&#xD;
           HAMD score in patients receiving TMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the feasibility of an accelerated protocol using rTMS in patients with acute&#xD;
           to subacute stroke and co-existing PSD. We hypothesize that the accelerated protocol&#xD;
           will promote compliance in our patient population and that the administration of this&#xD;
           intervention is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the safety of rTMS in patients with acute to subacute stroke. We hypothesize&#xD;
           that the side effects of TMS will be minimal and the therapy will be well-tolerated and&#xD;
           safe in individuals with recent strokes and co-existing PSD.&#xD;
