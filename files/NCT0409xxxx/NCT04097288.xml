      This study will investigate if citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is&#xD;
      reducing the opening pressure of the urethra and possibly causing or worsening stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence. Reboxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is known to increase urethral&#xD;
      opening pressure through actions on adrenoceptors in Onuf´s nucleus and will act as an active&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

      This study will investigate if citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is&#xD;
      reducing the opening pressure of the urethra and possibly causing or worsening stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence. Theoretically, citalopram can affect the tone of urethra through actions on&#xD;
      serotonergic receptors in Onuf´s nucleus that innervates the striated muscle in urethra.&#xD;
      Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is common and has been associated with&#xD;
      urinary incontinence. Stress urinary incontinence is frequent and the most common cause of&#xD;
      urinary incontinence. Reboxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is known to increase&#xD;
      urethral opening pressure through actions on adrenoceptors in Onuf´s nucleus and will act as&#xD;
      an active control. Should the tone of urethra decrease significantly after ingestion of&#xD;
      citalopram, this study would contribute to a deeper understanding of stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence and give rise to a debate of pharmacologic treatment of stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence diagnosed in patients treated with citalopram (this debate may also include use&#xD;
      of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study is performed to explore the effects of reboxetine and citalopram on&#xD;
      the opening pressure of the anal canal. Onuf´s nucleus, like the striated urethral sphincter,&#xD;
      innervates the striated skeletal muscle of the external sphincter in the anal canal. The&#xD;
      prevalence of fecal incontinence (FI) increases with age and is estimated to affect 15% of&#xD;
      people aged over 50 years. Pharmacologic treatment of fecal incontinence is very sparse and&#xD;
      new treatments it is very desirable. If reboxetine or citalopram increases the anal opening&#xD;
      pressure these pharmacologic agents might leads to new ways of treating FI, making this study&#xD;
      the first to explore this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, three period&#xD;
      cross over phase I study. Twenty-four healthy, female subjects are recruited and investigated&#xD;
      during three independent trial days where one of the pharmacologic agents is given each trial&#xD;
      day (citalopram, reboxetine or placebo) in concordance with the sequence (order of the&#xD;
      pharmacologic agents given). Subjects will be drafted randomly and evenly among the three&#xD;
      sequences possible. During all trial days pressures of the urethra and the anal canal of&#xD;
      every subject will be measured by urethral pressure reflectometry and anal acoustic&#xD;
      reflectometry at the time of maximum plasma concentration of citalopram and reboxetine. A&#xD;
      clinically meaningful difference in urethral pressure after administration of citalopram is&#xD;
      assessed to be 10 cmH2O compared to placebo (reboxetine acts as an active control) while a&#xD;
      clinically meaningful difference in anal pressure after administration of citalopram or&#xD;
      reboxetine is assessed to be 15 cmH2O compared to placebo.&#xD;
