  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of an intervention called Leadership and&#xD;
      Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI), relative to implementation as usual (IAU),&#xD;
      on clinician fidelity to, and youth service outcomes of, a well-established digital&#xD;
      measurement-based care intervention called the Outcomes Questionnaire-Analyst in outpatient&#xD;
      community mental health clinics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of LOCI on the implementation, fidelity, and&#xD;
      sustainment of a digital measurement-based care (MBC) system called the Outcomes&#xD;
      Questionnaire Analyst (OQ-A). Over two phases, the investigators will recruit a total of 20&#xD;
      agencies with up to 2 first level leaders per site (max N of 40 total), a minimum of 3&#xD;
      clinicians per site (60 total), and 72 caregivers per site (720 total). Agencies will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the control condition (implementation as usual of the OQ-A system) or&#xD;
      the intervention condition (the LOCI intervention).&#xD;

    <measure>Fidelity to MBC</measure>
    <time_frame>0-24 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician fidelity to the OQ-A, a digital measurement-based care system, will be measured by parent/caregiver reports. Specifically, parents/caregivers will complete the Caregiver Report of Measurement-Based Care measure which assesses the frequency of clinician's use of the measurement-based care system.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Youth Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers will be asked about their child's progress throughout treatment in order to assess this relative to their clinician's implementation and fidelity to the MBC system. Caregivers will complete the Short form Assessment for Children (SAC) to measure youth outcomes--specifically, the youth's rate of symptom reduction throughout treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanisms of Fidelity</measure>
    <time_frame>0-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This study will evaluate mechanisms of fidelity in clinician use of the MBC system. Clinicians will take assessments that measure the leadership style of their supervisors, the organizational climate, and clinicians' intentions to use MBC as these are hypothesized to mediate fidelity. Clinicians will complete the Implementation Leadership Scale (ILS) and the Implementation Climate Scale (ICS) to measure rate of improvement.</description>
