  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NCCN guidelines for B cell lymphoma suggest that patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive&#xD;
      NHL who are candidate for high-dose therapy should receive combination of cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapies as 2nd line treatment. However, proportion of patients who are adequately&#xD;
      salvaged by second line chemotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is&#xD;
      unsatisfactory. Moreover, many fragile patients are unfit for salvage cytotoxic chemotherapy&#xD;
      and/or high-dose chemotherapy. Hence, most of patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive&#xD;
      B-cell NHL is ultimately candidate for less-cytotoxic drugs with targeted approach. This&#xD;
      trial is phase II trial of acalabrutinib in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide for&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
