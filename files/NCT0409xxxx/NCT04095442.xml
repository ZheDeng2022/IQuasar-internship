  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of antibacterial mouthwash on muscle&#xD;
      speed and power in healthy young men and women. We have previously demonstrated that drinking&#xD;
      beetroot juice, a source of dietary nitrate and therefore nitric oxide, increases muscle&#xD;
      function in this population. Antibacterial mouthwash has been shown to interfere with the&#xD;
      conversion of dietary nitrate to nitric oxide. We therefore hypothesize that it will diminish&#xD;
      nitric oxide bioavailability and inhibit muscle contractility.&#xD;

      Study Visit One:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During an initial visit, subjects will complete the informed consent process, be instructed&#xD;
      on the requirements of the study, and practice the exercise protocol (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit Two:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be tested after they have avoided exercise, caffeine, alcohol, chewing gum, and&#xD;
      foods high in nitrate (e.g., spinach, beets, collard greens) for at least 24 hours. They will&#xD;
      also be asked to not use any mouthwash products during this period. They will then provide&#xD;
      provide a saliva sample for subsequent measurement of nitrate and nitrite concentrations and&#xD;
      have their breath nitric oxide levels measured using a portable analyzer. The maximal knee&#xD;
      extensor speed and power of their knee extensor muscles will then be measured using an&#xD;
      isokinetic dynamometer. This machine can control the speed of movement while measuring the&#xD;
      maximal force (torque) that a subject can voluntarily produce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be randomly assigned to receive either an antibacterial mouthwash&#xD;
      (Cepacol©, Reckitt Benckiser, Parsippany, NJ) or, as a control solution, an alcohol-free&#xD;
      &quot;natural&quot; mouthwash (Tom's of Maine©, Kennebunk, ME). Participants will be asked to rinse&#xD;
      their mouth as directed on the product's packaging for 30 s twice per day for 7 (+/-2) days&#xD;
      and to record the usage of the mouthwash on a provided form. Subjects will then return for&#xD;
      Study Visit 3 (see below). This is considered a single-blind study, which means that the&#xD;
      investigators will not know what type of mouthwash a subject is receives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit Three:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the treatment period, subjects will be asked to return to undergo the same&#xD;
      procedures as described for Study Visit Two.&#xD;
