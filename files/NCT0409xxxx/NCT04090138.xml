      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effects of setria performance blend&#xD;
      supplementation on endurance performance in healthy men.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial in healthy men.&#xD;
      Subjects will take either a placebo or setria performance blend (L-citrulline + glutathione)&#xD;
      for 8 days. At the day 8, subjects run on the treadmill to measure the time to exhaustion at&#xD;
      90%, 100%, and 110% of peak velocity. Arterial blood flow and blood vessel diameter (via&#xD;
      ultrasound), blood analytes (plasma nitrate/nitrite, L-arginine, L-citrulline), subjective&#xD;
      feelings of fatigue from a visual analog scale (VAS) and ratings of perceived exertion will&#xD;
      be assessed. There is a minimum of a two week washout period in between trials/treatments.&#xD;
      The same procedures are completed upon return visit.&#xD;
