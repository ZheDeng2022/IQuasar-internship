    <textblock>
      The study will utilize a stepped wedge cluster randomized design to examine the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the full FaCES (Facilitating Change for Excellence in SBIRT) adolescent SBIRT change&#xD;
      package. Primary care providers will be randomized as to when they receive training and begin&#xD;
      delivery of FaCES with their 12 to 17 year old patients, which includes targeted feedback&#xD;
      based on the patient's endorsed substance use level on the S2BI screening instrument.&#xD;

      The study will utilize a stepped wedge cluster randomized design to examine the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the full FaCES (Facilitating Change for Excellence in SBIRT) adolescent change package for&#xD;
      12 to 17 year old primary care patients. Primary care providers at two rural federally&#xD;
      qualified health centers in New Mexico and Tennessee will be randomized as to when they&#xD;
      receive training and begin delivering FaCES to their adolescent patients. FaCES includes&#xD;
      targeted feedback based on the patient's endorsed substance use level on the S2BI screening&#xD;
      instrument. Study participants will complete a baseline and follow-up assessment 3-months&#xD;
      post study recruitment.&#xD;
