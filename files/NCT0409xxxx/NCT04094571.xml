  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional electrical stimulation (FES) induced cycling is a common rehabilitative therapy.&#xD;
      Closed-loop FES control holds the promise to improve rehabilitation procedures. However, FES&#xD;
      results in a delay between the time of stimulation and muscle contraction and rapidly&#xD;
      fatigues muscle. The purpose of this study is to measure the FES-induced delay on an FES&#xD;
      cycle and to understand how the delay varies as a function of how long the user has been&#xD;
      cycling and a function of the crank angle.&#xD;

      This study will use non-invasive approaches (surface electrodes, encoders, torque meters,&#xD;
      motors) to study muscle delay and how muscle fatigues for both individuals possessing&#xD;
      movement disorders and healthy individuals. Individuals with movement disorders are often&#xD;
      susceptible to partial or total paralysis. This paralysis often leads to an increasingly&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle. By implementing the intelligent closed-loop control of FES-cycling,&#xD;
      FES-therapy can be made more effective, combating the effects of sedentary lifestyles. Using&#xD;
      data obtained from non-invasive sensors, the study team will apply analytical techniques to&#xD;
      quantify FES muscle delay and how well individuals can track a desired cadence as the muscle&#xD;
      fatigues. A challenge associated with FES-induced cycling is that there exists a delay&#xD;
      between the time when FES is applied and the time when the muscle contracts. There is&#xD;
      likewise a delay between the time FES is removed and the time the muscle ceases to contract.&#xD;
      Previous studies have measured this delay and determined that it varies with fatigue. A goal&#xD;
      of this project is to measure this delay on an FES-cycle and to determine how this delay&#xD;
      varies as a result of FES-induced cycling. Another goal is to determine what effect the crank&#xD;
      angle has on the delay as well as on the muscle control effectiveness. This study will&#xD;
      provide insight into how engineering can be combined with healthcare and therapy to better&#xD;
      both fields and bridge the gap between engineering and medicine.&#xD;
