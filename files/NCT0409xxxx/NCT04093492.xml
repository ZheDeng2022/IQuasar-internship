    <textblock>
      The Preemie Prep for Parents (P3) mobile intervention will be tested in an outpatient&#xD;
      population of pregnant women at risk of preterm birth and their partners. The study is an RCT&#xD;
      comparing knowledge and preparedness for decision making between a group receiving the P3&#xD;
      texts and videos and a group receiving links to ACOG prematurity patient education handouts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study focused on an outpatient population of pregnant women&#xD;
      at risk of preterm birth and their partners. The objective is to test the efficacy of the&#xD;
      Preemie Prep for Parents (P3) intervention on prematurity knowledge and preparedness for&#xD;
      decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are recruited from their obstetric clinic appointment between weeks 16 and 21,&#xD;
      and randomized 1:1 to either the P3 intervention, or access to electronic ACOG handouts&#xD;
      (active control). Any participating partners are assigned to the same arm as their pregnant&#xD;
      partner. The participants in the P3 group will then receive a schedule of automated text&#xD;
      messages, with video links, up to twice a day. These videos and messages are based on&#xD;
      information relevant to their gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry, participants will complete measures of their health literacy, anxiety,&#xD;
      decision self-efficacy, and subjective global health. As pregnancy continues, questionnaires&#xD;
      will be sent to participants at the start of their 25th, 30th, and 34th weeks. These&#xD;
      questionnaires will include Prematurity Knowledge Questionnaires (specific to their&#xD;
      gestational age), a Preparation for Decision Making scale, and an anxiety measure. At study&#xD;
      completion, within two weeks of either preterm childbirth or completion of the 34 week&#xD;
      questionnaire, participants will be asked to also complete the Educational-Aid Questionnaire.&#xD;
