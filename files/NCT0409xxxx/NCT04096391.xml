      This study is being conducted to compare intrathecal morphine using the commercially&#xD;
      available intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDS), and conventional medical management (CMM)&#xD;
      in subjects with non-cancer, refractory chronic pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To compare the change in pain intensity from baseline based on the Numeric Rating Scale&#xD;
      [NRS] between subjects randomized to the IDDS group and subjects randomized to the CMM&#xD;
      group.The comparison will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months following enrollment. The&#xD;
      evaluation at 6 months will be considered the primary time point for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the following secondary objectives, the comparisons between the IDDS group and&#xD;
      CMM group will be made using the intra-subject change from baseline as the dependent&#xD;
      variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the subject reported PROMIS 29 between the IDDS group and CMM group. Individual&#xD;
           subject scores recorded at baseline and months 3, 6, 9 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the accrued cost of therapy for pain control including those related to adverse&#xD;
           events, ED visits, cost of medications between the IDDS group and CMM group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the number of other concurrent treatments performed on each subject between the&#xD;
           IDDS group and CMM group. Individual subject counts recorded at months 3, 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
           will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional safety objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To characterize pain and device related adverse events for all subjects throughout the&#xD;
      study through completion of 12 month follow-up or subject exit.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Comparisons will be done prior to baseline visit and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 month visits.</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a 0-10 numeric pain rating scale (11 point scale), where a higher scores equates to more pain.&#xD;
The primary endpoint for this post-marketing study is the comparison of the NPRS between the IDDS group and the CMM group collected in the Study Diary at various time points.</description>

    <measure>Compare the change in PROMIS 29 scores between the IDDS group and CMM group</measure>
    <time_frame>Individual subject scores recorded at baseline visit and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 month visits.</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the subject reported Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29 between the IDDS group and CMM group. PROMIS 29 assesses pain intensity using a 0-10 numeric rating scale (11 point scale), where a higher score equates to more pain. Other health domains are scored using a Likert scale, where higher scores represent more of the specific domain being measured. The other health domains that are scored are: depression; anxiety; physical function; pain interference; fatigue; sleep disturbance; and ability to participate in social roles and activities.</description>
