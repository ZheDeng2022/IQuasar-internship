      arterial stiffness and endothelial function in dialysis patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The endothelium is a key regulator of vascular homeostasis and chronic exposure to vascular&#xD;
      risk factors alters the regulatory properties of the endothelium, which progresses toward a&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory pattern, senescence, and apoptosis. Endothelial cell integrity and function&#xD;
      are critical to the prevention of atherosclerosis, and therefore endothelial cell injury and&#xD;
      dysfunction are major steps in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction may be the landmark of active disease process through the course of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and a significant risk factor for future&#xD;
      cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies had reported that not only medical treatment but also exercise could improve&#xD;
      physical and vascular functions, dialytic efficiency, quality of sleep, fatigue and&#xD;
      depression et al. Exercise could be classified to aerobic, Anaerobic exercise and resistance&#xD;
      et. Several studies have shown that regular cycling exercise in hemodialysis patients could&#xD;
      improve physical activity, sleep quality, and reduce fatigability. Therefore, exercise plays&#xD;
      an important role in hemodialysis patients. According to these benefits, the investigator's&#xD;
      study was designed to explore the effects of intradialytic cycling exercise on sleep quality&#xD;
      and fatigability, adipokines and myokinins levels in hemodialysis patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Change of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue (FACIT-F) score for 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-test and then every 3 months for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the FACIT-F score before, during and after intradialytic cycling exercise FACIT-F score is from 0-52 points; higher score represents less fatigue.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score for 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-test and then every 3 months for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the PSQI score before, during and after intradialytic cycling exercise PSQI score is from 0-21 points; score&gt;=5 means poor sleeping quality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) for 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-test and then every 3 months for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the cfPWV before, during and after intradialytic cycling exercise&#xD;
cfPWV measurement: a measure of aortic wall stiffness, increases markedly with age. Each set of pulse wave and ECG data to calculate the mean time difference between R-wave and pulse wave on a beat-to-beat basis, with an average of 10 consecutive cardiac cycles. The cfPWV will be calculated using the distance and mean time difference between the two recorded points.&#xD;
Patients with cfPWV values of &gt; 10 m/s were classified in the high arterial stiffness group, whereas those with cfPWV values of ≤10 m/s were assigned to the low arterial stiffness group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) for 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-test and then every 3 months for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the CAVI before, during and after intradialytic cycling exercise&#xD;
CAVI is a novel and accurate method, independent of the effect of blood pressure, and is used as a predictor of arterial stiffness (AS) AS was defined as a CAVI ≥ 9</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) for 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-test and then every 3 months for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the baPWV before, during and after intradialytic cycling exercise&#xD;
baPWV is one measure arterial stiffness using brachial to ankle arterial wave analyses and has been used to assess peripheral arterial stiffness (PAS)&#xD;
baPWV value &gt;14.0 m/s on either side was considered high PAS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the aortic augmentation index(AI) measurements for 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-test and then every 3 months for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the AI before, during and after intradialytic cycling exercise&#xD;
AI of central blood pressure have been widely used as clinical indices of arterial stiffness AI is an indirect measure of central arterial stiffness, but mainly a direct measure of central wave reflection</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the brachial flow-mediated vasodilatation (bFMD) for 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-test and then every 3 months for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the bFMD before, during and after intradialytic cycling exercise&#xD;
Endothelial function is often quantified by FMD, which represents the endothelium-dependent relaxation of a conduit artery-typically the brachial artery - due to an increased blood flow.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the digital thermal monitoring (DTM) for 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-test and then every 3 months for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the DTM before, during and after intradialytic cycling exercise&#xD;
DTM is a simple noninvasive method to measure endothelial function and vascular reactivity that is correlated with atherosclerosis risk factors and coronary artery disease&#xD;
Vascular reactivity index (VRI) &lt; 1.0: the poor vascular reactivity, 1.0 ≤ VRI &lt; 2.0: the intermediate vascular reactivity, and VRI ≥ 2.0: the good vascular reactivity.</description>
