      Cross-over double-blind study. Healthy subjects will be exposed to diesel exhaust fumes&#xD;
      and/or filtered air during a 2-hour session. Several parameters will be assesed i.e.&#xD;
      endothelial function will be assessed with flow mediated dilation (FMD) techniques, arterial&#xD;
      stiffness with pulse wave velocity (PWV) and reflected waves with augmentation index (AIx). C&#xD;
      reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, protein C levels and protein S activity will be also&#xD;
      measured. Heart rate variability and standard deviation of normal to normal intervals R-R&#xD;
      intervals (SDNN) will be used to assess sympathetic activity. Measurements were assessed&#xD;
      before, 2 and 24 hours after diesel exposure.&#xD;

      Introduction Diesel and its products represent one of the most common pollutants affecting&#xD;
      people living in urban and rural areas of the world. The majority of patients attending&#xD;
      emergency departments are likely to have been subjected to chronic exposure to diesel engine&#xD;
      exhaust fumes particularly those living in proximity to busy city roads and highways. Diesel&#xD;
      exhaust fumes are considered to contribute to over 50% of atmospheric particles with a mass&#xD;
      of less than 10 μM (PM10) average aerodynamic diameter, which is responsible for air&#xD;
      pollution. For fine particle matter lower than 2.5 μM (PM2.5) and extremely small particles&#xD;
      below 0.1 μM in diameter, the contribution to air pollution is much greater. These particles&#xD;
      are small enough to be inhaled and deposited in the lungs where they can exert deleterious&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Europe and Japan, epidemiological studies have demonstrated high rates of cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity, as well as acute and chronic respiratory disease, following occupational exposure&#xD;
      to diesel exhaust fumes. Experimental animal studies have also shown that exposure to diluted&#xD;
      diesel engine emission impairs left ventricle systolic performance, sympathetic drive,&#xD;
      fibrosis/fibrinolysis and accelerates atherosclerosis. Epidemiological studies and&#xD;
      experimental animal models are, however, rather imprecise regarding the mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for these effects and the clinical impact of chronic diesel exhaust fumes&#xD;
      exposure. Moreover, although a relationship has been documented between acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes (ACS) and acute exposure to diesel engine exhaust fumes, it is not known whether&#xD;
      relatively short-term exposure can cause prolonged inflammatory responses and/or affect&#xD;
      endothelial function and vessel wall properties in such a way as to potentially promote the&#xD;
      development of atherosclerotic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of short-term exposure to Diesel exhaust&#xD;
      fumes on arterial elasticity, vascular function and inflammatory biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study population Volunteers will be included in this randomized, double blind,&#xD;
      crossover study All volunteers who qualified for study entry will be free of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary disease and acute inflammatory or chronic&#xD;
      diseases. Subjects who will be found to have an abnormal baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram&#xD;
      and/or impaired respiratory function tests will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals taking cardiovascular medications, antioxidant or vitamin supplementation, oral&#xD;
      contraceptives or anti-inflammatory agents during the two months prior to inclusion in the&#xD;
      study will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women receiving hormone replacement therapy and premenopausal women with irregular menstrual&#xD;
      cycles will also excluded from the study. All women selected for the study will underwent&#xD;
      pregnancy tests before each study session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is randomized double-blind, cross-over study. All subjects will be exposed&#xD;
      to air or pollutants in two sessions which will took place 4 weeks apart between 8.00 and&#xD;
      10.00 a.m. in an ad hoc laboratory. In each session, the subjects will underwent a 2-hour&#xD;
      exposure period to controlled amounts of diesel exhaust fumes or filtered air. In each&#xD;
      session, measurements of markers of vascular function (flow mediated dilation, pulse wave&#xD;
      velocity and augmentation index), sympathetic activity and blood tests depicting the&#xD;
      inflammatory and fibrinolytic profile will took place. These measurements will be performed&#xD;
      at baseline (before exposure-T0), at the end of the 2-hour session (T2) and 24 hours after&#xD;
      the end of exposure (T24) (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements in each women participating in the study will be performed at the same phase of&#xD;
      the menstrual cycle (late luteal phase). The participants will refrained from drinking&#xD;
      alcohol or caffeinated fluids and using medications containing caffeine, or smoking. All&#xD;
      volunteers will be assessed after having been in the fasting state for at least 8 h.&#xD;
      Participants will instructed to avoid changes in diet and physical activity habits during the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diesel exhaust and filtered air exposure Volunteer exposure to diesel exhaust fumes will&#xD;
      carried out on a specially designed 30m2 room which was hermetically sealed. The diesel&#xD;
      exhaust fumes will be produced by a diesel engine (2500 cc and 100-150HP) and dispensed&#xD;
      through a pipe system into the exposure room. Prior to study entry, indoor levels of carbon&#xD;
      monoxide (CO) along with concentrations of fine airborne particulate matters (PM2.5) will be&#xD;
      measured, controlled and kept within the desired limits using portable environmental&#xD;
      instrumentation. In order to secure adequate levels of exposure to PM2.5 and CO, all&#xD;
      measurements will be controlled and compared to the respective standards of the European&#xD;
      Commission. Specifically, 25 µg/m3 (mean annual limit) for PM2.5 particles and 10 µg/m3&#xD;
      (maximum daily 8 hour mean) for CO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular measurements Endothelial function evaluation Using a linear array ultrasound (U/S)&#xD;
      transducer endothelial function will be evaluated by estimating flow mediated dilation (FMD)&#xD;
      in the brachial artery, as per standardized protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central arterial stiffness measurements Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), an index&#xD;
      of aortic stiffness, will be calculated from measurements of pulse transit time and the&#xD;
      distance between 2 recording sites (PWV = distance, in meters, divided by transit time, in&#xD;
      seconds) using a well-validated non-invasive device (SphygmoCor; AtCor Medical, Sydney,&#xD;
      Australia) as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of wave reflections The AIx of the central (aortic) pressure waveform will be&#xD;
      calculated as a composite index of wave reflections and arterial stiffness using a validated,&#xD;
      commercially available system (SphygmoCor; AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia) which employs&#xD;
      the principle of applanation tonometry. Waveforms of radial pressure will be calibrated&#xD;
      according to sphygmomanometric systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure measured&#xD;
      in the brachial artery. Because the AIx is influenced by changes in HR, it was corrected as&#xD;
      appropriate (corrected for a steady HR of 75 bpm; AI75).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sympathetic activity assessment Heart rate variability (HRV) expresses the impact of the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system on heart activity. Low HRV may be attributed to increased&#xD;
      sympathetic tone and has been found to be associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Sympathetic activity will be evaluated by calculating HRV with continuous&#xD;
      electrocardiographic study (ECG) which was recorded for 20 minutes by a Holter device. ECG&#xD;
      data will then transferred onto a computer for assessment of HRV, which was performed in&#xD;
      accordance with current international guidelines, and standard deviation of normal to normal&#xD;
      intervals (SDNN) will be measured. (Holter software, Synescope, version 3.1, ELA Medical,&#xD;
      France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrinolysis and inflammation markers A fasting venous blood sample will collected by&#xD;
      venipuncture at baseline (before exposure-T0), at the end of the 2 hours session (T2) and 24&#xD;
      hours after the end of exposure (T24). Venous blood samples will be centrifuged at 3000 rpm&#xD;
      and serum was collected and stored at -80 C until assayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prothrombotic status was assessed by measuring levels of fibrinogen using the&#xD;
      Multifibren® U system. Fibrinolytic activity will be assessed with measurements of protein C&#xD;
      plasma levels and protein S activity, which were measured by the STA® - Staclot® Protein C&#xD;
      kit and HemosIL™ Protein S Activity kits, respectively. Furthermore, changes from baseline in&#xD;
      the inflammatory profile induced by diesel exhaust fumes will be studied by measuring serum&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) using the Architect Abbott device.&#xD;
