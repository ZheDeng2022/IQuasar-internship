  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1 in 10 teenagers lives with a chronic health condition that will require&#xD;
      ongoing care as they enter adulthood. Birth defects of the heart, also known as congenital&#xD;
      heart disease (CHD) are more common than any other type of birth defect and affect about 1 in&#xD;
      100 children, with most surviving to adulthood. However, most teenagers with CHD have little&#xD;
      knowledge about their heart and lack confidence in talking with doctors and nurses about&#xD;
      their health. These are essential skills when entering the adult-oriented health care system&#xD;
      after graduating from pediatric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study proposal our team plans to evaluate the effectiveness of delivering&#xD;
      1-on-1 teaching sessions for adolescents who live in smaller communities and can't easily&#xD;
      come to Edmonton for appointments in the heart clinic. Fortunately in Alberta we have a&#xD;
      widely available system called Telehealth that allows nurses and teens to meet by private,&#xD;
      secure teleconferencing while hundreds of miles away. Telehealth is provided by health&#xD;
      clinics around the province. We propose to use Telehealth in adolescents' home communities to&#xD;
      provide these teaching sessions for 16-19 year olds with CHD who are soon going to be&#xD;
      graduating from pediatric to adult care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who receive a nurse-led teaching session will be compared with a similar number&#xD;
      of adolescents who are not offered a teaching session, using a questionnaire that addresses&#xD;
      skills related to taking care of their health condition. This questionnaire will be completed&#xD;
      on-line (or if preferred by the participant, by letter mail) 1 month and 6 month after&#xD;
      entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deciding which adolescents receive a nurse-led teaching session will be random, i.e. like the&#xD;
      flip of a coin. Regardless, all participants will receive access to a website for young&#xD;
      people with CHD called iHeartChange.&#xD;

      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Transitioning Rural Adolescents to Adult Care (TRAAC) Study is a mixed-methods randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the impact of a Telehealth-based nurse-led transition&#xD;
      intervention in combination with access to a CHD website, versus the CHD website alone, on&#xD;
      preparing rural-based adolescents living with congenital heart disease (CHD) to successfully&#xD;
      transition from pediatric to adult cardiology care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the impact of a nurse-led transition intervention in&#xD;
      combination with access to the iHeartChange website, versus iHeartChange alone, on&#xD;
      adolescents' self-management skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) evaluate the impact of the nurse-led intervention on adolescents' self-efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) measure iHeartChange use by participants , and&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) explore potential influences on intervention effectiveness, using qualitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through the Stollery Children's Hospital Outreach Pediatric&#xD;
      Cardiology clinics. After discussion with the Research Coordinator, the participant will be&#xD;
      emailed an online consent form, and baseline questionnaires through REDCap as well as an&#xD;
      email from the iHeartChange website after the baseline questionnaires are complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 1 month and 6 month post enrollment, participants will receive the link to complete&#xD;
      the questionnaire via email. Should they not complete the questionnaire within the first 2&#xD;
      weeks, they will receive reminder emails at 2, 4 and 6 weeks post initial send out. At the&#xD;
      completion of the 1 month and 6 month questionnaires, the participant will receive a small&#xD;
      incentive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those assigned to the intervention group, a one-on-one telehealth session with the nurse&#xD;
      will be set up. The session will take ~ 1 hour. Prior to the session the participant will&#xD;
      receive a mail out transition package of additional written resources containing a &quot;When&#xD;
      You're 18 booklet&quot; with transition specific information, disease specific information sheets,&#xD;
      adolescent mental health resources, +/- endocarditis information if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant heart history information will be collected as well as demographics by accessing&#xD;
      their paper charts, eClinician, Netcare and Connectcare electronic medical records. Baseline&#xD;
      data we are collecting includes current height, weight, date of birth, cardiac diagnosis,&#xD;
      cardiac surgery and procedure information, medications, cardiology visits and other&#xD;
      information from the cardiology clinic letters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be assigned an alphanumerical code and pseudonym. All qualitative data&#xD;
      (nursing logs, text/email transcripts) will be transcribed, anonymized, and analyzed for&#xD;
      codes, categories and subcategories. The unit of analysis will be the nurse-led session; all&#xD;
      data for each session will be analyzed together to get a sense of what happened, what&#xD;
      influenced what happened, and whether the intervention was successful. Categories will be&#xD;
      given descriptors that use words as close to the data as possible; eventually, categories&#xD;
      will be grouped into main categories. Thematic analysis will be used to define broader&#xD;
      categories of potential influences on intervention effectiveness with the unit of analysis&#xD;
      being the entire set of coded session data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of quantitative analyses will be compared with qualitative results to explore the&#xD;
      extent to which there is agreement. Priority will be given to quantitative data; a nuanced&#xD;
      understanding of what influenced intervention effectiveness will be sought through a process&#xD;
      of integration.&#xD;

Permuted-block randomization with varying block sizes and equal allocation ratio will be used to ensure balanced allocation of patients between the 2 treatment arms. Blocks of sizes 2 and 4 will be randomly mixed to overcome the problem of predicting the allocation for the last few entries in each block. A given cardiologist's patients will be allocated to iHeartChange or the intervention group equally, preventing potential bias by cardiologist co-intervention</intervention_model_description>
