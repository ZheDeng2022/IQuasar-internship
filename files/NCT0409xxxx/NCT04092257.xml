      The purpose of this study is to assess completion and performance of the following novel&#xD;
      invasive cervical cancer (ICC) screen-and-treat algorithm among 625 HIV-positive women in&#xD;
      Lilongwe, Malawi: 1) rapid testing of self-collected vaginal brush for primary high risk&#xD;
      (hr)-human papillomavirus (HPV), 2) same-day visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for&#xD;
      women who are hr-HPV positive, and 3) thermocoagulation for VIA positive/ablation-eligible&#xD;
      (by cervical colposcopy) women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, prospective study of 625 HIV-positive women attending ART clinics in&#xD;
      Lilongwe, Malawi. The primary objectives of this study are to assess completion of a novel&#xD;
      ICC screen-and-treat strategy among HIV-positive women in Lilongwe, Malawi, using&#xD;
      self-collected vaginal brush for hr-HPV testing, followed by same-day VIA and&#xD;
      thermocoagulation for HPV-positive/VIA-positive/ablation-eligible (by colposcopy) women, and&#xD;
      to determine the 24-week efficacy of thermocoagulation among HIV-positive women with CIN2/3.&#xD;
      The secondary objective will be to evaluate the performance of the ICC screen-and-treat&#xD;
      strategy by estimating overtreatment for women who are&#xD;
      HPV-positive/VIA-positive/ablation-eligible, and undertreatment among&#xD;
      HPV-positive/VIA-negative women.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will self-collect a vaginal brush for hr-HPV testing. HPV-positive women and every 10th consecutive HPV-negative woman will complete same-day VIA with colposcopically-directed cervical biopsy and ECC (if lesion seen), and thermocoagulation if ablation-eligible by colposcopy. If no lesion is seen on colposcopy, the woman will have a cervical pap smear and ECC collected, and no thermocoagulation will be performed. Finally, women who are suspicious for cancer at VIA will undergo colposcopically-directed cervical biopsies.</description>

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current or prior history of cervical, vaginal or vulvar cancer or dysplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current symptomatic sexual transmitted infection requiring treatment (women will be&#xD;
             allowed to be in the study upon successful treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior HPV vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants with known allergy to acetic acid.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Participants with other illnesses that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
             or in the opinion of the investigator or designee, have a problem that would make&#xD;
             participation in the study unsafe or complicate interpretation of study findings.&#xD;
