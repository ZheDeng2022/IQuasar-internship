      To assess the performance of the Allegro in the hands of CLIA-Waived Point-of-Care users in&#xD;
      at least three distinct Point-of-Care clinical settings and compare the performance&#xD;
      characteristics to other accepted Point-of-Care methods and central laboratory reference&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the Ease of Use of the Allegro in the hands of the intended CLIA-Waived&#xD;
      Point-of-Care users. CLIA-Waived operators will be provided with all package insert sheets, a&#xD;
      Quick Reference Guide poster and Instructions for Use. No training, coaching, or prompting&#xD;
      will be provided other than clarifying the protocol.&#xD;

      Blood and urine tests are used in the assessment of diabetes and to guide clinical&#xD;
      management. In the traditional model of care, blood samples are taken from patients at the&#xD;
      clinic and are sent to the laboratory for analysis and the results may not be available for a&#xD;
      number of hours/days after the clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new analyser has been developed (Allegro™) which allows the tests to be undertaken at the&#xD;
      clinic, with the results available in a few minutes. This means that patients can get&#xD;
      immediate feedback and that the doctors/nurses can adjust treatment before the patient leaves&#xD;
      the clinic. It is obviously important that this analyzer performs to a similar degree of&#xD;
      accuracy to the laboratory analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research study is to assess the accuracy of the Allegro™ analyzer compared to&#xD;
      laboratory analyses on capillary and venous whole blood samples and urine samples. Three&#xD;
      hundred sixty (360) patients with diabetes will be invited to give a venous blood sample,&#xD;
      finger prick capillary blood sample and urine sample. The venous blood sample, finger prick&#xD;
      capillary blood sample and urine sample will be analysed by both the Allegro™ analyser and&#xD;
      laboratory analyses and the results compared. The Allegro™ results will not be used in the&#xD;
      management of the patients' diabetes.&#xD;
