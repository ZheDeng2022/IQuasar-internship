  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on the ergonomic features of the most common surgical procedures, which&#xD;
      require advanced techniques and relatively difficult operations, such as pancreatobiliary&#xD;
      surgery, prostatectomy, nephrectomy, colon and rectal resection. This study id designed to&#xD;
      verify the clinical safety and effectiveness of 'Revo-i Surgical Robot System (Model&#xD;
      MSR-5100), developed by Mirae Company to overcome the limitations of general laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
