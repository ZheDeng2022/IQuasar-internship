  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pentoxifylline, the novel&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor, as an adjunctive to risperidone in alleviating the negative&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      there is some evidence for the role of phosphodiesterase (PDE) signaling system in&#xD;
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia making this system a potential target for therapeutic&#xD;
      agents. PDEs are a family of enzymes that hydrolyse cyclic nucleotides and thus play a key&#xD;
      role in regulating intracellular levels of the second messenger cyclic adenosine&#xD;
      monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a methylated&#xD;
      xanthine derivative and a PDE inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with intermittent claudication on the basis of chronic occlusive arterial disease of the&#xD;
      limbs. It is known to inhibit platelet aggregation, increase erythrocyte flexibility or&#xD;
      deformability, and reduce blood viscosity. The rationale for its use in schizophrenia is that&#xD;
      it competitively inhibits PDEs, resulting in increased cAMP levels, the activation of protein&#xD;
      kinase A (PKA), the inhibition of IL and TNF-α synthesis, and reduced inflammation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is growing evidence to support the inflammatory hypothesis of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, the investigators will also explore whether cytokine levels mediate the&#xD;
      response from pentoxifylline treatment.&#xD;

    <description>PANSS total score will be used to examine treatment-induced change in psychaopthology. The PANSS is a 30-item rating scale used to assess symptoms of psychopathology. We will use the total PANSS score as the primary outcome measure which reflects total level of psychopathology including the positive and negative symptoms as well as general psychopathology.This measure will be administered at baseline, week 8 and week 16 of the study to assess if pentoxifylline treatment results in a significant reduction in PANSS total score as opposed to placebo.</description>

    <measure>Treatment-induced change in MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Battery (MCCB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 16 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Average total score on MCCB will be used to examine treatment-induced change in cognitive function. MCCB (Nuechterlein et al., 2008) will be admisnitered at the baseline an week 16 of the study. The MCCB assesses 7 domains of cognitive functioning known to be impaired for individuals with schizophrenia. A summary score averaging across domains is generated as a global measure of cognitive functioning.</description>
