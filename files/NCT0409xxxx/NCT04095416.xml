  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There will be two populations in this study: control group, and intervention group. These&#xD;
      groups will undergo propensity matching to account for confounders and minimize selection&#xD;
      bias. 120 patients will be enrolled, 60 to each population. The objective of this study is:&#xD;
      assess the utility of lower extremity compression wraps as adjuvant therapy in inpatient&#xD;
      management of acute systolic heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will consist of patients admitted to I5 Cardiology for management of acute&#xD;
      systolic heart failure with intravenous diuresis and standard medical therapy, meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. Information will be gathered through observational prospective data&#xD;
      analysis from Epic EMR, and will include daily diuretic type and dose required, daily urine&#xD;
      output, daily creatinine, total days of admission, daily and pre-discharge weight, admission&#xD;
      BNP, and pre-discharge BNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will consist of patients admitted to I5 Cardiology meeting inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and being managed with standard medical therapy. This group will receive additional&#xD;
      therapy using bilateral lower extremity compression wraps applied by nursing staff per&#xD;
      pre-set protocol, and will receive education on the use of compression wraps. Patients will&#xD;
      be instructed to wear the compression wraps for the entirety of the time they are undergoing&#xD;
      intravenous diuresis, with pauses in care as needed for hygiene and symptom relief purposes.&#xD;
      During the time of compression wrap application, the following data will be collected: urine&#xD;
      output, daily weights, daily creatinine, daily and total dose and type of intravenous&#xD;
      diuretic used. Prior to discharge, a BNP will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints (including percentage of weight reduction, total urine output achieved with&#xD;
      diuresis, total dose requirement and type of intravenous diuresis, total days of intravenous&#xD;
      diuresis, days to discharge, discharge BNP, and percent reduction from admission BNP) will&#xD;
      then be compared to assess the utility of adding lower extremity compression wraps to&#xD;
      inpatient management of acute systolic heart failure.&#xD;

      There will be two populations in this study: control group, and intervention group. 120&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled, 60 to group, randomized in 1:1 fashion. The control group will&#xD;
      consist of patients admitted to I5 Cardiology for management of acute systolic heart failure&#xD;
      with intravenous diuresis and standard medical therapy, meeting inclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Information will be gathered through observational prospective data analysis from Epic EMR,&#xD;
      and will include daily diuretic type and dose required, daily urine output, daily creatinine,&#xD;
      total days of admission, daily and pre-discharge weight, admission BNP, and pre-discharge&#xD;
      BNP. The intervention group will consist of patients admitted to I5 Cardiology meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and being managed with standard medical therapy. This group will receive&#xD;
      additional therapy using bilateral lower extremity compression wraps applied by nursing staff&#xD;
      per pre-set protocol, and will receive education on the use of compression wraps. Patients&#xD;
      will be instructed to wear the compression wraps for the entirety of the time they are&#xD;
      undergoing intravenous diuresis, with pauses in care as needed for hygiene and symptom relief&#xD;

      collected: urine output, daily weights, daily creatinine, daily and total dose and type of&#xD;
      intravenous diuretic used. Prior to discharge, a BNP will be obtained. Endpoints (including&#xD;
      percentage of weight reduction, total urine output achieved with diuresis, total dose&#xD;
      requirement and type of intravenous diuresis, total days of intravenous diuresis, days to&#xD;
      discharge, discharge BNP, and percent reduction from admission BNP) will then be compared to&#xD;
      assess the utility of adding lower extremity compression wraps to inpatient management of&#xD;
      acute systolic heart failure.&#xD;
