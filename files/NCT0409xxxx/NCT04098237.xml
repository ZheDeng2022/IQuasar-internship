  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess weight stability, functional changes, and quality of&#xD;
      life when Pancreaze (pancrelipase) delayed-release 84,000-lipase units (capsules), for main&#xD;
      meals, and 42,000-lipase units (capsules), for snacks, are added to standard of care in&#xD;
      patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This will&#xD;
      be the first prospective study of this particular formulation in addition to standard of care&#xD;
      in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. We will treat 45 consecutive patients with borderline&#xD;
      resectable, locally advanced and advanced pancreatic cancer patients who present with weight&#xD;
      loss and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with this advanced formulation of Pancreaze.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by patient reported number of bowel movements in the past 24 hours. In this study, higher numbers represent more severe symptoms; a reduction in number of bowel movements in the past 24 hours represents improvement in symptoms.</description>

    <description>As measured by patient reported stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Chart.The Bristol Stool Chart is a diagnostic scale to classify stool into 7 different groups, ranging from Type 1-7 (indicating solid to liquid consistency or time spent longest in the bowel to least time in the bowel). A normal stool should be either Type 3 or Type 4 (middle of the scale). Worsening of stool consistency is denoted by classifications located closer to the extreme ends of the scale (Type 1 or Type 7).</description>
