      The purpose of stage 1 of the study is to find out if blood tests can be used to see how the&#xD;
      cancer is responding to treatment with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard or usual treatment for this disease is pembrolizumab given by needle every three&#xD;
      weeks. This study will be done in two stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of stage 1 of the study is to find out if we can use blood tests to see how the&#xD;
      cancer is responding to treatment with pembrolizumab. A second stage of the study will take&#xD;
      place once stage 1 is completed. In stage 2 blood tests will be used to help determine if&#xD;
      patients whose cancer does not seem to be getting better on treatment with pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      would do better on a different treatment.&#xD;

             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed EGFR and ALK mutation-negative disease. Testing for EGFR and ALK is not&#xD;
             required for patients with squamous histology.&#xD;

             the prior therapy and enrollment. Local therapy, e.g. palliative extra-cranial&#xD;
             radiation, is allowed as long as a period of 2 weeks has passed since completion as&#xD;
             ctDNA levels may be altered by radiotherapy. There is no requirement for delay for&#xD;
             patients who have received brain radiation.&#xD;

             analyses when tumour tissue is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must consent to collection of liquid biopsy (blood) samples for ctDNA&#xD;

             reactions, or known hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or its components. Patients with&#xD;
             pre-existing conditions such as colitis, hepatic impairment, respiratory or endocrine&#xD;
             disorders (such as hypo or hyperthyroidism or diabetes mellitus), can be considered&#xD;

             patients are closely monitored&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder which would impair the&#xD;
             ability to obtain consent or limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
