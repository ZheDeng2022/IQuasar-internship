      Purpose The primary purpose of the current project is to characterize unselected patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery developing post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF), ultimately leading&#xD;
      to a new risk-stratification model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale According to rather scarce existing reports, it is estimated that&#xD;
      10% will develop POAF following abdominal surgery. It remains a challenge for the clinicians&#xD;
      to predict which patients are at risk. POAF can be difficult to diagnose, as symptoms are&#xD;
      often vague. Hence, the diagnosis may remain underreported leaving many patients without&#xD;
      adequate treatment. Untreated atrial fibrillation is associated with increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, especially due to an increased risk of ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Three-hundred adult patients admitted for surgery at the Digestive Disease Center at&#xD;
      Bispebjerg Hospital will be examined by heart rhythm monitoring during hospitalization, i.e.&#xD;
      pre-, peri- and postoperatively in the main SECAFIB-SURG study. Twenty study participants who&#xD;
      develop POAF and 20 without POAF matched with these on sex, age and co-morbidity, will&#xD;
      undergo additional cardiovascular examinations three months after surgery in the current&#xD;
      sub-study. All patients will be followed for at least one year after surgery. The study is&#xD;
      scheduled for completion within two years, commencing in January 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective Creating a POAF risk-stratification model for patients undergoing abdominal&#xD;
      surgery, could ensure timely diagnosis and treatment, hence, preventing complications&#xD;
      associated with POAF.&#xD;

      Background and rationale Post-operative AF (POAF) appears to be common in relation to&#xD;
      abdominal surgery affecting between 8% and 18%, however the incidence is not well reported,1&#xD;
      and the SECAFIB-SURG study aims at reporting this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of risk-stratification models exist in the general population and in cardiac surgery&#xD;
      patients, but it remains challenging to predict which patients will develop POAF in&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery patients.2-5 Diagnosing POAF is important, as recent data from the&#xD;
      Framingham population suggest that secondary AF (AF occurring during a concomitant medical&#xD;
      condition, e.g. surgery) is not a benign condition.6,7 Studies have found an association&#xD;
      between POAF in relation to non-cardiac surgery and increased risk of post-operative&#xD;
      mortality and stroke.8-10 Despite this, the current perception is that POAF is self-limiting&#xD;
      and merely a result of the physiological stresses of surgery, why continuous anti-coagulation&#xD;
      and referral for a cardiologist is not necessarily recommended.11-13 Well-known factors&#xD;
      associated with AF in the general population is age, hypertension, heart failure, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, heart valve disease and diabetes.14 In general surgery important risk factors of&#xD;
      AF is age (age 65-74, OR 2.08; age &gt;85, OR 3.56), hypertension (OR 3.66), heart failure (OR&#xD;
      1.64), thyroid disease (OR 6.29), laparotomy (vs laparoscopy, OR 3.30) and duration of&#xD;
      surgery (&gt; 600 min, OR 1.38).1 The pathophysiology of AF is however incompletely&#xD;
      comprehended.14-16 Structural remodelling of the atria and electrical pathways, oxidative&#xD;
      stress, inflammation, calcium overload, myofibroblast activation and microRNAs are suspected&#xD;
      implicated in AF initiation and progression.14-17 Improved understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of AF and improved diagnostic tools for predicting POAF is needed. In the&#xD;
      current study, blood samples will focus on markers of cardiac surcharge (troponins and&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide)18,19, inflammation20-22 and microRNAs associated with AF.23-25 Urine&#xD;
      samples will focus on oxidative stress markers.22,26,27 Electrocardiogram (ECG) will focus on&#xD;
      short and prolonged p-wave, and p-wave terminal force in lead V1 (PTFV1) which are correlated&#xD;
      with AF.28 Myovista (HeartSciences, Southlake, Texas, USA) a novel type of ECG (wavECG)&#xD;
      utilizing continues wavelet transform signal processing, appears to identify left ventricular&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction (LVDD),29 which is associated with AF in other studies.16,30-32&#xD;
      Finapres Nova (Enschede, The Netherlands) is a continuous blood pressure monitor which will&#xD;
      be used for non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring, e.g. beat-to-beat cardiac output, stroke&#xD;
      volume, cardiac contractility, left ventricular ejection time and total peripheral&#xD;
      resistance.33 Oral glucose tolerance test performed during monitoring with Finapres might&#xD;
      demask peripheral vascular dysfunction.34 Speckle-tracking and strain analysis of the left&#xD;
      atrium (LA) by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is in some studies able improve AF&#xD;
      risk-prediction.35-39 Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) with late gadolinium&#xD;
      enhancement (LGE) has been used to quantify atrial structural remodelling, fibrosis and&#xD;
      function, and has been used to improve prediction of favourable outcome of patients&#xD;
      undergoing ablation for AF.40-43&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The study aims at characterizing patients developing POAF by novel methods to improve&#xD;
      risk stratification of patients undergoing abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Prospective, single-centre, case-control study of patients undergoing abdominal&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a sub-study of SECAFIB-SURG. Study participants will be identified among&#xD;
      those enrolled in the SECAFIB-SURG study (study ID: 68605) who have agreed to be contacted if&#xD;
      they developed POAF or matched on age and gender with someone who did. POAF is defined as&#xD;
      new-onset AF developing from surgery until discharge and diagnosed by specialists in&#xD;
      Cardiology or Anaesthesiology on ECG or heart rhythm monitoring for at least 30 seconds&#xD;
      duration or three recurrent episodes of AF. The Investigator (Department of Cardiology at&#xD;
      Bispebjerg-Frederiksberg Hospital) will ensure signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations LA strain analysis has not been performed in this patient group.&#xD;
      LA strain has predicted recurrence of AF in patients who have undergone radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation.23,24 In one study, patients with recurrent AF had LA strain mean of 18.4% while&#xD;
      those without recurrence had a LA strain mean of 25.5%23. In another study, patients with&#xD;
      recurrent AF had LA strain mean of 9.7% while those without recurrence had a LA strain mean&#xD;
      of 16.2%.24 With 95% power and alpha 0.05, and enrolment ratio 1:1, 5 patients with - and 5&#xD;
      patients without - are required to identify significant difference in LA strain mean between&#xD;
      the two groups. The current population is however expected more heterogenous that those&#xD;
      undergoing radiofrequency ablation and as the study is explorative it will include 20&#xD;
      patients with POAF and 20 matched controls without POAF. Follow-up will remain unchanged from&#xD;
      the main study, i.e. one year from surgery.&#xD;

      A venous blood sample (approximately 30 mL) and a urine sample (approximately 30 mL) will be&#xD;
      collected for a Research biobank. Blood samples will be collected in EDTA- and serum tubes,&#xD;
      respectively, extracting plasma (from the EDTA tube) and serum (from the serum tube). Samples&#xD;
      are subsequently immediately frozen and transported on dry ice to a -80 degree freezer at&#xD;

      the last sample has been collected. Analyses will focus on markers of oxidative stress,&#xD;
