  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left atrial pressure (LAP) is a crucial hemodynamic parameter during cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Elevated LAP leads to pulmonary edema and other cardiopulmonary complications. The pulmonary&#xD;
      capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) measured by a pulmonary arterial catheter (PAC) is the&#xD;
      gold-standard method to estimate LAP. However, the placement of a PAC is an invasive&#xD;
      procedure associated with adverse events. Transesophagial echocardiophy (TEE) is a&#xD;
      non-invasive method to estimate LAP during cardiac surgery. Pulsed Doppler mitral flow,&#xD;
      pulmonary vein flow, tricuspid regurgitation peak flow and left atrial volume are validated&#xD;
      parameters to estimate LAP. Nevertheless, these parameters are not always valid in cardiac&#xD;
      surgery, mainly because of mitral valve pathology or prothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the diameter and collapsibility of inferior vena cava is the recommended method for&#xD;
      non-invasive right atrial pressure assessment in patients under mechanical ventilation, the&#xD;
      investigators made the hypothesis that diameter and collapsibility of the pulmonary veins&#xD;
      could be an additional method to estimate LAP during cardiac surgery. This has never been&#xD;
      investigated in cardiology or cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, pulmonary vein diameter and collapsibility will be correlated to&#xD;
      invasive PCWP to assess LAP perioperatively in 30 patients undergoing cardiac surgery&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of left ventricle filling pressures (LVFP) perioperatively in cardiac surgery&#xD;
      could be challenging. This is particularly relevant after separation from cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass because the hemodynamic state is dynamic, with changes in heart rate, loading&#xD;
      conditions, and deterioration in diastolic function being common. Elevated LVFP leads to&#xD;
      pulmonary edema, arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension and RV failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the LVFP, the gold standard method is the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure&#xD;
      (PCWP) measured by a pulmonary arterial catheter (PAC). However, placement of a PAC is an&#xD;
      invasive procedure associated with adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommandations released by the American Society of Echocardiography for the evaluation of&#xD;
      left ventricular diastolic function pointed out some difficulties concerning the evaluation&#xD;
      of elevated LAP perioperativly in cardiac surgery. The commonly used parameters, such as the&#xD;
      mitral pulsed Doppler flow, could be faulted by mitral valve regurgitation, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, or fast changes in loading conditions. In cardiac surgery, additional&#xD;
      diagnostic methods are needed to diagnose elevated LVFP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the right heart, measurements of the inferior vena cava diameter and collapsibility index&#xD;
      are recommended for the evaluation of the right atrial pressure. Since it has been previously&#xD;
      described that alterations of the pulmonary vein Doppler flow are correlated with elevated&#xD;
      LAP, pulmonary vein diameter dilatation or lack of collapsibility have never been&#xD;
      investigated as a marker of elevated LAP, neither in cardiology nor in cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators made the hypothesis that pulmonary vein diameter increase&#xD;
      when LAP increase (in the absence of confounding factors, such as pulmonary vein stenosis or&#xD;
      mitral regurgitation directed toward the pulmonary vein). In the same way,the investigators&#xD;
      hypothized that cyclic variations of pulmonary vein diameter under mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      decrease when the LAP increase. The ventilation parameters will be standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a prospective study in the Department of cardiothoracic&#xD;
      anesthesiology and critical care medicine, at the Montpellier University Hospital. Patients&#xD;
      scheduled for an elective cardiac surgery and requiring pulmonary arterial catheter&#xD;
      monitoring will be enrolled. The TEE standardized protocol will be performed three times,&#xD;
      before and after cardiopulmonary bypass, and one-hour postoperatively in ICU. The mean PCWP,&#xD;
      the standard method for measuring the LAP, will be recorded simultaneously by the pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial catheter. For patients with atrial fibrillation, measurements will be averaged from&#xD;
      10 consecutive cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to correlate left upper pulmonary vein diameter and collapsibility with&#xD;
      invasive PCWP. We have chosen to analyze the LUPV as the main marker because the LUPV is the&#xD;
      easiest to measure among the four pulmonary veins in our clinical practice. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to explore the correlation between the recommanded LAP echocardiographic&#xD;
      parameters and the PCWP ; and to compare the area under curve (AUC) of all echocardiographic&#xD;
      parameters to define which parameter has the best predictive value to diagnose elevated LAP.&#xD;
      An elevated LAP is defined by a PCWP greater than 18 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol has been approved by the Institutional Rview Board under the number&#xD;
      2019_IRB-MTP_05-21. The IRB waived the need for the investigator to obtain signed consent&#xD;
      forms. We have planned to include 30 patients in this study&#xD;
