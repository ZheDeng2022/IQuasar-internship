  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of fimaporfin-induced photochemical&#xD;
      internalisation (PCI) of gemcitabine complemented by systemic gemcitabine/cisplatin&#xD;
      chemotherapy compared to gemcitabine/cisplatin alone, in patients with inoperable&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment&#xD;
      groups and will receive study treatment for 6 months, followed by assessments every 3 months,&#xD;
      as applicable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an uncommon adenocarcinoma arising from cells lining the bile&#xD;
      ducts. Standard treatment options for CCA include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy,&#xD;
      dependent upon if the CCA is intra- or extra-hepatic. Surgical removal of the tumor is the&#xD;
      only potential cure, and CCA is very resistant to standard pharmaceutical drug treatment,&#xD;
      though chemotherapy has some effect. Current chemotherapy uses cisplatin plus gemcitabine.&#xD;
      Photochemical internalisation (PCI) is a novel technology, where photochemical reactions are&#xD;
      used to enhance the effect of drugs by increasing their ability cross cell membranes to&#xD;
      interact with their intended target. This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      fimaporfin-induced PCI of gemcitabine complemented by systemic gemcitabine/cisplatin&#xD;
      chemotherapy compared to gemcitabine/cisplatin alone, in patients with inoperable CCA.&#xD;

             fractionated platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with creatinine clearance &lt;45&#xD;
