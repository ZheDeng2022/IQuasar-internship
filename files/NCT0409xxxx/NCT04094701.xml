  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT),&#xD;
      investigating the influence of the number of opioid pills prescribed following primary hip&#xD;
      arthroscopy. All patients who sign the consent form will be enrolled in the suited and&#xD;
      randomized to one of the two treatment arms. The intervention group will receive 5 Norco&#xD;
      pills, gabapentin (30 mg, once daily for 10 days following surgery), and Tylenol (1000 mg,&#xD;
      three times daily for 10 days following surgery) while the control will receive the standard&#xD;
      at our practice of 30 Norco pills.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Follow-up will take place at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Variables of interest&#xD;
      will include postoperative patient pain scores (i.e. Visual Analog Scale or VAS), total&#xD;
      morphine equivalents taken in the first 30 days after discharge, number of unused opioid&#xD;
      pills, opioid disposal rates, and standard patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs)&#xD;
      including hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS), Harris Hip score (HHS), VAS&#xD;
      for pain, international hip outcome tool (iHOT-12), and Hip outcome score (HOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of this study, the investigators propose two standardized prescribing&#xD;
      patterns across all teams. The first would be the control postoperative prescribing pattern&#xD;
      and the second would be the experimental opioid reduced prescribing pattern. Patients will&#xD;
      not be informed if their postoperative prescriptions are part of the control or opioid&#xD;
      reduced prescribing pattern. Of note, patients will be allowed to cross over from the opioid&#xD;
      reduced experimental group to the standard of care control group if they have breakthrough&#xD;
      pain following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline of Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Following informed consent during the office visit when surgery is scheduled, all&#xD;
           patients will be randomized to one of the postoperative pain management protocols,&#xD;
           either the control or opioid reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects will proceed with hip arthroscopy, including appropriate treatment and&#xD;
           documentation of concomitant injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Over the course of the 1st month postoperatively, patients will complete a 30-day diary&#xD;
           detailing which medications they took on each day and their daily average pain level&#xD;
           (indicating whether physical therapy was performed). Data pertaining to prescription&#xD;
           refills (I.e., number of refills, time to refill), number of left over pain medications,&#xD;
           and disposal rates of opioid medications will also be recorded at these time points as&#xD;
           well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients will return for standard of care postoperative visits at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
           postoperatively. Patients will be asked to complete PROM questionnaires at the 3, 6, and&#xD;
           12 month follow-up time points&#xD;
