    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate a new method that may influence attention, cravings and&#xD;
      substance use called attention training, which will be delivered on a smartphone through an&#xD;
      application (app). The study team would like to know what participants think of this new&#xD;
      method and to determine if research involving this app is feasible. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will use the app for a period of two weeks and attend a total of 4 appointments at our study&#xD;
      location.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to evaluate a new method that may influence attention, cravings and&#xD;
      substance use called attention training, which will be delivered on a smartphone through an&#xD;
      application (app). The study team would like to know what participants think of this new&#xD;
      method and to determine if research involving this app is feasible. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will use the app for a period of two weeks and attend a total of 4 appointments at our study&#xD;
      location. A primary aim of the study is to assess feasibility, usability and acceptability of&#xD;
      mobile Attention Bias Retraining (ABR) by quantifying adherence (in lab and natural&#xD;
      environment), self-reported ease of use, perceived value and likelihood of future use.&#xD;
      Another primary aim of the study is to determine if ABR reduces attentional bias (AB) for&#xD;
      opioids in those with Opioid Use Disorders (OUD) compared to a control training condition. A&#xD;
      secondary aim of the study is to assess whether ABR reduces opioid craving to a greater&#xD;
      extent than a control training condition based on self-report. Another secondary aim is to&#xD;
      assess whether ABR is associated with less opioid use during the training period than a&#xD;
      control training condition based on self-report and urinalysis. An exploratory aim of the&#xD;
      study is to measure levels of self-reported pain pre- and post- ABR. Another exploratory aim&#xD;
      is to examine the durability of ABR effect on AB/craving/ opioid use at 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested individuals will first complete a in-person screening appointment including a&#xD;
      medical and psychiatric screening and questionnaires covering topics including substance and&#xD;
      alcohol use, cigarette smoking, and sexual behaviors. Eligible participants who enroll in the&#xD;
      study will next complete an orientation appointment when study staff will teach participants&#xD;
      how to use the study app and answer any questions that arise. Participants will then be&#xD;
      randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to one of two conditions. Each condition involves&#xD;
      use of a smartphone app. One smartphone app includes a task that targets attention directed&#xD;
      to substance-related cues while the other app includes a similar task that does not target&#xD;
      attention in this way. Neither the participants nor the staff members will know which&#xD;
      condition the participant has been randomly assigned to. Participants will be informed of the&#xD;
      assigned condition by study staff after the completion of the study. In most prior studies,&#xD;
      attention training has been delivered on a desktop computer in a laboratory setting. Initial&#xD;
      research has shown that attention training can be used in real-world settings using hand-held&#xD;
      devices such as smartphones.&#xD;

    <description>Assess whether attentional bias retraining (ABR) reduces opioid craving to a greater extent than a control training condition based on self-report. Will be examined at each appointment and during the 2-week intervention on the smartphone app. The 14-item Heroin Craving Questionnaire-Short Form (HCQ-SF-14) will be used to measure current heroin/opioid urges at lab appointments, and two questions rated on 6-point Likert scales will be asked after every trial during the smartphone training period about participants current liking and wanting for opioids.</description>

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) will be used to measure levels of self-reported pain pre- and post-intervention. Participants will be asked to report daily pain levels during the 2-week intervention period. Self reported pain with the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-SF: Self-report questionnaire used to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions. There are 9 items asking participant to rate the worst, least, average, and current pain intensity. Participants are also asked to list current treatments and the perceived effectiveness, and asked to rate the degree that pain interferes with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other persons, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a 10-point scale. The researchers will also ask participants to rate current pain levels, if participants have sought any relief from pain, and what was used to relieve the pain.</description>
