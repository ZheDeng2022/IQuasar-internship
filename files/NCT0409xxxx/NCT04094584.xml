  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4, open-label, feasibility study of extended release naltrexone (Vivitrol,&#xD;
      Alkermes Pharmaceutical), case management and tele-addiction medicine services for treatment&#xD;
      of alcohol use disorders in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol use contributes to a large number of emergency department (ED) visits and the rate of&#xD;
      alcohol-related ED visits is increasing. There is evidence that this increase may be driven&#xD;
      by a subset of patients who frequently visit the ED due to an underlying alcohol use disorder&#xD;
      (AUD). The proposed study will assess the feasibility of implementing a multimodal treatment&#xD;
      for AUD in the emergency department for 25 patients with AUD and frequent ED visits related&#xD;
      to alcohol use. The rationale for including each component of the multimodal treatment is&#xD;
      outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy is recommended as the standard of care for alcohol use disorders. Of the four&#xD;
      drugs approved by the FDA for treatment of alcohol use disorder, extended release naltrexone&#xD;
      has been found to be superior at reducing healthcare utilization, increasing detoxification&#xD;
      facility use, and reducing total cost. Fewer than 1 in 4 patients with AUD currently receives&#xD;
      treatment with an FDA approved agent and use of these drugs in EDs is virtually non-existent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to higher rates of alcohol and substance use, patients who frequently visit the&#xD;
      ED often suffer from multiple medical, mental health, and social problems that influence&#xD;
      their health. Providing such patients with case management services has shown promise in&#xD;
      improving health related outcomes while curbing ED utilization and healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited access to substance use and mental health services is a significant barrier to&#xD;
      receiving treatment, and large disparities exist in access to care based on income level.&#xD;
      Telemedicine is the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients via interactive&#xD;
      telecommunication equipment. It has been used effectively to improve access to mental health&#xD;
      care in a variety of patient populations, including in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that this multimodal treatment will reduce ED visits related to&#xD;
      alcohol use. ED utilization in the 12 months before and after initiating treatment will be&#xD;
      compared evaluate treatment efficacy.&#xD;
