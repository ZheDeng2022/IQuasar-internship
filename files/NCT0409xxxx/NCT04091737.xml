  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 pilot study of CSL200 in adult subjects with severe sickle cell disease.&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety of the following: collection&#xD;
      of CD34+ hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells by apheresis after mobilization with&#xD;
      plerixafor, reduced intensity conditioning with melphalan, and administration of CSL200.&#xD;

    <description>Adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.&#xD;
Serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is medically significant.&#xD;
