      This is a voluntary research study to find out which location in the heart a pacemaker wire&#xD;
      is the most efficient for a patient's heart and for battery life. Patients who volunteer and&#xD;
      are eligible for the study will be randomized to receive one of two positions for the wire to&#xD;
      be screwed into, in addition to studying multiple positions in the heart during the pacemaker&#xD;
      insertion. Enrolled patients will be in the study for 1 year. They will also have an&#xD;
      Ultrasound of their heart performed to assess how the pacemaker wire is affecting their&#xD;
      heart. Pacemakers are connected to the heart by wires that are screwed into the heart. The&#xD;
      wires can be connected to the heart in different places, which can affect how well the heart&#xD;
      beats over time. The typical position is at the tip of the heart. This position may cause the&#xD;
      heart to beat inefficiently. Over time, this could lead to weakened heart muscle, irregular&#xD;
      heart rhythm, and more hospitalizations. The heart has special muscle cells and fibers that&#xD;
      carry electrical signals through and around the heart. An alternative spot to place the&#xD;
      pacemaker wire is in an area where these special cells are grouped together (called the HIS&#xD;
      bundle). The pacemaker wire can be connected to the heart at a location which may allow the&#xD;
      heart to beat more efficiently when compared to putting the wire at traditional spots in the&#xD;
      heart (called HIS bundle pacing). However, sometimes connecting the wire into the HIS bundle&#xD;
      may cause the pacemaker battery to wear out faster. Physicians can also connect the pacemaker&#xD;
      wired near the HIS bundle (called Left left Bundle bundle area pacing). The study physicians&#xD;
      hope this will allow the heart to beat more efficiently without causing the battery to wear&#xD;
      out faster. The study physicians would like to study how different wire positions change&#xD;
      heart beat efficiency and how long the pacemaker battery lasts when the wires are placed in&#xD;
      different locations. This study will connect the pacemaker wire at either the HIS Bundle or&#xD;
      the left bundle area pacing, to see how effectively the heart pumps and how much battery is&#xD;
      being used.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label, prospective randomized pilot study to evaluate the&#xD;
      capture threshold of His Bundle versus left bundle area pacing. Secondary analysis will focus&#xD;
      on changes in left ventricular performance and mechanical synchrony. Symptomatic&#xD;
      bradyarrhythmias are effectively treated with cardiac pacemakers.The amount of pacing by the&#xD;
      lead positioned in the bottom chamber of the heart at traditional sites such as the right&#xD;
      ventricular apex have been associated with increased rates of atrial fibrillation, heart&#xD;
      failure, and mortality. Traditional pacing sites result in cardiac electromechanical&#xD;
      dyssynchrony, for which alternate pacing sites to minimize these untoward effects have been&#xD;
      sought. HIS bundle pacing, which utilizes a patient's native conduction, has demonstrated&#xD;
      improved electrical synchrony and left ventricular function when compared to traditional&#xD;
      pacing at the tip of the bottom chamber. Barriers to wide spread application to this&#xD;
      technique include the His bundle anatomic location and its attendant difficulties associated&#xD;
      with implant, as well as higher capture thresholds leading to decreased battery duration of&#xD;
      the pacemaker. An alternative to HIS bundle pacing is placing the lead just past the HIS&#xD;
      bundle area, which is further in the heart, and to actively fixate the lead into the&#xD;
      interventricular septum. This is referred to as Left Bundle Pacing, as it may electrically&#xD;
      capture the left bundle, which would simulate a patient's native conduction. The researchers&#xD;
      will evaluate the two different pacing sites (HIS bundle and Left Bundle area sites) to&#xD;
      determine how effectively the heart pumps with each pacing site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients requiring pacemaker implant will be screened for study eligibility and approached&#xD;
      for informed consent. Baseline assessments including echocardiogram and ECG will be obtained.&#xD;
      A standard of care echo done within 3 months of the procedure will be used as the baseline&#xD;
      echo. Once enrolled, the researchers will randomize patients to one of two arms. One arm will&#xD;
      fixate the ventricular pacemaker lead to the HIS bundle area while the other arm will have&#xD;
      the leads fixed into the left bundle area. The pacemaker wires will be connected in&#xD;
      accordance with randomization group. The day after the procedure, a chest x-ray, EKG and&#xD;
      pacemaker evaluation will be performed. An echocardiogram will be obtained at 3 months post&#xD;
      procedure. At 6 and 12 months post procedure, EKG rhythm strips will be obtained from&#xD;
      patients' standard of care remote pacemaker monitoring systems.&#xD;
