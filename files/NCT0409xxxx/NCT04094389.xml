  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized prospective pre-post test case series was chosen for this study. This case&#xD;
      series will provide feasibility data in preparation for a randomized controlled study of this&#xD;
      topic in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research question for this case series is as follows: Do the three proposed&#xD;
      orthotic wearing schedules provide varying results in the reduction of digital triggering&#xD;
      severity and level of pain experienced by those with trigger finger? The following three&#xD;
      orthotic wearing schedules will be investigated: only during waking hours, only while&#xD;
      sleeping, and continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the feasibility of the study the following questions are posed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What was the length of time required to recruit nine eligible participants for the case&#xD;
      series through the outpatient clinic utilized for this feasibility study? Based upon the rate&#xD;
      of recruitment for the feasibility study, were the initial methods of recruitment adequate or&#xD;
      did additional strategies need to be implemented to recruit a sufficient number of&#xD;
      participants within the desired time frame? Were the orthotics utilized for the study&#xD;
      comfortable to wear and functional for the participants while performing their activities of&#xD;
      daily living? Were the number and type of adverse events including redness, edema, tingling,&#xD;
      or numbness associated with orthotic wear similar across the groups, limited, non-serious,&#xD;
      and did not interfere with orthotic wearing? Did participants wear their orthotics for the&#xD;
      prescribed wearing schedule?&#xD;

      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine participants will be recruited through a convenience sampling of patients as they become&#xD;
      available through referral by physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practioners to the&#xD;
      researcher's clinic for hand therapy, meet the study's eligibility criteria and provide&#xD;
      informed consent to participate in the study. Medical records review will be performed by the&#xD;
      principal investigator who will also be the potential participants' treating therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the onset of the study and as new referral sources become available, until all nine&#xD;
      participants required for the study are enrolled, project flyers will be provided to&#xD;
      referring physicians, physician assistants and nurse practioners for posting in their offices&#xD;
      and providing to interested potential participants as desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants to be included and/or enrolled in this entire study, across all study&#xD;
      locations: 20 Nine participants are needed for data analysis, however, 20 participants have&#xD;
      been indicated for enrollment to cover for anticipated participant withdrawals and those who&#xD;
      are lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age of Subjects: 18 to 85+ Vulnerable participant groups included: None Gender of Subjects:&#xD;
      There are no gender-based enrollment restrictions for this study. Within the limitations&#xD;
      imposed by the population of people with trigger finger, it is intended that there will be an&#xD;
      equal gender distribution of the subjects included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Racial and Ethnic Origin: There are no race or ethnic-based enrollment restrictions for this&#xD;
      study. Within the limitations imposed by the population of the study site, it is intended&#xD;
      that this study will include sufficient enrollment of persons of diverse racial/ethnic&#xD;
      backgrounds to ensure equitable selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the feasibility of the study the following questions are posed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What was the length of time required to recruit nine eligible participants for the case&#xD;
           series through the outpatient clinic utilized for this feasibility study?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Based upon the rate of recruitment for the feasibility study, were the initial methods&#xD;
           of recruitment adequate or did additional strategies need to be implemented to recruit a&#xD;
           sufficient number of participants within the desired time frame?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Were the orthotics utilized for the study comfortable to wear and functional for the&#xD;
           participants while performing their activities of daily living?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Were the number and type of adverse events including redness, edema, tingling, or&#xD;
           numbness associated with orthotic wear similar across the groups, limited, non-serious,&#xD;
           and did not interfere with orthotic wearing?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Did participants wear their orthotics for the prescribed wearing schedule?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures performed exclusively for the purposes of this study are performed in addition&#xD;
      to the standard of care activities that would occur for all patients being provided with hand&#xD;
      therapy for the treatment of a triggering upper extremity digit regardless of their&#xD;
      participation in a study. These standard of care activities include standard clinical&#xD;
      assessments, provision of an orthotic and wearing schedule, provision of a home exercise&#xD;
      program and follow-up therapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial evaluation, consistent with standard of care activities that would occur for&#xD;
      all patients regardless of their participation in a study, demographic data collected on each&#xD;
      participant will include their age, gender, vocation, affected finger(s) and hand(s),&#xD;
      duration of trigger finger symptoms, hand dominance, relevant co-existing diagnoses, and&#xD;
      utilization of anti-inflammatory medications. Also consistent with standard of care&#xD;
      procedures, the participants will be assessed on the outcome measures of severity of digital&#xD;
      triggering and pain level during triggering at the initial evaluation to obtain a baseline&#xD;
      and then reassessed weekly until their time of discharge to permit an assessment of the rate&#xD;
      of recovery across time for each individual as well as for each of the three wearing&#xD;
      schedules. If triggering is not evident (Froimson's [1999] grade I) or if the digit is unable&#xD;
      to be actively unlocked (Froimson's [1999] grade III), the participants pain level during&#xD;
      active composite digital flexion and extension through their full available active range of&#xD;
      motion will be measured as per standard of care procedures. See table 1 for Froimson's (1999)&#xD;
      grading of digital triggering severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial evaluation, if the potential participant meets the study criteria they&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in the study. If the potential participant agrees to&#xD;
      participate in the study, they will then be provided with care that is unique to the study&#xD;
      participants and needs to be performed at the time of the initial evaluation including the&#xD;
      following: signing the consent will occur first, followed by completing the QuickDASH&#xD;
      (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Outcome Measure) being provided with an orthotic&#xD;
      wearing schedule (which may be different if they do not agree to participate in the study), a&#xD;
      home exercise program log and an orthotic wearing log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the participant's questions relevant to the study and necessary to facilitate rational&#xD;
      and thoughtful decision making by the participant will be answered prior to signing the&#xD;
      consent form. Prior to obtaining consent, the prospective participants will be asked if they&#xD;
      sufficiently understand the information provided in order to make an informed decision&#xD;
      regarding whether or not to participate in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only for the purposes of this research study, the QuickDASH will be completed by the&#xD;
      participant during their initial evaluation and then again during their discharge&#xD;
      re-evaluation to permit a pre-intervention to post-intervention assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a standard of care activity that would normally occur for all patients with a triggering&#xD;
      upper extremity digit regardless of their participation in a study, during the initial&#xD;
      evaluation visit the participant will also be provided with a custom fabricated thermoplastic&#xD;
      digital joint blocking orthosis. When the triggering of an index, middle ring or small digit&#xD;
      is able to be immediately relieved by blocking the MCP joint into approximately 15 degrees of&#xD;
      flexion, the participant will be provided with a custom MCP joint blocking orthotic that is&#xD;
      secured to the proximal phalanx of the affected digit, crossing the MCP joint and blocking it&#xD;
      at approximately 15 degrees of flexion and leaving the IP joints free. The number of MCP&#xD;
      joints blocked will be determined by the number of triggering digits (Photos 1 and 4). If&#xD;
      blocking of the affected index, middle, ring or small digit MCP joint does not relieve the&#xD;
      triggering or if the participant is unable to tolerate wearing of the MCP blocking orthotic&#xD;
      and the triggering is able to be relieved with isolated blocking of the PIP joint, the&#xD;
      participant will be provided with a custom PIP joint blocking orthotic with the DIP and MCP&#xD;
      joints left free (Photo 5). When the thumb is triggering and is able to be relieved of&#xD;
      triggering by blocking the MCP joint into approximately 15 degrees of flexion, the&#xD;
      participant will be provided with a custom MCP joint blocking with the IP and 1st&#xD;
      carpometacarpal joint left free (Photo 7). If blocking of the thumb MCP joint alone does not&#xD;
      relieve the triggering, both the MCP and IP joints will be blocked by the orthotic, with a&#xD;
      sufficient amount of IP joint flexion permitted to allow thumb opposition to the index,&#xD;
      middle, ring and small digits (Photo 8). If the participant is unable to tolerate wearing of&#xD;
      the thumb MCP and IP blocking orthotic and triggering of the thumb is able to be relieved&#xD;
      with blocking of the thumb IP joint alone, the participant will be provided with a thumb IP&#xD;
      joint blocking orthotic (Photo 6). Figure 1 provides a flow chart illustrating the protocol&#xD;
      that will be followed for this study to guide the decision-making process for selection of&#xD;
      the most appropriate orthotic for the treatment of index through small finger triggering.&#xD;
      Figure 2 provides a flow chart illustrating the protocol that will be followed for selecting&#xD;
      an orthotic for the treatment of triggering thumbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performed exclusively for research purposes, participants will be assigned at entrance to the&#xD;
      study to either wear the orthotic continuously, only during waking hours, or only while&#xD;
      sleeping. There will be three participants in each of the three groups. The first three&#xD;
      participants will each be assigned to a different group through randomization. The remaining&#xD;
      six participants will be assigned to one of the three groups based upon their Froimson's&#xD;
      (1999) grade. The mean Froimson's (1999) trigger finger severity grade will be calculated for&#xD;
      each group and participant assignments will be made as required to keep these means as equal&#xD;
      as possible. Nine participants are needed for data analysis, however, 20 participants have&#xD;
      been indicated for enrollment to cover for anticipated participant withdrawals and those who&#xD;
      are lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the continuous wear group will be instructed to wear their orthotic&#xD;
      continuously around the clock as tolerated with removal for hygiene and home exercise program&#xD;
      (HEP) performance. Participants in the day-wear group will be instructed to wear their&#xD;
      orthotic during all waking hours as tolerated, with removal for hygiene, HEP performance, but&#xD;
      not at night while sleeping. In the night-wear group, participants will be told to wear their&#xD;
      orthosis only at night. Consistent with standard of care for the treatment of trigger finger&#xD;
      with an orthotic, all nine of the participants will be instructed to wear their orthotic for&#xD;
      at least six weeks, as tolerated, with continuation of orthotic wear up to 10 weeks if their&#xD;
      triggering has not completely abated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a standard of care activity that would normally occur for all patients provided with an&#xD;
      orthotic for the treatment of a triggering upper extremity digit regardless of their&#xD;
      participation in a study, all participants will be educated on how to wear and care for the&#xD;
      orthotic care and to discontinue wear of the orthotic and notify the principle investigator&#xD;
      if they develop any adverse reactions including tingling, numbness, pain, edema or redness at&#xD;
      orthotic wear site that lasts longer than 20 minutes. All participants will be provided with&#xD;
      oral and written orthotic instructions that include their wearing schedule, precautions and&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performed for the purposes this study, to facilitate monitoring and measuring of orthotic&#xD;
      wearing time, reasons for deviation from the wearing instructions and comfort of the&#xD;
      orthotic, the participants will be instructed to keep a daily log of their orthotic donning&#xD;
      and doffing consisting of time, date, reason for removing, comfort with wear, and&#xD;
      functionality of the orthotic while performing their activities of daily living (Tarbhai et&#xD;
      al., 2012; Valdes, 2012). The comfort of the orthotic will be rated on the following 0-3&#xD;
      scale: 0 (comfortable); 1 (uncomfortable with some activities); 2 (uncomfortable with most&#xD;
      activities); 3 (uncomfortable with all activities). Adverse events including pain, redness,&#xD;
      edema, tingling and numbness associated with wearing of the orthotic will be recorded on the&#xD;
      daily log at the participants' earliest opportunity to increase the accuracy of the&#xD;
      recording. Pain associated with wearing of the orthotic will be measured with the use of the&#xD;
      NPRS. The participants functional use of their hand while wearing their orthotic to perform&#xD;
      activities will be measured on a 0-3 scale: 0 (no difficulty); 1 (difficulty with some&#xD;
      activities); 2 (difficulty with most activities); 3 (unable to do any activities while the&#xD;
      orthotic is worn).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to complete the orthotic daily log at the following times:&#xD;
      (a) The daily wear group as well as the continuous wear group will complete the log before&#xD;
      retiring for the days longest sleeping period; (b) the participants wearing the orthotic only&#xD;
      while sleeping will be instructed to fill out the log upon awakening. The orthotic daily log&#xD;
      data will be collected by the investigator at six, eight and ten weeks after the&#xD;
      participants' initial evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with standard of care activities, each participant will be provided with a HEP.&#xD;
      Each HEP will include digital range of motion (ROM) and tendon gliding, including passive&#xD;
      isolated and composite MCP, PIP and DIP flexion and extension, and active hook fist followed&#xD;
      by active composite MCP and IP extension exercises (Colbourn et al., 2008; Evans et al.,&#xD;
      1988; Valdes, 2012). If triggering is experienced during the HEP with the assigned active or&#xD;
      passive ROM exercises, the participant will be instructed to only range the triggering digit&#xD;
      through the active and / or passive non-triggering range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performed for the purposes of this study, to permit an estimation of the participants'&#xD;
      compliance with their prescribed HEP performance schedule, the participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a daily check-box log indicating their performance as most closely resembling one of&#xD;
      the following: (a) as prescribed; (b) yes, but less than prescribed; or (c) not performed.&#xD;
      The participants will be instructed to complete the HEP log before retiring for the days&#xD;
      longest sleeping period. The HEP performance data will be collected by the investigator at&#xD;
      six, eight and ten weeks after the participants' initial evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up therapy sessions, consistent with standard of care activities that would occur for&#xD;
      all patients with a triggering upper extremity digit regardless of their participation in a&#xD;
      study, will include the following: digital tendon gliding, ROM, edema reduction, HEP training&#xD;
      and reinforcement as needed, inspection of the participant's skin for signs of adverse&#xD;
      reaction to wearing of the orthotic, and modification of the orthotic or wearing schedule if&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Frequency, Duration and Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with treatment sessions lasting approximately 45 minutes,&#xD;
      occurring approximately twice per week, and for a duration of approximately 6-10 weeks with&#xD;
      the end point of therapy being dependent upon complete resolution or plateauing of the&#xD;
      participants progress with digital triggering. All study visits are also standard of care in&#xD;
      that no subject in this study will require more visits than they would have required if they&#xD;
      were not enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research procedures will be conducted at the Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center outpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation facility located at 752 Medical Center Court, Suite 303, Chula Vista,&#xD;
      California, 91911.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: Froimson's (1999) grading of digital triggering severity Grade I - Pain associated&#xD;
      with pre-triggering. Tenderness to palpation over the first annular pulley. Reported history&#xD;
      of digital triggering, although not reproducible during clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade II - Digital triggering occurs, although, digit can be unlocked with active extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade III - Digital triggering occurs and passive extension is necessary to unlock the digit,&#xD;
      or active flexion is unable to be performed at the digit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade IV - Digital triggering of the interphalangeal joint is unable to be unlocked with&#xD;
      active or passive movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assist with determining the feasibility of the study, the following data analyses will be&#xD;
      reported through descriptive statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate at which participants become available for the study. The participants' functional&#xD;
      use of their hand and comfort while wearing their orthotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants' percentage compliance with their prescribed wearing schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants' percentage compliance with their HEP performance schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be utilized in this case series to describe the characteristics&#xD;
      of participants' demographics, the adherence to the HEP, examine the data for changes in the&#xD;
      outcome measurements for each of the participants across the 6 - 10 weeks of study, and to&#xD;
      summarize the data to address the studies research question. The participants' pain and&#xD;
      severity of digital triggering measurements, performed weekly across the 10 weeks of the&#xD;
      study, will be calculated and reported for the mean and rate of change at each measurement&#xD;
      period across time for each individual as well as for each of the three wearing schedule&#xD;
      groups. The effect size for each group and between pairs of groups will be calculated for&#xD;
      changes in pain, severity of digital triggering, and changes in physical function as measured&#xD;
      through the QuickDASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator of this study will be responsible for the analytical / statistical&#xD;
      tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection/ Assessment Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Master List: The Master List is a participant data sheet for all nine participants which&#xD;
      permits the correlation of each of the nine participants with their subject ID, medical&#xD;
      record number, and telephone number. The principal investigator will be the only individual&#xD;
      with access to the Master List. The Master List was developed specifically for this study.&#xD;
      The master list will be kept separate from the outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthotic Daily Log: A daily log to be completed by the participant of their orthotic schedule&#xD;
      wearing compliance as well as their comfort level and functional use of their hand while&#xD;
      wearing your orthotic. The Orthotic Daily Log was developed specifically for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Exercise Program (HEP) Daily Log: A daily log completed by the participant of their home&#xD;
      exercise program compliance. The HEP Daily Log was developed specifically for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCTH Project Data Collection Sheet: Participant data collection sheet for all nine&#xD;
      participants, which will be identified only by subject ID#, permits documentation of orthotic&#xD;
      type, gender, age (recorded as &quot;&gt;89&quot; if &gt;90 yo), trigger grade, pain, wearing schedule, and&#xD;
      QuickDash Score. The OCTH Project Data Collection Sheet was developed specifically for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quick Dash: An eleven-item outcome measure survey of the participants symptoms and ability to&#xD;
      perform activities completed by the participant at the time of their initial evaluation and&#xD;
      then again at the time of their discharge from therapy to permit a pre-intervention to&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment. The QuickDash has been validated and is commonly used for&#xD;
      research purposes (Beaton et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Resources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participant data collected will be performed by the principal investigator who will also&#xD;
      be the treating therapist providing direct patient care for the participants of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of Sharp HealthCare electronic and paper medical records, physician office records,&#xD;
      laboratory test results, diagnostic test results, radiographic imaging studies including&#xD;
      radiology reports and radiographic images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from the principal investigators patient population as they become&#xD;
      available through referral for therapy and will be contacted while in the outpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation clinic at Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center where the research study will be&#xD;
      conducted and the participants will be attending therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medical records review will be performed by the investigator who will also be the potential&#xD;
      participants treating therapist. A Waiver of Authorization will be requested as the&#xD;
      investigator will need to review the medical records prior to meeting the potential&#xD;
      participants in order to determine if basic eligibility criteria are met. The medical records&#xD;
      review will include Sharp HealthCare paper and electronic medical records, and physician&#xD;
      office records. Data collected will include the names for the subjects, elements of dates&#xD;
      directly related to the subject, medical record numbers, and the subject's medical&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial evaluation and follow-up treatment sessions information will be obtained&#xD;
      from the subject to evaluate, assess, treat and monitor the progress of their triggering&#xD;
      finger(s). The subject will be evaluated and treated in an open gym area where other patients&#xD;
      will be receiving therapy, or the subject may be provided with treatment in a private room if&#xD;
      preferred by the subject. Only the subject's upper extremities need to be exposed for the&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment of their triggering finger(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality of Data and Storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be provided with a coded, sequentially numbered subject ID to maintain the&#xD;
      confidentiality of identifiable subject information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects' identity will be kept on a Master List and will remain separate from their&#xD;
      data. The Master List will be maintained by John Avery who is the principal investigator. The&#xD;
      master list will remain physically locked in a secure metal cabinet located at the research&#xD;
      site that only the principal investigator, who will also be the treating therapist, will have&#xD;
      access to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study, all of the participants' identifiers will be destroyed which is&#xD;
      anticipated to be 06/01/2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be identified on research-related forms as follows: Master List: Subject ID,&#xD;
      Name, MRN; HEP and Orthotic Daily Log: Subject ID only; OCTH Project Data Collection Sheet:&#xD;
      Subject ID, Gender, Age (&quot;&gt;89&quot; if &gt;90 yo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject's names, social security number, medical record number, Sharp financial&#xD;
      identification number (FIN), and any identifier (other than subjects' study identification&#xD;
      number) will not be sent off site. This data will not be used for any other purpose, other&#xD;
      than that for which the subjects will be consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to Individual Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to the subjects as a direct result of participating in the study include a more&#xD;
      intensive monitoring of their progress and compliance with their orthotic wear and home&#xD;

      Potential Benefits (Value) to Society:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This case series will provide feasibility data in preparation for a randomized controlled&#xD;
      study of this topic in the future. Practitioners can use the information obtained through&#xD;
      this case series as a platform for further inquiry regarding the efficacy of various wearing&#xD;
      schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Category: Minimal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All risks to the participants are no greater than what would be expected clinically for&#xD;
      participants not participating in the study, except for a slightly increased risk of loss of&#xD;
      confidentiality due to increased assessment associated with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risk includes one or more of the subjects developing a pressure wound or discomfort&#xD;
      from wearing of the custom fabricated thermoplastic orthotic on their hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of developing a pressure wound or discomfort is associated with pressure and shear&#xD;
      of the orthotic against the participant's tissue and the risk increases as the amount of&#xD;
      pressure, shear and time under pressure increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject's risk for developing discomfort or a pressure wound may increase if the subject&#xD;
      forcefully and / or repetitively flexes their digit while wearing an orthotic on it such as&#xD;
      during a waking activity or while sleeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential for a subject to experience a pressure wound or discomfort secondary to wearing&#xD;
      of their digital orthotic may be greater with continuous wear relative to wearing only while&#xD;
      awake or while sleeping due to the increased total amount of time the orthotic is donned.&#xD;
      However, a subject's individual risk level will vary depending upon the activity the subject&#xD;
      engages in and the duration and force applied through their digit against the thermoplastic&#xD;
      orthotic during the activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated probability of one or more of the subjects developing a pressure wound is low,&#xD;
      and the estimated potential for reversibility is typically high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protection Against Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential for the risk of any of the subjects experiencing a pressure wound will be&#xD;
      minimized by each orthotic being carefully custom designed to fit the individual subjects,&#xD;
      carefully monitoring the subjects for any complications related to orthotic wear, and&#xD;
      educating the subjects on how to wear and care for the orthotic care and to discontinue wear&#xD;
      of the orthotic if they develop any adverse reactions including tingling, numbness, pain,&#xD;
      edema or redness at orthotic wear site that lasts longer than 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The orthotics to be issued to the subjects who elect to be in the study are standard of care&#xD;
      for the treatment of trigger finger and will be fabricated only by the principle&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The orthotics will be fabricated and issued within the hand clinic treatment area during a&#xD;
      subject's treatment appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The orthotics are fabricated from a flat piece of thermoplastic which is stored in an&#xD;
      unlocked cabinet within the hand therapy treatment area of an open outpatient rehabilitation&#xD;
      gym.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fabricated orthotics for a participant will not be stored within the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The custom orthotic is not a significant risk device, because all of the following are true:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The orthotic is NOT intended as an implant that presents a potential for serious risk to the&#xD;
      health, safety, or welfare of a subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The orthotic is NOT purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining&#xD;
      human life that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The orthotic is NOT for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or&#xD;
      treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health that presents a&#xD;
      potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The orthotic is does NOT otherwise present a potential for serious risk to the health,&#xD;
      safety, or welfare of a subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The orthitic is not a banned medical device. The custom fabricated thermoplastic digital&#xD;
      orthotic that will be fabricated and issued by the principle investigator of this study to&#xD;
      participants with trigger finger is a standard of care for the treatment of trigger finger&#xD;
      and has not been banned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The custom orthotic that will be issued to the participants will be worn externally on the&#xD;
      triggering digit(s) and are not purported or represented to be for use in supporting or&#xD;
      sustaining human life that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or&#xD;
      welfare of a subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I do not believe that trigger finger, in and of itself, presents a potential for serious risk&#xD;
      to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I do not believe that use of the custom thermoplastic orthotic to be issued by the principle&#xD;
      investigator this study to the subjects of this study subjects presents a serious risk to&#xD;
      their health, safety or welfare.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <description>NPRS will be used to measure participant pain levels. The NPRS utilized ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst pain imaginable (Young, Cleland, Michener, &amp; Brown, 2010). The NRPS has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of pain (Ferreira-Valente, Pais-Ribeiro &amp; Jensen, 2011; Jensen, Karoly &amp; Braver, 1986; Young et al., 2010).</description>

QuickDASH is scored in two components: the disability/symptom section (11 items, scored 1-5) and the optional high-performance sport/music or work modules (4 items, scored 1-5).&#xD;
Disability/Symptom section: Assigned values for all completed responses are summed and averaged, producing a score out of five. This value is then transformed to a score out of 100 by subtracting one and multiplying by 25. A higher score indicates greater disability. = sum of n responses - 1 x 25, n where n is equal to the number of completed responses.&#xD;
Optional modules: For each module add up the assigned values for each response and divide by four; subtract one and multiply by 25 to obtain a score out of 100.</description>
