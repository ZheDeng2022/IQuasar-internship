  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-masked, randomized-controlled, dispensing clinical trial. A total of&#xD;
      approximately 40 eligible hyperopic and myopic subjects will be targeted to complete the&#xD;
      study. The subjects will be fit in the first study lens and worn for a total of 8-12 days&#xD;
      following a 7±3 day wash-out period. The procedures will be repeated for the 2nd lens.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Lens Centration</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Lens centration was assessed using a biomicroscope and was graded using the scale (Grade: 0, 1,2) with grade 0 represent Centered, Grade 1 = Slightly Decentered and Grade 2= substantially decentered. The data was then dichotomized into two groups: those with grade 1 or higher and those with grade 0 (centered). The percentage of participants with Grade 0 Lens centration was reported.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Lens Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Lens movement in primary gaze was assessed using a biomicroscope and was graded using the scale (Insufficient/Unacceptable (-2), Minimal/Acceptable (-1), Optimal (0), Moderate/Acceptable (+1) and Excessive/Unacceptable (+2)) with Optimal (0) representing no lens movement. The data was then dichotomized into two groups: those with Optimal Lens movement and otherwise (-2, -1, +1 and +2). The percentage of participants with Optimal Lens movement was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Handling Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Overall handling was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, aged 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120.</description>

        <description>Overall handling was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, aged 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120.</description>
