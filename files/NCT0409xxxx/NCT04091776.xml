      Recently, epidemiological studies had shown an increase in hip fractures with aging of the&#xD;
      population. Osteoporosis had been defined by a mean of -2.5 SD upon DEXA scan, which is not a&#xD;
      practical tool to use in patients with recent hip fractures until management of such&#xD;
      fractures either with fixation or replacement. Also it have been found that assessment of&#xD;
      osteoporosis using the Singh index is not a reliable method for osteoporosis diagnosis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis may affect the decision making for dealing with per-trochanteric fractures as&#xD;
      some surgeons prefer to do hip replacement for fear of fixation failure, while others still&#xD;
      convinced that fixation with good reduction and appropriate placement of lag screw within a&#xD;
      TAD less than 25mm is the best even with unstable types specially after the progress in&#xD;
      proximal femoral nails .&#xD;

      CT scan can be used for osteoporosis measurement. Even it can detect stress fractures that&#xD;
      are not diagnosed using DEXA scan. It can be used to assess BMD in specific regions like&#xD;
      spine or hip in a quantitative manner that can be compared to the T score used with DEXA scan&#xD;
      . Again It can assess the presence of comminution in the anterior and posterior cortices that&#xD;
      might not be easy with x-rays. The thickness of the lateral wall can be better measured&#xD;
      through CT scan which is a critical measure while deciding to fix trochanteric fractures&#xD;
      using whether DHS or PFN .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective clinical cohort study is to assess the sensitivity of CT scan&#xD;
      for localized osteoporosis detection that can be used in patients with hip fracture and&#xD;
      detection of comminution and thin trochanteric lateral wall that might not be accessible with&#xD;
      x-rays. And whether these independent factors could predict the fixation failure iagnosed&#xD;
