  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lack of adequate nutrition is the single biggest contributor to child mortality. Malawi is&#xD;
      amongst the countries most affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In global feeding programmes several variations of fortified blended foods are used and&#xD;
      imported into the country of need as supplementary foods. However, the accessibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of supplementary feeding is variable and can be a limiting factor for success in&#xD;
      preventing and treating malnutrition. Therefore, in countries with widespread hunger, an&#xD;
      increasing demand exists for innovative strategies offering alternative solutions for&#xD;
      year-round access to commonly consumed home-grown products with good nutritional value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moringa Oleifera - described as 'a nutritional and medicinal cornucopia' is common throughout&#xD;
      in Malawi. Moringa leaves can be repeatedly cropped and are rich source of nutrients and&#xD;
      non-nutrient bioactive compounds. These nutritional characteristics give Moringa the&#xD;
      potential to significantly contribute in Malawi's battle against malnutrition and mineral&#xD;
      element deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare Moringa as a substitute in specially formulated&#xD;
      supplementary foods in order to evaluate the in vivo bioavailability of key nutrients and&#xD;
      bioactives and biological activities of the plant. This would assess the potential for&#xD;
      establishing Moringa oleifera as an economically viable crop which could contribute towards&#xD;
      establishing a resilient food supply chain in Malawi that will deliver essential nutrients&#xD;
      across the population.&#xD;

      Lack of adequate nutrition remains the world's most prevalent health problem and the single&#xD;
      biggest contributor to child mortality. It is a direct or indirect cause of 43% deaths&#xD;
      worldwide among children under 5 years of age. The two separate forms of malnutrition -&#xD;
      wasting (a deficit in weight relative to length) and stunting (a deficit in length relative&#xD;
      to age) are closely related and often occur together in the same children, leading to an&#xD;
      increased risk of mortality. Although the prevalence of stunting is decreasing worldwide,&#xD;
      Africa faces a rise in the absolute number of stunted children. Malawi is amongst the&#xD;
      countries most affected in sub-Saharan Africa with 42% of the children being stunted and 4%&#xD;
      wasted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maize is the principal food crop and dietary staple in many parts of the developing world&#xD;
      including Malawi. This reliance on maize and the lack of dietary diversity is a significant&#xD;
      contributing factor to micronutrient deficiencies (present in over 30 percent of the&#xD;
      population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementary feeding by provision of extra nutrient-dense food beyond the home diet is an&#xD;
      intervention aimed at improving the nutritional status or preventing the nutritional&#xD;
      deterioration of the target population. Multiple socioeconomic and cultural factors play a&#xD;
      role in determining the type and content of supplementary foods provided in different&#xD;
      countries. The acceptability and efficacy of the nutrition support is variable (depending on&#xD;
      sensory perception of the food, price, convenience of preparation, etc.) and can be a&#xD;
      limiting factor for success in preventing and treating moderate and severe acute&#xD;
      malnutrition. In this context there is an increasing demand for innovative strategies&#xD;
      offering alternative solutions for year-round access to commonly consumed home-grown products&#xD;
      with good nutritional value in countries with widespread hunger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moringa Oleifera - widely regarded as the 'miracle tree' has been described as 'a nutritional&#xD;
      and medicinal cornucopia'. The Moringa plant is native to Northern India but has become&#xD;
      naturalized in Malawi where it is common throughout. All parts of the plant are usable for&#xD;
      different purposes, but for human and animal nutrition the leaves are the most widely&#xD;
      utilised. Moringa leaves can be repeatedly and sustainably cropped and are rich in macro- and&#xD;
      micronutrients, as well as bioactive compounds. These nutritional characteristics give&#xD;
      Moringa the potential to significantly contribute in Malawi's battle against protein-energy&#xD;
      malnutrition and mineral element deficiencies, providing home-grown feed and food products to&#xD;
      replace/partly replace, with economic advantage, imported nutrient premixes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research devoted to nutritional characterisation of Moringa oleifera shows that it is a rich&#xD;
      source of affordable, readily available, essential nutrients and phytoconstituents. The&#xD;
      Moringa foliage is a good source of minerals, carotenoids and tocopherols, polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids, ascorbic acid, folate and phenolics. Studies in animal models report&#xD;
      significantly higher bioavailability for iron from Moringa foliage when compared to ferric&#xD;
      citrate. Additionally, some major forms of folates were found to be highly bioavailable&#xD;
      compared to other folate-rich foods, such as green leafy vegetables. However, different&#xD;
      factors such as environmental, genetic, postharvest handling, stage of leaf development -&#xD;
      significantly influence nutrient contents of Moringa leaves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In human studies conducted with Moringa Oleifera to date, no adverse effects are reported and&#xD;
      in many parts of the world its use as a food fortificant is on the increase. However,&#xD;
      although many studies report improvement in the nutritional value of foods fortified with&#xD;
      Moringa Oleifera, none of them show the digestibility (in-vivo or in-vitro) and nutrient&#xD;
      bioavailability and high-quality research on its proposed nutritional and health benefits is&#xD;
      currently scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several variations (continuously refined to better meet the nutritional needs of&#xD;
      beneficiaries) of currently endorsed fortified blended foods (FBF) used in global feeding&#xD;
      programmes and imported into the country of need. Corn Soya Blend (CSB) fortified with a&#xD;
      vitamin and mineral premix (SUPER CEREAL) is one such combination provided by the World Food&#xD;
      Programme (WFP). The premix formula used may meet the minimum international standards, but is&#xD;
      manufactured using inorganic compounds, which may not be fully bioavailable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge no human intervention trials have attempted to compare&#xD;
      Moringa as modification substitute in specially formulated supplementary foods in order to&#xD;
      evaluate in vivo bioavailability of key nutrients and bioactives and biological activities of&#xD;
      the plant. This would give the potential for development for alternative formulations for&#xD;
      locally produced supplementary foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study the investigators aim to assess the nutritional composition of&#xD;
      Moringa leaves (grown in three different sites in Malawi) in terms of macro-, micro- and&#xD;
      non-nutrient composition. The sample with the most favourable profile will be used in a&#xD;
      subsequent human intervention study. With this randomised, controlled, crossover-design study&#xD;
      the investigators aim to evaluate the bioavailability potential of Moringa oleifera in terms&#xD;
      of key nutrients and bioactives when compared with the current nutrient supplement SUPER&#xD;
      CEREAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This human study is part of a wider collaborative study &quot;MORINGA; delivering nutrition and&#xD;
      economic value to the people of Malawi&quot;, investigating the possibility of establishing&#xD;
      Moringa oleifera as an economically viable crop which will contribute towards launching a&#xD;
      resilient food supply chain in Malawi that will deliver essential nutrients across the&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientifically proven nutritive benefits of locally grown in Malawi Moringa oleifera could&#xD;
      help to replace currently imported nutrients and products and develop sustainable production&#xD;
      of a high-protein, micronutrient rich crop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two types of diets will be prepared:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control meal: Corn Soya Blend Test meal: Corn Moringa Blend&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an acute intervention, these two test meals will allow us to evaluate the bioavailability&#xD;
      of key nutrients and bioactives provided by Corn Moringa Blend when compared with Corn Soya&#xD;
      Blend fortified with by an addition of a Micronutrient Premix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a cross-over fashion subjects will be randomly allocated to consume the Corn Moringa Blend&#xD;
      or the Corn Soya/Micronutrient Premix Blend test meal. The volunteers will be invited to&#xD;
      return to the Human Nutrition Unit (HNU) of the Rowett Institute for two intervention&#xD;
      sessions. Both intervention sessions will be identical in all aspects except for the&#xD;
      composition of the experimental meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the duration of the intervention session (over 24 hour period), the volunteers will be&#xD;
      asked to continue the low phytochemical diet and only consume water for the first five hours&#xD;
      following consumption of the test meal. Each treatment session will be followed by at least&#xD;
      one week wash-out period before crossing over to the second treatment.&#xD;
