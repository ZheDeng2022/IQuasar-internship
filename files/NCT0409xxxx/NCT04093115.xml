  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CX1106 is a novel inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) developed as a potential antitumor&#xD;
      agent by virtue of the rate limiting role of TS in the biosynthesis of thymidine. CX1106&#xD;
      differs from other TS inhibitors such as pemetrexed, raltitrexed, CB3717, and fluorouracil in&#xD;
      that it does not require active transport for uptake into cells. CX1106 also lacks a&#xD;
      glutamate moiety and thus does not require polyglutamation for antitumor activity. More than&#xD;
      1000 patients with various malignancies have been treated with CX1106 to date in previous&#xD;
      various clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suggest a study of CX1106 in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC&#xD;
      who are resistant or ineligible/intolerant to platinum-based chemotherapy. The aim of current&#xD;
      trial is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and safety profile of CX1106.&#xD;
