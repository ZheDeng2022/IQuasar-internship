    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status developed by EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. EQ-5D is designed for self-completion by respondents and it takes only a few minutes to complete. Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire. EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 pages - descriptive system and the EQ visual Analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the respondents self rated health on a 20 cm vertical , visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot; the worst health you can imagine&quot;</description>
