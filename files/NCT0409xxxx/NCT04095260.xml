    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to complete a neuromuscular performance assessment of high&#xD;
      school athletes who are participating in school based pre-season strength and performance&#xD;
      training program. The performance assessment will screen for existing muscle imbalances and&#xD;
      strength deficits known to increase risk for sports injury, and provide a baseline&#xD;
      performance measurement. Athletes will be measured before the start of the program and then&#xD;
      again at the end of the pre-season training period to measure changes in motor coordination,&#xD;
      muscle strength, and performance and injury risk category. Internal and external training&#xD;
      load will be measured weekly during the training program to track intensity of the training&#xD;
      program. In addition to the pre and post measurements, sports injury occurrence and time away&#xD;
      from sports participation will be tracked throughout the sport season/school year to evaluate&#xD;
      training program outcomes and accuracy of risk assessment.&#xD;

      This study involves a test - re-test design. Subjects will be tested in their physical&#xD;
      performance. These measures include a general assessment of joint mobility, muscle strength,&#xD;
      motor coordination, and performance assessment utilizing functional movement screens. The&#xD;
      physical examination is similar to a physical examination performed clinically in sports&#xD;
      performance testing and also in the practice of Physical Therapy. The initial baseline&#xD;
      measure will provide objective scores that can be utilized to assess for change over time.&#xD;
      Additional information to be gathered includes demographic information on the subject&#xD;
      including age, previous injury history, and level of exposure to physical performance&#xD;
      training. These variables are associated with injury risk and also impact the potential for&#xD;
      change with physical performance training. In addition, information on mental factors&#xD;
      including stress, fear of failure, and burnout will be collected. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      these variables also factor into athletic performance. It is not known how these variables&#xD;
      impact injury risk. Information on training load will be gathered weekly during the training&#xD;
      period. Training load has a direct impact on muscle performance, and is hypothesized to&#xD;
      impact injury risk. The subjects will be re-tested at the end of the training period to&#xD;
      measure changes in physical performance and injury risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: High school athletes, ages 14 to 18, who are participating in an organized&#xD;
      sports training program. The target subject enrollment is 250 high school athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria will be athletes who have completed a pre-participation sports physical,&#xD;
      are enrolled in a sports elective or a member of a sports team, and have volunteered to&#xD;
      participate in the study providing both verbal and written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for participation include athletes who have not submitted a&#xD;
      pre-participation sports physical to the high school training staff, student athletes who are&#xD;
      currently suffering from an acute neuromusculoskeletal injury with restrictions on athletic&#xD;
      participation, an athlete who has undergone surgery within a 3 month period of the program&#xD;
      start date, an athlete who presents with a cardiovascular condition that would exclude&#xD;
      exercise participation (systolic BP &gt; 180, diastolic BP &gt; 100), or athletes who are currently&#xD;
      pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a self-report questionnaire collecting demographic data including&#xD;
      age, gender, primary and secondary sport activity, and previous injury history. Participants&#xD;
      will also complete the Perceived Stress Scale to measure self-appraised stress, the Sports&#xD;
      Mental Training Questionnaire to measure mental preparation skills, and the Athlete Burnout&#xD;
      Questionnaire to assess emotional/physical exhaustion at the beginning and end of the 8 week&#xD;
      program to assess psychological stressors associated with sport participation that may impact&#xD;
      motivation to participate and perceived internal training load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The structured physical performance assessment will include functional movement testing,&#xD;
      motor coordination testing, joint mobility screen, muscle strength testing, and agility&#xD;
      performance testing. Video analysis will be included with the functional movement testing&#xD;
      utilizing software to assess reliability of the neuromuscular impairment screen.&#xD;
