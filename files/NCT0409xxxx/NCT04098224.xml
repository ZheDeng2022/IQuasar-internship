  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The smART+ is a comprehensive modular patient care system intended for ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the study is the optimization of the delivery of nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the smART+ Feeding tube includes a feature of facilitating correct tube placement&#xD;
      and alerting when the tube is displaced during ongoing use. The system will automatically&#xD;
      stop feeding if displacement is detected. If a massive reflux episode is detected by the&#xD;
      system, a balloon located on the tube will automatically inflate and automatic GRV feature&#xD;
      will open to prevent gastric content from regurgitating to the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to tube placement, the system allows to obtain REE (Resting Energy Expenditure)&#xD;
      measurements and calculates the optimized nutritional values required by the patient.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the system optimizes feeding by compensating for any lost feeding time or&#xD;
      discarded nutritional content that was discarded via the GRV (Gastric Residual Volume).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomly assigned to a study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A- ICU patients receiving the investigational device (&quot;Treated&quot;). Group B- Control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
