  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore whether the use of a medication, Ketamine, can help patients who come&#xD;
      to the ER with thoughts of suicide by improving their mood and reducing thoughts of suicide.&#xD;
      Ketamine has been used for this purpose in patients who have been hospitalized, but it has&#xD;
      not been well studied in the ER. The investigators are first trying to show that patients and&#xD;
      doctors in the ER find the treatment acceptable. The investigators also hope to determine&#xD;
      whether Ketamine is effective in decreasing the severity of patient's suicidal thinking while&#xD;
      in the ER. If this treatment works, future studies will look at whether it can help patients&#xD;
      be discharged from the hospital earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures: Patients will be enrolled into the study on a voluntary basis after the&#xD;
      research assistant has fully explained all the risks and benefits of the study (informed&#xD;
      consent). Research assistants, Emergency Department staff, and the Psychiatry team will help&#xD;
      identify patients for the study. Patients will be asked to complete surveys measuring the&#xD;
      degree of their suicidal thinking and mood. Additional information will be collected on&#xD;
      patients such as their demographics, current medications, and medical problems. Patients in&#xD;
      the study will receive the medication, Ketamine, which will be given through an intravenous&#xD;
      catheter (IV) at a dose based on the patient's weight and slowly infused over 40 minutes.&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored during their stay in the Emergency Department by Emergency&#xD;
      Department physicians and nurses for any signs of side effects to the medication. Patients&#xD;
      will be asked to complete several surveys at specific time periods after the administration&#xD;
      of Ketamine. All patients in the study will receive usual psychiatric care in addition to the&#xD;
      study medication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mood disorders complicated by suicidal ideation (SI) are common among patients presenting to&#xD;
      the Emergency Department (ED). Under current standard practice, patients awaiting psychiatric&#xD;
      evaluation in the emergency department do not typically receive interventions to address&#xD;
      their mood disorder or SI. With no end to the extended ED boarding of psychiatric patients in&#xD;
      sight, improvements in the acute treatment of SI with ketamine may help more patients receive&#xD;
      prompt and appropriate treatment. Low-dose ketamine has been well studied in psychiatric&#xD;
      literature. Studies involving a single dose of ketamine are promising, demonstrating both&#xD;
      immediate and sustained reductions in suicidal ideations. Low dose ketamine has been&#xD;
      well-studied in the ED for pain, asthma, and agitation, but not mood disorders or SI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine whether or not it is feasible to administer low dose ketamine in&#xD;
      the emergency department for the management of mood disorders with SI. Feasibility of&#xD;
      ketamine administration in the ED and will be determined by: (1) ability to recruit&#xD;
      participants, (2) tolerability of the intervention, and (3) acceptability by&#xD;
      patients/providers. The investigators will also explore whether the administration of&#xD;
      ketamine results in improvements in mood and SI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective open label feasibility pilot study will enroll 20 participants to receive&#xD;
      ketamine at 0.5mg/kg infused intravenously over 40 minutes. Patients that have active&#xD;
      suicidal ideation as determined by psychiatry staff who are being admitted to psychiatry&#xD;
      under voluntary certification will be eligible for the study. The investigators will assess&#xD;
      self-reported mood and suicidal ideations pre- and post-infusion of ketamine. Participants&#xD;
      will complete assessments at baseline (pre-infusion), 2 hours and 6 hours post-infusion, and&#xD;
      daily while in the ED until inpatient disposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize ketamine administration will be feasible in the emergency&#xD;
      department and will result in improved mood and decreased SI.&#xD;
