  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UK has the second highest tuberculosis (TB) incidence in Western Europe. Most active&#xD;
      cases occur in migrants due to reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired abroad.&#xD;
      Screening migrants for LTBI was recently introduced by Public Health England to reduce TB&#xD;
      rates and transmission of infectious cases. Newham, which has one of the highest TB rates in&#xD;
      London introduced the first large-scale LTBI screening programme for migrants, but it is&#xD;
      poorly accessed by pregnant women and screening uptake is low. The issue of how best to&#xD;
      screen for TB during pregnancy is important because pregnant/ postpartum women are at&#xD;
      particularly high risk of developing TB, and migrants from countries with high TB rates may&#xD;
      only interact with healthcare services during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective strategies are urgently needed to improve screening uptake for LTBI in pregnant&#xD;
      migrants. The Antenatal clinic is an attractive location to screen for LTBI because uptake&#xD;
      and acceptability of opt-out screening for other infectious diseases (HIV) is high. We will&#xD;
      evaluate the uptake, effectiveness and acceptability of routine screening for LTBI in&#xD;
      antenatal clinics. Eligible patients are pregnant women who have entered the UK within 10&#xD;
      years from a country with TB rates of &gt;150/100,000. Screening will involve a blood test,&#xD;
      taken with other routine antenatal blood tests. We expect that in this setting, screening&#xD;
      will be acceptable and uptake will be high. Our main outcome will be to assess the uptake of&#xD;
      screening in at least 200 women. Acceptability of screening and understanding barriers of&#xD;
      healthcare professionals to test for LTBI are secondary aims. The study will provide&#xD;
      important information about a new setting in which to screen pregnant migrants for LTBI and&#xD;
      barriers to starting treatment postpartum, which will inform the definitive trial to guide&#xD;
      national policy on LTBI screening in antenatal care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The UK has the second-highest TB incidence in Western Europe. Most active TB cases occur in&#xD;
      the non-UK born population (migrants) in large cities such as London. Migrants most at risk&#xD;
      of TB are from countries with a high TB incidence such as the Indian subcontinent and&#xD;
      Sub-Saharan Africa. One quarter of the whole world population are estimated to have LTBI.&#xD;
      Migrants who have acquired LTBI outside the UK, often reactivate in the first 5-10 years&#xD;
      after arrival. Barts Health NHS trust has one of the highest number of TB notifications in&#xD;
      England and manages 8% of active TB cases in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many countries in SE Asia and Africa, which have the highest global TB burden, also have high&#xD;
      maternal mortality rates. In women of reproductive age (15-45 years), TB is now among the&#xD;
      three leading causes of death. In 2014, an estimated 480,000 women died as a result of TB&#xD;
      globally. TB diagnosis in pregnancy is often delayed even in low-incidence countries.&#xD;
      Pregnancy can mask the clinical manifestations of TB, as some of the symptoms of TB such as&#xD;
      fatigue and loss of appetite are also common in pregnancy itself. There is a high risk of&#xD;
      LTBI reactivation during pregnancy and postpartum likely due to T-cell suppression and&#xD;
      reduced interferon-gamma production.There is an elevated risk of TB during pregnancy and&#xD;
      immediately postpartum compared to the general population. TB in pregnancy carries a high&#xD;
      risk of perinatal complications, poor foetal and maternal outcomes and early diagnosis of TB&#xD;
      is important to prevent significant maternal and perinatal complications. A simple clinical&#xD;
      algorithm recommended by the WHO based on absence of current cough, fever, weight loss, and&#xD;
      night sweats can help to exclude active TB disease. Sputum smear has a low sensitivity for&#xD;
      diagnosis of active TB in pregnancy, however health care professionals will have a higher&#xD;
      index of suspicion for active TB in IGRA positive pregnant women presenting with symptoms&#xD;
      suggestive of TB, thus preventing a delay in diagnosis. TB diagnosis in pregnancy can be&#xD;
      delayed due to reduced awareness among health care providers and reluctance to investigate&#xD;
      non-specific TB symptoms by chest radiography. Pregnant migrants may not be accessing routine&#xD;
      health care and often do not have a GP. Antenatal care may therefore be a rare and critical&#xD;
      opportunity to assess a woman's health and screen for TB. Moreover, antenatal care provides&#xD;
      an opportunity for health promotion such as advocating GP registration. England's&#xD;
      collaborative TB strategy recommends migrant screening for LTBI in high incidence areas in&#xD;
      England including boroughs such as Newham. LTBI screening programmes have now been&#xD;
      implemented. Between April 2015 and June 2016, 5,622 eligible migrants in England were&#xD;
      offered an LTBI test, 2,904 (51%) of whom attended for the test. Newham was the first London&#xD;
      borough to introduce a large-scale LTBI screening programme. A total of 20,905 LTBI tests&#xD;
      were reported between July 2014 and June 2017 across England, nearly half of the tests were&#xD;
      reported in Newham however uptake of screening remains low. This may be because individuals&#xD;
      eligible for screening do not have symptoms and perceive the risk of developing active TB as&#xD;
      low. Newham data has shown that uptake of screening varies significantly amongst GP surgeries&#xD;
      indicating that uptake may be influenced by healthcare providers' knowledge and attitudes to&#xD;
      screening but may also be due to other factors such as proximity to phlebotomy services. Data&#xD;
      from the Clinical Effectiveness Group (CEG) at QMUL has shown that in pregnant migrant women&#xD;
      screening uptake is even lower, &lt;25% and this may be because pregnant women have not been&#xD;
      told that LTBI screening is important. There is limited qualitative research about the&#xD;
      acceptability to women of LTBI screening in pregnancy. Reasons for low uptake may be due to&#xD;
      stigma of having active TB or fear of a positive test result affecting their immigration&#xD;
      status. An opt-out approach normalises screening that otherwise may present barriers in&#xD;
      relation to stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provider knowledge and understanding of the risks of TB screening and treatment is a major&#xD;
      predictor of successful management of TB. Newham data has shown that offer of screening&#xD;
      varies significantly amongst GP surgeries indicating that health care provider knowledge and&#xD;
      attitude may influence offer of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the impact of healthcare provider training to improve TB management has mainly&#xD;
      been performed in low income countries and there are only a few rigorous TB training&#xD;
      evaluation studies available. E-learning modules use pre- and post- training tests to&#xD;
      evaluate acquired knowledge. A GP E-learning module has been developed by TB Alert to enhance&#xD;
      knowledge of GPs responsible for screening and treatment of LTBI but the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      module has not been formally evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the feasibility study The investigator's aim is to assess whether it is feasible and&#xD;
      acceptable to screen an at-risk migrant population for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)&#xD;
      at routine antenatal booking visits in secondary care, using opt-out Interferon- gamma&#xD;
      release assay (IGRA) testing. This will allow the investigators to develop a definitive large&#xD;
      scale cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of acceptable&#xD;
      interventions to maximise migrant screening for LTBI in pregnancy, and to increase uptake of&#xD;
      LTBI treatment postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real time continuous data on study design:&#xD;

           of active TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Posters will be displayed in antenatal clinics explaining the study. All patients&#xD;
      will be given a Patient Information Sheet by their midwives that explains the study and what&#xD;
      participation will entail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valid implied consent will be used for participation in the study and data collection.&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be taken for LTBI questionnaires, interviews and focus groups.&#xD;
      Furthermore written informed consent will be obtained for questionnaires, knowledge quiz,&#xD;
      interviews and focus groups from healthcare providers participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Basic data on age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and substance misuse and&#xD;
      pre-existing medical conditions (such as diabetes) and antenatal history and TB history will&#xD;
      be recorded in all patients electronically in antenatal care according to existing protocols&#xD;
      as part of standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting Antenatal clinics at Royal London Hospital, Whipps Cross University Hospital and&#xD;
      Newham University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention All women who are eligible for LTBI screening and attend the antenatal&#xD;
      clinic for their dating scan will be asked to be tested for LTBI alongside other routine&#xD;
      investigations for blood borne viruses. IGRA testing will be offered on an opt-out basis&#xD;
      similar to HIV testing. In addition, all migrants will be screened for active TB by their&#xD;
      midwives using a standardized symptom assessment questionnaire that includes the WHO&#xD;
      recommended TB symptom screen. TB awareness-raising will be delivered in antenatal clinics by&#xD;
      midwives, utilizing evidence-based tools created by TB Alert. Pregnant women will also be&#xD;
      asked to complete a short questionnaire on acceptability of LTBI screening, knowledge about&#xD;
      TB/LTBI, and barriers to screening. At the end of pregnancy, women will be asked again to&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire to compare the perception and knowledge of active TB/LTBI before and&#xD;
      after the screening intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women with LTBI will be closely monitored for active TB during pregnancy by their&#xD;
      midwives. The GP will be informed of a positive IGRA test and also the TB clinic will be&#xD;
      notified. The GP will be asked to refer the patient to TB clinic for LTBI treatment or if the&#xD;
      woman lives in Newham she will be treated in primary care. In case this does not happen, the&#xD;
      TB clinic will send a reminder to the GP to refer the patient. If women develop symptoms of&#xD;
      active TB, the midwife will arrange referral to the TB clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care providers involved in antenatal care will be asked to complete an E-learning&#xD;
      module on active TB/ LTBI which will be developed by TB Alert and the Royal College of&#xD;
      Midwives. The E-learning course, which will be CPD accredited, has a pre and post-course quiz&#xD;
      to assess any change in knowledge. Health care providers will be also asked to take part in&#xD;
      interviews, focus groups and to complete a questionnaire for which the investigators will&#xD;
      obtain written informed consent.&#xD;
