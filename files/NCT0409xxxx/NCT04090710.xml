      This trial will evaluate the addition of cytoreductive stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      (SBRT) to standard of care combination ipilimumab and nivolumab (I/N) versus I/N alone for&#xD;
      the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open label, phase II randomized clinical trial evaluating SBRT as&#xD;
      upfront cytoreductive therapy to the primary renal mass along with combination I/N therapy in&#xD;
      patients with intermediate/poor risk mRCC who are not candidates for cytoreductive&#xD;
      nephrectomy. Eligible and consenting, newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed&#xD;
      intermediate/poor risk mRCC patients based on IMDC criteria with primary disease in-situ will&#xD;
      be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to either induction I/N followed by SBRT prior to the second&#xD;
      cycle (experimental arm) versus I/N alone (standard arm). Patients will be stratified based&#xD;
      on IMDC criteria (intermediate 1-2 versus poor 3-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard Arm: induction ipilimumab 1 mg/kg combined with nivolumab 3 mg/kg (I/N) every 3&#xD;
           weeks for cycles 1-4 followed by maintenance treatment with nivolumab 240mg every 2&#xD;
           weeks or 480mg every 4 weeks until disease progression (as determined by RECIST 1.1),&#xD;
           intolerance, or patient/physician decision to stop treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental Arm: induction ipilimumab 1 mg/kg combined with nivolumab 3 mg/kg (I/N)&#xD;
           every 3 weeks for one cycle, followed by SBRT to the primary disease in-situ, prior to&#xD;
           cycle 2-4 of I/N. Patients randomized to SBRT will undergo radiation planning during the&#xD;
           first cycle of I/N to their primary kidney mass, and then the radiation will be&#xD;
           delivered between cycles 1 and 2 to a dose of 30-40 Gy in 5 fractions every other day&#xD;
           over 1.5 weeks. Approximately one week following completion of SBRT, patients will start&#xD;
           cycle 2 of I/N as per standard of care. The total time elapsed between the start of&#xD;
           cycle 1 and 2 of I/N should be no more than 6 weeks. After completion of up to four&#xD;
           cycles of I/N, patients will proceed to standard of care maintenance treatment with&#xD;
           nivolumab 240mg every 2 weeks or 480mg every 4 weeks until disease progression (as&#xD;
           determined by RECIST 1.1), intolerance, or patient/physician decision to stop treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment (standard and experimental arm) participants will be assessed for radiation&#xD;
      toxicity and the occurrence of adverse events. Following treatment, participants will be&#xD;
      assessed at a clinic visit every 3 months, for a period of 1 year. Progression free survival&#xD;
      will be assessed by CT scan (chest; abdomen and pelvis), which is performed after the final&#xD;
      I/N treatment and every 3 months as per standard of care. Participants will be followed for&#xD;
      one additional year, seen at 18 and 24 months to assess survival. The planned sample size is&#xD;
      78 study participants.&#xD;
