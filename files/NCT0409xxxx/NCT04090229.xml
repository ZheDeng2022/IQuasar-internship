  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1B, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple ascending&#xD;
      dose (MAD) clinical study is designed to evaluate ASLAN004 versus placebo in patients who&#xD;
      have moderate-severe AD. The treatment period duration will be 8 weeks with a 12-week&#xD;
      follow-up period after the end of treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a MAD escalation in up to 3 cohorts of patients, followed by a&#xD;
      cohort expansion to further confirm the safety and tolerability of the selected dose, prior&#xD;
      to further investigation in Phase 2 studies. The cohort expansion will also support the&#xD;
      assessment of the trial's secondary efficacy objectives. Approximately 50 patients are&#xD;
      planned to be enrolled across the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 24 patients are planned to be enrolled in the initial MAD escalation, with a&#xD;
      maximum of 3 ascending dose levels (low, medium and high) of ASLAN004 (Cohorts 1-3). In all&#xD;
      dose cohorts, 8 patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive ASLAN004 (at specified&#xD;
      cohort dose, n=6) or matching placebo (n=2). Additional cohorts may be optional depending on&#xD;
      the data from the preceding cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expansion cohort (Cohort 4) of approximately 27 patients is planned and will be randomized&#xD;
      in a 2:1 ratio to receive ASLAN004 (n=18) or matching placebo (n=9). The rationale for this&#xD;
      is to provide greater assurance about the safety and tolerability of the selected dose level,&#xD;
      and to provide preliminary estimates of the PD and clinical effects at this dose, prior to&#xD;
      further dose and schedule finding work in Phase 2 studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 8 subcutaneous injections of ASLAN004 or matching placebo will be administered&#xD;
      according to a weekly schedule of injection from Day 1 (baseline visit) to Day 50 (Week 7) of&#xD;
      the study. Patients will be closely monitored and observed for a period of 30 minutes after&#xD;
      each injection of study drug (all visits). The clinical assessments and blood sampling for&#xD;
      safety laboratory tests, PK analysis, ADA assays, and biomarkers will be performed at each&#xD;
      visit as noted in the Schedule of Assessments. The treatment period will end at the last day&#xD;
      of Week 8 (ie., Day 56) after which patients will be followed every week for 12 weeks for&#xD;
      safety, PK parameters, ADA, and PD marker assessments. In the event that patients develop&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs)/serious AEs (SAEs) which are determined as definitely related, probably&#xD;
      related, or possibly related to ADA, and/or patients have a positive ADA result, additional&#xD;
      unscheduled sampling of ADA may be performed during the study or after Day 141, as deemed&#xD;
      clinically necessary. The exact timepoints for ADA sampling after Day 141 will be discussed&#xD;
      between the Investigator and Sponsor for each case.&#xD;
