    <textblock>
      Adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer improves local control, also in the elderly. Hormonal&#xD;
      therapy in hormone sensitive tumors improves results but can not substitute radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Improved local control leads to less breast cancer related morbidity and mortality, also in&#xD;
      an older population (Schonberg, JCO, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, in older patients with lower life expectancy, adjuvant radiotherapy is often&#xD;
      omitted. Following reasons are invoked:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  frailty of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fear for toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  impaired mobility, rendering transportation and positioning more difficult&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dependency for transportation to and from the radiotherapy departement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  negative cost effectiveness ratio, due to high cost (especially for complex techniques&#xD;
           and long schedules) and lower benefit (lower life expectancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypofractionation is feasible without increased toxicity, and combines better local control&#xD;
      with patient comfort and lower costs. Further lowering the number of fractions (from 15-21 to&#xD;
      5) will further improve patient comfort, but is challenging when different doses are needed&#xD;
      in the same target volume. This problem is addressed using advanced techniques permitting&#xD;
      dose-integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the elder with cancer, several unrecognized geriatric problems, including depression and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, can be detected by CGA . Some problems do interact with cancer&#xD;
      treatment. In this study screening and assessment is provided to support patients and to&#xD;
      develop an inventory of radiotherapy obstacles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study includes breast cancer patients, ≥70 years old, referred for adjuvant radiotherapy&#xD;
      after surgical treatment. A schedule of 5 fractions is offered, encompassing different&#xD;
      targets of treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer improves local control and overall survival, also in&#xD;
      the elderly. Hormonal therapy in hormone sensitive tumors improves results but can not&#xD;
      substitute radiotherapy (EBCTCG, Lancet, 2011). Improved local control, leads to less breast&#xD;
      cancer related morbidity and mortality, also in an older population (Schonberg, JCO, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, in older patients with lower life expectancy, adjuvant radiotherapy is often&#xD;
      perceived as too cumbersome. As a consequence, patients who could have benefit from breast&#xD;
      conserving therapy are referred for mastectomy. Even when breast-conserving surgery is&#xD;
      chosen, adjuvant radiotherapy is sometimes omitted in frail patients over 70 years fearing&#xD;
      the burden of daily transportation to the radiation department. However, omitting&#xD;
      radiotherapy results in a higher risk of loco-regional recurrence. It has been shown that&#xD;
      older patients have a worse prognosis due to suboptimal treatment, especially in locally&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer (Schonberg, JCO, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following reasons are invoked by the patients or the care-givers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  frailty of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fear for (mostly acute) toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  impaired mobility, rendering transportation and positioning more difficult&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dependency on third parties (family, services) for transportation to and from the&#xD;
           radiotherapy departement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  negative cost effectiveness ratio, due to high cost (especially for complex techniques&#xD;
           and long schedules) and lower benefit (lower life expectancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypofractionation and acceleration are proven to be feasible in recent trials (cf. Start&#xD;
      Trial, Fast Trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data and in order to overcome above mentioned obstacles for radiotherapy in&#xD;
      breast cancer, we start a study with accelerated radiotherapy in women above 70 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As we are experienced in advanced techniques as IMRT, VMAT, simultaneous dose-integration and&#xD;
      IGRT, we will use simultaneous dose integrated protocols to permit inclusion of early as well&#xD;
      as locally advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integration of doses within one global volume encompasses several advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of fractions can be maintained, regardless of the indication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  imprevisible high doses due to overlap of adjacent fields in tangential techniques is&#xD;
           avoided&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  high dose volume is more adequately limited to the actual region of high risk, as dose&#xD;
           difference is smaller.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the impact of accelerated radiotherapy on the well being of the patient&#xD;
      and on the treatment cost, quality of life (QoL) will be measured and a cost-analysis will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology of research At the radiotherapy intake consultation, patients with age ≥70 years&#xD;
      are extensively informed on the advantages and the possible risks of accelerated irradiation.&#xD;
      A written documentation of the study is provided to permit consultation of family and general&#xD;
      practitioner before consent for participation. Until 1 week before the start of radiotherapy,&#xD;
      patients can decide wether or not to participate in this study without impact on the starting&#xD;
      day. Inclusion is performed after signing the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to include 70 patients aged ≥ 70 years, who, after signing the informed consent,&#xD;
      will be treated with the accelerated schemes over 10 days (5 sessions, every other day).&#xD;
      Following doses are prescribed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast: 5x5,7Gy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  R0 boost: 5x6.5Gy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  R1 boost: 5x6.9Gy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thoracic wall: 5x5.7Gy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymph nodes: 5x5.4Gy --&gt; these doses are simultaneously integrated, and regions are&#xD;
           prescribed according to our standard protocol .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positioning of the patient depends on technical possibilities and patient rigidity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for breast irradiation without lymph nodes, prone positioning is preferred if feasible,&#xD;
           if not the patient is positioned in supine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for thoracic irradiation with or without lymph node irradiation, patient is always&#xD;
           installed in supine position&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for breast + lymph node irradiation, patients are installed in supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points of our study are acute and chronic toxicity, loco-regional control and QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided in two different strata (first group without lymph node irradiation,&#xD;
      second group with lymph node irradiation) for following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. these groups represent different outcomes with lymph node invasion having a negative&#xD;
           impact on morbidity, loco-regional control and overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a higher frequency of acute moist desquamation might occur in the second group (lymph&#xD;
           nodes included) as compared to the first group, due to a larger target volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the brachial plexus is a special concern, as it lies close or even within the target&#xD;
           volume. Therefore we will monitor closely the effects on the brachial plexus for the&#xD;
           second group. Nevertheless, as the total dose is lower than with normo-fractionation,&#xD;
           the risk for brachial neuropathy is maximally reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  40 patients in group 1: irradiation of breast/thoracic wall with or without integrated&#xD;
           boost without lymph node irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 patients in group 2: irradiation of breast/thoracic wall with or without integrated&#xD;
           boost and with lymph node region irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      An application for funding to perform geriatric assessment is introduced. In the elder with&#xD;
      cancer, several unrecognized geriatric problems, including depression and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, can be detected bij CGA . Some of these problems even interact with cancer&#xD;
      treatment. In this study screening and assessment is provided to develop an inventory of&#xD;
      obstacles for undergoing radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When screening scores positive (G8 score ≤ 14/17) geriatric assessment will be performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the problems and needs of the patient. Patients will be referred for appropriate&#xD;
      treatment and support. As described by Schönberg, treatment in early stage breast cancer&#xD;
      might even lead to improved morbidity and mortality when compared to a non-cancer population,&#xD;
      due to the 'healthy user' effect, detecting otherwise unrevealed problems. In the scope of&#xD;
      this study, this effect can not be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis To estimate the number of patients needed, we applied the Wilson score&#xD;
      confidence interval test for binomial proportion, which is a 2-sided exact method for power&#xD;
      analysis, using &quot;SAS Power and Sample Size&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve a conditional probability of 87% with an alpha-error of 0,1, a number of 35&#xD;
      patients would be needed. To compensate for drop-outs, we include 40 patients in this&#xD;
      study-arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 To achieve a conditional probability of &gt;95% with an alpha-error of 0,1, a number of&#xD;
      25 patients would be needed. To compensate for drop-outs, we include 30 patients in this&#xD;
      study-arm.&#xD;
