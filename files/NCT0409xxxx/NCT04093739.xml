  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this consecutive series PMCF study is to collect data confirming safety,&#xD;
      performance and clinical benefits of the G7 Freedom Constrained Liners when used for primary&#xD;
      and revision total hip arthroplasty (implants and instrumentation) at 5 years follow-up.&#xD;
      Since G7 Acetabular Cup System has only been on the market since 2015, a prospective&#xD;
      follow-up will be necessary to obtain data for the 5 year post-surgery time-point for each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

      Since G7 Acetabular Cup System has only been on the market since 2015, a prospective&#xD;
      follow-up will be necessary to obtain data for the 5 year post-surgery time-point for each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to confirm safety of the study products. This will be assessed by&#xD;
      recording the incidence and frequency of revisions, complications, and adverse events.&#xD;
      Relationship of the events to either implant or instrumentation should be specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by analyzing&#xD;
      recorded patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs).&#xD;
