      The aim of the present investigation is to assess the clinical therapeutic effect of topical&#xD;
      use of Coenzyme Q10 versus topical corticosteroid in management of symptomatic oral lichen&#xD;
      planus and determine whether the effect, if any, was due to its antioxidant activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a relatively common chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous autoimmune&#xD;
      disease that primarily affects the skin and mucosal surfaces including the oral cavity with a&#xD;
      variety of clinical manifestations including reticular, papular, hyperkeratotic, atrophic,&#xD;
      erosive, and bullous forms 1,2. The erosive, atrophic, and bullous type lesions are usually&#xD;
      accompanied with pain or burning sensation that affects the patient's quality of life3.&#xD;
      Intraorally, the buccal mucosa, dorsum of the tongue and the gingiva are commonly affected 4&#xD;
      .OLP has most often been reported in middle aged patients3. Women account for 60% to 75% of&#xD;
      patients with OLP 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OLP is estimated to affect1% to 2.0% of the general population. Around 40% of lesions occur&#xD;
      on both oral and cutaneous surfaces, 35% occurs on cutaneous surfaces alone, and 25% occur on&#xD;
      oral mucosa alone 6,7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several predisposing factors might be involved in the pathogenesis of OLP. Earlier studies&#xD;
      have implicated stress, anxiety and depression as possible factors. Familial cases of OLP&#xD;
      have been reported and the role of genetic predisposition was considered8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact etiology of OLP is still unknown, but cell-mediated immune dysfunction is&#xD;
      implicated in the complex etio-pathogenesis of this disease. Large amounts of cytokines that&#xD;
      are released by affected keratinocytes and the associated inflammatory elements play a key&#xD;
      role in the selective recruitment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells trigger apoptosis of the basal&#xD;
      cells of the oral epithelium. T-cell dominated infiltrate in the sub epithelial region, which&#xD;
      characterizes OLP, induces further release of cytokines9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines may be produced by nearly every cell, but mostly act locally on cell receptors and&#xD;
      have high potency10. Their production gives rise to an inflammatory cascade. One of the most&#xD;
      important elements in this cascade is overexpression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α).&#xD;
      TNF- α causes tissue destruction and overproduction of other cytokines, especially&#xD;
      interleukin (IL)-6 which, in turn, leads to further inflammation and tissue degradation 11.&#xD;
      Production of cytokines can in turn stimulate production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and&#xD;
      cause oxidative damage to the tissues 12 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malondialdehyde (MDA), as the lipid peroxidation marker, increases in an oxidative&#xD;
      stress-dependent situation 13. Actually, higher levels of MDA were reported in serum and&#xD;
      saliva of patients affected by OLP14-17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of treatments have been proposed for OLP: topical or systemic corticosteroids,&#xD;
      cyclosporine, retinoids, azathioprine, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, photo chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      surgery 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic and topical corticosteroids are probably the most effective treatment modality for&#xD;
      patients with diffuse erosive OLP or multisite disease 19 .Despite the therapeutic effects of&#xD;
      corticosteroids, they have significant morbidity and disturbing adverse effects such as&#xD;
      fungal infections and adrenal suppression. Moreover, steroid use is contraindicated in&#xD;
      patients who are breastfeeding, and have to be used with caution in patients with herpetic&#xD;
      infections, glaucoma, HIV infection, tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, candidiasis, and&#xD;
      hypertension, as well as in pregnant women, resulting in a continuing search for novel&#xD;
      therapies 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) or ubiquinone is a lipid-soluble vitamin-like antioxidant naturally&#xD;
      found in the diet and can also be synthesized endogenously by all cells of our body. It is&#xD;
      one of the key components in ATP production in ETC. CoQ10 protects membranes against&#xD;
      oxidation, and regenerates vitamins E and C and enzymatic antioxidant systems, and modulates&#xD;
      prostaglandin metabolism 21, 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximal antioxidative power of the CoQ10 coenzyme is credited to its electron-donating&#xD;
      properties that neutralize free radicals 23, and its ability to replenish other valuable&#xD;
      endogenous antioxidants 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CoQ10 is located in the membranes in close proximity to the unsaturated lipid chains to act&#xD;
      as a primary scavenger of free radicals and prevent lipid peroxidation 25.. Any certain&#xD;
      condition that leads to increased levels of ROS (either by overproduction or impaired&#xD;
      removal) or reduced function of antioxidants is called &quot;oxidative stress&quot;. ROS may be toxic&#xD;
      to cells via inactive enzymes, denaturizing proteins, DNA destruction, and lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation. These events lead to damaged cell membrane, increased reactive aldehyde&#xD;
      materials, and impaired cell function. The level of ROS and lipid peroxidation may be related&#xD;
      to OLP 26,27. This suggests that oxidative stress is a major trigger for OLP, and the level&#xD;
      of antioxidants is a potential determinant of susceptibility to be affected by OLP 28, 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, studies have shown that CoQ10 also exerts anti-inflammatory properties via IL-1,&#xD;
      TNF-α, and NFκB1-dependent gene expression, thus enhancing clearance of inflammation within&#xD;
      the lesion to promote tissue regeneration and wound healing30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Papucci et al. 31 demonstrated that treatment with CoQ10 lowered the number of apoptotic&#xD;
      keratocytes in response to excimer laser irradiation to a much higher extent than other free&#xD;
      radical scavengers. Moreover, supplemental CoQ10 has good safety record; no adverse effects&#xD;
      have been reported with daily dosage ranging from 600 to 1200mg&#xD;
