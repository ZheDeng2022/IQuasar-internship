  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND About 1/4 of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) seem to develop&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (AF) over their life-span. Typically, symptoms of heart failure and&#xD;
      especially shortness of breath get much worse once AF is present. Catheter ablation of AF in&#xD;
      HCM has been proposed by several centres, but outcomes are much worse than in non-HCM AF.&#xD;
      Accurate mapping of the arrhythmia is crucial with regard to improving the procedural&#xD;
      outcome. Interestingly, intracardiac mapping during AF has demonstrated very long average&#xD;
      cycle length during ongoing AF in HCM which should make identification of the critical&#xD;
      re-entry/rotors much easier using dipole cardiac mapping (Acutus mapping system, Acutus&#xD;
      Medical, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION and PURPOSE This is a pilot trial recruiting a total of 20 patients with HCM and&#xD;
      AF (paroxysmal or persistent with &lt;12 months duration time in persistent AF) eligible for&#xD;
      catheter ablation, without other significant structural heart disease Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of acute adverse events due to the use of ACUTUS mapping system during AF&#xD;
           ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence of chronic adverse events due to the use of ACUTUS mapping system guided&#xD;
           catheter ablation during the 12 months F/U period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety endpoint of the entire mapping and ablation strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment on efficacy of ACUTUS mapping system guided AF ablation in HCM patients using&#xD;
           a double-arm study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RF time to termination of AF to SR Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RF time to termination of AF to atrial tachycardia (AT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Freedom from AF/flutter/tachycardia (&gt; 30 sec) at the end of the 12 months follow up&#xD;
           (F/U) period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to first recurrence of AF/flutter/tachycardia (&gt; 30 sec)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Freedom of AF/flutter/tachycardia on previously failed anti-arrhythmic medication&#xD;
           Ablation procedure First 10 patients (group 1): ablation will be carried out after&#xD;
           acquisition of a left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA) dipole map at baseline, pre and&#xD;
           post administration of Adenosine IV. Then pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as a first step&#xD;
           and subsequent remap and ablation of all patterns of interest in the LA until&#xD;
           restoration of sinus rhythm (SR) or decision to proceed with direct current&#xD;
           cardioversion (DCCV, 360J).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second 10 patients (group 2): after the acquisition of a dipole map of LA and RA at baseline&#xD;
      (pre and post Adenosine IV administration), ablation of all identified areas of interest&#xD;
      (API) will be performed, followed by remap and finally PVI +/- DCCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients: final step will be the deployment of a RA isthmus line and demonstration of&#xD;
      bidirectional block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP Patients will be followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;

      FOLLOW UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up at 3, 6, and 12months with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical visit, symptoms questionnaire, electrocardiogram (ECG), ECG Holter (3, 6, and&#xD;
           12 months);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  trans-thoracic echocardiogram (only at 12months);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three-dimensional late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonamce - 3D LGE- CMR&#xD;
           (if possible, only at 6 months); exercise cardiopulmonary test (only pre-ablation and at&#xD;
           6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY REPORTING RECORDING ADVERSE EVENTS (AES) All Adverse Events will be recorded in the&#xD;
      hospital notes and Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the Investigator suspects that the disease has progressed faster due to the administration&#xD;
      of the study treatment/procedure, then he/she will report this as an unexpected adverse event&#xD;
      to the Sponsor and the REC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE TYPE AND DURATION OF THE FOLLOW-UP OF SUBJECTS AFTER AES The type and duration of&#xD;
      follow-up care for subjects following an AES will be as follows: 6-12 months following&#xD;
      pulmonary vein stenosis, phrenic nerve palsy, valve damage, and atrio-oesophageal fistula (if&#xD;
      operated); 3-6 months following vascular complications or pericardial effusion (usually these&#xD;
      complications are promptly treated without major long term consequence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREGNANCY Pregnant patients will be excluded from the study. However, if pregnancy occurs&#xD;
      after inclusion into the study, investigators will record and notify pregnancies occurring&#xD;
      during the study period to the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of pregnant subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No further ablation procedure will be undertaken during the pregnancy period in order to&#xD;
           avoid radiation exposure and hazards to the foetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication contraindicated during pregnancy will be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anticoagulation treatment with Warfarin will be discontinued during the first and the&#xD;
           third trimester and replaced with subcutaneous injections of low molecular weight&#xD;
           heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No additional investigations involving radiation exposure such as computed tomography&#xD;
           (CT), X ray will be performed, unless clinically urgent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of child born to a pregnant trial subject, including male trial subject who is the&#xD;
      partner of the pregnant woman:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children born to a pregnant subject are unlikely to be affected by the participation of the&#xD;
      parent in the study. For safety reasons, a specialised paediatric team will follow children&#xD;
      for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS (APRS) The Chief Investigator (CI) will prepare the APR for the&#xD;
      study. It will be reviewed by the Research Office (RO) and sent to the regulatory ethic&#xD;
      committee (REC) by the CI within 30 days of the anniversary date on which the favorable&#xD;
      opinion was given by the REC, and annually until the study is declared ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REPORTING URGENT SAFETY MEASURES The Sponsor and/or the Investigator may take appropriate&#xD;
      urgent safety measures in order to protect the subjects of a clinical study against any&#xD;
      immediate hazard to their health or safety. If safety measures are taken, REC approval is not&#xD;
      required before the measure is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will immediately and in any event no later than 3 days from the date the&#xD;
      measures are taken, give written notice to the REC and the study Sponsor of the measures&#xD;
      taken and the circumstances giving rise to those measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to prevent any delays in the reporting timelines the Sponsor has delegated this&#xD;
      responsibility to the CI/Principal Investigator (PI). Therefore, the CI/PI must report any&#xD;
      urgent safety measures to the REC directly, and in parallel to the Sponsor. The REC&#xD;
      coordinator will acknowledge receipt of urgent safety measures within 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE CONFIDENTIALITY All data will be handled in accordance&#xD;
      with the Data Protection Act 1998, NHS Caldecott Principles, The Research Governance&#xD;
      Framework for Health and Social Care, 2nd Edition (2005), and the condition of the REC&#xD;
      approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Case Report Forms (CRFs) will not bear the subject's name or other personal identifiable&#xD;
      data. The subject's initials, Date of Birth (DOB) and study Identification Number (ID), will&#xD;
      be used for identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION TOOL Case Report Forms (CRF) will be designed by the CI and the final version&#xD;
      will be reviewed and discussed with the study Sponsor. All data will be entered legibly in&#xD;
      black ink with a ball-point pen. If the Investigator makes an error, it will be crossed&#xD;
      through with a single line in such a way to ensure that the original entry can still be read.&#xD;
      The correct entry will then be clearly inserted. The amendment will be initialled and dated&#xD;
      by the person making the correction immediately. Overwriting or use of correction fluid will&#xD;
      not be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure the accuracy of all data entered and&#xD;
      recorded in the CRFs. The Delegation of Responsibilities Log will identify all trial&#xD;
      personnel responsible for data collection, entry, handling and managing the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be firstly recorded into source documents (i.e medical notes) (medical history,&#xD;
      baseline investigations) and then recorded onto the CRF (with the addition of the procedure&#xD;
      specific data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods used to maximise completeness of data will include telephoning subjects who have not&#xD;
      attended the planned follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA HANDLING AND ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Excel software will be used for data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to ensure validity and quality of data the study investigators will use cross&#xD;
           validation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be stored and backed up on 2 additional hard drives on two different sites in&#xD;
           order to allow recovery of data in case of a disaster such as fire/flooding/ theft. The&#xD;
           PI and their collaborators/co-workers will be responsible for data entry and quality of&#xD;
           data collection. Analysis will be performed by the study investigators and reviewed&#xD;
           independently of data entry by the statistical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every patient will receive a numerical patient identifier and all data that is&#xD;
           transferred outside the primary hospital will exclusively be identified by this study&#xD;
           number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study database will be held at the Biomedical Research Unit (BRU) server at the&#xD;
           Royal Brompton Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARCHIVING ARRANGEMENTS The study documents (including the Study Master File (SMF), Case&#xD;
      Report Forms (CRFs), Informed Consent Forms along with the study database) will be kept for a&#xD;
      minimum of five years. They will be stored in locked offices within the Royal Brompton and&#xD;
      Harefield NHS Foundation Trust (RB&amp;HFT). The CI is responsible for the secure archiving of&#xD;
      study documents. The study database will also be kept electronically on the RB&amp;HFT computer&#xD;
      network, for a minimum of five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approved repository for longer retention of local materials for studies that involve&#xD;
      RB&amp;HFT patients is Box-It Storage UK. The study documentation will be prepared for archiving&#xD;
      by the research team in line with the Research Office Archiving Standard Operating Procedures&#xD;
      (SOP) and the transfer will be arranged by the Research Office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient anonymised data may be exported for the purpose of offline review and to perform the&#xD;
      image merge as part of the study and also to further develop the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS This is a feasibility pilot study, which will test the feasibility of AF&#xD;
      mapping with Acutus system and catheter ablation in patients with HCM and paroxysmal or&#xD;
      persistent AF (time in persistent AF &lt; 12 months duration). Therefore, no power calculation&#xD;
      has been done and the number of patient recruited will be of 20 which are deemed sufficient&#xD;
      by the Chief Investigator and Co-PIs on a clinical basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated recruitment period for the trial will be of 6 months. We estimate that this&#xD;
      sample size is attainable in practice, as the number of AF ablation procedures per year&#xD;
      performed within each Trust is around 400. The study investigators also included patients&#xD;
      with previous AF ablation in order to maximise chances of recruitment. This pilot is&#xD;
      performed with the intention to plan a prospective multi-operator/multicentre trial which is&#xD;
      adequately powered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators will aim to compare the procedure parameters as well as the outcome&#xD;
      of this trial to age &amp; gender matched procedures of the same operator from the last 5 years'&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN Descriptive statistic data with regard to baseline and procedural&#xD;
      variables will be reported; continuous variables will be expressed by mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation or median and interquartile range (25th, 75th percentile), depending on the&#xD;
      normality of distribution; categorical variables will be summarized by frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages. The outcome of radiofrequency ablation on the entire cohort of patients will be&#xD;
      presented in the form of percentage of patients free from symptomatic or documented&#xD;
      arrhythmia or with only mild symptoms related to arrhythmia recurrence. Results will be&#xD;
      reported separately for 3, 6 and 12month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the severity of symptoms and documentation of tachycardia during follow-up,&#xD;
      patients will be divided into two groups (success/recurrence). Baseline characteristics and&#xD;
      procedural variables will be compared between these two groups by student t-tests, Mann&#xD;
      Whitney U tests, or Fisher's exact test where appropriate in order to identify those&#xD;
      variables associated with better mid/long term outcomes. A two-tailed p value &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. Intra-patient improvement from baseline to 12 months&#xD;
      follow-up visit will be assessed by McNemar's test. Freedom from AF will be assessed as a&#xD;
      time dependant variable using Cox proportional hazard models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To judge if ablation strategy using Acutus mapping system is as successful in achieving the&#xD;
      clinical endpoint, the study investigators will compare the procedure parameters as well as&#xD;
      the outcome of this trial to age &amp; gender matched procedures of the same operator from the&#xD;
      last 5 years' database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the strength of association between the acute successes (SR at the end of the&#xD;
      ablation), 3, 6 and 12-month outcomes, a McNemar test will be performed. Data will be&#xD;
      analysed using SPSS version 18 (IBM Corporation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two procedures using a&#xD;
      computer programme that provides a sequence of the procedures randomly permuted in blocks of&#xD;
      constant or varying size. For this study a constant block size will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMMITTEES INVOLVED IN THE STUDY Trial Management Group (TMG) - normally includes those&#xD;
      individuals responsible for the day-to-day management of the trial, such as the CI,&#xD;
      statistician, trial manager, research nurse, data manager. The role of the group is to&#xD;
      monitor all aspects of the conduct and progress of the trial, ensure that the protocol is&#xD;
      adhered to and take appropriate action to safeguard participants and the quality of the trial&#xD;
      itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONITORING AND AUDITING The requirement for study monitoring or audit will be based on the&#xD;
      internal Research Office (RO) risk assessment procedure and applicable Standard Operating&#xD;
      Procedures (SOPs). It is the responsibility of the RO to determine the monitoring risk&#xD;
      assessment and explain the rationale to the study research team. Monitoring support will be&#xD;
      provided by the Sponsor, Spectrum Dynamics, as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study monitoring and/or audit will be discussed with the CI before arrangements are made to&#xD;
      conduct the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA The Investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit trial-related&#xD;
      monitoring, audits, REC review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to&#xD;
      source data/documents. Trial participants are informed of this during the informed consent&#xD;
      discussion. Participants will consent to provide access to their medical notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINANCE The therapeutic procedure follows the normal clinical pathway for treatment of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation. The additional cost incurred due to the participation in the HCM-AF ablation&#xD;
      with Acutus protocol per patient will be sponsored by Acutus Medical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY NHS bodies are liable for clinical negligence and other negligent&#xD;
      harm to individuals covered by their duty of care. NHS Institutions employing researchers are&#xD;
      liable for negligent harm caused by the design of studies they initiate. The provision of&#xD;
      such indemnity for negligent harm should be stated to the participant.&#xD;
