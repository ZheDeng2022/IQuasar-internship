  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is a chronic pain condition that develops after breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery. The objective of this study was to determine if Pecs II block administered&#xD;
      prior to general anesthesia (GA) reduced the incidence of PMPS after mastectomy and axillary&#xD;
      clearance (MAC) when compared with conventional analgesic therapy.&#xD;

      This cross sectional study was approved by the research and ethics committees in both&#xD;
      institutional and national levels. This project was registered under National Medical&#xD;
      Research Register (NMRR), Ministry of Health Malaysia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who underwent MAC from July 2015 - June 2017 in Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) were&#xD;
      recruited. In order to standardize surgical technique and reduce confounding factors, case&#xD;
      selection was only limited to unilateral MAC. Other breast cancer surgeries, such as wide&#xD;
      local excision, modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and lumpectomy, were excluded. Patients&#xD;
      with the following characteristics and problems were excluded from our study - past history&#xD;
      of chronic pain and on regular analgesics, chemotherapy or radiotherapy before surgery,&#xD;
      surgical complications (such as infection or wound breakdown) or cancer recurrence, history&#xD;
      of psychiatric illness, inability to be contacted, inability or unwillingness to participate&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no standard definition for this chronic pain syndrome. Depending on the&#xD;
      definitions applied, patient selection and methods used, the incidence varies. The definition&#xD;
      of PMPS used in this study was modified from International Association for the Study of&#xD;
      Pain19 (IASP) and other studies.9,20 In our study, PMPS is taken as chronic post surgical&#xD;
      pain in the anterior aspect of the thorax, axilla, and/or upper half of the arm beginning&#xD;
      after mastectomy, without objective evidence of local abnormality, persisting either&#xD;
      continuously or intermittently for more than three months after surgery, and may be&#xD;
      associated with allodynia or sensory loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire used in this study was obtained with permission from Dr Manoj Kumar Karmakar,&#xD;
      the author of a previous study on the effect of thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) on&#xD;
      chronic pain post mastectomy.21 It was prepared in both English and Malay versions (Appendix&#xD;
      1) to cater for our local population. The English version was translated to Malay using&#xD;
      forward and retrograde translation methods to check the reliability and precision of the&#xD;
      words by four independent translators who were bicultural Malay speakers with a good command&#xD;
      of English. The translation was further evaluated by a panel of experts in the field of&#xD;
      Regional Anesthesia and Pain Management to verify the idiomatic and cross-cultural&#xD;
      equivalence to the English version. Seven respondents were then recruited to assess face&#xD;
      validity of the questionnaire. Repeat evaluation was done until respondents understood all&#xD;
      the questions in the process of content validation. No modification was needed as the first&#xD;
      draft of questionnaire was well understood by all respondents. Internal consistency&#xD;
      reliability and construct validation was done using Cronbach's alpha, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin&#xD;
      (KMO) test and Bartlett's test of sphericity.22 The KMO value of 0.56 and the significant&#xD;
      Bartlett's test of sphericity (P&lt; 0.001) in this validation was acceptable. Cronbach's alpha&#xD;
      was 0.736, indicating good internal consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal details, medical history and contact number of all patients who underwent MAC within&#xD;
      the specified period were collected from patient's medical records with the permission from&#xD;
      the Head of Breast and Endocrine Unit, Department of General Surgery, HKL. Each patient who&#xD;
      fulfilled the selection criteria was assigned a study number and grouped into either&#xD;
      conventional analgesic therapy (Group A) or Pecs II block (Group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in this study had undergone MAC under GA with regular method of&#xD;
      induction and maintenance inhalational anesthesia. Those who received Pecs II block had the&#xD;
      procedure done before induction of anesthesia by a team of experienced regional&#xD;
      anesthesiologists. Both groups received appropriate doses of opioid and nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) for intraoperative analgesia. Post operatively, all patients&#xD;
      received standardized oral analgesics for pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey was conducted by a single investigator. Recruited patients were seen in the&#xD;
      surgical outpatient clinic to obtain consent and complete the questionnaire. Patients who&#xD;
      were not seen in the clinic were contacted by telephone to obtain verbal consent and answer&#xD;
      the questionnaire according to the template prepared (Appendix 2). A series of questions&#xD;
      related to chronic pain of PMPS were asked as per questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using Krejcie and Morgan formula,24 sample size was calculated based on the incidence of&#xD;
      PMPS, which was our primary outcome variable. Published data showed that the incidence of&#xD;
      PMPS ranges from 11% to 60%.7-10 With expected incidence of 60%, using 2 proportions sample&#xD;
      test, we calculated that a minimum of 95 patients per study group would provide 80% power (α&#xD;
      = 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 software. Continuous variables are presented as&#xD;
      mean ± standard deviations or median (interquartile range) where appropriate. Categorical&#xD;
      data is shown as numbers and percentages. Comparison of continuous data between groups was&#xD;
      performed by Student's&#xD;
