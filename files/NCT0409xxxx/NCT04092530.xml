  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancies conceived within 18 months of a prior delivery (termed short inter-pregnancy&#xD;
      interval [IPI]) place mothers and infants at high risk for poor health outcomes and affect&#xD;
      nearly one third of women in the U.S. Rates of postpartum (PP) contraception use remain low,&#xD;
      particularly among low-income minority women, leading to high rates of short IPI pregnancies.&#xD;
      This proposed study aims to address the gap in the current model of PP contraception care, by&#xD;
      developing and implementing a novel approach to link (co-schedule) PP contraception care with&#xD;
      newborn well-baby care with the goal of improving access to timely PP contraception.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pregnancies conceived within 18 months of a prior delivery (termed short inter-pregnancy&#xD;
      interval [IPI]) place mothers and infants at high risk for poor health outcomes including&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia, anemia, and preterm birth. Despite these negative health consequences, nearly&#xD;
      one third of women experience a short IPI, highlighting a significant public health problem&#xD;
      in the U.S. A critical approach to preventing short IPIs is to provide postpartum (PP) women&#xD;
      with timely access to contraception. The current standard clinical practice is to have women&#xD;
      return six weeks after delivery for a postpartum visit, at which time contraceptive needs are&#xD;
      addressed. However, many women resume sexual activity prior to six weeks PP, and many women,&#xD;
      particularly low-income minority women, do not present for this visit. Low rates of&#xD;
      postpartum contraception uptake leave women vulnerable to an unplanned pregnancy and&#xD;
      significant negative health consequences. Thus, there is an urgent need for alternative&#xD;
      approaches to increase timely access to PP contraception to improve outcomes for women and&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. develop a comprehensive implementation plan to link PP contraception and newborn care&#xD;
           through co-scheduling visits in community health centers (CHC);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. use an effectiveness- implementation hybrid design to evaluate this novel system-level&#xD;
           approach to linking maternal and newborn care at CHCs served by our partner&#xD;
           organization, AllianceChicago and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. assess implementation of linked PP contraception and newborn care and report on key&#xD;
           barriers and facilitators related to successful implementation of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing access to timely contraception is a promising strategy to help women plan their&#xD;
      families and, in turn, reduce the poor health sequela associated with short IPI pregnancies.&#xD;
      The long-term impact of this study is to reduce negative health outcomes among PP women and&#xD;
      infants by increasing access to patient-oriented PP contraceptive care. Findings may provide&#xD;
      evidence supporting a paradigm shift for linked PP care and identify important insights to&#xD;
      facilitate successful implementation of this model of care in CHCs across the nation.&#xD;

    <description>During the intervention period, staff will capture women during the first well-baby visit (WBV) and offer to have the next visit co-scheduled for infant and contraception care. Appointments are scheduled during the discharge process at the end of each WBV. During the discharge process all women 0-6 months postpartum will be identified by clerical staff through review of each pediatric clinic beforehand and through an electronic flag alert in the infant's electronic medical record. The pre-review of pediatric clinic schedules and the use of the flag will remind staff to offer the mother a co-scheduled visit for newborn and contraceptive care at the time of the next newborn visit.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible participants include women presenting with their infants at one of the 7&#xD;
             chosen CHC sites for their first WBV (typically 3-5 days after delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women will be excluded if they had a tubal ligation or a long acting reversible&#xD;
             contraception planned immediately after delivery. Additionally, women will be excluded&#xD;
             if they needed an emergency hysterectomy due to life threatening bleeding during&#xD;
             delivery. Any male patients will be excluded from the study because the study outcomes&#xD;
             of contraceptive method use and pregnancy status are not applicable to males.&#xD;
