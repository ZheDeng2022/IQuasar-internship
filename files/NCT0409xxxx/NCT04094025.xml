    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, evaluator-blinded study consisting of one (1) group. The study will&#xD;
      assess skin irritation as well as sensitization for d-ATS patch in healthy subjects. All&#xD;
      three (3) articles (d-ATS patch, placebo patch, and saline patch) will be applied&#xD;
      simultaneously on the back of each subject. Healthy subjects will be enrolled to participate&#xD;
      in two (2) phases: A Screening Phase and a Treatment Phase. The total duration of the study&#xD;
      for each subject will be about 10 - 16 weeks. The Re-challenge Test will only be performed&#xD;
      for subjects who experience any type of sensitization during Challenge Period.&#xD;
