  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with disabilities often access rehabilitation services to improve their abilities to&#xD;
      participate in everyday activities. Goal-directed therapy is considered an important&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy to achieve outcomes that are meaningful to families. Not a lot is known&#xD;
      about the effects of goal setting on rehabilitation outcomes. Strategies to help children&#xD;
      participate in the goal-setting process are rarely used in clinical practice. The aim of this&#xD;
      project is to test the effects of a child-focussed goal setting approach, Enhancing Child&#xD;
      Engagement in Goal Setting (ENGAGE), on therapy outcomes. Service use and the cost vs.&#xD;
      benefits of the ENGAGE approach compared to usual practice will also be examined. Children&#xD;
      with neurodevelopmental disabilities aged 5-12 years old (n=96) who access paediatric&#xD;
      rehabilitation services at six rehabilitation sites will participate. Therapists (n=24) at&#xD;
      participating sites in Alberta, Canada will be randomized into 1) the ENGAGE intervention&#xD;
      group or 2) the usual therapy practice control group. Children will participate in the ENGAGE&#xD;
      approach to goal setting or usual practice based on the allocation of their therapist. This&#xD;
      study will determine if the ENGAGE approach to goal setting affects child goal performance,&#xD;
      satisfaction with goal performance, functional abilities, participation, and parent and child&#xD;
      quality of life. The investigators will also evaluate differences in parent and child quality&#xD;
      of life in relation to parent costs (e.g., absenteeism, presenteeism, travel costs) and&#xD;
      compare amount of therapy time between the two groups to see which approach is more&#xD;
      cost-effective and efficient. After the study, children, parents and therapists will be asked&#xD;
      to discuss aspects that influenced effective implementation of the ENGAGE approach. This&#xD;
      study could provide evidence to improve meaningful child and family outcomes in paediatric&#xD;
      rehabilitation and improve efficiency of paediatric rehabilitation services.&#xD;

      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pragmatic trial aims to improve health outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disabilities (NDD) using a novel therapist-targeted, theory-driven, evidence-based approach&#xD;
      to goal setting, the Enhancing Child Engagement in Goal Setting (ENGAGE) approach. This study&#xD;
      includes an economic analysis and service utilization component and an implementation process&#xD;
      analysis to evaluate cost-effectiveness and to support long-term sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary question: Does ENGAGE improve children's engagement in therapy, goal-related&#xD;
      performance (primary outcome), functional abilities, participation in home, school and/or&#xD;
      community, and child and caregiver quality of life compared to the current standard of care?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary questions: 1) What goal, child, family and therapist factors mediate and/or&#xD;
      moderate the effects of ENGAGE on the above intervention outcomes? and 2) Does ENGAGE improve&#xD;
      cost effectiveness from the perspectives of parents and service delivery efficiency compared&#xD;
      to the current standard of care?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY/IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY AND EVALUATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be used with&#xD;
      therapists randomized to one of two groups; the ENGAGE intervention group or the usual care&#xD;
      control group. The RCT will be a six-site trial with two groups (ENGAGE training&#xD;
      absent/present) with two periods of post-intervention assessment (immediate post-treatment&#xD;
      and 3-month follow-up). The trial will take place within established public paediatric&#xD;
      rehabilitation sites in Alberta. An economic analysis consisting of a cost-benefit analysis&#xD;
      from the perspectives of parents and a comparison of service utilization costs will be&#xD;
      conducted in conjunction with the RCT. To facilitate more widespread implementation, a&#xD;
      qualitative process evaluation will be conducted to delineate core versus peripheral&#xD;
      components of the intervention, and therapist, child and parent perspectives on the&#xD;
      contextual features that influenced implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: The sample size will be 96 children (12 therapists as clusters per group and 4&#xD;
      children per therapist) at six sites. Based on the investigators' pilot work, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that child dropout from the pre-post intervention period will be minimal (i.e.,&#xD;
      less than 5%). A target change score of 2.0, a clinically significant change on the COPM&#xD;
      (primary outcome), with a standard deviation of 2.75 corresponds to an effect size of 0.723&#xD;
      for the comparison of means. A sample size of 96 will result in an effect size of at least&#xD;
      0.682 in the primary outcome (COPM performance rating) with alpha=0.05 and 80% power assuming&#xD;
      an intra-cluster correlation (ICC) of 0.1 using a two-sided, cluster adjusted, t-test for the&#xD;
      comparison of means. An ICC of 0.1 was selected based on results of a previous cluster RCT&#xD;
      with children with cerebral palsy (ICCs between 0.08 to 0.13). Since therapist attrition is&#xD;
      possible over the duration of the study, the sampling strategy was designed so that a cluster&#xD;
      size of 11 would still provide 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.716, below the target&#xD;
      effect size. Smaller effect sizes will be detectable if the ICC is smaller than 0.1. The&#xD;
      sample size was adjusted from 88 to 96 to allow for an 8% loss to follow-up (1 therapist, 4&#xD;
      children per group). The investigators do not anticipate retention issues for the baseline&#xD;
      and post-intervention assessments (primary evaluation period). The probability of loss to&#xD;
      follow-up may increase at the 3-month follow-up assessment. The estimate of loss to follow-up&#xD;
      is based on the investigators' experience with trials with children with disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are children who 1) are 5-12 years old, 2) are referred to PT and/or OT&#xD;
      for a period of direct treatment, and 3) speak English. Further inclusion/Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      can be found in the protocol in documents section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Over 18 months, children (n=96) will be sequentially recruited by 24 therapists&#xD;
      from six paediatric Alberta rehabilitation sites (4 children per therapist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: A computer-generated, permuted-block randomization sequence using site as a&#xD;
      stratification variable will be used to allocate 24 OTs and PTs across 6 sites to the ENGAGE&#xD;
      or control group to ensure balanced groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups: Intervention Group - Therapists will receive training on our principles-based&#xD;
      goal setting approach and strategies in the goal setting toolbox. Control group - The control&#xD;
      group will comprise usual care. With the exception of the strategies outlined in ENGAGE,&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions used to achieve identified goals will not vary from usual&#xD;
      practice. Consistent with a pragmatic trial, this approach will enable us to evaluate&#xD;
      effectiveness of ENGAGE in typical clinical settings. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment duration and intensity for both groups will differ based on nature of goals,&#xD;
      treatment strategies, and family preference. It is anticipated that treatment block lengths&#xD;
      will vary from 3-8 sessions over 2-8 weeks, representing typical clinical variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fidelity monitoring- Following the training, the strategies used by ENGAGE therapists will be&#xD;
      tracked to evaluate treatment fidelity prior to recruiting participants. Feedback will be&#xD;
      provided as needed to therapists as part of the implementation plan to facilitate ongoing and&#xD;
      consistent use of the intervention strategies. Treatment frequency, intensity, intervention&#xD;
      strategies, and feedback frequency and mechanisms will be documented by therapists at each&#xD;
      treatment session. Co-interventions will be monitored for each participant. Recruitment and&#xD;
      formalized data collection will begin once intervention therapists at the site achieve an&#xD;
      acceptable level of fidelity defined as adherence to ENGAGE principles at least 90% of the&#xD;
      time. For example, the extent children are involved in identifying their own goals will be&#xD;
      monitored and how often therapists use feedback on goal-related performance at each treatment&#xD;
      session. Practices will also be monitored in the control group using an open-ended form to&#xD;
      prevent contamination from exposure to ENGAGE principles. Ongoing documentation of practices&#xD;
      and monitoring will be used to evaluate the need for additional or different implementation&#xD;
      support in the intervention group and to enable comparison of group practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During ENGAGE training and throughout the study the investigators will reinforce that&#xD;
      intervention therapists need to avoid discussion of principles and practices with the control&#xD;
      group therapists. Therapists will complete a questionnaire about their typical practices with&#xD;
      respect to goal setting at the beginning of the training session (intervention) and&#xD;
      orientation (control). These responses will identify if the control group therapists deviate&#xD;
      from their approach to goal setting used at baseline over the course of the study and allow&#xD;
      for between group comparisons of strategy use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and Outcomes: Identical assessments will be conducted at 1) baseline&#xD;
      (pre-treatment), 2) post-treatment (within 10 days), and 3) at 3-months post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure is goal performance, satisfaction with performance, goal attainment&#xD;
      (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)). All data will be entered into REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An economic analysis consisting of a cost benefit analysis from the family perspective will&#xD;
      be conducted in conjunction with this trial. Costs related to ENGAGE relative to typical care&#xD;
      will be tracked using a therapy session questionnaire for both groups. In addition, total&#xD;
      costs incurred per child during the intervention will be determined by multiplying therapist&#xD;
      direct and indirect (e.g., documentation) time by a corresponding unit price. Mean cost per&#xD;
      child will then be calculated for each group. Costs from the family perspective will be&#xD;
      tracked using a parent questionnaire and outcomes will be parent and child quality of life&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Data and demographic characteristics will be described (e.g., means, standard&#xD;
      deviations) for both groups. Change scores (post minus pre, follow-up minus post) will be&#xD;
      summarized for each outcome, with COPM changes post intervention as the primary analysis&#xD;
      (Question 1) and the other outcomes as secondary analyses. For each change score and outcome,&#xD;
      a cluster adjusted t-test will be used to compare mean change score between groups (ENGAGE,&#xD;
      control). A confidence interval will be reported for the difference between group mean&#xD;
      scores. Mixed effects linear regression models on all outcomes will include group and time&#xD;
      (fixed effects), a therapist random effect (to adjust for the clustering), and a child random&#xD;
      effect (to adjust for repeated measures on each child). Time will be a categorical variable&#xD;
      so that post and follow-up times can be compared with pre-treatment assessments. A time by&#xD;
      group interaction will also be considered to assess the effects of group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 2: Mixed effects multiple linear regression models similar to the above will also be&#xD;
      developed for each outcome with the additional variables of site, site by group as an&#xD;
      interaction (to assess site effect) and other theoretically important variables (e.g.,&#xD;
      cognitive abilities, age, parenting style) as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 3: Mean cost per child and the mean effectiveness result per child for each group&#xD;
      will be represented in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) - the ratio of the&#xD;
      difference between groups in mean cost per patient to the difference in mean effectiveness&#xD;
      using the two quality of life measures (CarerQol and KIDSCREEN) as outcomes. Extensive&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis including probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to test&#xD;
      robustness of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process evaluation: Semi-structured interviews will be conducted during post-intervention&#xD;
      assessment with pairs of parent and child participants (n=24 pairs from the ENGAGE condition;&#xD;
      n=12 pairs from the control condition), stratified by centre, child age and child diagnosis&#xD;
      to ensure variability in the sample. Therapists (n=24) at each of the six sites will also&#xD;
      participate in qualitative interviews to explore their experiences with the ENGAGE approach&#xD;
      and the implementation process.The CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research)&#xD;
      framework will be used in conjunction with the Theoretical Domains Framework to sensitize the&#xD;
      researchers to known barriers and facilitators to implementation. Interviews will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded, professionally transcribed, and last approximately 45-60 minutes. Data will&#xD;
      be analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Journaling will be used throughout data&#xD;
      collection and analysis to record preliminary themes/ideas about the data, experiences in the&#xD;
      research process and reasoning around decisions in data collection and analysis, and to&#xD;
      facilitate research reflexivity.&#xD;

The PEDI-CA T includes domains that align with the I CF-CY domains of activity (daily activities, mobility, social/cognitive) and participation. A parent of each participant will complete the content-balanced version of the PEDI-CA T using iPads at each site. An algorism based on item response theory selects items to minimizes the number ofresponses required, so parents answer up to -30 items/domain.</description>
