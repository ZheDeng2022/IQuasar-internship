    <textblock>
      This trial studies the frequency of cachexia in ambulatory cancer patients and the&#xD;
      psychological burden in patients and their primary caregivers who are referred to an&#xD;
      outpatient supportive care clinic. Studying how often loss of appetite and/or unintentional&#xD;
      weight loss (cachexia) occurs in patients seen in the supportive care clinic may help&#xD;
      researchers develop new ways to lower stress in patients who suffer from loss of appetite and&#xD;
      weight loss as well as their family caregivers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with cancer cachexia, as defined by various&#xD;
      criteria including The European Society of Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) as well&#xD;
      as an International Consensus Criteria (ICC), in a group of ambulatory patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer who are referred to a Supportive Care Clinic at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer&#xD;
      Center (UTMDACC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with complications anorexia (Appetite Score&#xD;
      Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale [ESAS] [&gt;= 3] &amp; Functional Assessment of Anorexia&#xD;
      Therapy-Anorexia/Cachexia Subscale Questionnaire [FAACT-A/CS] =&lt; 37); and the proportion of&#xD;
      patients that have both anorexia and cancer cachexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the association between symptoms of anorexia and/or cancer cachexia and the&#xD;
      degree of symptom distress in cancer patients seen in a supportive care clinic, as measured&#xD;
      by Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS - total score), Hospital Anxiety and Depression&#xD;
      Scale (HADS), and the Functional Assessment of Anorexia Therapy-Anorexia/Cachexia Subscale&#xD;
      (FAACT-A/CS Questionnaire) and in their primary caregivers, ESAS-Caregiver, Caregiver Quality&#xD;
      of Life-Cancer (CQOLC), and Brief Illness Perception (Brief-IPQ) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To elucidate the frequency of Nutritional Impact Symptoms (NIS), evaluated by a&#xD;
      Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA-SF), and alterations in body&#xD;
      composition (Inbody 770 Bio-Impedance Machine) experienced by patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the patient's perception of body image, Body Image Scale (BIS), as related to&#xD;
      their change in weight and physical appearance due to cachexia in patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the perception of need for nutritional support in cancer patients seen in a&#xD;
      supportive care clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete 8 questionnaires about appetite, quality of life, symptoms, history of&#xD;
      weight loss, nutritional status, body image, and nutritional support over 30 minutes.&#xD;
