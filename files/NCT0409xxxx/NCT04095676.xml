    <textblock>
      Pleura empyema is a frequent disease with a high morbidity and a mortality rate of&#xD;
      approximately 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleura empyema is characterized by the passage of three stages (I - III). The aim of treating&#xD;
      the disease is to remove the infection and provide fully expansion of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial treatment at the early stage of the disease (stage I) is simple drainage. In&#xD;
      clinical practice, stages II and III are treated alike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current standard treatment for these stages is drainage with ultrasound (ULS) -guided&#xD;
      pigtail. Simultaneously with drainage, an intrapleural fibrinolyticum can be given. A&#xD;
      potential better alternative is surgery in terms of Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery&#xD;
      (VATS). The theoretical advantage of early surgery is that patients undergo rapid, definitive&#xD;
      treatment. Furthermore, surgery can ensure optimal drain placement. How best to treat these&#xD;
      patients (drainage or surgery) is still under clinical evaluation and depends to a great&#xD;
      extent on local clinical practice. It is only to a limited extent based on scientific&#xD;
      evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if there is a difference in outcome in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with stage II and stage III empyema who either receive primary VATS surgery or ULS&#xD;
      guided drainage and intrapleural therapy (fibrinolytic (altaplasm) with DNase (Pulmozyne ®))&#xD;
      The primary outcome is Hospitalization time and secondary outcomes is e.g. mortality, health&#xD;
      related costs and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study can thus provide new and highly relevant knowledge as well as change the&#xD;
      treatment of these patients, both nationally and internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned that a total of 184 patients will be included in the project. The study takes&#xD;
      place as a collaboration between all four thoracic surgical departments and the major&#xD;
      pulmonary medicine departments in Denmark. In addition, the study has international&#xD;
      collaborators/consultants who will provide counselling in connection with the study.&#xD;

      Intrapleural Fibrinolysis and DNase versus VATS for the treatment of pleural empyema: a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleural empyema is a disease with an infection inside the chest cavity, often as a result of&#xD;
      a pneumonia. In Denmark there are approximately 500 new cases per year. Patients often have&#xD;
      longer duration of hospitalization, and the disease carries a significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality rate of approximately 15%. The state of pleura empyema is characterized by the&#xD;
      passage of three stages (I - III):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parapneumonic effusion (stage I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fibropurulent stage (stage II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic organizing stage (stage III)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of treating the disease is to remove the infection and provide fully expansion of the&#xD;
      lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study we want to find the optimal method for treating patients in stage II and III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial treatment at the early stage of the disease (stage I) is simple drainage and the&#xD;
      disease at later stages can be treated with surgical intervention. In clinical practice,&#xD;
      stages II and III are treated alike. Current standard treatment for these stages is drainage&#xD;
      with ultrasound (ULS) -guided pigtail with a minimum size of 10 F. Simultaneously with&#xD;
      drainage, an intrapleural fibrinolyticum can be given, but the indication and evidence for&#xD;
      this is discussed. In the MIST II study, fibrinolytic (alteplase) was combined with DNase,&#xD;
      and the authors found a positive effect using this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, surgery was associated with a significant morbidity and, to a lesser extent,&#xD;
      mortality. The surgery was conducted as open surgery using a thoracotomy. Today, it can often&#xD;
      be performed as a Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS), which can be performed with a&#xD;
      very low morbidity and mortality. It has been advocated that patients should be operated very&#xD;
      early in the process, but the evidence is weak. In a Cochrane review on surgical versus&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment of pleura empyema, two studies with adult patients have been included.&#xD;
      None of the studies have a size or methodological quality that makes it possible to determine&#xD;
      whether VATS should be included as part of the standard treatment of these patients. In&#xD;
      children (aged &lt;15 years), a randomized, controlled study of 50 patients in each group was&#xD;
      conducted. It found no difference in outcome between fibrinolyticum and VATS, but no fixed&#xD;
      treatment algorithm has been established for this age group. Furthermore, these results&#xD;
      cannot be generalized to an adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theoretical advantage of early surgery is that patients undergo rapid, definitive&#xD;
      treatment and surgery can ensure optimal drain placement. The potential advantages in early&#xD;
      surgery are reduced mortality, admission time, and fewer late complications. In addition, it&#xD;
      is estimated that an increased number of early-operable patients may reduce the proportion of&#xD;
      patients, who will later be thoracotomized, as early surgery may be performed as VATS.&#xD;
      However, there is the inherent risk of an operation and thereby the increased costs of the&#xD;
      surgical procedure when compared to simple drainage. However, this could possibly be&#xD;
      outweighed by reduced drug consumption, reduced need for supplemental drainage, shorter&#xD;
      duration of admission, and reduced morbidity after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, it is necessary to determine whether early VATS should be introduced as standard&#xD;
      therapy in patients with fibropurulent stage (stage II) and the chronic organizing stage&#xD;
      (stage III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis • Patients over 18 years with a fibropurulent stage (stage II) or a chronic&#xD;
      organizing stage (stage III) pleural empyema will have a significantly reduced time of&#xD;
      hospitalization, if they undergo a VATS operation compared to ULS-guided pigtail drainage and&#xD;
      fibrinolyticum (Acitlyse® (altaplasm)) with DNase (Pulmozyne®)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the difference in outcome in patients diagnosed with complex parapneumonic&#xD;
      effusion (stage II), and pleural empyema (stage III) who are treated either VATS surgery or&#xD;
      TUS guided drainage and intrapleural therapy (fibrinolytic (Alteplase) with DNase&#xD;
      (Pulmozyme®)) as first line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected improvements If this trial is positive for the primary and/or the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, it could potentially change and strengthen the treatment of patients with this&#xD;
      disease, both nationally and internationally. We investigate both clinical parameters,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction and economical aspects (cost-effectiveness) in relation to pleura&#xD;
      empyema treatment, so it will cover many aspects of this disease. If the trial is neutral, it&#xD;
      will provide valuable data on intervention that is currently commonly used for this disease&#xD;
      and can guide the treating physician to choose the adequate treatment based on the local&#xD;
      preferences.&#xD;

      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. VATS procedure with drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TUS-guided pigtail catheter placement and intrapleural therapy with Actilyse and DNase&#xD;
           Block randomization with varying block size will be used to get an equal number of&#xD;
           patients in both groups. There will be stratification for each surgical center in the&#xD;
           randomization. The randomization is conducted via a REDCap (Research Electronic Data&#xD;
           Capture), (REDCap Consortium, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Tennessee, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blinding Patients and responsible health care staff will not be blinded. Research staff&#xD;
           not involved in the treatment of the included patients are blinded to treatment&#xD;
           allocations until data analyses are complete. Assessment of different scoring systems&#xD;
           (e.g. TUS and radiology score) are blinded to the extent that it is practically&#xD;
           possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient population and selection All patients admitted during the diagnosis of pleural&#xD;
           empyema or pleural effusion without specification (diagnostic codes: DJ 86, DJ 86.1, DJ&#xD;
           86.9, DJ 90.9), Stages II and III will be potential candidates, whether they are&#xD;
           hospitalized at a Regional Hospital or at a University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Practical issues regarding inclusion of patients Patients who immediately meet the&#xD;
           criteria for inclusion and are interested in participating are informed by one of the&#xD;
           project participants or project nurses from the thoracic surgery department or other&#xD;
           relevant department where the patient is hospitalized. The physical location of&#xD;
           information and randomization will vary with the local organization of hospitals and&#xD;
           departments. If the patient is randomized to VATS, the patient is transferred to one of&#xD;
           the four centers where there is a thoracic surgical department. If the patient is&#xD;
           randomized to ULS guided drainage and intrapleural therapy, the patient is transferred&#xD;
           to one of the specialized pulmonology departments participating in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention Drain and intrapleural therapy group Pigtail is applied as soon as possible&#xD;
           and within 48 hours after randomisation. Drain placement is carried out using ULS.&#xD;
           Operators (conductors of the procedure) must have relevant training and competencies&#xD;
           corresponding to the specialist level within the relevant specialty and be approved by&#xD;
           the steering committee to conduct the procedure. A pigtail catheter (minimum 10F) is&#xD;
           inserted. Operator determines the size of drain and whether drain placement is done with&#xD;
           one-step or Seldinger technic.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intrapleural therapy consists of treatment with the following two drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  intrapleural Actilyse® (alteplase) 10 mg twice daily for three days&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  intrapleural Pulmozyme® (DNase) 5 mg twice daily for three days Both drugs are&#xD;
                administered twice daiyly through the pigtail catheter and are left for one hour in&#xD;
                the pleural cavity by blocking the drain (e.g. closing the three-way-stopcock / use&#xD;
                of a pean forceps). The installation of the drugs in the pleural cavity is&#xD;
                performed seperately with a time interval between administrations of at least two&#xD;
                hours. Actilyse® (alteplase) is preparred by diluting 10 mg Actilyse® (alteplase)&#xD;
                in the solvent liquid (10 ml) supplied alongside the drug in a 50 ml syringe. This&#xD;
                mixture is further diluted by drawing isotonic NaCl into the syringe until the&#xD;
                total volume of fluid in the syringe is 30 ml. Following this preparation the&#xD;
                mixture is injected into the pleural cavity using the pigtail catheter. Pulmozyme®&#xD;
                (DNase) is prepared by drawing 5 ml Pulmozyme® (DNase) (1mg/ml)(5 ml = 2 Pulmozyme&#xD;
                cannisters) into a 50 ml syringe. This mixture is further diluted by drawing&#xD;
                isotonic NaCl into the syringe until the total volume of fluid in the syringe is 30&#xD;
                ml. Following this preparation the mixture is injected into the pleural cavity&#xD;
                using the pigtail catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VATS group The VATS procedure must be completed as soon as possible and no later than 48&#xD;
           hours after randomisation. The surgery is performed with the patient in a 90 degree&#xD;
           sideways position, using general anesthesia. Access is obtained through one to three&#xD;
           ports, followed by purification and possibly decortication, and insertion of one pleural&#xD;
           drain (sizes 24 - 32F) at the end of surgery. 20 ml Marcain is used as local analgetic&#xD;
           and applied at the incision sites or as a nerve block. In the VATS group, suction on&#xD;
           drain (- 15 cm H20) is applied in the first day after the procedure. Operator must have&#xD;
           relevant training and competencies corresponding to the specialist level within the&#xD;
           relevant specialty and be registered and approved by the steering committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the procedure Randomized patients are transferred to a specialized respiratory&#xD;
           medical department or remain at the thoracic surgical department.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Saline flushes In both groups following completion of the intervention flushes of 30 ml&#xD;
           normal saline will be given three times daily to ensure tube patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
           The empiric antibiotic treatment used in all centers is in accordance with the national&#xD;
           guidelines from the Danish Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery and Danish Society for&#xD;
           Respiratory Medicine [19, 20]. Treatment is initiated as intravenous treatment. Type of&#xD;
           antibiotic treatment can be subsequently adjusted depending on results of&#xD;
           microbiological tests. Change to oral treatment can be done when all of the following&#xD;
           three criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical improvement of the patient (e.g. no fever/fever, improved general&#xD;
                condition)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Paraclinically satisfactory response (with respect to decreases in leukocytes and&#xD;
                CRP's)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Drain/pigtail is removed This means that 14 days i.v. treatment will not be given&#xD;
                as standard. The duration of i.v. antibiotic treatment will therefore be individual&#xD;
                based on the application of the above criteria. The overall duration of treatment&#xD;
                of antibiotic is 6 weeks as standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other treatments and supportive care&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Offered specialized lung physiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Screened for and given additional nutritional support&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treated with painkillers in accordance with departmental guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Given thrombosis prophylactic treatment in accordance with national guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
           Need for additional salvage thoracical surgery or non-surgical pleural procedures&#xD;
           Following the primary intervention subsequent decisions during the admission to perform&#xD;
           salvage thoracic surgery or additional non-surgical pleural procedures is made in&#xD;
           accordance with the national guidelines from the Danish Society for Cardiothoracic&#xD;
           Surgery and Danish Society for Respiratory Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Removal of drain/pigtail&#xD;

           The decision to remove the drain / pigtail is made by the clinician attending the&#xD;
           patient. The following criteria are used as a guide for discontinuation of drain/pigtail&#xD;
           in both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical improvement of the patient (e.g. no fever/subfebril, improved general&#xD;
                condition)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Satisfactory biochemical response (with respect to a decrease in leukocytes and&#xD;
                CRPs)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Imaging (TUS, CT or Chest X-ray (CXR) in 2 planes) without significant residual&#xD;
                effusion (&lt; 100 ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Drain with clear pleural fluid by rinsing In both groups removal of drain / pigtail&#xD;
                does not await the results of any of the obtained cultures of the pleural fluid. As&#xD;
                such the presence of negative cultures is used as removal criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Discharge from hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
           In current usual practice in Denmark, patients with pleural empyema are typically&#xD;
           discharged when:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The drain / pigtail has been removed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Antibiotic treatment has been changed from intravenous to oral treatment without&#xD;
                signs of subsequent clinical or paraclinical treatment within one day following the&#xD;
                change These principles are also used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

           Data collection Media&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), REDCap Consortium, Vanderbilt University&#xD;
                Medical Center, Tennessee, USA&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Electronic patient record (EPJ in Region Midt, EPJ in Region North, EPJ (COSMIC) in&#xD;
                Region South and EPJ (EPIC Health Platform) in the Capital Region and Region&#xD;
                Zealand).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Health related costs are retrieved via the National Patient Register (LPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Handling and archiving data All data is entered in a Case Report Form in RedCap. REDCap&#xD;
           is a professional database that provides a user-friendly interface. The REDCap data&#xD;
           management system is secure, fully compliant with all regulatory guidelines, and&#xD;
           includes a complete audit-trail for data entry validation. Through these mechanisms, as&#xD;
           well as relevant training for all involved parties, patient confidentiality will be&#xD;
           safeguarded. REDCap is available for free at both Odense and Aarhus University.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When handling, processing and archiving data collected, the Data Inspectorate's&#xD;
           guidelines are followed, which implies that all personal data are deleted at the end of&#xD;
           the project. The collected data is stored at the Department of CardioThoracic and&#xD;
           Vascular Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital and at Department of Pulmonology, Odense&#xD;
           University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size and power calculation The study is based on assumptions and knowledge about&#xD;
           admission time, both from national and international publications. We calculated the&#xD;
           sample size based on the following assumptions: the main effect target is the difference&#xD;
           between the total time (primary endpoint) between the two groups of patients (VATS&#xD;
           versus drainage). The distribution of the hospitalization time is expected to be skewed&#xD;
           to the right, so that a logarithmic transformation is needed to achieve normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We assume a median hospitalization period in the drainage group of 12 days, a minimum&#xD;
           clinically relevant difference in hospitalization of two days, 80% power, and&#xD;
           coefficient of variation (CV) of 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Significance level is set to 0.05. Thus, 77 patients in each group must be included. To&#xD;
           account for excluded patients (set at 20%), we expect to include 92 patients in each&#xD;
           group. A total of 184 patients is to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In terms of showing clinically relevant non-inferiority with a difference in&#xD;
           hospitalization of 1 day with a 80% power, and CV of 40%, 70 patients is needed in each&#xD;
           group. This is based on a true improvement of 1 hospitalization day. Based on the annual&#xD;
           number of patients diagnosed with pleura empyema in Denmark, we find it feasible to&#xD;
           include the needed number of patients in the trial during the inclusion period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data analysis Data extractions are made from RedCap database. Data analysis is performed&#xD;
           using one of the following: Microsoft® Excel® 2011 (Microsoft Corporation, Washington,&#xD;
           USA), Prism Version 8 for Mac OS X (GraphPad Software, Inc., California, USA), STATA&#xD;
           version 16 (StataCorp LLC, Texas, USA). Endpoints will be described for the individual&#xD;
           group by median and percentile, assuming data is not normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Differences between the groups in the primary endpoint are determined by t-test at the&#xD;
           log-entry time and reported as median ratios with associated confidence intervals.&#xD;
           Patients dying during the admission is omitted from the analysis if the primary&#xD;
           endpoint. Whether death before discharge affects the primary endpoint is assessed using&#xD;
           survival analysis as sensitivity analysis. We expect that the distribution between&#xD;
           stages II and III will be 75% and 25%, respectively, and whether there is a difference&#xD;
           between stages II and III will be assessed as secondary analysis. When repeating&#xD;
           measurements (e.g. quality of life), repeated measurements ANOVA are used with treatment&#xD;
           and time as systematic effects and patient as random effect. All data are analyzed&#xD;
           primarily according to the intention to treat principle, but there will also be one per&#xD;
           protocol analysis regarding the above-mentioned endpoints. Comparison will take place&#xD;
           between the two groups (drainage and VATS).&#xD;

&#xD;
           Risks of participation, ethical considerations and monitoring Common clinical practice&#xD;
           is currently very divergent and there is no national or international consensus on which&#xD;
           of the treatments is preferable (VATS versus drainage). There is thus no safe evidence&#xD;
           for any of the regimes.The individual patient may not immediately benefit from&#xD;
           participating. The results of the study will primarily benefit future patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethics and dissemination All patients provide informed consent before randomisation. The&#xD;
           research project is carried out in accordance with the Helsinki II Declaration, European&#xD;
           regulations and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The Scientific Ethics Committees for&#xD;
           Denmark and the Danish Data Protection Agency have provided permission. Information&#xD;
           about the subjects is protected under the Personal Data Processing Act and the Health&#xD;
           Act. The trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov, and monitored by the regional&#xD;
           Good Clinical Practice monitoring unit. The results of this study will be published in&#xD;
           peer-reviewed journals and presented at various national and international conferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interruption of the experiment Suspected Severe Adverse Reactions suspend the attempt&#xD;
           for the individual patient. However, patient data is still used in the project according&#xD;
           to intention to treat principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Earlier termination of the trial for the individual patient&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the patient wishes to leave the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If unexpected complications occur If leaving the trial, the patient will follow the&#xD;
                department's usual procedure for treating patients treated for pleura empyema. If&#xD;
                the patient wishes to leave the study, the collected data is not used if, as a&#xD;
                result of unexpected complications, the patient cannot receive the intervention the&#xD;
                patient is randomized, the patient enters the data and continues to collect data in&#xD;
                accordance with the intention to treat principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Events and side effects All unintended events and adverse events throughout the&#xD;
           treatment period and until the last call after 30 days are recorded. All Adverse Events&#xD;
           are recorded in the patients Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Agreements with other departments / hospitals All involved departments have signed a&#xD;
           document obligating them to take active part in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All Pulmonary and Thoracic Surgical departements on the four University Hospital has&#xD;
           agreed to participate in the trial The Danish Society of Cardiothoracic Surgery and the&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life and patient reported outcomes within 12 months after hospitalization (measured by European Quality of life (EQ5D)) EQ-5D is a generic quality of life questionnaire that comprises five questions, each with three possible answers. The five questions refer to various dimensions of health-related quality of life: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and anxiety/depression, respectively. Each question is answered with either &quot;no problems&quot;, &quot;some problems&quot;, or &quot;severe problems&quot;</description>

    <description>Health related costs within 12 months after hospitalization hospitalization.The unit is in Euro's).&#xD;
Costs were defined as use of any resource item multiplied by a unit cost. We used a marginal cost concept. That is, we limited the cost measurement to resource items that differed between the two procedures whereas costs that were unaffected by treatment procedure were not included in the analysis. The latter included administrative costs, buildings, electricity, heating, and water.&#xD;
For each patient, we calculated the cost of surgery and drainage, inpatient hospital stays and outpatient hospital visits, consultations with general practitioners, and use of prescription drugs during 52 weeks following intervention.&#xD;
Information on the use of healthcare after discharge was collected from the Danish National Patient Register, The National Health Service Register and The Danish National Prescription Registry, all administered by Statistics Denmark.</description>

    <description>The VATS procedure must be completed as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours after randomisation. The surgery is performed with the patient in a 90 degree sideways position, using general anesthesia. Access is obtained through one to three ports, followed by purification and possibly decortication, and insertion of one pleural drain (sizes 24 - 32F) at the end of surgery. 20 ml Marcain is used as local analgetic and applied at the incision sites or as a nerve block. In the VATS group, suction on drain (- 15 cm H20) is applied in the first day after the procedure. Operator must have relevant training and competencies corresponding to the specialist level within the relevant specialty and be registered and approved by the steering committee.</description>

    <description>Pigtail is applied as soon as possible and within 48 hours after randomisation. Drain placement is carried out using ULS. Operators (conductors of the procedure) must have relevant training and competencies corresponding to the specialist level within the relevant specialty and be approved by the steering committee to conduct the procedure. A pigtail catheter (minimum 10F) is inserted. Operator determines the size of drain and whether drain placement is done with one-step or Seldinger technic.&#xD;
The intrapleural therapy consists of treatment with the following two drugs:&#xD;
intrapleural Actilyse® (alteplase) 10 mg twice daily for three days&#xD;
intrapleural Pulmozyme® (DNase) 5 mg twice daily for three days</description>
