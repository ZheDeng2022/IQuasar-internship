  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II study using the combination of twice weekly ixazomib plus pomalidomide&#xD;
      and dexamethasone in relapsed and or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational drug and tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to&#xD;
      use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved both pomalidomide and ixazomib individually for the treatment of&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. Dexamethasone, also FDA approved, is a type of steroid and is usually&#xD;
      combined with other chemotherapy for the treatment of blood cancers, such as myeloma and&#xD;
      leukemias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ixazomib targets a part of cells called proteasomes. It works by slowing down or&#xD;
           blocking proteasomes from doing their job of digesting proteins. In myeloma cells, there&#xD;
           is a greater need for proteasomes to digest proteins; the buildup of excess proteins&#xD;
           causes cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide has also been shown to cause tumor cell deaths. Dexamethasone can stop&#xD;
           white blood cells from traveling to areas myeloma cells are causing damage. When&#xD;
           combined with myeloma drugs, it sometimes makes those drugs work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing the safety of ixazomib when given with pomalidomide and dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide and ixazomib are given individually for the treatment of multiple myeloma.&#xD;
           Dexamethasone is also given for multiple myeloma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ixazomib when combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone may help control the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ixazomib is FDA approved to treat multiple myeloma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators are looking for the highest dose of ixazomib that can be given safely&#xD;
           in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone&#xD;
