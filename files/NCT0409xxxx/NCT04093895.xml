      A Phase 2, uncontrolled, open-label, single arm study to evaluate the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and efficacy of PerioSept® (3%) as adjunct to Scaling and Root Planing in subjects with&#xD;
      periodontitis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, uncontrolled, single arm study to evaluate PerioSept® as adjunct to Scaling and&#xD;
      Root Planing in Subjects with moderate to severe Periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 12 adult subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 10 evaluable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 study visits will take place for each enrolled subject (V1-V4 within 120 days). An&#xD;
      additional optional follow-up visit (V5) at 6 Months might be added later on. On the baseline&#xD;
      visit at Day 1 (V2) and if needed Day 2 (V2a) patients will undergo full mouth SRP followed&#xD;
      by administration of PerioSept® 3% gel into gingival dental pockets. Treatment of PerioSept®&#xD;
      3% (without SRP) will be repeated at V3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects must have a minimum of 4 qualifying target teeth defined as a tooth with at&#xD;
      least one periodontal pocket with a probing pocket depth (PPD) &gt;= 6mm and bleeding on probing&#xD;
      (BOP) at baseline defined as study pockets. All study pockets will be treated with SRP and&#xD;
      PerioSept®. Additional teeth identified by investigator as needing SRP per standard of care&#xD;
      but not meeting target teeth criteria will be defined as non-target teeth/treatment sites and&#xD;
      may also be treated with SRP and PerioSept®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental parameters will only be assessed on the target teeth and each of the 6 sites&#xD;
      associated with these teeth (assessment sites). Thus, each eligible patient will have at&#xD;
      least 4 Target teeth, a minimum of 4 study pockets and a minimum of 24 assessment sites (6&#xD;
      sites per tooth x 4 target teeth, inclusive of the 4 study pockets) that will be assessed for&#xD;
      all study outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall for all 10 evaluable patients there will be at least 40 target teeth, 40 study&#xD;
      pockets and 240 sites for which the study outcome measures will be assessed as specified&#xD;
      further below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be conducted over a 12 weeks' and optional 24 weeks' (3 and 6 months&#xD;
      respectively) period including safety assessments, assessments of dental parameters (PPD,&#xD;
      Clinical attachment level, BOP, recession, Plaque index, Gingival Index) and tolerability&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

             which the investigator believes may interfere with the periodontal parameters to be&#xD;
             assessed in this study (e.g., significant dental and/or gum/oral tissue work).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SRP or periodontal surgery within 12 months prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject who have a medical and/or dental condition (e.g. a current clinically unstable&#xD;
             occlusal situation) and/or use medications/supplements which the investigator believes&#xD;
             makes him/her unsuitable for participation in the study&#xD;
