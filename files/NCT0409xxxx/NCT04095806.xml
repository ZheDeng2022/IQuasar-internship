      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study in Zanzibar (which Jutta Adelin Jorgensen, PI of ZanStroke, led) showed a&#xD;
      high prevalence of hypertension among adults at 33%, in fact higher than average in&#xD;
      Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and poor performance of the health systems with nearly 90% of&#xD;
      people with hypertension not achieving adequate blood pressure control. Uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension (HTN) and stroke have already become among the commonest causes of admission to&#xD;
      and death at hospital in Zanzibar. At the same time, there is little or no data available to&#xD;
      quantify the stroke burden on types, treatment and outcomes, cost of stroke care, nor a&#xD;
      comprehensive understanding of the causes of poor hypertension control in the population.The&#xD;
      Tanzanian Stroke Incidence study (which Richard Walker from Newcastle University led) showed&#xD;
      some of the highest stroke incidence rates in the world. However, there are many unanswered&#xD;
      questions, and the Zanzibar Stroke Study will be a unique opportunity to look at all stroke&#xD;
      admissions from a large island population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zanzibar Stroke Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses investigated are&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. Current challenges in stroke care cannot exclusively be explained by limited structural&#xD;
      resources, and care delivering processes play an essential role.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. b. Current organization and quality of care for stroke including rehabilitation could&#xD;
           benefit from being aligned with best practices for low resource settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a. Stroke types, causes, and prognosis are dominated by a higher proportion of&#xD;
           hemorrhagic strokes, associated to poorly controlled hypertension, higher 30-day&#xD;
           mortality, and worse prognosis in terms of disability and mortality at 12 months than&#xD;
           seen in high income settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2b Long term stroke outcome is not only depending on stroke severity but also on&#xD;
      sociodemographic/economic factors with worse prognosis for the poorest part of the&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3a. There is a significant first stage delay due to local perceptions and beliefs around&#xD;
      stroke which prohibits biomedical treatment in the prognostically important acute phase of&#xD;
      stroke 3b. There are untapped resources in the community that could be leveraged to increase&#xD;
      adherence to medical treatment to control BP to prevent stroke and re-stroke, as well as&#xD;
      making rehabilitation accessible 4a. Introducing a hypertension care package at lowest&#xD;
      primary care level for people at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk to prevent stroke and&#xD;
      re-stroke is cost-effective, affordable, and possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4b. With no intervention, the cost of stroke care at hospital level will in 10 years exceed&#xD;
      the cost of all reproductive and child health (RCH) services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ZanStroke is an observational, prospective study of stroke admissions to hospitals in&#xD;
      Zanzibar (Unguja) enrolling all patients with a recent stroke (&lt; 30 days) over a period of&#xD;
      one year to investigate the burden of stroke disease, risk factors and outcome up till 12&#xD;
      months post-stroke. This will be done through establishing a stroke patient register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant data will include sociodemographic and -economic information, vascular risk&#xD;
      factors and previous medical history, routine head-CT, routine biochemical results and other&#xD;
      investigations, as well as early and long-term outcomes (deaths, disability,&#xD;
      independence/functionality, quality of life, cognition, medicine adherence, rehabilitation&#xD;
      therapy, re-stroke).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 80% of stroke patients in Unguja, Zanzibar who seek hospital care are admitted&#xD;
      to the main hospital and the nearby private hospital, and these will undergo CT head scan,&#xD;
      but this will not be possible in all of the other six hospitals. We will take blood samples&#xD;
      and store serum and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for potential future analysis from the main&#xD;
      hospital and the nearby private hospital only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the clinical epidemiological research, qualitative and health economic&#xD;
      evaluation research will be undertaken to understand stroke patients and caretakers life&#xD;
      worlds and perspectives, health care providers skills and practices, organization and&#xD;
      processes of stroke care at hospital level, and to define a set of most cost-effective&#xD;
      interventions to prevent and treat stroke in the particular Zanzibar context.&#xD;

      Current and future benefits and impacts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the demographic transition and population ageing in SSA rates of stroke are set to&#xD;
      continue to increase rapidly as part of the double burden of disease (still a major burden of&#xD;
      infectious diseases, as well as an unfinished agenda of maternal and newborn health).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have already established a global high level of hypertension in the adult&#xD;
      population in Zanzibar, and low performance of the health system for managing this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to identify the peculiar genomic, gene-environmental and environmental risk&#xD;
      and protective factors for stroke occurrence, pattern, type, outcome, and current incidence&#xD;
      velocity in SSA in order to inform preventive measures especially effective and&#xD;
      cost-effective control of raised blood pressure/hypertension; the best model for the&#xD;
      provision of inpatient care and rehabilitation in a resource poor environment with lack of&#xD;
      access to dedicated stroke units and limited multidisciplinary team input; and to include the&#xD;
      particular East Africa population in existing or future international stroke collaborations&#xD;
      to ensure that genetic variations relevant to the population there are represented.&#xD;

    <description>disability of stroke patients as measured using the modified Ranking Scale (mRS) at 30 days post stroke.&#xD;
The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) assesses disability in patients who have suffered a stroke and is compared over time to check for recovery and degree of continued disability. A score of 0 is no disability, 5 is disability requiring constant care for all needs; 6 is death.&#xD;
The mRS has been used in clinical research for over 30 years and is a common standard for assessing functional outcomes in patients with stroke.&#xD;
Multiple studies have shown that the mRS correlates with physiological indicators such as stroke type, lesion size and neurological impairment as assessed by other stroke evaluation scale</description>

    <description>Cognitive impairment of stroke patients 3 and 12 months post stroke using the Identification and Intervention for Dementia in Elderly Africans (IDEA) cognitive screening tool .&#xD;
The first 4 items involve being able to name a bridge from a description of its use, knowing the day of the week, knowing the name of the village chief/ town mayor/ city governor and naming as many animals as possible in one minute (score 2 for ≥ 8 animals, score 1 for 4-7 animals, score 0 for 0-3 animals). Item 5 is a 10-word recall test (score 1 point for each word up to a maximum of 5 points). The sixth item is designed to measure praxis and involves a matchstick design test with scores ranging from 0 (no matchsticks placed correctly), to 3 (all four matchsticks placed correctly).&#xD;
The maximum possible score is 15 and the minimum 0, with a higher score indicating better cognitive function. 7/8 is used as a cut-off for dementia, and 10/11 a cut-off for cognitive impairment</description>

    <measure>Health related Quality of Life at 3 and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 12 months post stroke; data collected over 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life among stroke patients 3 and 12 months post stroke using the 5-level EQ-5D instrument.&#xD;
The EQ-5D is a standardized non-disease specific instrument to describe and value health-related quality of life and consist of a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS).&#xD;
The descriptive system comprises of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels. The patient indicates his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.&#xD;
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale ( 0-10), where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' (0) and 'The worst health you can imagine' (10).</description>

    <time_frame>3 and 12 months post stroke; data collected over 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medicine adherence among stroke patients 3 and 12 months post stroke using the Medicine Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ).&#xD;
MAQ is a standardized instrument to assess intentional and un-intentional non-adherence and consist of four questions with response options yes or no. No to all responses = good adherence, while one or more Yes to responses = non-adherent. Non-adherence can be identified as mainly unintentional (factor 1) or purposeful (factor 2), or mixed.</description>
