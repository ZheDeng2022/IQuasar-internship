    <textblock>
      Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is a group of inflammatory rheumatic conditions with&#xD;
      inflammatory back pain caused by inflammation in the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) and back as&#xD;
      hallmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no laboratory test or biomarker is cable of differentiating between patients with&#xD;
      early-stage axSpA and persisting low back pain of other causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the predictive value of baseline levels of the&#xD;
      biomarkers Complement C3d and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (HsCRP) identifying bone&#xD;
      marrow oedema (BME) at MRI of the SIJ at baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, no laboratory test or biomarker is cable of differentiating between patients with&#xD;
      early-stage axSpA and persisting low back pain of other causes. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)&#xD;
      B27 is not an acute biomarker, but a prognostic marker for the development of axSpA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) is commonly used as an acute biomarker in different inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions. Previous studies have shown that only 40-60% of ankylosing spondylitis (AS)&#xD;
      patients with clinical signs of active disease have elevated levels of CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier studies regarding the complement C3 split product C3d have shown a correlation&#xD;
      between inflammatory diseases like AS and elevation of C3d. Those studies were based on a&#xD;
      small number of cases, but a newer study from 2016 has shown a correlation between different&#xD;
      biomarkers, including C3 and new fatty lesions at MRI in Golimumab treated AS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To investigate the predictive value of baseline levels of C3d and hsCRP identifying&#xD;
      bone marrow oedema (BME) at MRI of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective cohort study including patients, aged 18-45 years, having&#xD;
      unspecific low back pain registered in the Spines of Southern Denmark (SSD) cohort including&#xD;
      patients referred to the Spine Centre of Southern Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, all patients filled in a standardised questionnaire and were interviewed&#xD;
      identifying inflammatory symptoms followed by a clinical examination focusing on symptoms&#xD;
      related to the SIJ. Blood samples were taken and analysed for HLA-B27 (prognostic biomarker).&#xD;
      Furthermore, all patients underwent an MRI of the spine including the SIJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 1037 patients were included, 696 had blood tests taken and gave consent for further&#xD;
      use for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For research purposes, the blood samples were stored in the Molecular Biology of Infectious&#xD;
      Agents in the Early Diagnosis of Spondyloarthritis biobank (MICSA). The biobank is hosted by&#xD;
      the research group at Graasten Rheumatological Hospital. Of the 696 patients who gave&#xD;
      consent,188 patients were examined by a Rheumatologist at baseline. Of those 96 patients&#xD;
      fulfilled the criteria of having axSpA according to The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis&#xD;
      international Society (ASAS) criteria, 38 patients had inflammatory changes at MRI or had one&#xD;
      feature consisting with spondyloarthritis, but did not fulfil the ASAS criteria. 82 randomly&#xD;
      selected patients with low back pain were included as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 216 patients were defined as the cohort included for further analysis in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Vejle Hospital has previously assisted in the&#xD;
      collection and storage of MICSA samples. It is technically possible to use the stored frozen&#xD;
      MICSA samples for analysing C3d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 184 (of 216) baseline samples were accessible for further analysis. The baseline&#xD;
      samples will be analysed for C3d with the use of EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)&#xD;
      plasma and treated according to the local protocol for such analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in the MICSA cohort have had an MRI of the spine including the SIJ at baseline.&#xD;
      Two experienced radiologists have systematically described the MRI regarding signs of&#xD;
      inflammatory changes including BME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATA (version 15.0) will be used for statistical analysis. Parametric data will be reported&#xD;
      as the mean and standard derivation (SD) or One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). In&#xD;
      between-group comparisons for continuous and categorical demographic variables will be&#xD;
      performed with the independent sample t-test and Pearson Chi-square test or Fisher´s exact&#xD;
      test. The Kruskal-Wallis test and interquartile range will be used to describe nonparametric&#xD;
      data. Logistic regression analysis will be used to test independent variables as predictive&#xD;
      factors for BME detected by MRI, resulting in odds-ratios, sensitivity, specificity, and area&#xD;
      under the curve (AUC). This will be followed by multivariate logistic regression to evaluate&#xD;
      the potential effect of other variables. A p-value &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study with patients suspected of having spondyloarthritis has found a significant&#xD;
      difference in mean levels of C3 between groups with 23 and 22 participants, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the use of means and SD from the above study and alfa= 0.05, beta= 0.2, power 0.8 and&#xD;
      enrollment ratio 1:2 the sample size in our study is calculated to n:10 and n:20&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore expected, that a significant difference in C3d levels between the three&#xD;
      groups in the present study can be detected based on the size of each group in the MISCA&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
