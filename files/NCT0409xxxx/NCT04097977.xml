      Introduction Over the past 20 years there has been an overall deterioration in the mental&#xD;
      health of young people. An increasing number of young people are diagnosed with emotional&#xD;
      disorders such as anxiety and depression. Overall, mental health problems represent the&#xD;
      greatest health burden among adolescents. This means that many young people have difficulties&#xD;
      in meeting demands, and challenges in education and employment. Thus, it is estimated that up&#xD;
      to 60% dropout in education is due to mental health problems. Therefore, an educational,&#xD;
      well-coordinated and early intervention is needed to support the young person's recovery&#xD;
      process by activating the young person's social network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design The project is designed as a non-randomized intervention study with a&#xD;
      control group. Comparative analyzes will be performed with pre- and post-assessments, as&#xD;
      outlined in Figure 1. The study involves a regional hospital in mental health and five&#xD;
      municipalities. The trial takes place from January 2020 to December 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The RENEW-S intervention consists of two key elements: collaborative networking&#xD;
      and a youth group that will form the basis of real user involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The participants are young adults aged 18 - 30 years with experiences as an&#xD;
      inpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for recruitment Questionnaires administered to the patients within the first 48&#xD;
      hours after admission, at discharge, 1 month after discharge and 3 months after discharge&#xD;
      (Figure 1). Patients who did not consent to participation or failed to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire at the beginning of their stay were excluded from the study, as were those&#xD;
      hospitalized for less than a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Information of participants and data management is in accordance with the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration. The project is reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency and the Region&#xD;
      Zealand Ethics Committee. Data are entered into the EasyTrial © Online Clinical Trial&#xD;
      Management system. All personal identifiers will be removed or disguised during analysis to&#xD;
      preclude personal identification.&#xD;

      Introduction Over the past 20 years there has been an overall deterioration in the mental&#xD;
      health of young people. An increasing number of young people are diagnosed with emotional&#xD;
      disorders such as anxiety and depression. Overall, mental health problems represent the&#xD;
      greatest health burden among adolescents. This means that many young people have difficulties&#xD;
      in meeting demands, and challenges in education and employment. Thus, it is estimated that up&#xD;
      to 60% dropout in education is due to mental health problems. Therefore, an educational,&#xD;
      well-coordinated and early intervention is needed to support the young person's recovery&#xD;
      process by activating the young person's social network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1996, a group of US researchers and practitioners initiated an educational support model&#xD;
      called RENEW (Rehabilitation for Empowerment, Natural Support, Education and Work) targeting&#xD;
      young people with mental health difficulties. The primary goal of RENEW is to enhance young&#xD;
      people's well-being through social inclusion and education, focusing on building young&#xD;
      people's own capacities by supporting them in utilizing their existing social networks and&#xD;
      adding new contacts in their path towards education and work. This support model has shown&#xD;
      positive results with young people, where in particular their educational attainment and&#xD;
      self-reported level of function have been improved. In 2013, the Psychiatric Center in&#xD;
      Ballerup (Denmark) and the University of New Hampshire (USA) established a collaboration to&#xD;
      investigate whether RENEW could be implemented in a Danish psychiatric setting, and achieve&#xD;
      positive results as well. Young people with mental health difficulties have expressed lack of&#xD;
      coherence in their pathways, which may result that the young people's problems are not dealt&#xD;
      with in a timely manner, so that their problems worsen. It also means, there is a high risk&#xD;
      that they will abandon education and become increasingly ill. New research by Tew et al also&#xD;
      suggests that the network may have a greater impact than conventional treatment for young&#xD;
      people with mental disorders. Thus, the Psychiatric Center in Ballerup wanted to create a&#xD;
      greater degree of cohesion for the young people in their pathways across services through&#xD;
      stronger cross-sectoral and team-based collaboration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Psychiatric Center Ballerup model has primarily focused on young outpatients and in&#xD;
      municipal context. However, since the young inpatients usually have a greater need for&#xD;
      support both in terms of their mental state, but also in relation to educational support and&#xD;
      to support the young person's social network. Consequently, an improved intervention is&#xD;
      needed to target this group: In order to prevent the development and aggravation of mental&#xD;
      illness, there is a need for early intervention, recovery and inclusion of people with mental&#xD;
      illness in education, work and everyday life. This project is based on the RENEW model and&#xD;
      rooted in Psychiatry in Slagelse: RENEW-S. There is also a great desire for a high degree of&#xD;
      user involvement in the project, partly for the purpose of learning for all parties involved,&#xD;
      and partly to strengthen implementation. Involving users in the research project will enhance&#xD;
      our understanding of young adults' perspectives in relation to the young person's&#xD;
      hospitalization, social network, own resources and network based recovery. However, there is&#xD;
      a lack of stakeholder involvement in this type of research. Co-operative inquiry is a&#xD;
      research method that involves stakeholders such as service users and health professionals, as&#xD;
      co-researchers. In co-operative inquiry, the production of knowledge is a joint venture among&#xD;
      stakeholders and researchers who work together to create relevant and practice-oriented&#xD;
      knowledge by means of the three following research steps: preparation, intervention and study&#xD;
      outcomes assessment. The purpose of the project is to develop a network-based approach to the&#xD;
      young inpatients with mental illness aged 18-30 years in order to strengthen the young&#xD;
      person's social network and own resources using the RENEW model so that the young person&#xD;
      achieves a higher degree of recovery, as well as education and employment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis The research steps The research are involving the three steps:&#xD;
      preparation, intervention and study outcomes assessment (see Table 1 for the timetable and&#xD;
      tasks in relation to the research steps): A systematic review and focus interviews of young&#xD;
      adults with mental illness together with health professionals are planned to inform the&#xD;
      intervention. The preparation step regarding the systematic review is further explained in&#xD;
      the Prospero protocol (ID: 151202). Likewise, further details concerning the planning and&#xD;
      preparing of the focus group interviews are planned to be published as a study protocol in a&#xD;
      qualitative journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The project is designed as a non-randomized intervention study with a control&#xD;
      group. Comparative analyzes will be performed with pre- and post-assessments, as outlined in&#xD;
      Figure 1. The study involves a regional hospital in mental health and five municipalities.&#xD;
      The trial takes place from January 2020 to December 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The RENEW-S intervention consists of two key elements: collaborative networking&#xD;
      and a youth group that will form the basis of real user involvement. The final version of the&#xD;
      intervention can only be determined on the basis of the results of the research steps 1+2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Network meetings The RENEW-S network meetings is fundamental for this approach. It is about&#xD;
      using the young persons' network and their own available resources. The social network is of&#xD;
      great importance to the young person's recovery process. First meeting between the young&#xD;
      person and the facilitator is about what the young person can expect, and information about&#xD;
      the principles and ideas behind RENEW-S. The RENEW-S process consists of 4 general phases: 1)&#xD;
      a mapping process 2) the development of a team to support goal attainment 3) implementing the&#xD;
      plans 4) preparation for exiting RENEW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finishing the mapping process, the young adults start working on their goals in&#xD;
      collaboration with their support team, and participate in a weekly youth group (See Appendix:&#xD;
      Additional description of the Network meetings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth group The group is structured around the same agenda each time, starting with a&#xD;
      presentation round, followed by an activity within the topic of the day, and finishing with&#xD;
      sharing experiences of the activity in plenum. The young people can find inspiration&#xD;
      regarding themes and exercises in the RENEW manual: Exercises include: 1) tasks and&#xD;
      activities recommended by other young people or professionals 2) different recovery-oriented&#xD;
      activities and cognitive / behavioral therapeutics exercises (25) 3) short films developed by&#xD;
      the anti-stigma campaign &quot;One of us&quot; (2018) 4) field trips with a social purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training of facilitators and staff Facilitators are trained within each of the subject&#xD;
      groups; nurse, doctor, physiotherapist, psychologist, and social worker. The training is&#xD;
      planned to be conducted by the responsible project manager (RENEW) in Ballerup. The total&#xD;
      staff will be introduced to the RENEW-S model at two initial workshops, as well as ongoing&#xD;
      supervision every 14 days throughout the project period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting The study took place at the Psychiatric Hospital in Slagelse, Denmark, which consists&#xD;
      of four inpatient wards, an outpatient clinic, and an emergency ward serving a mixed urban&#xD;
      and rural district. The department of psychiatry has 80 beds, 1995 discharges, and 39,391&#xD;
      visits to its outpatient clinics per year (2017 figures, obtained from HR department, Mental&#xD;
      Health Services, Slagelse). As part of the publicly funded hospital services, the mental&#xD;
      health services are administered by Region Zealand, one of Denmark's five regional health&#xD;
      authorities, serving a population of 821,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The participants are young adults aged 18 - 30 years with experiences as an&#xD;
      inpatient. The study include inpatients admitted from October 2020 to April 2022, and the&#xD;
      patients suffered from psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, psychosis, major&#xD;
      depression, bipolar disorder, and severe personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for recruitment Questionnaires administered to the patients within the first 48&#xD;
      hours after admission, at discharge, 1 month after discharge and 3 months after discharge&#xD;
      (Figure 1). Patients who did not consent to participation or failed to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire at the beginning of their stay were excluded from the study, as were those&#xD;
      hospitalized for less than a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size calculation is based on an intervention study with SF-36 as the&#xD;
      primary outcome, also conducted in Psychiatry (23). In this study, there is a clinically&#xD;
      relevant effect size 0.5 with a power 80 ((α = 0.05). Based on this study's sample size&#xD;
      calculation, 120 patients in each group are needed (intervention and control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Descriptive analysis Categorical data will be presented by numbers and&#xD;
      proportions; continuous variables are shown by median and quartiles. Baseline data will be&#xD;
      compared between the groups. The X2 test or Fisher's exact test are used for the analysis of&#xD;
      categorical variables. For analysis of varians (ANOVA) and Kruskal -Wallis test are used for&#xD;
      non-parametric and non-normally distributed variables, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary analysis All analyses will be conducted based on the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle. Missing outcomes will be imputed and for non-adherence to protocol, a per-protocol&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted as sensitivity analysis. A non-response analysis will be carried&#xD;
      out for excluded patients and non-completers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination Information of participants and data management is in accordance&#xD;
      with the Helsinki Declaration. The project is reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency&#xD;
      and the Region Zealand Ethics Committee. Data are entered into the EasyTrial © Online&#xD;
      Clinical Trial Management system. All personal identifiers will be removed or disguised&#xD;
      during analysis to preclude personal identification. The following articles are planned for&#xD;
      publication: 1) The effects of networked based recovery in a mental health setting: findings&#xD;
      from a systematic review 2) Networked-based recovery in mental health: Inpatient experiences&#xD;
      3) Improved patient-reported outcomes after network-based recovery to young adults in mental&#xD;
      health: A nonrandomized clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organization The project is organized with a steering group, a project group. All groups&#xD;
      include users with experiences from hospitalization in mental health services, health&#xD;
      professionals and researchers. The steering group is responsible for the project being&#xD;
      implemented in accordance with the project description, deciding on changes and approving the&#xD;
      framework and resources. The steering group consists of two users, who have been hospitalized&#xD;
      and diagnosed with a psychiatric diagnoses, and involved in other projects with user&#xD;
      involvement. The project group is responsible for day-to-day operations, including ensuring&#xD;
      that the project's stakeholders are involved in the process, as well as conducting the actual&#xD;
      intervention, such as assessments of impact, and application for external funds. Moreover,&#xD;
      recruitment of project staff and information about the project. The project group is also&#xD;
      responsible for ensuring the necessary research strength in the study design, methods and&#xD;
      analyses, including publication of results. The project group consists of five users from the&#xD;
      user panel in Psychiatry in Region Zealand.&#xD;
