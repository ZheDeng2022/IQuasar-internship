    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well polarized dendritic cell (aDC1) vaccine, interferon&#xD;
      alpha-2, rintatolimod, and celecoxib work together in treating patients with HLA-A2 positive&#xD;
      (+) melanoma that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). The aDC1 vaccine&#xD;
      contains white blood cells (dendritic cells or DCs) that stimulates the immune system.&#xD;
      Interferon alpha-2 can improve the body?s natural response to infections and other diseases.&#xD;
      It can also interfere with the division of cancer cells and slow tumor growth. Rintalolimid&#xD;
      may stimulate the immune system. Celecoxib is a drug that reduces pain. This study is being&#xD;
      done to find out if aDC1 vaccine, interferon alpha-2, rintatolimod, and celecoxib can prevent&#xD;
      the growth and/or progression of melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the objective response rate to treatment with an autologous alpha-type-1&#xD;
      polarized dendritic cells (alphaDC1)/TBVA vaccine (alpha-type-1-polarized dendritic cells&#xD;
      loaded with tumor blood vessel-targeting antigenic peptides) plus cytokine modulating (CKM)&#xD;
      regimen (rintatolimod, recombinant interferon alpha-2 [IFN-alpha2b] and, celecoxib) in human&#xD;
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2+ subjects with primary PD-1 resistant immuno-oncology&#xD;
      (IO)-refractory melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the immune-related objective response rate (objective response rate [ORR]; per&#xD;
      immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [iRECIST];) in the above patient&#xD;
      population treated with autologous alphaDC1/TBVA vaccine plus cytokine CKM regimen followed&#xD;
      by re-treatment with PD1 blockade (+/- CTLA4 blockade).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate rate of durable responses (&gt; 6 months) on the combination treatment in the above&#xD;
      patient population treated with autologous alphaDC1/TBVA vaccine plus cytokine CKM regimen&#xD;
      followed by re-treatment with PD1 blockade (+/- CTLA4 blockade).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine whether the combination of peptide-loaded autologous alphaDC1 vaccines and&#xD;
      tumor-selective chemokine modulation (CKM: IFN-a2b, rintatolimod, and celecoxib) improves the&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) and immune-related progression-free survival (iPFS) in HLA-A2+ subjects&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1-refractory melanoma compared to the historical control of the best supportive&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Identify the intratumoral and systemic immune correlates of the response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive recombinant interferon alpha-2 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes,&#xD;
      rintatolimod IV over 2.5 hours, and celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3.&#xD;
      Beginning cycle 2, patients also receive alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cells intradermally&#xD;
      (ID) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. At 12 weeks, patients with progressive disease may&#xD;
      switch to ipilimumab with or without a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and patients with a complete&#xD;
      response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) may switch to a PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      inhibitor or best alternative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
