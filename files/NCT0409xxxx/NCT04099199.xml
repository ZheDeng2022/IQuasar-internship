      This is a multicenter study with a minimum of three CLIA-Waived intended operator sites in&#xD;
      which prospectively collected vaginal swab specimens will be evaluated with the Click Sexual&#xD;
      Health Test as compared to standard of care. The specimen collection will occur over one&#xD;
      study visit for each enrolled subject, but study staff will continue to follow the subject&#xD;
      through standard of care until the subject receives treatment or she is lost to follow up.&#xD;
