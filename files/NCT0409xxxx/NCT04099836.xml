  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of giving atezolizumab&#xD;
      combined with bevacizumab in patients with stage 4 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#xD;
      mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose cancer has gotten worse while receiving&#xD;
      osimertinib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be single arm, open label, phase 2 study which will include patients with&#xD;
      stage 4 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations and who have progressed on osimertinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although both atezolizumab and bevacizumab are approved for the treatment of NSCLC, the&#xD;
      combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab has not been approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of specific non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have one of the following EGRF mutations: exon 19 or exon 21 L858R with&#xD;
      progressive disease on osimertinib may be eligible to participate in this study. If enrolled&#xD;
      into the study, the study team will give the patient atezolizumab (1200 mg) combined with&#xD;
      bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks intravenously. As part of this study, the patient will&#xD;
      have blood samples, other tests, exams, and procedures done for study purposes and their&#xD;
      standard of care. Patient participation in the study will last for up to 2 years after&#xD;
      completion of the last dose of the study drug or until your condition worsens or intolerable&#xD;
      adverse events as deemed by the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are possible patient risks to this study that include but are not limited to diarrhea,&#xD;
      itching, rash, and a feeling of weakness.&#xD;
