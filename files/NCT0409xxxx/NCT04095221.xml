  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the study drug prexasertib is a safe and&#xD;
      effective treatment for people with DSRCT or RMS when given in combination with the standard&#xD;
      drugs irinotecan and temozolomide. The study will test different doses of prexasertib in&#xD;
      combination with irinotecan and temozolomide to find the highest dose of prexasertib that&#xD;
      causes few or mild side effects in participants.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single institution study to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of prexasertib when given in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide. Patients with relapsed or refractory desmoplastic small round cell tumor or rhabdomyosarcoma of any subtype will receive prexasertib using the 3+3 dose-escalation schema.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The RP2D is defined as the highest dose level associated with not more than 1 DLT out of 6 patients. A total of 5 dose levels are planned, including 2 back up levels. The DLT's will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design.</description>
