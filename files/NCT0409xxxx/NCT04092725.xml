  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover study to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of repeated oral doses of SCY-078 (Ibrexafungerp) on the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran&#xD;
      administered orally to healthy subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The two-period crossover study will consist of two treatments administered in random order.&#xD;
      Treatments will be separated by a minimum of 10 day wash-out (between last dose in the first&#xD;
      period and first dose in the subsequent period). Healthy male and female subjects will will&#xD;
      be enrolled to assess the effects on a single dose of dabigatran mesylate (DAB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened within 4 weeks prior to dosing and randomized to a treatment&#xD;
      sequence (AB or BA) in a crossover fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment A: Single oral 150mg dose of DAB. Treatment B: Twice daily (BID), every 12 hours&#xD;
      (Q12H) oral doses of SCY-078 750mg on Day and Day 2; and single oral AM doses of SCY-078&#xD;
      750mg on Day 3 and Day. On Day 3, a single 150mg dose of DAB will be administered 1 hour&#xD;
      after the AM dose of SCY-078.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will fast overnight after being admitted to the clinic on Day -1 and will remain in&#xD;
      the clinic until the final procedures are complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty eight male and female subjects between 18 and 55 years (inclusive) will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study. Subjects who discontinue may be replaced.&#xD;
