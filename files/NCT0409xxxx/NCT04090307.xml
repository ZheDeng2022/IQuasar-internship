  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a randomized trial to determine the effect of Targeted Lifestyle Change Group&#xD;
      Prenatal Care (TLC) on maternal and neonatal outcomes in women at high risk for developing&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long term, the investigator aims to test the central hypothesis that those in TLC will have&#xD;
      better maternal and neonatal outcomes than those in TC. The objective is to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized trial to determine the effect of TLC group prenatal care on birthweight and&#xD;
      neonatal body composition, maternal healthy lifestyle and diabetes-related outcomes, delivery&#xD;
      and neonatal outcomes, and psychosocial stress and depression.&#xD;

    <description>TLC will start in the late first trimester or early second trimester and run for ~6-10 sessions. Groups of 2-10 consented women, with two or more GDM risk factors, will meet under the supervision of an obstetric provider (nurse practitioner or MD) and co-facilitator (health educator, nutritionist, or nurse) for two-hour sessions. A major focus of TLC will be education, and much of each visit will be spent on pregnancy, exercise/nutrition education, and behavioral health.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to routine care will receive their prenatal care with their primary obstetric provider. Patients are seen for 10-15 minutes every four weeks until 28 weeks' gestation, every two weeks (or more by provider discretion) until 37 weeks and weekly until delivery. Visits focus on routine screening tests and prenatal care. Traditional care participants will receive a phone call once a month, until 28 weeks gestation, from a nurse practitioner to check-in on pregnancy goals, healthy eating, and exercise. Each subject's medical chart will be reviewed for demographics, antenatal management, maternal and neonatal outcomes.</description>
