  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure is a major cause for development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In&#xD;
      patients with CKD, high blood pressure is the most important risk factor that worsens kidney&#xD;
      and heart function and leads to kidney failure. The problem is more pronounced for patients&#xD;
      living in remote communities, as studies have shown that these patients often receive low&#xD;
      quality of care and substandard monitoring of their health. The current medical practice of&#xD;
      using office-obtained BP measurements to monitor and treat patients with CKD and hypertension&#xD;
      is negatively impacting the health of patients with CKD who live in remote areas. Regular BP&#xD;
      monitoring is required to ensure that BP levels are in the appropriate range as recommended&#xD;
      by standardized medical guidelines. Home BP monitoring can be used to ensure that BP is in&#xD;
      the right range and is recommended for all patients with high BP. Studies in other healthcare&#xD;
      systems show that to optimally perform home monitoring, readings should be tele-transmitted&#xD;
      (electronically sent to the care provider). Studies have also indicated that BP control&#xD;
      improves when healthcare providers regularly review tele-transmitted BP readings of patients&#xD;
      and using standardized care protocols, make adjustments to their treatment plan. Information&#xD;
      on the value of telemonitoring in the management of BP among patients with CKD living in&#xD;
      remote communities is lacking across the globe. Therefore, we will conduct a study that will&#xD;
      compare usual care to telemonitoring and case management in CKD patients living in remote&#xD;
      areas. This study aims to prove that telemonitoring works well in monitoring and treating&#xD;
      high blood pressure in patients with CKD, and may help reduce the risk of worsening heart and&#xD;
      kidney health in these patients. We anticipate that telemonitoring and case management of BP&#xD;
      among remote dwellers with CKD and hypertension will optimize BP control (i.e., avoid under-&#xD;
      and over-treatment), thereby improving outcomes compared to the usual care&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Our project is based on implementation of a telemonitoring and case management BP program for&#xD;
      remote dwellers with diabetes and CKD in remote regions of Alberta. Our aim is to determine&#xD;
      the impact of the intervention on BP control and other CKD risk factors, achievement of&#xD;
      guideline-concordant therapeutic targets, evaluate barriers and enablers of implementation of&#xD;
      the proposed model of care, patient-centred evaluation and economic modelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To determine the effectiveness of telemonitoring and protocol-based case&#xD;
      management versus usual care Objective 2: To analyze the usability and acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention Objective 3: To determine the cost-effectiveness and cost utility of the&#xD;
      intervention versus usual care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (a) improved process of care (control of BP and other CKD risk factors); (b) evidence on user&#xD;
      acceptability and safety of the intervention; and (c) better understanding of factors&#xD;
      affecting implementation, scale-up and sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, Randomization, and Allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the clinical care of&#xD;
      remote dwelling hypertensive CKD patients. Independently of the study team, the EPICORE&#xD;
      Centre (www.epicore.ualberta.ca) will randomly assign 200 patients to each study arm (1:1):&#xD;
      home-based BP telemonitoring plus protocol-based case management versus usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in select remote communities in the Peace Region of Northern&#xD;
      Alberta over a period of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age â‰¥ 18 years with a documented diagnosis of established CKD (eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2&#xD;
           and/or proteinuria &gt; 1 g/day), and uncontrolled hypertension (not concordant with the&#xD;
           guideline target for CKD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  English literacy, both verbal and written&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ability and willingness to provide informed consent for participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  systolic BP level &gt; 220 mmHg or diastolic BP level &gt; 110 mmHg on screening BP&#xD;
           measurement; immediate consultation with a hypertension specialist will be expedited&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BP within the recommended range&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  terminal illness (life expectancy &lt; 1 y)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participation in a concurrent nephrology or cardiovascular trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient resides in an area without mobile phone coverage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be provided with a home BP telemonitoring system whereby a patient pushes a&#xD;
      single button on a home BP monitor to initiate measurement, and data are auto-transmitted via&#xD;
      Bluetooth to an Android smartphone and relayed to a secured web portal for review. Patients&#xD;
      will receive a validated electronic upper arm oscillometric BP device (A&amp;D Ltd. UA-651BLE;&#xD;
      San Jose, CA) and an Android smartphone with a prepaid SIM card (enabling wireless data&#xD;
      transmission). Patients will take four measurements daily for 1 week using recommended&#xD;
      techniques. If BP is uncontrolled (high or low), this 1-week protocol will be followed each&#xD;
      month until BP is in the therapeutic range. Once controlled, the 1-week protocol will be&#xD;
      repeated every 3 months. Teletransmitted BP readings will be summarized within the health&#xD;
      portal using telemonitoring software, which will calculate an overall weekly mean by&#xD;
      discarding first-day measurements and averaging the subsequent 24 measurements over the next&#xD;
      6 days. Temporal trends will be plotted. The BP data will be teletransmitted to the study&#xD;
      case manager, who will review lifestyle modifications, BP self-monitoring and medication&#xD;
      adherence. The case manager will also review telemonitored health portal BP summaries, make&#xD;
      protocol-based therapeutic adjustments and send summaries to participants' PCPs to inform&#xD;
      them of treatment changes. Medications will be adjusted based on existing treatment&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the control arm (usual standard care), participants' home BP series mean, trends, and&#xD;
      individual readings will be sent via secure electronic medical records (EMR) to their PCP&#xD;
      along with a 1-page summary of Canadian guidelines for BP thresholds, targets, and treatments&#xD;
      relevant for CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demographics and health behaviours: age, sex, race, smoking, alcohol intake;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  past medical history, particularly significant CVD (coronary artery disease, stroke,&#xD;
           peripheral arterial disease, heart failure);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medication history (BP-lowering drugs): name, type, dosage, frequency, duration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anthropometric indices: height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  upper mid-arm circumference (to determine proper cuff size) using standard measures;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hr ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), home BP series, and pulse rate; BP will be&#xD;
           measured according to recommended techniques using validated devices;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  laboratory investigations: serum electrolytes, glycated hemoglobin (A1c), lipids panel,&#xD;
           urinary albumin/creatinine ratio;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  health care use in past year: physician and/or emergency room visits, and&#xD;
           hospitalizations ascertained through patient self-reports and/or provincial&#xD;
           administrative data sources;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life and utility measurements (Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 [KDQOL-36]&#xD;
           Euro-QOL 5D [EQ-5D] as a preference-based utility measure); and Patient Assessment of&#xD;
           Chronic Illness Care [PACIC].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up data will be collected at 6 months and 1 year, measured as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical endpoints and patient-centred outcomes: 24-hr ABPM, telemonitored home BP,&#xD;
           heart rate, medications, anthropometrics, cardiovascular risk factors and markers (A1c,&#xD;
           lipids, smoking, urinary albumin), health care use, quality of life and utility, and&#xD;
           satisfaction with medical care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  safety endpoints: frequency of syncope and hypotension requiring assistance or medical&#xD;
           attention and/or electrolyte disturbances;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  user acceptability: two 10-point Likert scales used to evaluate usability and&#xD;
           acceptability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  costing data: trial-based costing using the three-step micro-costing technique of&#xD;
           identification, measurement and valuation of relevant health care and non-health care&#xD;
           resources using standard methods, with focus on cost of telemonitoring and case&#xD;
           management, health care costs (through linkage with Alberta Health data), and&#xD;
           patient-borne costs (patient survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Effectiveness of telemonitoring and protocol-based case management versus usual&#xD;
      care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the 1-year difference in the proportion of patients meeting the&#xD;
      guideline-concordant BP target between intervention and control groups. We will use 24-hour&#xD;
      ABPM because it is the gold standard measurement and the best validated clinical trial BP&#xD;
      endpoint. Major secondary outcomes will include the change in mean 24-hour systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic BP (overall, daytime and nighttime). First, we will use descriptive statistics to&#xD;
      summarize key variables as appropriate, including assessments of temporal trends and tests of&#xD;
      normality. Second, we will calculate the 6-month and 1-year mean changes from baseline in&#xD;
      each outcome and compare them between study arms using chi-square tests for dichotomous&#xD;
      outcomes and unpaired t-tests for continuous outcomes. Third, we will identify multivariable&#xD;
      predictors of the 1-year change in a given outcome using appropriately constructed and&#xD;
      calibrated logistic regression models for dichotomous outcomes (including the primary&#xD;
      outcome) or linear regression models for continuous outcomes. Initial models will be&#xD;
      appropriately adjusted for key confounding demographic, clinical and laboratory variables.&#xD;
      Missing data will be handled using last observation carried forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Usability and acceptability of the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of usability and acceptability is critical for all technology-enhanced care&#xD;
      interventions to minimize risk of undesired consequences commonly seen post-implementation.&#xD;
      End-user input into system design and operation, and rigorous system evaluation is important&#xD;
      to reduce the risk that interventions will be ineffective, unusable or unsafe. We will take a&#xD;
      qualitative approach to this process by using focus groups. A target sample size of 5 to 8&#xD;
      participants will be recruited from patients in the telemonitoring arm and care providers.&#xD;
      The first 5 users typically identify 70% of severe usability problems and the first 8 users&#xD;
      typically identify 85%; a higher sample size has low incremental yield because of data&#xD;
      saturation.Focus groups will be conducted for each of the group (patients and care providers)&#xD;
      at baseline and follow-up. Sessions will be audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed&#xD;
      using the methodology of interpretive description (ID). NVIVO, a qualitative software system,&#xD;
      will be used to create a filing system and coding database. The first focus group in each&#xD;
      group will be read and re-read to generate an initial codebook. The codebook will be&#xD;
      iteratively refined throughout the analysis. Codes will be categorized and analyzed&#xD;
      thematically. Patient and clinician data will first be analyzed separately, and then across&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Cost-effectiveness and cost utility of the intervention versus usual care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness (Model A) and cost utility (Model B) of the intervention compared with the&#xD;
      control arm will be analyzed using a modified version of a validated economic model. Best&#xD;
      practices for economic evaluation will be followed. The intervention includes intermittent or&#xD;
      one-time costs (e.g., devices, treatment algorithm development, patient and health care&#xD;
      professional training) and ongoing costs (e.g., network and data, case manager time, BP&#xD;
      medications). Data captured during the RCT will accurately determine the costs of&#xD;
      telemonitoring, case management, and health care system use by patients. The change in BP at&#xD;
      1 year, a validated surrogate, is a key variable in both analyses. Model A will calculate the&#xD;
      cost per decrement in mean BP using a 1-year time horizon and a public health care payer&#xD;
      perspective. Model B will estimate incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)&#xD;
      gained over a lifetime. It will consider longer-term health outcomes, including the&#xD;
      probability of developing ESRD (requiring dialysis or transplant) or major cardiovascular&#xD;
      events (i.e., coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke), all-cause mortality, impacts&#xD;
      on quality of life (EQ-5D), and health care costs associated with these outcomes. In each&#xD;
      model we will explore distributions using bootstrapping, create acceptability curves, and&#xD;
      perform one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of uncertainty&#xD;
      in key model parameters. In Model B, the potential impact of reducing complications of&#xD;
      treating hypertension in patients with CKD (hypotension, syncope) by a plausible range will&#xD;
      be explored in sensitivity analysis using baseline risk determined from a population-based&#xD;
      cohort of patients and ambulatory care sensitive conditions for emergency room visits and&#xD;
      hospitalizations.&#xD;
