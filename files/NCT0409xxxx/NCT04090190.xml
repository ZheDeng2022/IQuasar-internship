  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is a very common condition affecting women of all ages. The&#xD;
      objective of this pilot study is to better understand the urinary microbiome and associated&#xD;
      inflammatory markers in blood and urine in women with urgency UI. The study will assess how&#xD;
      inflammation may affect response to standard of care anticholinergic medication treatment for&#xD;
      urgency urinary incontinence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective pilot study of women presenting to the Urogynecology&#xD;
      clinic with urgency urinary incontinence symptoms who are offered treatment with a standard&#xD;
      of care anticholinergic medication for six weeks. The patient will be asked to provide a&#xD;
      clean catch urine sample and blood draw. Study participants will fill out a Urinary Distress&#xD;
      Inventory-6 (UDI-6) questionnaire at baseline and keep a bladder diary before starting the&#xD;
      anticholinergic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urine will be assessed by enhanced urine cultures and DNA sequencing for urinary&#xD;
      microbiome along with inflammatory mediators in the urine. Inflammatory mediators in both the&#xD;
      blood and urine will be measured using immuonenzyme assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements for microbiome will be repeated for all patients at 6 weeks. Baseline urinary&#xD;
      symptoms at enrollment and variation of symptoms after 6 weeks of anticholinergic treatment&#xD;
      will be assessed using the UDI-6 questionnaire and a bladder diary.&#xD;

    <description>Study participants will be evaluated for urgency urinary incontinence and will be offered treatment with a standard of care anticholinergic medication for 6 weeks. All study participants will fill out the UDI-6 and two day bladder diary at baseline before starting anticholinergic medication treatment. Participants will then provide a urine sample and blood draw to be assessed for urinary microbiome and inflammation. Anticholinergic medication will be taken daily for 6 weeks and the same procedures (UDI-6 questionnaire, bladder diary, urine sample except the blood draw for assessment) will be performed at the 6-week time period.</description>
