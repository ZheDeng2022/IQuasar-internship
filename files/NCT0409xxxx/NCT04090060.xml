  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anal cancer is a common cancer among gay, bisexual and other men having sex with men (MSM).&#xD;
      Its annual incidence is approximately 50-fold and 5-fold higher among HIV-positive MSM and&#xD;
      HIV-negative MSM, respectively, compared to the rest of the general population. Like cervical&#xD;
      cancer, it is primarily caused by human papillomaviruses (HPV). Unlike cervical cancer, there&#xD;
      is no efficacious treatment for anal precancers as there is for cervical precancers. To date,&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials have failed to find an efficacious treatment although other trials&#xD;
      continue; thus, professional societies recommend an annual digital ano-rectal exam (DARE) for&#xD;
      detection of anal abnormalities, including small tumors, among all MSM. But DARE is&#xD;
      underutilized, e.g., most persons, regardless of HIV do not receive an annual DARE and most&#xD;
      HIV physicians do not perform the exam. Therefore, alternative methods for early detection&#xD;
      are needed because early detection of small tumors is associated with &gt;85% 5-year survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even though expert opinion recommends annual digital ano-rectal exams (DARE) for detection of&#xD;
      anal cancer tumors among men having sex with men (MSM), the procedure is severely&#xD;
      underutilized by clinicians and it is not known how to increase utilization. This is&#xD;
      problematic in the context of an extremely high incidence of anal cancer among MSM, no proven&#xD;
      treatment for anal precancerous lesions, and lack of screening infrastructure for detecting&#xD;
      precancerous lesions, even in high-resource countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this study is to decrease morbidity and mortality from anal cancer by&#xD;
      increasing detection of anal canal tumors through self- or partner-palpation of the anal&#xD;
      canal. Preliminary data indicate these exams are feasible and highly acceptable among MSM. In&#xD;
      a diverse sample of 200 MSM, 93% of men correctly classified their anal self-exam (ASE) or&#xD;
      anal companion exam (ACE) as either normal or abnormal, and 94% said the exams were&#xD;
      acceptable. Given these findings, our overall objective is to determine the viability of the&#xD;
      ASE and ACE by assessing exam accuracy and consistency of results in two clinic sites.&#xD;
      Accuracy will be defined as concordance between clinician DARE and participant exam. The&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that both ASE and ACE at visit 1 will have ≥70% sensitivity and ≥90%&#xD;
      specificity using the clinician DARE as the gold standard at each of two visits. We will test&#xD;
      the hypothesis with three specific aims: 1) Estimate ASE and ACE sensitivity and specificity;&#xD;
      2) Determine independent factors associated with ASE and ACE concordance; and 3) Determine&#xD;
      the impact of ASE, ACE, and DARE on survival and quality of life, and evaluate the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of these strategies among HIV+ and HIV- MSM and transgender persons. The&#xD;
      aims will be accomplished with a study in Houston and Chicago with a sample of 100 couples&#xD;
      (i.e., 200 partners) and 600 single persons (one-half HIV-positive), aged &gt;=25 years, who&#xD;
      will perform a clinician-taught ASE or ACE. The individual's ASE and partner's ACE will then&#xD;
      be compared with the clinician's DARE. The assessment will be done at each of two visits,&#xD;
      spaced six-months apart, to assess retention of exam accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of visit 1, one-half of participants, i.e., 300 individuals and 50 couples&#xD;
      (stratified by city) will be randomly selected and encouraged to practice the ASE/ACE three&#xD;
      months before Visit 2. Study staff will make reminder calls (or emails/texts) and follow-up&#xD;
      calls for the scheduled practice session. At the follow-up calls, study staff will record the&#xD;
      participant's result for the self/companion exam and the level of anxiety and pain, if any,&#xD;
      associated with the exam. If the participant reports more than minimal pain and anxiety, they&#xD;
      will be asked to return to the clinic for an HCP exam. Regardless of prior results, all&#xD;
      persons will be asked to return for Visit 2.&#xD;
