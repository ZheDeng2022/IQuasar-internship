  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite careful patient selection for subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS),&#xD;
      some Parkinson's disease (PD) patients show limited improvement of motor disability.&#xD;
      Non-conclusive results and the lack of a practical implantable prediction algorithm from&#xD;
      previous prediction studies maintain the need for a simple tool for neurologists that&#xD;
      provides a reliable prediction on postoperative motor improvement for individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a prior developed prediction model for motor response after STN DBS in PD&#xD;
      patients is validated. The model generates individual probabilities for becoming a weak&#xD;
      responder one year after surgery. The model will be validated in a validation cohort&#xD;
      collected from several international centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predictive model is made public accessible before data collection on:&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Predicting motor outcome after STN DBS in Parkinson Disease can be challenging for the&#xD;
      clinician. Current prediction studies report non-conclusive results on the most important&#xD;
      predictors and are limited by used computational methods. Traditional statistical analyses&#xD;
      which focus on correlations are biased by predictor- and confounder-selection by the&#xD;
      investigators. Modern computational methods like machine learning prediction models are less&#xD;
      limited by sample size and can consider a wider range of predictors which leads to less&#xD;
      selection-bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective patient data is collected from multiple international centers. This&#xD;
      retrospective, multicenter cohort is used to validate the model which is developed based on a&#xD;
      single-center retrospective cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to develop a prediction tool that provides the clinician with a probability for&#xD;
      weak response during the preoperative phase. This could support the clinician in including or&#xD;
      informing the patient during preoperative counseling.&#xD;

    <description>Motor outcome is categorised in a binary outcome variable. The model will predict to which outcome group the patient will belong one-year postoperatively. The primary outcome measure is the performance of the predicted outcome categories with the actual outcome categories.&#xD;
Performance of prediction models is expressed as area under the curve of the receiver operator curve, predictive accuracy, true positive prediction rate, and false positive prediction rate.</description>
