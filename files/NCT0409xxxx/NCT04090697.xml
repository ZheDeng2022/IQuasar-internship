  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine if clinically relevant doses of buccally&#xD;
      administered oxandrolone are safe and tolerable in neonates with hypoplastic left heart&#xD;
      syndrome (HLHS) or other single right ventricular anomalies who have undergone a Norwood&#xD;
      procedure. The secondary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of buccally administered oxandrolone&#xD;
      in improving objective indices of growth and nutrition in neonates who have undergone a&#xD;
      Norwood procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed investigation is a Phase I/II randomized trial of 28 days of open label&#xD;
      oxandrolone vs. no oxandrolone treatment to assess optimal dosing, safety/tolerability, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of this therapy in post-Norwood neonates with HLHS. Control subjects&#xD;
      will receive standard therapy with no placebo and no oxandrolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is aimed at cumulative dose finding as well as a preliminary assessment of&#xD;
      safety/tolerability and efficacy. The design and dosing are based upon preliminary phase I&#xD;
      data obtained as part of an ongoing protocol under IND #107706. This trial will initially&#xD;
      include two arms (control and 0.1 mg/kg oxandrolone BID). This initial oxandrolone dose was&#xD;
      chosen based on the preliminary data collected in the background studies conducted for this&#xD;
      trial. There were no adverse safety outcomes in the small cohort of subjects receiving 0.1&#xD;
      mg/kg of oxandrolone BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 1, subjects will be block randomized into each arm in a 1:4 (control to&#xD;
      oxandrolone) ratio. An interim analysis of the safety data will be performed after the first&#xD;
      25 subjects in Cohort 1 have been randomized and have completed 28 days of oxandrolone&#xD;
      therapy or observation (control group). If there are no significant differences in the&#xD;
      primary safely/tolerability outcome and safety reviews are favorable for BID dosing, then&#xD;
      Cohort 2 (25 subjects) will be randomized in a 1:4 ratio to the control and TID dosing arms.&#xD;
      A similar interim analysis will be performed after Cohort 2 subjects have been randomized and&#xD;
      completed 28 days of oxandrolone therapy. Enrollment will again be suspended during this&#xD;
      second interim analysis to determine if dose escalation is warranted. Cohort 3A, utilizing&#xD;
      0.15 mg/kg oxandrolone TID would be possible if both Cohorts 1 (0.1 mg/kg BID) and 2 (0.1&#xD;
      mg/kg/dose TID) do not demonstrate any differences in the primary safety/tolerability outcome&#xD;
      compared to controls and safety reviews are favorable (Figure 4). If the safety threshold is&#xD;
      crossed, then a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/dose BID will be used for cohort 3B. An interim safety&#xD;
      analysis will be performed after 25 subjects have been enrolled in this highest dosing arm.&#xD;
      If at any point a risk-benefit balance in any cohort is found to be negative, then further&#xD;
      enrollment will proceed at the lower dosing arm determined to be safe/tolerable based on the&#xD;
      primary outcome and safety review with a 1:4 control:oxandrolone ratio and a total subject&#xD;
      number of 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the second interim safety analysis leads to the conclusion that the lower dose (0.1 mg/kg&#xD;
      oxandrolone BID) appears to be safe and well tolerated, while the higher dose (0.1 mg/kg&#xD;
      oxandrolone TID) is not, then the enrollment will proceed in the 0.1 mg/kg BID arm with a 1:4&#xD;
      ratio. If the lowest dose of oxandrolone (0.1 mg/kg BID) is found to be unsafe, then the&#xD;
      trial will be stopped. The benefit of this approach lies in the ability to allocate patients&#xD;
      to the highest safe dose arm thus enriching the relevance of safety/tolerability and efficacy&#xD;
      information obtained. A higher-dose treatment arm will be used if the data reveal the initial&#xD;
      treatment arm is not different from control with regards to the primary outcome. If no&#xD;
      safety/tolerability effect is demonstrated, the trial will, by design, function as a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial with dose-escalation. It is anticipated that the study will&#xD;
      conclude with approximately 80 oxandrolone patients (in up to three dosing arms) and 20&#xD;
      control patients.&#xD;
