  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ANA catheter system (may also be designated as &quot;ANA system&quot;, &quot;ANA 18 -002&quot; or &quot;ANA&#xD;
      device&quot;) is a distal access catheter designed to assist in neurovascular procedures by&#xD;
      facilitating the insertion and guiding of other devices (i.e. retrieval devices and&#xD;
      intravascular catheters) and restricting blood flow at the target position. It is a sterile,&#xD;
      single-use, disposable intravascular device comprised of two coaxial catheters (delivery&#xD;
      catheter and funnel catheter) consisting of sections of variable stiffness. The funnel&#xD;
      catheter is comprised of a radiopaque nitinol braid (self-expanding funnel), covered by a&#xD;
      continuous silicone coating that, when deployed, provides local and temporary flow&#xD;
      restriction. The delivery catheter has a hydrophilic coating to reduce friction during use&#xD;
      and a radiopaque marker on the distal end. Both catheters have Luer lock hubs on their&#xD;
      proximal end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study has been designed to collect prospective clinical evidence to compare the&#xD;
      Anaconda ANA device to similar devices used for guiding and supporting stent retrievers&#xD;
      during neurothrombectomy procedures. The protocol has been designed to replicate the patient&#xD;
      population enrolled in prior studies of similar devices. The primary endpoint will be ability&#xD;
      of the investigational device to facilitate stentriever deployment and neurothrombectomy in&#xD;
      the anterior circulation, with successful reperfusion defined as achieving a modified&#xD;
      Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) score of ≥2b in the target vessel with ≤3 passes&#xD;
      of the investigational device without the use of rescue therapy. Follow-up at 24h, Day 5 (+/-&#xD;
      12 h) or discharge, whichever comes first and at 90 days will allow documentation of the&#xD;
      clinical outcome of the neurothrombectomy procedure as a whole and detect any device related&#xD;
      and other complications, making use of the ANA device for distal access.&#xD;

    <description>Intra-arterial recanalization therapy or mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a therapeutic option for patients who are not candidates for t-PA or in whom t-PA has failed. MT is performed by means of various devices (Merci Revive, Penumbra, etc.). There are currently two major approaches to MT: the so-called stent retrievers (used with or without a balloon catheter), and catheters used for direct aspiration (manual with syringe or by aspiration pump via distal access catheters [DACs]). Moreover, both techniques can be combined. MT may be performed following IV t-PA, as a stand alone therapy, or in conjunction with IA thrombolysis.</description>
