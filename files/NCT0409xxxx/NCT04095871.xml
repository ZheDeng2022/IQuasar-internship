  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clean Intermittent Self-Catheterization (CISC) is a procedure of regularly emptying the&#xD;
      bladder by introducing a single-use urinary catheter through the urethra. CISC are indicated&#xD;
      in several situations in patients with neurological pathologies but also with urological or&#xD;
      functional disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The announcement of the indication of CISC is often difficult and the acceptance of this&#xD;
      therapy remains complicated, due to the invasive side, the dependence on a material and the&#xD;
      time required to perform CISC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies have assessed patient satisfaction and adherence to self-catheterization&#xD;
      through quality of life questionnaires, but none have examined the impact of this technique&#xD;
      on daily life through the duration of CISC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim is to evaluate the impact of time to perform CISC on patient adherence and&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over 18 years old performed CISC for more than 1 month, exclusive or not, are&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History and treatment, age, professional activity, visuals disorders, technical aids for&#xD;
      walking and the history of CISC with the date of initiation, the type of catheter, the&#xD;
      carrier, the number of CISC per 24 hours, the position of realization, the use of a mirror&#xD;
      and urethral sensitivity are recorded. Cognitive disorders, fatigue, psychological state,&#xD;
      impact on quality of life are assessed on the day of the patient's consultation. The grip of&#xD;
      the upper limbs is explored by Box and Block and Nine Hole Peg Test. The validated&#xD;
      questionnaires,Intermittent Catheterization Satisfaction Questionnaire ( InCaSaQ),&#xD;
      Intermittent Catheterization Difficulty Questionnaire (ICDQ), Intermittent Catheterization&#xD;
      Adherence Scale (ICAS) are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At home, patients have to complete one calendar on the specific duration of a 24-hour&#xD;
      self-catheterization and the next day a second calendar on the total duration of CISC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is specific time of self-catheterization described by the timed duration from&#xD;
      the moment when the circumstances of care are combined to carry it out : isolated place,&#xD;
      nearby equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome is total time of self-catheterization described by the timed duration from&#xD;
      the moment of the intention to self-catheter until the return to the initial activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influence of age, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), American Spinal Injury Association&#xD;
      (ASIA), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Moca), Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Box and Block and&#xD;
      Nine Hole Peg Test, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Qualiveen&#xD;
      Total,Intermittent Catheterization Satisfaction Questionnaire (InCaSaQ), Intermittent&#xD;
      Catheterization Difficulty Questionnaire (ICDQ), Intermittent Catheterization Adherence Scale&#xD;
      (ICAS) on time of self-catheterization are analysis.&#xD;
