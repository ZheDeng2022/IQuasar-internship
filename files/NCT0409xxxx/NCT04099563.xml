             (diastolic), following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is &gt;=140 mm Hg&#xD;
             (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the&#xD;
             average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single&#xD;
             repeat test, if deemed necessary: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT) level &gt;=1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); Total bilirubin&#xD;
             level &gt;1 × ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have direct&#xD;
             bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin&#xD;
