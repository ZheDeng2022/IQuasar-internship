      Myocardial infarction (MI), is a type of acute coronary syndrome, in which there is damage to&#xD;
      the cardiac muscle as demonstrated by increased cardiac Troponin levels in the setting of&#xD;
      acute ischemia (1). Myocardial infarction (MI) is a fatal disease that is caused by block in&#xD;
      the oxygen supply of blood vessels of the heart muscle, leading to permanent heart muscle&#xD;
      damage and death of its cells. According to world health organization (WHO) report published&#xD;
      in 2014, 68% of global deaths annually related to non communicable diseases, Cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases constitute 31% of these deaths denoting that they are the leading cause of death&#xD;
      (2). Risk factors of cardiovascular diseases include behavioral factors as eating un healthy&#xD;
      food, smoking, alcohol intake, and other substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding management of MI, There have been several studies that have shown the superiority&#xD;
      of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as a treatment for ST-elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (STEMI) when compared with thrombolytic therapy in terms of reducing mortality&#xD;
      rate and recurrence of myocardial infarction (MI) [3-5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding Drug abuse cardiovascular effects. It depends on the drug, dose, and route of&#xD;
      administration, cardiovascular consequences can range from innocuous side effects, to life&#xD;
      threatening ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sympathomimetic drugs like amphetamines cause an increase in release of peripheral&#xD;
      catecholamines stimulating increases in heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, and cardiac&#xD;
      contractility, thus resulting in augmentation of cardiac output and blood pressure. In&#xD;
      contrast, several drugs are directly cardiodepressant in the acute setting, and many drugs of&#xD;
      both types are cardiotoxic causing cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure with long-term&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the balance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand with drug use can lead to&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia. For example, cocaine increases oxygen demand in the myocardium while&#xD;
      simultaneously decreasing supply by inducing epicardial coronary vasoconstriction. Modulation&#xD;
      of lipid profiles, coagulation factors, platelet function, and inflammation further heighten&#xD;
      the risk of cardiac ischemic events in patients using these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many recreational drugs are arrhythmogenic in the acute setting or during&#xD;
      abstinence/withdrawal. Mechanisms of arrhythmias are complex and likely result from interplay&#xD;
      between the direct effects of drugs, electrolyte derangements, sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      alterations, and cardiac ischemia.(6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substance Use Disorders (SUD) are considered to be prevalent In Middle Eastern Arab&#xD;
      countries, particularly Egypt, but there is scarce information on the problem of patients&#xD;
      with substance abuse or dependence attending emergency rooms in general hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In across sectional study done in EL Mansoura University in 2012, Among patients with&#xD;
      substance abuse, cannabis ranked first (3.6%) then tramadol 1.8%, polysubstance1.7%, followed&#xD;
      by stimulants group (1.3%), alcohol (1.1%), and finally anticholinergics (0.5%) and volatile&#xD;
      substances (0.3%). Urine toxicology shows that 30% used at least one of these illicit drugs:&#xD;
      (20%) tested positive for cannabis, (6%) had a positive urine screen for amphetamine, and&#xD;
      (10%) tested positive for opiates.(7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have reported discrepant results on the association between substance use&#xD;
      disorders and access to Primary PCI after acute myocardial infarct (AMI) [8]. Druss and&#xD;
      colleagues showed that patients with SUDs aged 65 and older in acute care non-governmental&#xD;
      hospitals in the United States were less likely than those with neither mental nor substance&#xD;
      use disorder to receive cardiac catheterization after acute MI [9]. Young reported data&#xD;
      stratified by age, indicating that patients with SUDs both younger and older than 65 years&#xD;
      have lower rates of cardiac procedures and higher rates of in-hospital mortality compared&#xD;
      with those with neither mental nor substance use disorders [10]. Most recently, Jones and&#xD;
      colleagues published results from an analysis of administrative data from a large&#xD;
      commercially insured sample of all ages, adjusting for comorbidities.(11) They obtained an&#xD;
      unexpected result: those with SUDs were more likely to receive percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) in comparison to those with neither mental nor substance use disorders.&#xD;
