  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first in human study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      single ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of intravenous PNT001 in healthy adult participants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 clinical trial is a multicenter, double-blind, single ascending dose trial&#xD;
      evaluating safety in up to a total of 48 participants across up to 6 dose cohorts, 5 planned&#xD;
      and 1 to be determined if an additional dose group is required. Each cohort will include 8&#xD;
      participants (6 active, 2 placebo) who will receive a single dose of either PNT001 or&#xD;
      placebo. Within each cohort a sentinel group of 2 participants (1 active, 1 placebo) will be&#xD;
      enrolled to evaluate safety and tolerability before enrolling the full cohort. If there are&#xD;
      no safety concerns (as determined by the data and safety monitoring board [DSMB]), the&#xD;
      remaining 6 participants (randomized as 5 active, 1 placebo) will be enrolled. This process&#xD;
      will be followed for all additional cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, and laboratory assessments at Day -1, eligible participants will be admitted&#xD;
      to the research unit on Day 1 (or Day -1 at Investigator's discretion), where they will&#xD;
      remain for three (or four) nights with standardized meals provided during their inpatient&#xD;
      stay. On Day 1, participants will be randomized to receive either active drug or placebo.&#xD;
      Study medication will be administered as a single i.v. infusion over 30 minutes (up to 60&#xD;
      minutes for doses greater than 2,700 mg), followed by collection of safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      PK data over 16 weeks. Participants will be discharged on Day 4 and will return for an&#xD;
      outpatient study visit on Day 5 (may be phone or clinic visit), and to the study site on Days&#xD;
      7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, and 112.&#xD;
