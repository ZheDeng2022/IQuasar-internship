    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to observe the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      WATCHMAN FLX™ Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Device for subjects with non-valvular&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation to reduce the risk of stroke in Hong Kong area.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center observational study. The primary&#xD;
      Effectiveness Endpoint is the occurrence of non-effective LAA closure defined as any&#xD;
      peri-device flow &gt; 5mm demonstrated by TEE/CT/MRI at First Follow-up.The primary safety&#xD;
      endpoint is the occurrence of one of the following events between the time of implant and&#xD;
      within 7 days following the procedure or by hospital discharge, whichever is later: all-cause&#xD;
      death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device or procedure related events requiring&#xD;
      open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention such as pseudoaneurysm repair, AV&#xD;
      fistula repair, or other major endovascular repair. Secondary effectiveness endpoint is the&#xD;
      occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism at 12 months from the time of implant.&#xD;
