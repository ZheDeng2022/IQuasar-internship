  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and availability of commercial CGM&#xD;
      products to patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes has made the use of CGM more widespread.&#xD;
      CGMs work by placing a probe underneath the skin of a patient, into the interstitial space.&#xD;
      Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who are on intermittent hemodialysis (iHD) or&#xD;
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) undergo fluid shifts between the interstitial fluid and&#xD;
      intravascular space during dialysis treatments.These fluid shifts, uremia, acidosis, and&#xD;
      volume overload (increase in interstitial fluid volume due to ESRD) have the potential to&#xD;
      impact the performance of the most advanced and commercially available CGMs; however, use of&#xD;
      CGM in these patients has not yet been studied.Use of CGM, and potentially hybrid closed loop&#xD;
      insulin delivery systems that are dependent on accurate continuous glucose monitoring, has&#xD;
      the potential to improve glucose control and quality of life in these patients (7). This&#xD;
      study team feels that this study will be valuable in collecting preliminary data needed with&#xD;
      the goal of validating the use of CGM in this patient population. The specific aim is to&#xD;
      conduct a pilot study to evaluate the accuracy of continuous glucose monitors (CGM) in End&#xD;
      Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients on intermittent hemodialysis (iHD).&#xD;

      Recent advances in continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and availability of commercial CGM&#xD;
      products to patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes has made the use of CGM more widespread&#xD;
      (1). CGMs work by placing a probe underneath the skin of a patient, into the interstitial&#xD;
      space. The probe is an electroenzymatic sensor which uses glucose oxidase to break down&#xD;
      glucose to create hydrogen peroxidase and other elements. Hydrogen peroxidase then interacts&#xD;
      with a base metal layer of the sensor and is oxidized, which results in release of electrons&#xD;
      which creates a current. The current is proportional to the glucose concentration. The&#xD;
      current is measured by the probe and transmits a calculated glucose concentration to a&#xD;
      receiving device (2). Substances that are widely distributed in body water, and thereby&#xD;
      present in the interstitial space, potentially affect this technology. Acetaminophen and&#xD;
      aspirin are substances that are have been known to affect the accuracy of these devices (3);&#xD;
      however, more recently developed CGMs such as the Dexcom G6, were able to demonstrate no&#xD;
      interference by acetaminophen (4). Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who are on&#xD;
      intermittent hemodialysis (iHD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) undergo fluid shifts between the&#xD;
      interstitial fluid and intravascular space during dialysis treatments. They are also often&#xD;
      uremic and have metabolic acidosis (5). These fluid shifts, uremia, acidosis, and volume&#xD;
      overload (increase in interstitial fluid volume due to ESRD) have the potential to impact the&#xD;
      performance of the most advanced and commercially available CGMs; however, use of CGM in&#xD;
      these patients has not yet been studied (3). Moderate to severe CKD is associated with both&#xD;
      increase in insulin resistance and decrease in insulin clearance, which results in often&#xD;
      unpredictable and labile glucose concentrations and increased risk of hypoglycemia in these&#xD;
      patients (6). Use of CGM, and potentially hybrid closed loop insulin delivery systems that&#xD;
      are dependent on accurate continuous glucose monitoring, has the potential to improve glucose&#xD;
      control and quality of life in these patients (7). This study team feels that this study will&#xD;
      be valuable in collecting preliminary data needed with the goal of validating the use of CGM&#xD;
      in this patient population.OBJECTIVE: The specific aim is to conduct a pilot study to&#xD;
      evaluate the accuracy of continuous glucose monitors (CGM) in End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)&#xD;
      patients on intermittent hemodialysis (iHD). Accuracy will be assessed by calculating the&#xD;
      mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between CGM values and concurrent finger stick or&#xD;
      capillary blood glucose (CBG) in these patients during hemodialysis, and on non-dialysis&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
