  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the gold standard for the management&#xD;
      of jaundice in patients with distal malignant biliary obstruction. However, surgically&#xD;
      altered anatomy (i.e., Whipple intervention, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, Billroth II surgery),&#xD;
      periampullary diverticula, gastric outlet obstruction, and malignant obstruction of the lumen&#xD;
      determine the failure of the procedure in about 5-10% of cases, requiring alternative methods&#xD;
      of decompression. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) and surgical bypass are&#xD;
      well established alternatives in these patients, but associated with increased morbidity,&#xD;
      longer length of hospital stay and higher costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) through a transduodenal access is an alternative in&#xD;
      cases of failed or unfeasible ERCP. EUS-BD has considerably evolved thanks to the development&#xD;
      of dedicated devices such as lumen apposing metal stents (LAMS), specifically designed for&#xD;
      endoscopic ultrasound procedures. LAMS are made up of braided nitinol that is fully covered&#xD;
      with silicone to prevent tissue ingrowth, with wide flanges on both ends to provide&#xD;
      anchorage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, LAMS have been incorporated into a delivery system with an electrocautery mounted&#xD;
      on the tip (Hot Axios; Boston Scientific Corp.), which allows the device to be used directly&#xD;
      to penetrate the target structure without the need to utilize a 19G needle, a guidewire, and&#xD;
      a cystotome for prior dilation. This has been described for drainage of peri-pancreatic fluid&#xD;
      collections, common bile duct (CBD), gallbladder, and for creation of gastro-jejuno&#xD;
      anastomosis. The biliary drainage procedure performed with the Hot Axios sistem is a fast,&#xD;
      one-step procedure that obviates the need accessory exchange and thus potentially reduces the&#xD;
      risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure has been described as safe and effective with a technical success of 98.2%,&#xD;
      clinical success of 96.4%, and low rate of complications 7% (consisting of duodenal&#xD;
      perforations, bleeding and transient cholangitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with distal malignant biliary obstruction have a higher risk of ERCP failure,&#xD;
      related to the difficulty of bile duct cannulation or access to the second duodenal portion&#xD;
      due to the presence of a stenosis. This condition could imply the need of more advanced&#xD;
      cannulation techniques (such as pre-cut, Double Guide Wire DGW technique, pancreatic&#xD;
      septotomy) with consequent higher risk of developing post ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). Unlike&#xD;
      ERCP, an reaching the papilla is not a requisite for a successful EUS-BD. Moreover, since the&#xD;
      papilla is not cannulated and the pancreatic duct is not accessed, this is expected to result&#xD;
      in a minimal risk of post-procedural pancreatitis (about 0.50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that, in patients with distal malignant biliary obstruction,&#xD;
      EUS guided biliary drainage as first step approach has a lower risk of post-procedural&#xD;
      pancreatitis compared to standard ERCP. The investoigators propose to perform a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study to test this hypothesis.&#xD;
