      To determine if cataract surgery may have an impact on the natural history of early DME&#xD;
      (E-DME)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery worsens preoperative DME, deserving an adequate pre and postoperative&#xD;
      treatment. A large British study demonstrated that even eyes without preexisting edema are at&#xD;
      risk of DME development after surgery according to the gravity of retinopathy. A new DME&#xD;
      classification (the ESASO Classification of DME) defines a new category of DME, named early&#xD;
      DME (E-DME) as follow: presence of small intraretinal cysts associated with well-recognizable&#xD;
      and detectable inner retinal layers, ellipsoid zone (EZ) and external limiting membrane&#xD;
      (ELM), with increase in central subfield thickness (CST) and/or macular volume (MV) less than&#xD;
      30% of maximum normal values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to its undetectable or minimal impact on visual function, E-DME has not yet been studied,&#xD;
      and retinologists usually restrict treatment to more advanced cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-DME is the most frequent type of DME among the population undergoing cataract surgery,&#xD;
      estimated by DICAT-I Study in 20.7% of the diabetic subjects, corresponding to 5.4% of the&#xD;
      general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that cataract surgery has a negative impact both on diabetic eyes&#xD;
      with no DME and in eyes with advanced DME. Even E-DME therefore probably worsens after&#xD;
      surgery but there are no data on this matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective: to determine if cataract surgery may have an impact on the natural history&#xD;
      of early DME (E-DME) Study Design: prospective multi-center observational case-control study&#xD;

    <description>Changes in central subfield thickness (CST) and/or macular volume (MV) measured by SD-OCT in eyes with E-DME during the first 4 months after cataract surgery (Group 1) compared to eyes with the same condition but without any surgical intervention (Group 2).&#xD;
Eyes in both groups developing a &quot;significant worsening&quot; of E-DME, defined as an increase of at least 50 microns in central subfield thickness (CST) or 0.5 mm3 in macular volume (MV) measured by SD-OCT will be withdrawn from the study to receive adequate therapeutic intervention.</description>

        Study Groups GROUP 1: Eyes with E-DME scheduled for cataract surgery GROUP 2: Control&#xD;
        Group. Eyes with E-DME and clear media, non-significant cataract, pseudophakic (Group 2a:&#xD;
        phakic; Group 2b: pseudophakic) or eyes with cataract scheduled for surgery after the end&#xD;
        of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Gold candidate: patient with bilateral E-DME and cataract in at least one eye.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible patients will be identified during the regular preoperative cataract examination.&#xD;
        In the presence of a diabetic patient, an OCT scan will be performed (according to the&#xD;
        protocol, see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only eyes with E-DME will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria may be one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diabetic patients with bilateral E-DME and bilateral cataract. Both eyes will be&#xD;
             enrolled: one eye will receive surgery at M4, the other at the end of follow up (M8)&#xD;
             or later (gold candidate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diabetic patients with bilateral E-DME and cataract in just one eye (gold candidate).&#xD;
             The eye with E-DME and no cataract may be already pseudophakic (surgery performed at&#xD;
             least 18 months before) or with clear media.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diabetic patients with E-DME and cataract in just one eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diabetic patients with cataract and no E-DME in the eye scheduled for surgery but&#xD;
             E-DME in the other eye. Only the eye with E-DME will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Past ocular surgery of any kind (except for cataract surgery) or ocular pathologies&#xD;
             other than diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Macular edema considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. OCT examination suggesting that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities (e.g., a taut&#xD;
             posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) are the primary cause of the macular edema.&#xD;
             In the case of ERM, an OCT scan must be sent to the Coordinating Center for approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any ocular pathology or ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, might affect macular edema&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of any therapy (anti-VEGF treatment, focal/grid macular photocoagulation,&#xD;
             intravitreous or peribulbar corticosteroids) for DME or diabetic retinopathy in the&#xD;
             past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within two months before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Aphakia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Evidence of uncontrolled glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Intraocular pressure must be &lt;25 mmHg, with no more than one topical glaucoma&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
