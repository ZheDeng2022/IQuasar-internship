  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, parallel design study to evaluate the PK, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and immunogenicity of single SC doses of CC-93538 in healthy Japanese and&#xD;
      Caucasian adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of approximately 48 subjects, 24 Japanese and 24 Caucasians, will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Japanese subjects will be enrolled first and randomized 1:1 to receive a single SC dose of&#xD;
      either 180 mg or 360 mg CC-93538. Caucasian subjects will then be enrolled and matched to&#xD;
      Japanese subjects (1:1) by weight (± 20%) and receive the same single SC dose of either 180&#xD;
      mg or 360 mg CC-93538.&#xD;

             and PE at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female subjects not of childbearing potential must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper&#xD;
                  documentation required) at least 6 months before Screening, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Postmenopausal (defined as 24 consecutive months without menses before Screening,&#xD;
                  with a follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level in the postmenopausal range&#xD;
                  according to the laboratory used at Screening); FSH to be performed at the&#xD;
                  discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;

                  documented) or agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with FCBP while&#xD;
                  participating in the study until 5 months after the last dose of IP.&#xD;

             Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal&#xD;
             (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method are not&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used&#xD;
             together.&#xD;
