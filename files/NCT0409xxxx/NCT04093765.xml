  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators aim at an operational research deployment of&#xD;
      Ultrasensitive Rapid Diagnostic Test (URDT) -based Mass Screening and Treatment (MSAT) in the&#xD;
      Malaria Elimination Task Force (METF) elimination program. This intervention will be tested&#xD;
      in two types of setting. In group 1, MSAT will be used in a programmatic setting in order to&#xD;
      decrease the reservoir of asymptomatic carriers in high incidence villages (following the&#xD;
      same principles and objective as previously deployed MDA interventions). In group 2, the&#xD;
      investigators take advantage of the lighter framework of MSAT to use it as a reactive&#xD;
      intervention in order to respond to malaria outbreaks in low to intermediate incidence&#xD;
      villages. The MSAT intervention will be preceded with community-level consent and community&#xD;
      engagement (CE) activities. MSAT will be conducted over a period of approximately 1 week in&#xD;
      each hamlet, village or group of villages, and will consist in administering a P. falciparum&#xD;
      URDT to all individuals agreeing to participate. A limited subgroup (expected 5-25%) will be&#xD;
      found positive and receive supervised treatment over 3 days for the standard regimen (DP to&#xD;
      cure asexual stage infection + single low-dose primaquine to destroy gametocytes). After this&#xD;
      intervention, the incidence of clinical falciparum episodes will be monitored by the village&#xD;
      MP. In group 1, a comparison of the prevalence at baseline and 12 months after MSAT&#xD;
      intervention will be performed through a second URDT survey, in addition to which both&#xD;
      baseline and 12-month surveys will include the collection of a 200µL capillary blood sample&#xD;
      for reference detection in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be evaluated primarily on its ability to reduce yearly cumulative&#xD;
      incidence of clinical falciparum malaria compared to year before intervention. Additional&#xD;
      evaluations of the impact of MSAT will include: in group 1, comparison of asymptomatic&#xD;
      infection prevalence; and in group 2, modifications of the shape of the incidence curve&#xD;
      following intervention.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stepped-wedge open-label, non-randomized, cluster intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed in clusters (hamlet (isolated group of household, village, or&#xD;
      group of village). The intervention will be conducted in two types of clusters, both&#xD;
      corresponding to locations where an excess of case was detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Sustained high incidence clusters, characterized by a yearly cumulative incidence&#xD;
      &gt;84 cases/1000/year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Villages in group 1 will be attributed an intervention a given year based on the cumulative&#xD;
      incidence over the previous 12 months (METF stratification January, including the last 2&#xD;
      transmission seasons). The order of intervention will be decided based on logistic&#xD;
      constraints and highest incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Focal transmission clusters, corresponding to locations where an epidemic alert has&#xD;
      been signalled and confirmed (see definition of thresholds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Villages in group 2 will be attributed an intervention based on P. falciparum incidence in&#xD;
      the previous 4 weeks. In near-0 transmission area, an intervention will be conducted in each&#xD;
      likely source location of transmission of a locally acquired case. In the other areas&#xD;
      (METF1+METF2), the intervention will be triggered when the incidence is above the pre-defined&#xD;
      epidemic threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cluster, all inhabitants will be invited to undergo an URDT test to identify their&#xD;
      infection status, and will receive the appropriate treatment according to their&#xD;
      characteristics. Information on village inhabitants absent during the MSAT activities will be&#xD;
      obtained from village population lists provided by the village headman and from household&#xD;
      member declarations. During the URDT screening, all individuals will receive a unique&#xD;
      identifying number that will be used to record demographic data in the MSAT paper logbook and&#xD;
      to label URDT and reference sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after MSAT intervention, incidence of clinical malaria episodes will be recorded&#xD;
      at the MP (1 or several) serving the cluster receiving the intervention. No individual data&#xD;
      will be collected to link clinical case participation, infection status and incidence of&#xD;
      clinical episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from group 1 clusters will be invited to participate in a prevalence survey&#xD;
      during MSAT and 12 months after, in order to evaluate the impact of the MSAT campaign on the&#xD;
      asymptomatic carriage prevalence. This will require collection of a 200µL sample during the&#xD;
      MSAT campaign and a second round of URDT screening with the collection of a 200µL sample, 12&#xD;
      months after MSAT.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All persons living in the village or cluster of villages will be eligible for MSAT&#xD;
             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals living in smaller settlements (permanent or temporary) within walking&#xD;
             distance of a selected intervention village will also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Large &quot;work-related&quot; settlements in the vicinity of a targeted village (military&#xD;
             camps, logging camp, mining site) will be approached by the team to be included in the&#xD;
             screening and treatment activity. They will be included in the analysis as a unit&#xD;
             within a cluster of villages if all the study information can be collected (including&#xD;
             follow-up survey for Group 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who do not provide informed consent for both URDT screening and treatment&#xD;
             in case of positive result. Individuals will be given the possibility to refuse the&#xD;
             collection of the 200µL reference sample or the DBS collection but participate to URDT&#xD;
             screening and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children &lt;1 year old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a documented Pf-positive malaria RDT who received treatment (AL+sld&#xD;
             PMQ) during the previous 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NB: Individuals who were diagnosed infected with PF and received a treatment between 7 and&#xD;
        30 days before the intervention are still likely to be URDT positive due to the persistence&#xD;
        of HRP2, and this will result in treatment of individuals who are likely uninfected.&#xD;
        However, in a high prevalence area or in an outbreak context, previous infection signals&#xD;
        exposure, and DP will provide a protection against a likely re-infection.&#xD;
