  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of standard usual care combined with daily&#xD;
      supervised physical training during hospitalization with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)&#xD;
      compared to standard usual care alnone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-acuired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospitalization worldwide. Despite&#xD;
      increased focus on mobilization, hospitalization is associated with bed rest. Bed rest with&#xD;
      low levels of physical activity leads to functional deline as well as increased risk of&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled trial, which investigates the effect of standard usual&#xD;
      care combined with daily supervised physical training in patients hospitalized with CAP&#xD;
      compared to standard usual care alone.&#xD;
