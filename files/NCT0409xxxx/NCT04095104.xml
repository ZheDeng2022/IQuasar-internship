  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to establish the feasibility and initial efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination of phentermine and topiramate for adolescents and young adults who require&#xD;
      additional risk reduction after bariatric surgery. This study will use a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blinded design to evaluate an adjunctive 12-week intervention of&#xD;
      phentermine + topiramate + standard of care vs. placebos + standard of care 6 months after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery, among 12 to 24 year olds who don't achieve expected weight loss or who&#xD;
      remain severely obese (n=10 total).&#xD;

    <description>Validated questionnaire: Eating in the Absence of Hunger-Parent (EAH-P) completed by the parent/guardian about their adolescent/young adult. This measure has 14 items.&#xD;
Each item is on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1= &quot;never&quot; to 5= &quot;always&quot;. A higher score indicates more eating in the absence of hunger.&#xD;
Total and sub scales are calculated by taking the average of the items. Total score measures the overall construct &quot;Eating in the Absence of Hunger&quot; Subscales include: &quot;External Cues&quot; (4 items); &quot;Response to negative affect&quot; (6 items); &quot;Fatigue/Boredom&quot; (4 items).</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Restraint, Disinhibited Eating, and Predisposition to Hunger</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire&quot; will be completed by the adolescent/young adult. This is a 51-item measure that is divided into 2 parts, and assesses 3 eating behaviors: 1) Cognitive Dietary Restraint (20 items), 2) Disinhibited Eating (16 items), and 3) Predisposition to hunger (15 items). Higher scores in each domain indicate more of each of those behaviors.&#xD;
The minimum score for factors 1, 2, and 3 are: 0, 0, and 0. The maximum score for factors 1, 2, and 3 are: 20, 16, and 15 Part I includes items 1-36 rated as either True (1) or False (0) Part II includes items 37-51 and is rated on a 4-point Likert-like scale with one exception- item 50 is rated on a 6-point scale.&#xD;
Scores for each of the three eating behaviors are calculated by taking the average of the items, and are most commonly reported separately, not as a total score.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PedsQL instrument will be completed by the adolescent/young adult. There are 4 scales: Physical Functioning (8 items), Emotional Functioning (5 items), Social Functioning (5 items), and School Functioning (5 items) and 3 Summary Scores: Total Scale Score (23 items), Physical Health Summary Score (8 items), and Psychosocial Health Summary Score (15 items).&#xD;
Items are rated on a 0-4 scale. Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, such that 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 4=0.&#xD;
Higher scores indicated better health-related quality of life. Scale Scores are calculated as the sum of the items over the number of items answered.&#xD;
Psychosocial Health Summary Score is calculated as the sum of the items over the number of items answered in the Emotional, Social, and School Functioning Scales.&#xD;
Physical Health Summary Score is the same as the Physical Functioning Scale Score.</description>
