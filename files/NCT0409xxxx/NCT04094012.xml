  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful implement of preventive therapy for subjects with latent tuberculosis infection&#xD;
      (LTBI) is the critical step for elimination of tuberculosis (TB). The major obstacle of&#xD;
      traditional preventive therapy is the unacceptable long treatment duration, taking isoniazid&#xD;
      5mg/kg daily for a total of 9 months (9H), thus seriously compromising its acceptability.&#xD;
      With the introduction of 12-doses weekly high-dose (15 mg/kg) rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP&#xD;
      regimen), the completion rate of 3HP has be shown to be much higher than 9H. However, 4.9% to&#xD;
      9.1% of LTBI cases who received 3HP failed to complete treatment because of side effects.&#xD;
      Systemic drug reactions (SDRs), even hypotension and shock, under 3HP treatment are higher&#xD;
      than 9H treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study in HIV patients demonstrated that a new short-term regimen, consisting of&#xD;
      isoniazid 5mg/kg plus rifapentine 10mg/kg daily for one month (1HP), has a similar risk of&#xD;
      adverse reactions as 3HP. Clinical study with head-to-head comparison between 3HP and 1HP,&#xD;
      however, remains lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective multicenter study is conducted to investigate whether risk of SDRs under 1HP&#xD;
      is lower than that under 3HP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: 1HP has a lower incidence rate of SDRs than 3HP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the risk of SDRs in 1HP treatment and in 3HP treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore side effect profile of 1HP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter randomized control trial will compare the risk of SDRs under conventional&#xD;
      3HP regimen (Arm 1: 3HP), and a new regimen consisting of daily rifapentine (10 mg/kg) plus&#xD;
      isoniazid (5 mg/kg) for 1 month (Arm 2: 1HP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases, with an estimated 10.0&#xD;
      million new cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2017. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set&#xD;
      the goal of eliminating TB as a public health problem, aiming to achieve 90% and 95%&#xD;
      reductions in the TB incidence and number of TB deaths by 2035. Latent tuberculosis infection&#xD;
      (LTBI), a status of persistent immune response to stimulation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#xD;
      antigens without clinically manifest active TB, has a 10% risk of progressing to active TB&#xD;
      and has thus emerged as a critical target for improving TB control and elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of LTBI programmes has long been limited. In 1999, real-world data obtained&#xD;
      from an inner-city population in Atlanta, Georgia in the United States revealed that only 27%&#xD;
      of subjects receiving isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy completed their treatment. A 2016&#xD;
      meta-analysis including 748,572 subjects in 58 studies also found poor completion of LTBI&#xD;
      programmes, with a 60% treatment completion rate. With the introduction of rifapentine (RPT),&#xD;
      a rifamycin with much longer half-life than rifampin, the duration of a modern preventive&#xD;
      regimen termed 3HP comprising RPT and INH could be shortened to 12 doses administered weekly,&#xD;
      with the completion rate approaching 90%. However, 3.8% of those receiving 3HP experience&#xD;
      systemic drug reactions (SDRs). The risks of severe adverse event (AE) and SDRs are even&#xD;
      higher among subjects &gt;35 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, little has been discovered regarding the risk factors or predictors of SDRs due to&#xD;
      3HP therapy. In a pharmacokinetics study of once-weekly RPT treatment in 35 TB patients&#xD;
      during continuation phase therapy, serious AEs were not linked with a higher area under the&#xD;
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0~∞) of RPT. Furthermore, no studies have reported on&#xD;
      plasma INH levels after once-weekly INH treatment or the association between plasma INH level&#xD;
      and AE development. Under the support of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC), a&#xD;
      prospective multicenter observational study was conducted in Taiwan since 2016 to investigate&#xD;
      the correlation between SDRs and plasma concentrations of INH, RPT and their major&#xD;
      metabolites - acetyl-isoniazid (AcINH) and desacetyl-rifapentine (DeAcRPT). Preliminary&#xD;
      results from 129 LTBI cases showed that those with SDRs and those without SDRs had similar&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of the 4 compounds at either post-dose 6 or 24 hours (C6 or C24),&#xD;
      except that the C24 plasma INH concentration was significantly higher in the SDRs group.&#xD;
      Furthermore, generalised estimating equation (GEE) model revealed that C24 plasma INH level&#xD;
      was associated with a higher risk of SDR development (OR [95% CI]: 1.61 [1.15-2.25], p =&#xD;
      0.006). By contrast, C24 plasma RPT level was not associated with a higher risk of SDR&#xD;
      development (OR [95% CI]: 1.01 [1.00-1.02], p = 0.218).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3HP regimen is among the four regimens for LTBI that is recommended by the WHO and is&#xD;
      also probably the most promising regimen because of its convenience, with only 12 doses&#xD;
      requried. With its effectiveness well established, the major remaining concern regarding 3HP&#xD;
      may be its AEs. Studies have estimated that 4.9% to 9.1% of those in close contact with&#xD;
      patients with open TB and who received 3HP failed to complete the regimen because of the side&#xD;
      effects.8,10 While on the 3HP regimen, SDRs have generally been linked with RPT, which has a&#xD;
      well-known side effect: flu-like syndrome. Additionally, RPT is a newer agent, making it a&#xD;
      possible contributor to SDRs given that a higher SDR rate was observed compared with other&#xD;
      INH-containing regimens. Some scholars, however, have argued against this point. First, one&#xD;
      study using the 3HP regimen demonstrated that rechallenge with RPT did not necessarily lead&#xD;
      to SDRs. In the same study, rifapentine was better tolerated than isoniazid upon rechallenge.&#xD;
      In another study involving 1200 mg of RPT once weekly as continuation therapy for active TB,&#xD;
      no SDRs were linked with RPT. Finally, in a study of 162 pulmonary TB patients receiving RPT&#xD;
      with a dosage of more than 15mg/kg daily, no patients developed SDRs. In literature review,&#xD;
      we discovered that among reports describing an association between RPT and flu-like symptoms,&#xD;
      RPT was commonly coadministered with INH. Furthermore, in cases describing an association&#xD;
      between INH and flu-like symptoms, the associations were all proven with rechallenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a less well-known effect than that of RPT, INH can also lead to flu-like syndrome.&#xD;
      Of the patients with active TB who were receiving INH, usually with a dose of 300 mg/day,&#xD;
      1%-9.8% developed flu-like syndrome. Case reports describing the association between INH and&#xD;
      flu-like syndrome have also been published. In the 3HP regimen, INH dosage is 900 mg/week,&#xD;
      and no data exist regarding the proportion of cases developing SDRs under a single INH dosage&#xD;
      higher than this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some hypotheses could possibly explain the association between the high INH dose and SDRs&#xD;
      during 3HP therapy. First, since INH could bind to key enzymes in cytokine pathways such as&#xD;
      peroxidase, a high plasma level of INH may activate pathways which are not activated under&#xD;
      usual dose of INH due to low binding affinity. Second, the high plasma INH level may&#xD;
      interfere with or interact with rifapentine metabolite, resulting in SDRs. Rifapentine,&#xD;
      however, did not affect INH pharmacokinetics. Interestingly, a study investigating drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions between dolutegravir and once weekly RPT plus INH also revealed a higher INH AUC&#xD;
      among those who develop toxicities and a higher INH level among two cases experiencing severe&#xD;
      flu-like syndrome. In summary, our preliminary results and recent publications support the&#xD;
      association between INH and SDR development because INH drug level, rather than RPT drug&#xD;
      level, was discovered to be associated with SDR development, and the short duration and rapid&#xD;
      resolution of symptoms in some cases may indicate that a rapidly metabolised drug was the&#xD;
      causative agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because rather high doses of INH and RPT are used in 3HP regimen and safety remains a big&#xD;
      concern in preventive therapy and program roll-out, a new regimen, consisting of daily INH&#xD;
      300 mg and RPT 600 mg (450 mg if body weight &lt;45.0 kg) for one month was compared with 9H in&#xD;
      a large international, open-label RCT enrolling 3000 people living with HIV, so called the&#xD;
      BRIEF TB trial. During follow-up, the incidence of active TB was 0.65 vs. 0.67 per 100&#xD;
      person-years in the 1HP and 9H groups, respectively, showing non-inferiority of the&#xD;
      ultra-short course of preventive therapy. However, the incidence rate of targeted safety&#xD;
      events (liver, gastrointestinal, neurologic, skin or hypersensitivity) was lower with the 1HP&#xD;
      regimen (2.9% [2.2 - 3.9%]) than with 9H regimen (4.7% [3.6 - 6.0%], p = 0.016). Treatment&#xD;
      completion rates were significantly higher among people taking 1HP (97 vs. 91%, p &lt; 0.01).&#xD;
      Because in the PREVENT TB trial the 3HP group had a significantly higher risk of adverse&#xD;
      events than the 9H group, the preliminary results of the BRIEF TB trial suggest that by daily&#xD;
      use of a relative small dose for both INH and RPT, the 1HP regimen, can be more tolerable&#xD;
      than 3HP regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, there remains so many unknowns in rifapentine-based preventive therapy. Further&#xD;
      study is necessary to consolidate the finding that INH may play a role in the development of&#xD;
      SDRs during 3HP therapy, as well as to evaluate the completion rate and safety profile of 1HP&#xD;
      therapy. Therefore, we conduct this prospective multicenter study to investigate whether risk&#xD;
      of SDRs under 1HP is lower than that under 3HP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis: 1HP has a lower incidence rate of SDRs than 3HP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the risk of SDRs in 1HP treatment and in 3HP treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore side effect profile of 1HP&#xD;
