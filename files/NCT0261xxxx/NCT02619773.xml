  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections at the site of surgical incisions (SSIs) are the most common infection among&#xD;
      surgical patients. Although all patients undergoing surgical procedures are at risk for&#xD;
      developing SSIs, colorectal surgery has had consistently had high rates of SSIs, ranging from&#xD;
      3-45%. These infections can increase the length of hospital stay, and increase the rate of&#xD;
      readmissions and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further research is needed to study the effects of mupirocin in general surgery. A recent&#xD;
      study compared colorectal SSI rates between mupirocin and standard gauze surgical dressings.&#xD;
      The results of this show that mupirocin has the greatest effect on reducing SSI rate when&#xD;
      compared to standard gauze dressings. However, these studies have not been performed in the&#xD;
      United States and have only been studied on a very specific patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the rate of infections at the surgical incision after&#xD;
      colorectal surgery when a mupirocin dressing is placed versus a standard gauze dressing&#xD;
      without mupirocin.&#xD;

      Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common nosocomial infection among surgical&#xD;
      patients and are the third most common nosocomial infection among all hospitalized patients.1&#xD;
      Although all patients undergoing surgical procedures are at risk for developing SSIs,&#xD;
      colorectal surgery has consistently had high rates of surgical site infections, ranging from&#xD;
      3-45%. Numerous studies have shown the adverse effects of SSIs, including increased length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, morbidity, mortality, readmissions and costs. In a recent study analyzing&#xD;
      various surgical procedures, including colorectal operations, surgical site infection was&#xD;
      found to be the number one cause of unplanned readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have been performed showing that intranasal mupirocin may have a role in reduction of&#xD;
      SSI in cardiac and orthopedic surgery. However, there has been minimal investigation on the&#xD;
      effects of topical mupirocin in general surgery. A recent study from Spain compared&#xD;
      colorectal SSI rates between mupirocin dressings, silver-impregnated dressings, and standard&#xD;
      gauze surgical dressings. The results of this show that mupirocin has the greatest effect on&#xD;
      reducing SSI rate when compared to standard gauze and silver-impregnated dressings. However,&#xD;
      these studies have not been performed in the United States and have only been studied on&#xD;
      open, colorectal oncologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare mupirocin dressings to standard surgical dressings and&#xD;
      their respective SSI rates at a United States community hospital in patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective open and minimally invasive colorectal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-center prospective, randomized study will be performed. Patients who will undergo&#xD;
      elective colorectal surgery and consent to participate will be randomized (1:1) to one of the&#xD;
      following 2 treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Island dressings until postoperative day (POD) #2 (which is current practice at&#xD;
           Gundersen Health System)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mupirocin + island dressing until POD#5 Analysis of outcomes will include rate of SSI,&#xD;
           and 30-day morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
