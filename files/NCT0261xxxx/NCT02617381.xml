      &quot;This is not a validation study of a questionnaire. This is a multicenter diagnostic study,&#xD;
      assessing the sensitivity and specificity of a simple structured questionnaire, to identify&#xD;
      patients requiring further haemostatic investigations, in pre-operative patients. This study&#xD;
      will also allow for the assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of the routine care&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are recruited during the pre-anaesthesia visit by an anaesthesiologist, in&#xD;
      different anaesthetic sectors each day of the week, so that different types of surgery are&#xD;
      represented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each day (from Monday to Friday), the first 2 eligible patients will be offered to take part&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine care strategy is not modified by the study protocol. In addition, the simple&#xD;
      structured questionnaire will be completed by the patient with a research assistant after the&#xD;
      pre-operative consultation As recommended in diagnostic studies, the gold standard (see&#xD;
      secondary endpoint paragraph) will be performed consistently in all patients to avoid&#xD;
      verification bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The improvement of screening for the need of further investigations by use of the&#xD;
      questionnaire compared to routine care will be measured counting how many patients are&#xD;
      adequately reclassified with the questionnaire compared to the routine care strategy,&#xD;
      regarding the gold standard (using the Net Reclassification Index).&quot;&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Screening for the need of an extensive haematological investigation in order to determine&#xD;
      the existence of inherited or acquired haemostatic abnormalities at the pre-anaesthesia visit&#xD;
      is part of a routinely used strategy to prevent perioperative haemorrhagic complications. In&#xD;
      France, this screening is mainly based on a basic set of haemostatic tests: prothrombin time&#xD;
      (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and platelet count (PC). When these tests&#xD;
      are abnormal, the patient may undergo a more complete set of haemostatic tests and, if&#xD;
      needed, be referred to a haematologist for advice. Nevertheless, all published studies have&#xD;
      pointed out the scarce efficacy of preoperative PT/aPTT/PC testing for hemorrhagic risk&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in 2011 several professional societies have advised AGAINST using this strategy&#xD;
      and advocated its replacement by a structured questionnaire for the screening of the need of&#xD;
      further haemostatic investigations (to validate or not an increased risk of perioperative&#xD;
      haemorrhage). Nevertheless, the performance of a screening strategy relying on such a&#xD;
      structured questionnaire has never been studied in the pre-anaesthesia context. This probably&#xD;
      explains why many anaesthesiologists still continue to prescribe PT/aPTT/PC to detect&#xD;
      haemostatic abnormalities and don't use any questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, our hypothesis is that a validated structured and simple questionnaire is an accurate&#xD;
      screening strategy to determine patients requiring further haemostatic investigations in the&#xD;
      preoperative setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main reasons for the non compliance with the guidance advising against the use of&#xD;
      screening haemostatic tests (PT/aPTT/PC) for the identification of patients with potential&#xD;
      haemorrhagic risk is probably related to the fact that the alternative strategy proposed to&#xD;
      anaesthesiologists (the use of a structured questionnaire) has never been investigated before&#xD;
      in the context of the pre-anaesthesia visit. Therefore, the present project would estimate&#xD;
      the diagnostic performance (sensitivity and specificity) of a simple structured questionnaire&#xD;
      to identify patients requiring further haemostatic investigations (i.e. patients for whom&#xD;
      further haemostatic investigations would conclude to an increase haemorrhagic risk). The&#xD;
      innovative approach of the project is related to: (i) the choice of a simple structured&#xD;
      questionnaire, specifically conceived to be used at the pre-anaesthesia visit; (ii) a study&#xD;
      design that takes into account the needs of the final users (the anaesthesiologist and the&#xD;
      surgical team).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of a questionnaire at the pre-anaesthesia visit, to&#xD;
      identify patients requiring further haemostatic investigations for haemorrhagic risk&#xD;
      assessment as defined by a full haemostatic investigation (i.e. patients for whom full&#xD;
      haemostatic investigations would conclude to an increase haemorrhagic risk)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the diagnostic accuracy (specificity, sensibility and likelihood ratios) of&#xD;
           the current routine care strategy at the pre-anaesthesia visit (i.e. no structured&#xD;
           questionnaire, and prescription of further haematological tests at the sole discretion&#xD;
           of the anaesthesiologist) to identify patients requiring further haemostatic&#xD;
           investigations for HgR as defined by the gold standard (a full haemostatic&#xD;
           investigation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the improvement in the identification of patients requiring further&#xD;
           haemostatic investigations for HgR assessment using a simple structured questionnaire,&#xD;
           compared to usual care, in pre-operative patients (i.e. to describe how many patients&#xD;
           are adequately reclassified by using the questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe how many patients had a major peri-operative bleeding event with respect to&#xD;
           the answers to the simple structured questionnaire.&quot;&#xD;
