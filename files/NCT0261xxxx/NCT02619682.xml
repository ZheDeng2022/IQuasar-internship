    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the safety of alternating ixazomib citrate and lenalidomide as&#xD;
      treatment to help keep cancer from coming back after stem cell transplant (maintenance&#xD;
      therapy) in treating patients with multiple myeloma. Ixazomib citrate may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Lenalidomide may&#xD;
      stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells. Giving ixazomib citrate and lenalidomide&#xD;
      as maintenance therapy after transplant may prolong the length of time until the cancer&#xD;
      returns.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the toxicity of the use of ixazomib (ixazomib citrate) and lenalidomide as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy after autologous transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the ability to deliver the planned therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess initial response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the median time to disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30-120 days after completion of autologous transplant, patients receive ixazomib&#xD;
      citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days for 2 courses, followed by lenalidomide&#xD;
      PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28 for 2 courses. Treatment repeats, alternating after every 2&#xD;
      courses, for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>Response criteria will be determined by International Myeloma Working Group Criteria. In patients with chemo-refractory disease at the time of ASCT, the therapy will be felt to be promising if median time to progression is &gt; 9 months. If chemo-sensitive disease at time of ASCT, the therapy will be felt to be promising if median time to progression is &gt; 41 months based on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 10014 lenalidomide maintenance study post ASCT. Initial response rates and outcome will be descriptively reported.</description>

    <description>Within 30-120 days after finishing autologous transplant, patients receive ixazomib citrate PO on days 1, 8 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will continue to alternate between ixazomib citrate and lenalidomide every 2 courses for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
