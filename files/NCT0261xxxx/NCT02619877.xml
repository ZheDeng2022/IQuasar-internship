      This is a phase II single-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALLO-ASC-DFU&#xD;
      in patients with Diabetic Foot Ulcer, compared to standard therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALLO-ASC-DFU is a hydrogel sheet containing allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.&#xD;
      Adipose-derived stem cells have anti-inflammatory effect and release growth factors such as&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which can&#xD;
      enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide a new option in&#xD;
      treating a Diabetic Foot Ulcer.&#xD;
