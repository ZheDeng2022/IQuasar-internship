      The primary aim of this study is to compare efficacy of &quot;early endoscopy&quot; and &quot;non-endoscopic&#xD;
      treatment&quot; for management of acute upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding in patients with&#xD;
      recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This study will also compare rates of surgery, repeated&#xD;
      intervention (endoscopy or TAE), rebleeding and complications between two groups.&#xD;

      MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design and Randomization A multicenter RCT of recent ACS patients&#xD;
      presenting with acute UGIB was conducted in three tertiary centers (Far Eastern Memorial&#xD;
      Hospital, Hsin-Chu Branch and Taipei Branch of National Taiwan University Hospital) in&#xD;
      Taiwan. Patients with recent ACS, including unstable angina (UA), ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and&#xD;
      non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) who presented symptoms of acute UGIB were evaluated for&#xD;
      enrollment. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) age over 20-year-old, 2) ACS episodes&#xD;
      in the past 2 weeks, 3) symptoms of UGIB including hematemesis, coffee ground emesis or tarry&#xD;
      stool passage accompanied with a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) level greater than 2 g/dl from&#xD;
      baseline. Patients with any one of the following criteria were excluded: 1) malignancy or&#xD;
      other advanced disease with a life expectancy of &lt; 6 months, 2) pregnant or lactating women,&#xD;
      3) history of allergy or severe side effects from PPIs, contrast, and iodine, 4) platelet&#xD;
      count &lt; 80k/uL, or prothrombin time INR &gt;2.0, 5) decompensated (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score B&#xD;
      and C) liver cirrhosis, 6) stage 3~5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated Ccr &lt; 60&#xD;
      ml/min/1.73m2) using Cockcroft-Gault formula, exclusive of end-stage renal disease under&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy.17 All the authors had access to the study data and had reviewed&#xD;
      and approved the final manuscript.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients were randomly assigned to EE or non-EE management. Patients in both groups&#xD;
      received bolus intravenous pantoprazole 40mg followed by continuous infusion (8mg/hour).3,18&#xD;
      In the EE group, patients underwent endoscopy within 24 hours after onset of UGIB symptoms.&#xD;
      All enrolled patients were monitored in cardiac intensive care unit. At endoscopy, stigmata&#xD;
      of hemorrhage (SRH) were treated by endoscopic therapy in combination of any two of the&#xD;
      followings: epinephrine submucosal injection, thermocoagulation, hemoclipping, and argon&#xD;
      plasma coagulation. Hemostasis was considered initial successful if bleeding had stopped at&#xD;
      endoscopy. Antral-biopsy specimens were obtained to a rapid urease test and histopathological&#xD;
      examination for Helicobacter pylori (Hp) study. Patients assigned to non-EE group received&#xD;
      medical treatment with PPIs alone and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy two weeks after&#xD;
      enrollment to evaluate the recent SRH. Decision on discontinuation of DAPT was at the&#xD;
      discretion of cardiologists depending on cardiac conditions of each enrolled patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints The primary endpoint was failure of control hemorrhage. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints included complication rate, length of hospital stay, units of blood transfusion,&#xD;
      re-bleeding rate, needs for repeated intervention (endoscopic therapy, transarterial&#xD;
      embolization (TAE), or surgery) for uncontrollable recurrent bleeding. Blood troponin-T,&#xD;
      creatine kinase-MB, Hb, hematocrit (Hct) and complete electrocardiogram (ECG) were checked&#xD;
      every 8 hours within 24 hours after enrollment. APACHE II, Rockall and Blatchford scores at&#xD;
      intervention were calculated.19 This study was approved by the Research Ethics Review&#xD;
      Committee of study institutes (FEMH IRB-103062-F, Hsin-Chu NTUH 105-001-F, Yun-Lin NTUH&#xD;
      201411020RIND).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of failure to control hemorrhage The time frame for acute bleeding episode was&#xD;
      defined as 24 hours after enrollment. Clinical failure of control bleeding was defined as:&#xD;
      hematemesis or nasogastric tube drainage of significant fresh blood (≥ 200 mL) ≥ 2hours, or&#xD;
      persistent hypovolemic shock after intervention; or 3 g/dl drop in Hb level (or 9% drop of&#xD;
      Hct) within 24 hours if no blood transfusion; or a decrease in Hb ≥ 2 g/dL or an increase ≤ 1&#xD;
      g/dL, despite 2 or more units of red blood cells (RBC) component transfusion within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of re-bleeding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically significant recurrent bleeding was defined by the followings: vomiting of fresh&#xD;
      blood, fresh blood in the nasogastric tube aspirate, hematochezia or melena after a normal&#xD;
      color stool, and a decrease in Hb ≥ 2 g/dL or an increase less than 1 g/dL, despite 2 or more&#xD;
      units of RBC component transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of major and minor complications Major complications were defined as death and&#xD;
      life-threatening arrhythmias within 24 hours after randomization. Minor complications were&#xD;
      defined as hypotension (&lt;90/60mmHg), hypertension (&gt;180/100mmHg), tachycardia (&gt;120bpm),&#xD;
      bradycardia (&lt;60bpm), tachypnea (&gt;24/min.), oxygen desaturation (SpO2 &lt;90%), and minor&#xD;
      arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimation and Randomization The null hypothesis of this study was the&#xD;
      superiority of EE over non-EE in the efficacy on bleeding control. The primary efficacy&#xD;
      analysis used an intention-to-treat approach that included all patients meeting the entry&#xD;
      criteria who had completed the follow-up. Approximately 80% of UGIB patients will stop&#xD;
      bleeding spontaneously,20 and rates of hemostasis that resulted from a first endoscopic&#xD;
      procedure exceeded 94% in most large studies.21 However, there was no data demonstrating the&#xD;
      outcome of patients under DAPT developing acute UGIB treated medically alone. Therefore, we&#xD;
      assumed that about 70% of acute UGIB patients under DAPT would stop bleeding spontaneously&#xD;
      without therapeutic endoscopy. As a result, we estimated a sample size of at least totally 68&#xD;
      patients in EE and non-EE groups in order to achieve a statistical power of 80% at a 5%&#xD;
      significance level on a two-tailed test, with margin of error of 2% in order to detect a 24%&#xD;
      (94% vs. 70%) difference. Sealed envelopes with computer generated randomization number (0&#xD;
      for non-EE, 1 for EE group) were used. After enrollment, gastroenterologists opened the&#xD;
      consecutive envelops for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and the&#xD;
      comparisons between two groups were performed using the Student t-test; categorical variables&#xD;
      were summarized as count (%) and the comparisons between groups were made using the&#xD;
      Chi-square or the Fisher's exact test when appropriate. Univariate and multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression models were performed for evaluation of the risk factors for outcomes in both&#xD;
      groups. A two-tailed p value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The&#xD;
      statistical analysis was performed using STATA software (version 11.0; Stata Corp, College&#xD;
      Station, TX, USA).&#xD;
