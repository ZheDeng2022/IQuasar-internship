    <textblock>
      Nausea is a common symptom encountered in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) environment&#xD;
      that is often treated with oral or intravenous anti-emetic medications. Research Design/Plan:&#xD;
      This will be a randomized equivalence study comparing the reduction in a patient's reported&#xD;
      level of nausea after treatment with either Ondansetron or IPA Methods: Patients who report&#xD;
      nausea and/or vomiting in the normal evaluation and care of after calling 911 for Emergency&#xD;
      Medical Care will be offered enrollment in the study. A short script will be attached to the&#xD;
      outside of each study packet providing information about the study and its risks and&#xD;
      benefits. Verbal or written (waiver of informed consent will be requested) permission will be&#xD;
      obtained to start randomization. If the patient agrees to enroll then the study packet will&#xD;
      be opened and utilized. All Advanced Life Support Ambulances in the San Antonio Fire&#xD;
      Department will have sealed numbered opaque boxes or envelopes with either: 70% Isopropyl&#xD;
      Alcohol swabs or ondansetron. Six Visual Nausea Severity Scoring cards will be provided with&#xD;
      a marking pen to record timed nausea levels before and upon arrival to the Emergency&#xD;
      Department and 15 minutes after treatment whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relevance: This treatment has not been studied in the unique environment encountered&#xD;
      by Paramedics in the Pre-Hospital setting. If this treatment is found to be effective, it&#xD;
      many offer a very simple, extremely inexpensive and non-invasive (basic life support)&#xD;
      approach for the treatment of nausea.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nausea is a common symptom encountered in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) environment&#xD;
      that is often treated with oral or intravenous anti-emetic medications. Post operative&#xD;
      patients with modern anesthesia techniques and processes still have a 20-30% incidence of&#xD;
      Nausea and/or vomiting. Nausea is a complicated symptom that is though to arise from the&#xD;
      vomiting center in the lateral reticular formation in the brainstem. Afferent inputs form the&#xD;
      cerebellum, higher cortical centers, the vestibular apparatus, the glossopharyngeal nerve and&#xD;
      the vagal nerve inputs contribute to the process of the perception of nausea. Chemoreceptors&#xD;
      in the Chemoreceptor Trigger Zone (CTZ) are located on the brain surface and are highly&#xD;
      vascularized leading to increased exposure to neurotransmitters such as Serotonin (5-HT-3),&#xD;
      histamine (H1) acetylcholine and dopamine. Blocking such neurotransmitter stimulation with&#xD;
      targeted medications such as antihistamines or 5-HT-3 antagonists such as Ondansetron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nausea is a common symptom encountered in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) environment&#xD;
      that is often treated with oral or intravenous anti-emetic medications. Many patients do not&#xD;
      respond well to this therapy, and EMS services that have only basic life support (BLS)&#xD;
      capabilities may not have any good treatment currently. Additionally, because of the&#xD;
      configuration of modern day ambulances, the patient is transport in a rear facing position in&#xD;
      the patient compartment with very limited view of the environment. This method of transport&#xD;
      frequently causes motion sickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion sickness is thought to be caused by inadequate adaption of the body to conflicts&#xD;
      between vestibular, visual, other proprioceptive inputs and inhibition of the vestibular&#xD;
      cerebellum. Common therapies may include antihistamines, benzodiazepines, tricyclic&#xD;
      antidepressants and or scopolamine. Behavioral strategies such a watching the true horizon,&#xD;
      steering the vehicle, tilting head into turns and laying down with eyes closed have been&#xD;
      shown to alleviate some symptoms of motion sickness. But these strategies are not available&#xD;
      in the EMS environment. Scopolamine administered well before motion stimulus has been shown&#xD;
      to prevent motion sickness and acute treatment is best when using sedating antihistamines.&#xD;
      Non-sedating antihistamines, Ondansetron and ginger root have not been found to effectively&#xD;
      prevent nor treat motion sickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple agents have been studied for the treatment of nausea in the emergency department&#xD;
      with equivalency of effect and time on onset. Common agents include ondansetron,&#xD;
      metoclopramide, promethazine and prochlorperazine. Such agents have also been used in the EMS&#xD;
      environment to some degree, but require parenteral administration with exposure to the risks&#xD;
      for side effects or sedation. There are also not options at the BLS level. Post-operative&#xD;
      oxygen therapy has not been shown to decrease post nausea after c-section delivery which is&#xD;
      disappointing as this is a ubiquitous therapy in the EMS environment of care, is inexpensive&#xD;
      and easy to administer. Ondansetron has been shown to be safe and effective in the&#xD;
      prehospital environment with a low incidence of side effects but cost and need for parenteral&#xD;
      administration is often a barrier to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have shown Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) 70% aromatherapy to be as effective as&#xD;
      Ondansetron with a more rapid onset of nausea relief. This therapy was performed by holding a&#xD;
      folded saturated 70% IPA pad under the nares with the patient inhaling the vapors. The&#xD;
      patient is simply instructed to take three deep breaths through their nose. In animal&#xD;
      experiments, toxicity from inhalation of IPA is very low at doses allowable by inhalation as&#xD;
      compared with dermal or oral ingestion. Dermal application of IPA is routinely used by EMS&#xD;
      personnel to cleanse the area of skin immediately surrounding the insertion point of an&#xD;
      intravascular catheter for medication administration, or blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPA Therapy may offer a very inexpensive, easy to administer, and effective alternative to&#xD;
      medication therapy for nausea and vomiting in the prehospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT AND RANDOMIZATION PROCESS Patients who report nausea and/or vomiting in the&#xD;
      normal evaluation and care of after calling 911 for Emergency Medical Care will be offered&#xD;
      enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A short script will be attached to the outside of each study packet providing information&#xD;
      about the study and its risks and benefits. Verbal or written (waiver of informed consent&#xD;
      will be requested) permission will be obtained to start randomization. If the patient agrees&#xD;
      to enroll then the study packet will be opened and utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES AND LOGISTICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Advanced Life Support Ambulances in the San Antonio Fire Department will have sealed&#xD;
      numbered opaque boxes or envelopes with either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three large 2 ply 70% Isopropyl Alcohol swabs OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ondansetron (Zofran) 4mg for IV/IM use&#xD;
&#xD;
      These study packets will have similar weight, shape and contour despite the contents. If&#xD;
      needed, props may be includes to make packages similar in weight, contour or sound when&#xD;
      shaken so as to not reveal its true contents. The goal is to enroll at least 400 patients&#xD;
      over a 1 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each arm, the package will contain a step by step instruction checklist. Six Visual&#xD;
      Nausea Severity Scoring cards will be provided with a marking pen to record timed nausea&#xD;
      levels before and upon arrival to the Emergency Department and 15 minutes after treatment&#xD;
      whichever comes first. The treatment protocol for each arm will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      70% Isopropyl Alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mark Time and Visual Nausea Severity Score 0-10&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Remove alcohol prep with gloved hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Place under nares of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Instruct the patient to take three separate deep inhalations of the Isopropyl vapors&#xD;
           through their nose&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Record time of treatment on back of first Visual Nausea Severity Score card.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Mark time and Subsequent Visual Nausea Severity Scores upon arrival to the Emergency&#xD;
           Department at indicated time intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. If patient still has significant nausea and or vomiting after ten minutes provide rescue&#xD;
           Ondansetron therapy with 4mg of Ondansetron slow IV push or IM&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Mark time and Visual Nausea Severity Score upon arrival to the Emergency Department on&#xD;
           third card.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Document all interventions on electronic Patient Care record as per usual procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Complete Paramedic evaluation tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Envelope or box, with Consent, score cards and Paramedic evaluation tool will be&#xD;
           returned to Medic Officer on duty and a new study packet will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Used Study Packets will be collected by the Investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ondansetron 4mg IV/IM (standard of care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mark Time and Visual Nausea Severity Score 0-10 on first enclosed card.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Start IV if not already done so.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If unable to obtain IV access in two attempts use intramuscular route.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inject 4mg of Ondansetron slow IV push or IM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Record time of treatment on back of first Visual Nausea Severity Score card.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Mark time and Second Visual Nausea Severity Score upon arrival to the Emergency&#xD;
           Department or 10 minutes after treatment whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. If patient still has significant nausea and or vomiting after ten minutes provide rescue&#xD;
           an additional dose of Ondansetron therapy with 4mg of Ondansetron slow IV push or IM&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Mark time and Visual Nausea Severity Score upon arrival to the Emergency Department on&#xD;
           third card.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Document all interventions on electronic Patient Care record as per usual procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Complete Paramedic evaluation tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Envelope or box, with Consent, score cards and Paramedic evaluation tool will be&#xD;
           returned to Medic Officer on duty and a new study packet will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Used Study Packets will be collected by the Investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secure excel spreadsheet tool will be used to abstract data from the research data&#xD;
      collection documents and the EMS electronic patient care record. The patient will only be&#xD;
      identified by the randomization number, incident number, age (if greater than 89 age will be&#xD;
      indicated by &lt;89 years), sex and date of service in the database and on all study packet&#xD;
      materials. All relevant time intervals and Visual Nausea Severity Scores will be recorded for&#xD;
      enrolled patients. Time to treatment will be compared between the two arms of the study as&#xD;
      well as changes in Visual Nausea Severity Scores. Treatment failures requiring additional&#xD;
      Ondansetron will be characterized. Paramedic will be asked to evaluate the treatment provided&#xD;
      for ease of use, time needed to complete the treatment and their impression of effectiveness&#xD;
      of the assigned treatment. T-test and confidence intervals will be utilized to determine&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
