&#xD;
          8. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Has had prior treatment for advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Prior&#xD;
             treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors is permitted in this setting. A washout of at&#xD;

             treatment must have elapsed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has received prior therapy with an anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2&#xD;
             agent.&#xD;

             days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Inhaled or topical steroids, and&#xD;
             adrenal replacement doses ≤ 10 mg prednisone equivalents are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune&#xD;
             disease or syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.&#xD;
             Patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy is an exception to this&#xD;
             rule. Patients that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid&#xD;
             injections would not be excluded from the study. Patients with hypothyroidism stable&#xD;
             on hormone replacement will not be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
