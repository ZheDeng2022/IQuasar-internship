  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whereas the advantageous effects of exercise-training on memory is increasingly recognized,&#xD;
      the practicality and clinical usefulness of such interventions in community-dwelling older&#xD;
      African Americans (AA)s Mild Cognitively Impaired (MCI) subjects, and the mechanism by which&#xD;
      an effect occurs need elucidation. Because aerobic-exercise can improve emerging&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CVD)-related risk factors for cognitive decline such as lipids, inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and glucose homeostasis; the Investigators will examine training effects on these&#xD;
      and related biomarkers. The imperative for this study is further underscored by the fact&#xD;
      that, AAs: i) have high rates of dementia, and ii) have paucity of cross-sectional, and lack&#xD;
      prospective data on the effects of exercise on cognition. To overcome barriers to recruitment&#xD;
      and retention, enhance compliance with a long exercise program (3-times/week), and maximize&#xD;
      the use of available resources, the Investigators will use a community-based approach.&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary objectives of this study build on the Investigators' experience, and&#xD;
      will compare the effects of aerobic-exercise to stretch-exercise (control) in&#xD;
      community-dwelling AA MCI subjects. Following the initial 6 months active intervention, the&#xD;
      aerobic-exercise group will follow a prescribed but free living 40 minutes, 3 time/week&#xD;
      exercise regimen while the control group returns to usual care plus stretch-exercise for&#xD;
      additional 12 months. This study will facilitate the estimation of sample size for a larger&#xD;
      confirmatory study in AAs. A newly acquired direct oversight of the DC Ward-6 Senior Wellness&#xD;
      Center and its infrastructures by the Howard University Division of Geriatrics will provide&#xD;
      additional resources and access to the community. In addition to the Investigator's&#xD;
      feasibility aims, the Investigators will determine performance on cognitive tasks using the&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Sub-scale (ADAS-Cog) and Clinical Dementia&#xD;
      Rating Scale (CDR) sum of boxes supplemented by tests of executive function (EF) and&#xD;
      Functional Activity Questionnaire (FA) and together as ADAS-Cog-Plus; changes in brain volume&#xD;
      regions of interest (ROI) with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), selected CVD and AD-related&#xD;
      bio-markers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although anticholinesterase therapies have greatly improved the symptomatic treatment of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), they have not been demonstrated to significantly slow the disease&#xD;
      progression; and amyloid-directed therapies have produced disappointing results. A promising&#xD;
      evidence-based and relatively side-effect free lifestyle approach is emerging as an&#xD;
      alternative or adjunct to drug therapy. In cross-section and prospective studies, and a few&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials; aerobic exercise-training has been demonstrated to improve&#xD;
      cognition in older subjects. However, the mechanisms of these effects remain poorly&#xD;
      understood. Because it is now recognized that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks can catalyze&#xD;
      AD development, it is vital to test whether lifestyle adaptation shown to reduce CVD risks&#xD;
      can favorably modify cognitive trajectories and markers of neurodegeneration. Such&#xD;
      interventions may benefit those at an early and clinically discernible prodromal stage of AD&#xD;
      such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Notably, such data are currently lacking in African&#xD;
      Americans (AA)s who harbor higher rate of CVD risks and AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a laboratory approach to exercise intervention study is required to prove causation,&#xD;
      such a design may not lend itself to real-life application, and is demanding for many&#xD;
      economically and educationally disadvantaged older AAs experiencing early symptoms of&#xD;
      cognitive deterioration. To address this concern, the Investigators seek to initiate an&#xD;
      18-month study, testing real-life applicability of the effects of exercise adaptation on&#xD;
      memory in a more ideal community setting. However, those who chose to exercise at an academic&#xD;
      center will not be excluded. Collection of outcome measures at baseline, 3-month, 6-month,&#xD;
      9-month, 12-month and 18-month will provide pilot data to inform dose and duration effects of&#xD;
      exercise on outcome measures. In addition to augmenting enrollments, the proposed approach&#xD;
      will bolster retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this pilot study, therefore, are to examine the feasibility of a&#xD;
      community-based 18-month study (6-month active intervention and 12-month passive follow-up)&#xD;
      aerobic exercise-training on neurodegeneration in AAs MCI subjects. The Investigators will&#xD;
      test the hypotheses by randomizing subjects into one of 2 groups: 1.) aerobic-exercise; and&#xD;
      2.) stretch-exercise (control). The Investigators proposed that the aerobic-exercise group&#xD;
      will perform better than control group on cognitive measures. Secondarily, the Investigators&#xD;
      will determine whether training-induced changes in cognition relate to increases in brain&#xD;
      volume. Exploratory, the Investigators will also investigate intervention effects on&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, selected CVD risk factors and biomarkers, cerebral&#xD;
      oxygenation and Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIF-1Î±) gene expression, and Apolipoprotein E gene&#xD;
      (APOE), to assess their mediation of training-induced changes in cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A team of experienced Investigators in neuroimaging, neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and&#xD;
      exercise physiology has been assembled to conduct this study. Working collaboratively with&#xD;
      the District of Columbia Office on Aging (DCOA), the Directors of the Ward 6 Senior Wellness&#xD;
      Center operated by DCOA, and the lead agencies on aging (community grassroots organizations&#xD;
      supported by DCOA), the Investigators will recruit, enroll, randomize, and train participants&#xD;
      at the wellness center. After obtaining informed consent and completing an initial&#xD;
      assessment, participants will undergo initial exercise screening to determine their ability&#xD;
      to exercise safely. Following randomization of 80 volunteers into aerobic-exercise (40) and&#xD;
      control (40); baseline neuropsychological, neuroimaging and biomarker measurements will be&#xD;
      obtained. Both groups will undergo 3 times/week supervised group-specific intervention at the&#xD;
      wellness center for 6 months. After the initial 6 months of active intervention, the&#xD;
      aerobic-exercise group will follow a prescribed but free living 40 minutes, 3 time/week&#xD;
      exercise regimen, while the control group returns to usual care. Baseline tests will be&#xD;
      repeated at 3 month, after 6 months (active intervention period); and at 9, 12 and 18 months&#xD;
      (passive follow-up period). Treadmill, lumber puncture (LP) and brain magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) tests will occur only at baseline and 6 months. Between groups changes in&#xD;
      cognitive performance, biomarkers, and neuroimaging measurements will be compared using&#xD;
      appropriate multivariate methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the Investigators remain cognizant of other planned or ongoing fitness and memory&#xD;
      trial, the proposed study is unique in the sense that: it is a logical extension of the&#xD;
      Investigators' ongoing work; tests the proposed hypotheses in predominantly AA sample in whom&#xD;
      paucity of data remains, and therefore, will advance reduction in health disparity; will&#xD;
      obtain data at multiple time-points (baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months) and therefore allow&#xD;
      for the assessments of the effects of duration and dose of intervention on outcome measures;&#xD;
      test the real-life applicability of the proposed intervention in a community setting; and&#xD;
      generate pilot data on the mechanisms by which these interventions affects memory.&#xD;
      Importantly, outcomes from this study may lead to practical and effective strategy to delay&#xD;
      cognitive decline in populations at most risk, and can prevent or attenuate the physical,&#xD;
      psychological and the economic burden associated with dementia in AAs.&#xD;
