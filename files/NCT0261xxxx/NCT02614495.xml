      This study adopt Simon's two-stage designs method. In the first stage, When the first 12&#xD;
      patients enrolled complete therapy of Cycle 1, investigators and sponsors will analyze safety&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetic (PK) data, to determine whether the dose is suitable for TC and&#xD;
      enrollment should be stopped during this period.15 subjects will be enrolled in both&#xD;
      subgroups (advanced MTC and iodine-refractory DTC), and more 10 subjects in each subgroups&#xD;
      will be enrolled after efficacy assessment in the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral sulfatinib at a dose of 300mg/d within 1 hour after breakfast&#xD;
      (once-daily dosing continuously, every 28-day treatment cycle) until disease progression,&#xD;
      death, or intolerable toxicity, or in the opinion of the investigator, patients were no&#xD;
      longer deriving clinical beneﬁt、lost to follow-up、withdrew informed consent form, or sponsors&#xD;
      terminated the study, whichever comes first.&#xD;
