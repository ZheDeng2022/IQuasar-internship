  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of a standardised imaging protocol to detect post endoscopic mucosal&#xD;
      resection (EMR) recurrence or residual adenoma through the comparison of biopsies of the post&#xD;
      EMR scar with endoscopic findings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Removal of colonic polyps reduces colon cancer and although most polyps found are small,&#xD;
      removal of large polyps can now be safely and effectively removed with wide field EMR.&#xD;
      Residual polyp tissue is found at follow up colonoscopy in approximately 15% of cases however&#xD;
      and remains a focus of attempts to improve EMR efficacy. All patients undergoing surveillance&#xD;
      colonoscopy after EMR at Westmead Hospital Endoscopy unit will have steps of assessment and&#xD;
      therapy of the scar recorded. Data will be entered into the large prospective audit database&#xD;
      and also analysed separately. Data will be stored in coded format. The individual steps and&#xD;
      the outcome of the scar interrogation and therapy will also be assessed and analysed. It is&#xD;
      expected that these results will help guide the optimal approach to assessment and confirm&#xD;
      the efficacy of therapy of recurrence further aiding the endoscopic approach to large colonic&#xD;
      polyps.&#xD;
