      Tissue perfusion is a critical factor for tissue regeneration and healing of anastomoses.&#xD;
      Compromised microperfusion in the area where the anastomosis is sited likely contributes to&#xD;
      leaks, but until now there has not been an easy and reliable technique to intraoperatively&#xD;
      evaluate microperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the association of intraoperative flux measurement with postoperative&#xD;
      outcome of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design: Prospective observational study. Flux measurement will be carried out using the&#xD;
      moorVMS-LDF DUAL CHANNEL Laser Doppler Blood Flow system. The flux probe will be applied on&#xD;
      the respective organs (i.e. esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, colon, rectum) and&#xD;
      measurements will be documented after a stable signal has been obtained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection is the primary therapy for a variety of benign and malignant diseases of&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract. Advances in the perioperative care surgical technique and imaging&#xD;
      modalities have significantly improved the outcome of patients with major abdominal&#xD;
      resections within the past three decades. However, the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      complications after major abdominal resections remains high with morbidity rates of 30-60%&#xD;
      despite a gradual decrease in perioperative mortality over time. Persistently high morbidity&#xD;
      rates may in part be explained by broadened indications with surgery in patients having&#xD;
      relevant comorbidities and/or advanced disease requiring extended resections. The reduction&#xD;
      of perioperative morbidity is of high relevance for the patients, as complications are&#xD;
      associated with poor oncological and functional long-term outcome and delay of further&#xD;
      therapy. In addition, complications present a major cause of costs for the health care&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue perfusion is a critical factor for tissue regeneration and healing of anastomoses.&#xD;
      Compromised microperfusion in the area where the anastomosis is sited likely contributes to&#xD;
      leaks, but until now there has not been an easy and reliable technique to intraoperatively&#xD;
      evaluate microperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the post-operative period, inadequate wound perfusion and impairment of systemic or&#xD;
      local oxygenation represent the main predisposing factors for anastomotic leakage. This is&#xD;
      the case for the gastric conduit as well as for colonic/rectal anstomoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, the performance of gastroplasty has been shown to be associated with impairment&#xD;
      in the microcirculatory blood flow in the proximal end of the gastric tube, despite the&#xD;
      absence of significant impairment in systemic haemodynamic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These microcirculatory impairments promote the occurrence of oesophageal anastomotic leakage,&#xD;
      which represents a potentially life-threatening complication related to the disastrous&#xD;
      consequences of the leakage of gastrointestinal contents, with mediastinitis, septic shock,&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar results have been shown for colorectal anastomoses. So, a good microcirculatory blood&#xD;
      flow around the anastomosis could indicate an optimal condition for anastomotic healing. Or&#xD;
      the other way around, a bad microcirculatory blood flow could lead the surgeon to rethink the&#xD;
      planned anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the association of intraoperative flux measurement with postoperative&#xD;
      outcome of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design: Prospective observational study. Flux measurement will be carried out using the&#xD;
      moorVMS-LDF DUAL CHANNEL Laser Doppler Blood Flow system. The flux probe will be applied on&#xD;
      the respective organs (i.e. esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, colon, rectum) and&#xD;
      measurements will be documented after a stable signal has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser Doppler measurement allows realtime and continuous monitoring suitable for the&#xD;
      investigation of the gastrointestinal microcirculation. Light generated by a laser diode&#xD;
      penetrates the tissue, where it is reflected by circulating blood cells. This reflected light&#xD;
      is returned via an optical fibre to a photodetector and transformed into an electrical&#xD;
      signal, which is proportional to the number of blood cells moving in the measured volume&#xD;
      multiplied by the mean velocity of the cells, and is referred to as the blood flux expressed&#xD;
      as perfusion units (PU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each measurement represents the mean value (PU) of a stable perfusion over a 1-min period&#xD;
      without motion artefacts.&#xD;
