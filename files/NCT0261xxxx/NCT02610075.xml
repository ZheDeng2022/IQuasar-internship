  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase Ib study will identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of AZD1775 monotherapy&#xD;
      when administered orally once daily (QD) or two times per day (BID) on Days 1 to 5 followed&#xD;
      by 9 days of rest in 14-day cycles, or QD on a 5/2 dosing schedule (5 days on, followed by 2&#xD;
      days rest) in 21-day cycles in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours.&#xD;
      Alternative treatment schedules may be explored if preliminary data suggest these would be&#xD;
      more appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of food on single dose PK of AZD1775 will be assessed in 12 patients. In this&#xD;
      sub-study, patients will receive a single oral dose of AZD1775 with 240 mL of water, once in&#xD;
      the fasted state and once following a high-fat meal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will attempt to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2&#xD;
      Dose (RP2D) of AZD1775 monotherapy when administered orally once daily (QD) or two times per&#xD;
      day (BID) on Days 1 to 5 followed by 9 days of rest in 14-day cycles, or QD on a 5/2 dosing&#xD;
      schedule (5 days on, followed by 2 days rest) in 21-day cycles in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic solid tumours. Both the QD 5/9 and 5/2 dosing schedules will run in&#xD;
      parallel. An evaluation will be made after the second QD cohort has been completed to&#xD;
      determine whether to proceed with one or both dosing schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AZD1775 MTD will be determined through dose-escalation using a 3+3 cohort design. If less&#xD;
      than one-third of evaluable patients in a given cohort (0 of 3 patients or 1 of 6 patients)&#xD;
      experiences a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT); escalation may proceed to the next higher dose&#xD;
      level. If one of the first 3 patients enrolled in a given cohort experiences a DLT, 3&#xD;
      additional patents will be enrolled in that cohort. If a DLT is observed in one-third or more&#xD;
      of patients, the dose at which this occurs will be considered not tolerated and the MTD will&#xD;
      have been exceeded. The highest dose level(s) at which less than one-third of patients (0 of&#xD;
      3 patients or 1 of 6 patients) experiences a DLT will be declared the MTD. Up to 6 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in each cohort. Dose escalation will continue until identification of the&#xD;
      MTD or Sponsor termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 10 dose escalations are anticipated in the determination of MTD. Approximately 6&#xD;
      subjects may be added to replace non-evaluable patients. Therefore, a total of 66 patients&#xD;
      are expected to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-limiting toxicities will be evaluated during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment. If appropriate&#xD;
      the DLT observation period can be expanded by up to 2 weeks in case of treatment delay due to&#xD;
      study drug-related adverse events. Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. Patients&#xD;
      must complete Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 safety evaluations which will conclude on Cycle 3 Day 1,&#xD;
      and must receive at least 80% of the planned dose to be considered evaluable. Patients&#xD;
      receiving less than 80% of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 dose (28 days) will be replaced unless they&#xD;
      experienced a confirmed DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population used to determine the MTD will consist of patients who have met the&#xD;
      minimum safety evaluation requirements of the study, and/or who have experienced a DLT in&#xD;
      Cycle 1 or Cycle 2. Minimum safety requirements will be met if during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 of&#xD;
      treatment the patient receives a minimum of 80% of treatment doses of AZD1775, completes the&#xD;
      safety evaluations, and is observed for at least 28 days. Patients who do not meet these&#xD;
      minimum safety evaluation and treatment requirements and whom do not experience a DLT will be&#xD;
      replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be allowed to continue treatment with AZD1775 until evidence of disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criterion has occurred.&#xD;
