      In the current constantly changing healthcare landscape quality measurement has a central&#xD;
      role. As the practice of medicine is shifting from authority to accountability, the quality&#xD;
      of surgical interventions is under continuous scrutiny by patients, peers, payers, and policy&#xD;
      makers. If done appropriately quality measurement can empower all members of the healthcare&#xD;
      debate. There is increasing focus on patient satisfaction outcomes as quality indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important part of surgical outcomes is a patient's perception of the result of the&#xD;
      intervention and overall experience in the preoperative setting. When assessing surgical&#xD;
      outcomes, measuring patient satisfaction is necessary. A qualitative systematic review of&#xD;
      patient satisfaction measures noted a scarcity of well-development quality improvement&#xD;
      initiatives to improve patient satisfaction. Anxiety, a potent behavioral and psychological&#xD;
      reaction, weighs heavily on a patient's perioperative experience and is exacerbated by&#xD;
      preoperative concerns about underlying disease and impending anesthesia and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple stressors on the day of the surgery: unfamiliar environment, multiple&#xD;
      forms to be signed, and multiple short encounters with new and unfamiliar personnel. These&#xD;
      create confusion, increase baseline anxiety, and can negatively affect patient experience,&#xD;
      and by extension surgical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing familiarity with this environment can help patients feel more informed about what&#xD;
      matters most to them, and have more accurate expectations of possible benefits and harms of&#xD;
      their options. This can potentially decrease overall anxiety, improve patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      and decrease pain levels. With the current study investigators will have the following two&#xD;
      specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To determine whether an immersive preoperative experience (video) is associated with&#xD;
      decreased anxiety and improved patient experience during the perioperative phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To determine whether an immersive preoperative experience is associated with decreased&#xD;
      stress, improved patient satisfaction, and decreased pain during the perioperative phase.&#xD;

      The study will include patients scheduled to undergo neurosurgical interventions. Patients&#xD;
      for whom surgical intervention is deemed necessary will be approached for participation in&#xD;
      the study. After signing informed consent, they will be randomized to watch a video during&#xD;
      their preoperative evaluation visit or have a regular standard of care evaluation during&#xD;
      their preoperative visit. For the patients randomized to the intervention group, the&#xD;
      preoperative visit will be performed, as it would be normally, with the only addition of a&#xD;
      5-minute video. Patients will be given a few minutes to watch the video, and will have the&#xD;
      chance to ask questions. The remainder of the interaction between patient and provider will&#xD;
      not be affected in any other way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video will include a simulated patient encounter (with actors not real patients)&#xD;
      showcasing the preoperative experience of the patient, including getting checked in, meeting&#xD;
      the nurses, surgeons, and the anesthesiologists. The technology used will allow the immersion&#xD;
      of the patient in the preoperative environment. The hypothesis is that by introducing a way&#xD;
      to familiarize the patients with the preoperative environment, investigators will have an&#xD;
      impact on their anxiety about the operation and their satisfaction with the entire&#xD;
      experience. Investigators hope this quality improvement initiative will change patient&#xD;
      experiences for the better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will fill out questionnaires immediately preoperatively on the day of the procedure,&#xD;
      on the day after the procedure, and 30-days after the operation (only for patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery for degenerative spine disease). The outcomes of interest will be stress level, pain&#xD;
      level, and patient satisfaction level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables will be analyzed using χ2 tests for&#xD;
      categorical variables and the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables.&#xD;
      Logistic regression will be performed, for each binary outcome. Linear regression will be&#xD;
      performed, for each continuous outcome. The variable age will be tested separately as a&#xD;
      continuous variable and a categorical variable (65-69 years, 70-74 years, 75-79 years, and&#xD;
      ≥80 years) in multivariable logistic regression models. Other variables that will be included&#xD;
      in the multivariable models include Charlson Comorbidity Index score, American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists [ASA] score, APAIS score. Mixed effects methods will be used, with treating&#xD;
      physician as a random effects variable, to account for clustering at the physician level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators intend to randomize 150 patients in 1:1 allocation to the video and&#xD;
      conventional arms. We anticipate not being able to obtain the primary outcome on up to 10% of&#xD;
      patients, leaving 135, or approximately 68 completers per arm. This yields just over 80%&#xD;
      power at the usual 5% type 1 error rate to detect a difference between the two arms of one&#xD;
      half (0.5) standard deviations in the primary outcome.&#xD;
