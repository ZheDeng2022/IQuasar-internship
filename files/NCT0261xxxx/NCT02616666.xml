    <description>Patients will be randomized to receive either dapagliflozin or SOC. As this is a pragmatic trial, there will be no additional interventions (apart from collection of PROs and occurrence of hypoglycaemias) and there will be no restriction on how GPs change the randomized treatment regimen (e.g., switch or add drugs). Patients will be followed up for 2 years (+ 12 weeks = 116 weeks) after randomization, regardless of the status of medication.</description>

    <description>The comparator arm consists of SOC. The SOC arm can be sulphonylurea (SU) or non-SU treatments. SU treatments will include any SU and the related insulin secretagogues repaglinide or nateglinide, each of them in combination with metformin. The non-SU treatments can be metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), or metformin and glitazones (pioglitazone) combination therapy. Other SGLT-2 inhibitors are excluded. All these treatments are approved in the UK for use in this patient population.</description>
