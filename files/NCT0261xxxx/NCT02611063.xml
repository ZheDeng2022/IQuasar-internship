  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether fostamatinib, a drug that blocks activated B&#xD;
      cells will be effective in preventing and treating chronic graft vs host disease (cGVHD)&#xD;
      after allogeneic stem cell transplant. Activated B cells may play a role in development of&#xD;
      cGVHD. Inhibiting the B cell activation using fostamatinib after allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant may prevent the development of cGVHD.&#xD;

      Design &amp; Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HCT) according to the&#xD;
      program's standards. No specific conditioning regimen is mandated. The stem cell source must&#xD;
      have been peripheral blood stem cells. Prophylaxis against acute GVHD must be with standard&#xD;
      agents (sirolimus and/or tacrolimus and/or methotrexate and/or cyclosporine). Participation&#xD;
      in a trial evaluating novel agents for therapy of acute GVHD is allowed, as long as the&#xD;
      experimental agent was discontinued &gt; 14 days prior to trial entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy: Patients will receive 100mg daily, 150mg daily or 100 mg bid beginning 90 days after&#xD;
      allogeneic transplantation and continue for up to 1 year from day of transplant OR beginning&#xD;
      at time of steroid-refractory cGVHD. Dosage will be determined using the modified continual&#xD;
      reassessment method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient evaluations: Patients will be evaluated for cGVHD and other toxicity at a minimum on&#xD;
      day 1(baseline), day 3, day 11, day 25, day 39, day 60, day 88, day 116, day 144, day 186,&#xD;
      day 228, and day 275 from initiation of protocol therapy. While the assessment for safety is&#xD;
      determined based on the evaluation at day 60, patients may stay on therapy for up to 1 year&#xD;
      after transplantation (study treatment day 275). In addition, patients will be observed for&#xD;
      one year after stopping study treatment with evaluation for toxicity and cGVHD during clinic&#xD;
      visits at 6 and 12 months after completion of study therapy. If at any time within the first&#xD;
      year after transplantation, a study subject is determined to have evidence of moderate or&#xD;
      severe stage cGVHD according to NIH consensus criteria for global severity, the subject will&#xD;
      be removed from this clinical trial and appropriate therapy for cGVHD will be administered&#xD;
      per the treating physician's discretion. The study subject may continue to receive&#xD;
      Fostamatinib as per the guidelines of this clinical trial in the event that mild stage cGVHD&#xD;
      is diagnosed. If cGVHD develops during the observation period, a second course of&#xD;
      Fostamatinib at 100% tolerated study dose may be given during the observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunosuppressive and other medications should be tapered according to the treating&#xD;
      physicians' discretion with careful attention to the clinical trial or treatment plan to&#xD;
      which the participating subject is already enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory samples will be obtained according to the study schedule. The following tests are&#xD;
      to be collected and analyzed for the study: complete blood counts, serum chemistry, liver&#xD;
      function tests (LFTs), chimerism analysis if indicated, and immunology/correlative science&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be open to members of all demographic groups who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. Approximately 18 subjects will be recruited at Duke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of eighteen patients will receive fostamatinib beginning at day 90 after allogeneic&#xD;
      transplantation. The safety assessment is determined at day 60. Patients with&#xD;
      steroid-refractory cGVHD are also eligible for this phase I study. Three dose levels are&#xD;
      considered: 100 mg qd, 150 mg qd, 100 mg bid, and the target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      probability is 0.33. The Bayesian model averaging continual reassessment method (BMA-CRM)&#xD;
      will be used for this trial.[15]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study targeted molecular mechanisms underpinning aberrant B-cell&#xD;
      signaling in cGVHD. Corollary studies will determine whether B and T cell subsets and/or&#xD;
      soluble B-cell activation factors are altered after Syk inhibition. The objective is to&#xD;
      implement preemptive targeted therapies that decrease excessive immune activation in&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
