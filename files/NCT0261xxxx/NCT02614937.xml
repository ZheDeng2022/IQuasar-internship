  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, single center, open label, randomized study evaluating the biological&#xD;
      effect of squalamine lactate ophthalmic solution, 0.2% combined with intravitreous&#xD;
      ranibizumab in patients with macular edema secondary to branch, hemi-central and central&#xD;
      retinal vein occlusion (BRVO, HRVO, CRVO).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At baseline, all eyes underwent ETDRS visual acuity measurements at 4 meters, a complete&#xD;
      ophthalmological evaluation, SD-OCT imaging of the macula, and fluorescein angiographic&#xD;
      assessment of capillary perfusion in the macula and peripheral fundus. All eyes received an&#xD;
      initial 10 week mandatory loading period of topical squalamine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eyes received mandatory intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0.5mg at the conclusions&#xD;
      of weeks 2 and 6. At the conclusion of week 10, eyes were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      continue squalamine drops bid or discontinue squalamine drops in the study eye. All eyes were&#xD;
      examined every 4 weeks through the week 38 endpoint and were eligible to receive additional&#xD;
      as needed ranibizumab 0.5mg injections starting at the conclusion of week 10 and every 4&#xD;
      weeks thereafter through week 34 depending upon prespecified visual acuity and OCT&#xD;
      retreatment criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any eye with a decrease of 5 or more ETDRS letters or increase in CST on OCT of 50uM or more&#xD;
      from their best previous measurements automatically received an additional ranibizumab 0.5mg&#xD;
      injection beginning at the conclusion of week 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eyes randomized to continue squalamine drops did so through the week 38 endpoint. SD-OCT&#xD;
      measurements of the macula were obtained at every study visit. Fluorescein angiograms were&#xD;
      performed on the study eye at baseline, weeks 10 and 38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints included all adverse events spontaneously reported, elicited or observed&#xD;
      were documented by the investigators at any visit.&#xD;
