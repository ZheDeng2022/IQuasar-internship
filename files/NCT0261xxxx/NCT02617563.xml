      The purpose of this study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the effectiveness of MAST techniques for anterior/lateral and posterior&#xD;
           approaches in Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) patients with spondylolisthesis (≥ grade&#xD;
           I).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess how single or double level MAST(Minimal Access Spinal Technologies) fusion&#xD;
           procedures PLIF (Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion), TLIF (Transforaminal Lumbar&#xD;
           Interbody Fusion), DLIF (Direct Lateral Interbody Fusion), OLIF (Oblique Lumbar&#xD;
           Interbody Fusion), ALIF (Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion), or MIDLF (Midline Lumbar&#xD;
           Interbody Fusion) are used in surgical practice and to describe long-term safety and&#xD;
           effectiveness in a broad patient population of patients with degenerative lumbar disc&#xD;
           disease .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this Prospective, Global (multi center), Post Market Release (PMR) Study, Patients will be&#xD;
      submitted to a single or double level instrumented fusion procedure using a PLIF, TLIF, ALIF,&#xD;
      OLIF, DLIF or MIDLF technique via a minimally invasive procedure and will receive the same&#xD;
      medical treatment as if they would not participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be monitored with visits conducted at the start, during and at the&#xD;
           closure of the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MedDRA coding will be used to classify the Adverse Event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted according to Medtronic SOPs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size calculation: Assuming that the standard deviation for ODI improvement at 3&#xD;
           months is 20 for both groups (anterolateral and posterior) and there is no difference in&#xD;
           the mean ODI improvement at 3 months, with 80% power and 5% alpha level, the sample size&#xD;
           for the primary endpoint (DDD patients operated for spondylolisthesis) is as follows in&#xD;
           order to claim equivalence between two groups with equivalent margin (-10, 10):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated sample size per group (anterolateral procedures versus posterior procedures):&#xD;
           70&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated total sample size for spondylolisthesis patients: 140&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From the MASTERS-D study it is know that approximately 50% of the patients with&#xD;
           degenerative disc disease have spondylolisthesis ≥ grade I. Hence the required total&#xD;
           sample size is 140/0.5 = 280. The study is anticipated to enroll 350 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to a final statistical analysis, 3 months and annual interim analyses are&#xD;
           anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study hypothesis for the primary objective is to verify whether patients operated&#xD;
           for spondylolisthesis (≥ grade I) have equivalent mean improvement of ODI at 3 months&#xD;
           regardless of the minimally invasive surgical procedure (anterolateral or posterior)&#xD;
           used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The null-hypothesis: Ho: Δ ODI_Anterolateral ≠ Δ ODI_posterior&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will be tested against the alternative hypothesis: HA: Δ ODI_Anterolateral = Δ&#xD;
           ODI_posterior Where Δ ODI_Anterolateral is the average improvement in ODI score&#xD;
           (baseline - 3 months) in spondylolisthesis subjects treated with the anterolateral&#xD;
           approach and Δ ODI_posterior is the average improvement in ODI score (baseline - 3&#xD;
           months) in spondylolisthesis subjects treated with the posterior approach.&#xD;

    <measure>The neurological success rate defined as maintenance or improvement of neurological functions</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status is based on four types of measurements (sections): motor, sensory, reflexes, and straight leg raising.&#xD;
Overall neurological success will be defined as maintenance or improvement in all sections (motor, sensory, reflex, and straight leg raising) for the time period evaluated. In order for a section to be considered a success, each element in the section must remain the same or improve from the time of the baseline evaluation to the time period evaluated. Therefore, if any one element in any section does not stay the same or improve, then a patient will not be considered a success for neurological status.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fusion success</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To observe the Fusion success. Fusion success rate will be summarized for at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 year follow-up. If a subject shows fusion success at early time points and non-fusion at a later time point, the fusion status at all earlier points should be considered as non-fusion. For 2-level fusion subjects, fusion success will be defined as achieving fusion at both treated levels.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients needing a second surgery at the index and/or adjacent level(s) (reoperation rates) throughout the study</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Document Secondary Surgeries at index and/or adjacent level(s)throughout the study. When a patient requires additional surgery at the index level(s), it can be an indicator of insufficient outcomes of the initial surgery. Due to the progressive nature of the degenerative lumbar spine, additional surgeries at the index and/or adjacent levels might be required after the initial surgery. To ensure all safety and economic values are collected, the revision surgeries and their complication types and rates will be assessed during the study by the surgeons.&#xD;
For secondary surgery at index levels and/or secondary surgery at adjacent levels, survival analysis will be performed to estimate the cumulative event rate up to 5 years.</description>

    <description>To observe and document the days after the surgery, fulfilling following criteria:&#xD;
No need for intravenous infusion of analgesic drugs&#xD;
No ongoing surgery related adverse events impending discharge&#xD;
No need for nursing care&#xD;
The objective of the Surgery Recovery Day assessment is to collect the day when the patient could be discharged based on his actual clinical condition because the effective day of discharge may be prolonged by factors other than the patient's clinical recovery such as social factors or co-morbidity.&#xD;
For the purpose of reporting these parameters the day of the surgery will be considered 'D0', the first day after surgery as 'D1', the second day as 'D2' and so on.</description>
