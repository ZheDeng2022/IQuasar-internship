  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective, non-randomized collection of defined clinical data&#xD;
      under normal conditions of use for the WiCS-LV System, an implantable cardiac pacing system&#xD;
      capable of delivering pacing energy to the left ventricle of the heart without using a pacing&#xD;
      lead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled and followed according to standard of care for 5 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A clinical registry will be used to collect data from all implanted patients, at all&#xD;
      follow-ups and across all implanting centers. Implant procedure will be according to the&#xD;
      'Instruction for Use' of the system and assessments and follow-ups according the best&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymized data will be collected on Case Report Forms (CRF) for each patient in the&#xD;
      registry. These data will be collected at the time of implant and at scheduled patient&#xD;
      in-clinic follow-ups of 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 1, 2,3,4,5 years post implant.&#xD;
      Patients entering the registry will be given a Registry code suitable to uniquely identify&#xD;
      the patient, the implanting center, and the responsible physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be consolidated into a dataset by the sponsor for analysis purposes. The sponsor&#xD;
      may request support from the center to review patient records in order to monitor the data in&#xD;
      cases where the data appears incomplete or appears to be inaccurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data set will be consolidated such that each implanting center may access its own data,&#xD;
      or as mutually agreed between centers, aggregate data. Data may be used by centers for&#xD;
      purposes of publication or other objectives of the center.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with heart failure meeting standard criteria for CRT based upon the current&#xD;
        European Society of Cardiology / European Heart Rhythm Association (ESC/EHRA) guidelines&#xD;
        and meeting criteria in one of these categorizations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Untreated by conventional CRT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have had an attempted but failed CS lead implant due to such&#xD;
             complications as venous occlusion, difficult CS access or anatomy, poor lead stability&#xD;
             or previous CS repositioning procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a previously implanted CS lead that is programmed off due to such&#xD;
             complications as high pacing threshold, non-capture, phrenic nerve stimulation, lead&#xD;
             failure, lead dislodgement, or other justifications due to lead issues documented by&#xD;
             the prescribing physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-responder to conventional CRT&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients that have a relative contraindication for a CS lead implant such as difficult&#xD;
             subclavian access, venous thrombosis, venous occlusion, risk of lead dislodgment, or&#xD;
             other justification documented by the prescribing physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have a relative contraindication for revising an implanted device to a&#xD;
             CRT device such as previous pocket erosion, previous pocket infection, previous&#xD;
             explantations, or other justifications documented by the prescribing physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other justifications based upon the prescribing physician's judgment of&#xD;
             risk to reopening the device pocket including consideration for the remaining&#xD;
             longevity of the pacemaker/ICD battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

        assessed from diagnostic transthoracic echocardiography Left atrial or left ventricular&#xD;

        transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or other neurological stimulation&#xD;

        ultrasound Use of echocardiography imaging using vascular, intracardiac, Doppler, and&#xD;
