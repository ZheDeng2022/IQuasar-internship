      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung diseases are among the most frequent and most serious ailments in Denmark. Chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth most frequent cause of death and&#xD;
      represents a significant burden on the health care system, the patients and their relatives.&#xD;
      The National Board of Health in Denmark recommends spirometry to all individuals over 35&#xD;
      years who present at least one respiratory symptom (dyspnea, cough, wheeze or sputum&#xD;
      production) or risk factors (prior or current smoking or relevant occupational exposure) in&#xD;
      order to facilitate early detection of COPD. However approximately 200,000 citizens with COPD&#xD;
      remain undiagnosed and unknown to the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventive health checks including spirometry can be used to detect lung diseases earlier. In&#xD;
      a Danish municipality, the Check your Health Preventive Programme (CHPP) was initiated,&#xD;
      offering preventive health checks to all 30 to 49 year-old citizens. This health promotion&#xD;
      program provides the unique opportunity to evaluate single components of preventive health&#xD;
      check in a real-life setting. Only a few previous studies have included spirometry in a&#xD;
      preventive health check.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over time the attendance at preventive health checks has decreased and at present the&#xD;
      response rate is approximately 50%. Little is known about initiatives that can influence the&#xD;
      attendance rate according to preventive health checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to examine whether focused information on spirometry in the&#xD;
      invitation material will influence the attendance in preventive health checks. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that spirometry as part of the preventive health check will&#xD;
      increase the attendance in CHPP from 53% to 58% and the increase will be among prior and&#xD;
      current smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materiel/Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Check your health preventive program (CHPP):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is embedded in the fourth year of the above mentioned CHPP. In CHPP, all&#xD;
      citizens living in the municipality of Randers aged 30-49 years per 1st of January 2012 were&#xD;
      identified in the Danish Civil Registration System. CHPP is a house-hold cluster randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial offering a preventive health check to all 30 to 49 year old citizens in a&#xD;
      Danish municipality during the years 2012 to 2017 (n= 26,216). The citizens were randomized&#xD;
      by household into 5 groups of equal size, each corresponding to a specific year where they&#xD;
      would be invited to a health check. Invitations with a prefixed appointment for the health&#xD;
      check and information about the health check were dispatched continuously&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health checks and the subsequent health behavioral courses are performed at a local&#xD;
      health care center. The subsequent health interview takes place at the participants own&#xD;
      general practitioner. The health checks will be conducted by health professionals who have&#xD;
      experience with all measurement procedures as well as in risk communication to ensure&#xD;
      standardization and quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health check:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the health check the participants are asked to answer a web-based questionnaire&#xD;
      regarding physical activity, self-rated health, mental health, smoking and alcohol. The&#xD;
      clinical examination include following measures: biochemical (total cholesterol, lower&#xD;
      density lipoprotein (LDL), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)), systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, bodyweight, height, spirometry and Aastrands submaximal bike-test&#xD;
      (cardiorespiratory fitness). At the end of the health check, the results are presented in a&#xD;
      profile pamphlet including recommendations for follow up according to their risk-profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Execution of the health check is standardized by a written protocol and adherence is checked&#xD;
      continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on questionnaire data the following categorical variables will be described for all&#xD;
      attendees:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age will be divided into four groups; 30-35, 36-40, 41-45 and 46-50&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking status will be classified as smoker, ex-smoker, or never smoker and supplied&#xD;
           with information about pack years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Airway symptoms (dyspnoea, wheezing or coughing) during the last four weeks will be&#xD;
           divided into&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All of the time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most of the time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Now and then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rarely&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not at all&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial on attendance in preventive health check. From November&#xD;
      2015 until November 2016, 4,356 CHPP-citizens will be randomized further to either&#xD;
      intervention or control in the present trial: The intervention group receives an invitation&#xD;
      which highlights the value of spirometry as part of a health check. The invitation is made in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Danish Lung Association and has been tested on a focus group before&#xD;
      the invitations are dispatched. The control group will receive a standard invitation. Primary&#xD;
      outcome measure is effect on attendance. Secondary outcome is the percentage of participants&#xD;
      with abnormal spirometry assessed at the preventive health check. The characteristics of the&#xD;
      2 groups will be described according to sex, age, smoking history, spirometry values and lung&#xD;
      symptoms. The intervention, the outcome and the group assignment in this trial are not&#xD;
      revealed in the invitation for the citizens. Randomization is handled by an independent&#xD;
      statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is estimated to 4,356 participants in total and is calculated on the basis of&#xD;
      the following assumptions: 1:1 randomization, two-sided significance level of 0.05, power of&#xD;
      0.9, intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.01 and with an average of 1.5 citizens in each&#xD;
      household, we calculated the design effect to be 1.05. Calculations are further based on the&#xD;
      objective of being able to detect a difference of 5% in effect size of attendance. The&#xD;
      investigators determined this 5% difference to be clinically meaningful based on expert&#xD;
      opinions and criteria employed in other research. The intracluster correlation coefficient&#xD;
      was included to reflect a possible clustering effect of the general practitioners (n = 46),&#xD;
      which is seldom greater than 0.01 in primary care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The main outcomes Effect of the intervention on attendance will be estimated by differences&#xD;
      in the proportion of citizens attending the health check in each of the groups. Crude and&#xD;
      adjusted estimates of the difference in proportion will be based on binominal regression.&#xD;
      Also these estimates will be compared with estimates based on propensity scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a descriptive analysis of attendees and non-attendees will be performed&#xD;
      regarding sex, age, smoking history, self-reported lung symptoms and spirometry measurements.&#xD;
      The analysis will follow the intention to treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the endpoints, the number and percentage of individuals experiencing the endpoint&#xD;
      will be presented, by randomisation group. Binominal regression will be used to estimate the&#xD;
      difference in proportion between the two groups, and 95% confidence interval, comparing the&#xD;
      intervention group with the comparison group. The baseline measure of the outcome will be&#xD;
      included as a covariate in the model. If the distribution of the outcome is skewed, a log&#xD;
      transformation will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Analysis of the baseline characteristics For the descriptive part of this study, bivariate&#xD;
      and multivariate analysis will be performed. Continuous variables e.g. height and weight are&#xD;
      presented as mean ± standard deviation, unless the variable has a highly skewed distribution,&#xD;
      in which case, medians, 25th and 75th percentiles will be presented. For categorical&#xD;
      variables, e.g. smoking status, civil status, and sex, the number and percentage of&#xD;
      individuals within each category will be presented as absolute numbers and relative (%)&#xD;
      frequencies. Anova will be used when comparing means or changes in means of numerical&#xD;
      variables; and Chi2-test will be used when comparing proportions for categorical variables.&#xD;
      Categorical outcomes will be analysed with logistic regression. The statistical significance&#xD;
      level is set at p &lt; 0.05. Statistical analysis will be performed using STATA 14.0 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of missing data :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary trial analysis will use an Intention To Treat (ITT) population, which includes&#xD;
      all participants in the group to which they were randomised, regardless of the amount of&#xD;
      intervention actually received. The only exclusion criterion is terminal illness as reported&#xD;
      by the general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent attendees refusing to participate, households are invited together and two&#xD;
      reminders are sent out. Furthermore, appointments are scheduled outside of work hours.&#xD;
      Finally, we have the unique opportunity to use the Danish registers as a population-based&#xD;
      health care database with information about the non-attendees, described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Missing values due to incomplete clinical measurements or questionnaires Records with&#xD;
           missing data due to incomplete questionnaires and incomplete spirometry measurements&#xD;
           will be excluded. Sensitivity analysis will be performed and it will be considered if&#xD;
           data are missing at random or not at random. Afterwards complete case analysis will be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Missing values of non-attendees As we have no clinical measurements or any answered&#xD;
           questionnaires on the non-attendees, these data will be obtained from the Danish&#xD;
           national registers. Sensitivity analysis will be performed and it will be considered if&#xD;
           data are missing at random or not at random. Afterwards complete case analysis will be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-attendees will be described on following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sociodemographic: Education level, sex, age, ethnicity and civil status from 2016&#xD;
                using Danish Civil Registration System(CRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Socioeconomics: income and transfer payments from 2016 using the Danish Civil&#xD;
                Registration System(CRS) .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Contacts to their general practitioner from 2014-16 using reimbursement to the&#xD;
                general practitioner from the Danish National Health Service Register.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prescriptions of respiratory medicine from 2014-16 using the information about&#xD;
                redeemed medication from the Danish National Prescription Register by using the ATC&#xD;
                group R03 from 1995-2013. We categorized the drugs into rescue drugs against airway&#xD;
                symptoms e.g. SABA / SAMA and chronic drugs against airway symptoms e.g. SABA/&#xD;
                SAMA, LABA/LAMA, leukotriene inhibitors, theophylline and inhaled corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the present study are expected to contribute with important knowledge about&#xD;
      the value of information on spirometry in invitations to health checks measured at different&#xD;
      levels of attendance - as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Legal and ethical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been presented to The Scientific Ethics Committee and it is considered as&#xD;
      routine data and thus ethical approval is not needed for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comply with the declaration of Helsinki and according to the Danish Health Law&#xD;
      each of the participants will provide written informed consent for data to be used for&#xD;
      research. Approval by The Danish Data Protection Agency is obtained (2014-54-0704).&#xD;
