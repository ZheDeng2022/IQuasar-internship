      phaseI/II, Cohort B n = 4, ≥ 18 years of age, Cohort C n= 6, 6-12 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort will receive a single subretinal injection of 1x10e11 vector genome particles of&#xD;
      rAAV.hCNGA3 in each eye at different time-points. Cohort A, in whom the first eye has&#xD;
      received treatment under protocol version 5.0, will only receive one injection in the second&#xD;
      eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After standard three-port 23G pars plana vitrectomy, balanced salt solution will be used to&#xD;
      induce a localized primary retinal detachment in a controlled fashion. Vector solution will&#xD;
      be applied using disposable 41G extendible subretinal injection needles within a standard 23G&#xD;
      body to fit the port system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint safety: Safety assessment 12 months after treatment, descriptively Primary&#xD;
      endpoint efficacy: Contrast sensitivity (Pelli Robson 3 m) 6 months after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key secondary endpoints efficacy 12 months after treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contrast sensitivity (Pelli Robson 3 m)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BCVA assessed using the ETDRS visual acuity protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microperimetry (MAIA) (20°)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chromatic Pupil Campimetry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient reported outcomes (VFQ25/CVFQ, A3-PRO) Safety as the primary endpoint will be&#xD;
           assessed by clinical examination of ocular inflammation (slit lamp, fundus&#xD;
           biomicroscopy, fundus photography. Systemic safety will be assessed by vital signs,&#xD;
           routine clinical chemistry testing (including CRP, ESR) and full/differential blood&#xD;
           counts. Immunopathology essays will include specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays&#xD;
           for humoral antibodies against rAAV8 capsid protein. Biodistribution will be monitored&#xD;
           by polymerase chain reaction studies on rAAV8 genome in blood, urine, saliva and tear&#xD;
           fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: The analysis of the primary endpoint (contrast sensitivity after 6 months) will be&#xD;
      done using a pre / post comparison for the entire sample including both eyes for cohort B and&#xD;
      C (n=10) and only one eye for cohort A (n=4) with GEE correction for the dependency of left&#xD;
      and right eye. In the waiting group the second (therapeutic) phase will be used. The&#xD;
      dependency appears for cohorts B and C which contribute both eyes but not for cohort A which&#xD;
      contributes only one eye to the efficacy analysis. The study is powered for this analysis. We&#xD;
      will use the specific type of IEE (Independence Estimating Equations) which reveals correct&#xD;
      standard errors and a robust estimate for model parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, we will compare the Intervention group vs. control group (waiting group) (n=7&#xD;
      vs. 7), using baseline adjusted analysis of covariance and between subject comparisons. This&#xD;
      analysis will use GEEs as described for the primary analysis including both eyes of cohort B&#xD;
      and C and only the newly treated eye in cohort A. This analysis will be descriptive and&#xD;
      provide evidence for the planning of a randomized Phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis population will be the ITT in which only patients with baseline&#xD;
      measurements will be included. For patients providing baseline measurements in one eye, only&#xD;
      this eye will be included. Multiple imputation will be done with sampling unit &quot;eye&quot; if only&#xD;
      baseline, but not follow up data are available. Descriptive parameters will be given for the&#xD;
      full cohort (n=14) and for the sub-strata (n=4, 4, 6 pooled), additionally, correlation&#xD;
      analysis descriptively for the comparison of subjective and objective measurements will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety (ITT): AEs and SAEs will be documented using line listings and tabulations (MedDRA&#xD;
      code will be applied). Frequency tabulations of certain classes of events will be given&#xD;
      including two-sided 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of analysis (1) is to gain evidence for a sample size estimation for a phase III&#xD;
      trial with similar design, where analysis (2) will be confirmatory and powered according to a&#xD;
      sample size estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Schedule: of trial November 2015 end of recruitment 04/2022, end of trial 04/2027,&#xD;
      duration of trial per patient: one year with four years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final study report will be prepared after completion of the four year follow-up period (5&#xD;
      years after treatment).&#xD;
