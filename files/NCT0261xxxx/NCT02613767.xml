  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are an increasing number of individuals in the United States with obesity, and this is&#xD;
      a major health concern with links to many chronic diseases. Impairments in protein metabolism&#xD;
      with obesity may disrupt muscle function and modify the dietary protein requirements in obese&#xD;
      individuals. Further, overweight and obese type 2 diabetics exhibit dramatically reduced&#xD;
      skeletal muscle mass compared with lean, healthy controls. Surprisingly, the influence of&#xD;
      being overweight or obese on this decline in muscle mass remains understudied, despite clear&#xD;
      evidence that similar metabolic impairments typically exist in these populations prior to the&#xD;
      development of overt diabetes. Protein ingestion provides the amino acid building blocks to&#xD;
      synthesize and repair muscle proteins in adults. Previous research has shown that the muscle&#xD;
      protein synthetic response to food ingestion may be reduced in overweight/obese adults.&#xD;
      However, this research provided the 'free' amino acids in small portions every 15 min during&#xD;
      the postprandial period. In free living conditions, however, it is more common to consume&#xD;
      protein dense foods in single portions. Currently, there is no information available on how&#xD;
      eating protein rich foods affects muscle protein synthesis in overweight and obese adults.&#xD;
      This proposed research will fill this research gap by being the first study to compare the&#xD;
      muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of a meal-like amount of high quality&#xD;
      protein in lean, overweight and obese adults. The objective of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      muscle protein synthetic response after the consumption of 35g pork protein in lean,&#xD;
      overweight and obese adults. In order to assess this objective the researchers propose to use&#xD;
      primed continuous infusion of L-[ring-13C6] phenylalanine to measure muscle protein synthesis&#xD;
      rates after the consumption of dietary protein. In a parallel design the researchers will&#xD;
      study 13 obese (BMI 30-39.9 kg/m2) participants, 13 overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2), and 13&#xD;
      age-matched lean controls (BMI 18-24.9 kg/m2) between the ages of 20 and 45 years. All&#xD;
      subjects will be sedentary and weight stable for the previous 6 months. On the test day,&#xD;
      subjects will remain sedentary for the determination of muscle protein synthesis in both the&#xD;
      fasted state and after consumption of the protein meal. Blood and muscle sampling will occur&#xD;
      on the test day.&#xD;

      Participants will be asked to report to the laboratory at 7:00 am following an overnight&#xD;
      fast. Upon arrival, a Teflon catheter will be inserted in an antecubital vein of one arm for&#xD;
      arterialized blood sampling and a baseline blood sample will be drawn. Arterialized blood&#xD;
      samples will be obtained by wrapping the subjects' forearm in a heating blanket (45 °C) for&#xD;
      10 min prior to each blood collection time point. A second Teflon catheter will be inserted&#xD;
      in an antecubital vein of the opposite arm, and participants will receive a priming dose of&#xD;
      L-[ring- 13C6]phenylalanine (2.0 µmol∙kg) prior to initiating a continuous infusion of&#xD;
      L-[ring-13C6]phenylalanine (0.05 µmol∙kg∙min) (t=-240). The prime and continuous tracer&#xD;
      infusion will be passed through a 0.2 μm filter. Blood will be collected every 1 hour and&#xD;
      biopsies of the vastus lateralis will be collected at t=-180 and t=-15 min using a 5 mm&#xD;
      Bergström needle (modified for manual suction) under 2% xylocaine local anesthesia for the&#xD;
      measurement of postabsorptive muscle protein synthesis rates. The second biopsy (t=-15 min)&#xD;
      will be used to determine baseline levels of phosphorylated and total proteins involved in&#xD;
      nutrient sensing and muscle anabolic signaling. Subsequently, the participants will ingest 6&#xD;
      oz of fresh ground center cut pork loin. This cut of meat was selected due to its low lipid&#xD;
      content (2.5-3%) and it is uniform in shape, size and composition. Along with the ingested&#xD;
      pork, the participants will consume 300 mL of water. The water will be enriched to 5% with&#xD;
      tracer according to the phenylalanine content of ~4% in the pork. This approach is required&#xD;
      to minimize disturbances in isotopic steady state and provide appropriate conditions for the&#xD;
      calculation of postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates. The time required to consume the&#xD;
      pork will be recorded. The completion of the pork meal and water will mark the start of the&#xD;
      postprandial phase (t=0). During this period, arterialized blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      into evacuated chilled heparinized tubes at t=30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 min.&#xD;
      Additional muscle biopsies will be collected at t=120 and 300 min of the experimental&#xD;
      infusion for the measurement of postprandial muscle protein synthetic and muscle anabolic&#xD;
      signaling protein responses. The muscle biopsy samples will be freed from any visible blood,&#xD;
      fat, and connective tissue, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80˚C until&#xD;
      analysis. Blood samples will be centrifuged at 1,000×g at 4˚C for 10 min and separated plasma&#xD;
      will be transferred to 2.0 ml cryovials. The plasma samples will be stored at -20˚C until&#xD;
      further analysis.&#xD;

        We recruited 32 healthy, sedentary adult subjects (20-45 y) for this investigation. There&#xD;
        are three groups being studied, which will be stratified by body mass index. Because&#xD;
        randomization is not possible, groups were balanced by age and sex. No races or ethnic&#xD;
        groups will be specifically recruited or excluded.&#xD;
