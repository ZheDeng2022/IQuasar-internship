      This is a phase I study of combination immunotherapy with IFN-γ and the PD-1 inhibitor&#xD;
      nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed on at least one prior&#xD;
      systemic therapy, which may include prior immunotherapy. Patients will be treated with a one&#xD;
      week induction phase (IP) of IFN-γ, followed by a combination phase (CP) with IFN-γ and&#xD;
      nivolumab for three cycles, followed by a single agent phase of only nivolumab for up to one&#xD;
      year. The study will primarily assess the safety and tolerability of the combination. Tumor&#xD;
      assessments will occur after three cycles of combination therapy, then every three cycles&#xD;
      thereafter. Secondary objectives including ORR, PFS, and OS will also be assessed, as will&#xD;
      various correlative analyses. Initial accrual will occur using a modified 6+6 design, and if&#xD;
      endpoints for safety (using DLT criteria) are met, expansion cohorts in RCC and UC will be&#xD;
      opened for up to 15 patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic solid tumor&#xD;
             that has shown clinical or pre-clinical evidence of responding to anti-PD-1 therapy or&#xD;
             the capacity to up-regulate PD-L1. These tumor types may include but may not be&#xD;
             limited to: RCC, UC, melanoma, non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung&#xD;
             cancer, squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN), ovarian carcinoma, triple&#xD;
             negative breast cancer, gastric cancer, microsatellite instability expressing&#xD;
             (MSI-high) colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, mesothelioma, gastrointestinal&#xD;
             stromal tumors, endometrial carcinoma, liposarcomas, chondrosarcomas, and uterine&#xD;
             sarcomas. Patients with solid tumor types not listed above may be enrolled at the&#xD;
             discretion of the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Dose expansion phase will include two cohorts and consist of patients with&#xD;
             either metastatic UC or RCC, but must meet all other inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All patients must have received at least one line of systemic therapy in the&#xD;
             metastatic setting. Prior immunotherapy is allowed, including prior treatment with&#xD;
             nivolumab or another PD-1 inhibitor, as long as the reason for discontinuation of a&#xD;
             prior PD-1 inhibitor was not for drug-related toxicity.&#xD;

             detail in section 11.0.&#xD;

             core biopies. At least 3 formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) slides at five&#xD;
             microns each may be collected at each biopsy. Determination of tissue accessibility&#xD;
             and quantity will be made by the consenting clinician. Patients must consent to the&#xD;
             two study-required biopsy procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), except patients with&#xD;
                  Gilbert's syndrome in whom total bilirubin must be &lt;3.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST/ALT (SGOT/SGPT) &lt; 3 times institutional normal limits&#xD;
&#xD;

                  or calculated by Cockroft-Gault formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and HIPAA&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             recur in the absence of an external trigger. Subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, or residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis only requiring&#xD;

             arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or history of acquired immune&#xD;
             deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-defining illness.&#xD;

             states, unless disease has been treated and confirmed cleared.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any medical condition that in the investigator's opinion could interfere with&#xD;
             interpretation of study or toxicity, or increase the risk to the patient related to&#xD;
             potential toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Major surgery within 4 weeks of initiation of study drug.&#xD;
