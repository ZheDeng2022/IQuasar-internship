  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the a Qigong based exercise intervention, here referred to as&#xD;
      Meditative Movement (MM), to ameliorate the symptoms associated with chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) and its co-morbidities. It tests the hypothesis that MM will have a&#xD;
      beneficial effect on COPD in FA, particularly on functional ability, respiratory symptoms,&#xD;
      affective state, inflammation, and autonomic imbalance. If the hypothesis is correct, MM&#xD;
      could be rapidly and inexpensively taught to FA with COPD and other COPD patients to slow&#xD;
      degeneration and improve quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has three phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will identify the best MM practices and their impact on a test group of affected FA.&#xD;
      Phase 2 will develop a video to apply what is learned in Phase 1 to a larger group of&#xD;
      affected FA, and will document the resulting impact on various aspects of pulmonary&#xD;
      dysfunction and its comorbidities. Phase 3 is to refine the protocols and methods developed&#xD;
      in earlier phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: To identify the best set of MM exercises for improving COPD-related symptoms. This&#xD;
      will be done by conducting a 12-week in-person MM program that will be held in one or more&#xD;
      locations in the Northeastern region of the US and possibly other regions of the&#xD;
      country.These training sessions will be used to determine precisely which MM exercises are&#xD;
      most appropriate for this group. Selection will be based on professional judgment,&#xD;
      participant feedback, and objective pre- and post-intervention measurements taken at the&#xD;
      beginning and end of the 12-week program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: To use an RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of the exercises selected in Aim 1, as&#xD;
      delivered by video only. We will design and produce an instructional DVD based on the&#xD;
      findings in Aim 1.In the RCT we will test the hypothesis that targeted MM training and&#xD;
      practice using the DVD alone will improve QOL, exercise tolerance, autonomic balance and&#xD;
      pulmonary function, and reduce fatigue, in flight attendants with a COPD diagnosis. Pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention measurements will be compared, and to outcomes from a control group of&#xD;
      flight attendants who will be wait listed for later participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: The videos used to train subjects in Phase II will be refined and the order of&#xD;
      introduction of training modules will be adjusted. Efficacy will again be tested in newly&#xD;
      recruited subjects. This is also a RCT.&#xD;
