    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of treatment with once&#xD;
      daily (QD) oral administration of dexlansoprazole 30 or 60 mg for 8 to 12 weeks in pediatric&#xD;
      subjects aged 1 to 11 years inclusive, with erosive esophagitis (EE) and to assess the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of dexlansoprazole 15 or 30 mg compared to placebo in maintenance of healed&#xD;
      EE for 16 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. Dexlansoprazole is being&#xD;
      tested to heal erosive esophagitis (EE) and maintain healing of EE in pediatric participants&#xD;
      aged 1 to 11 years. This study will look at the healing of EE followed by maintained healing&#xD;
      of EE in children who take dexlansoprazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two periods; a Healing of EE Period and a Maintenance of&#xD;
      Healed EE Period. Approximately 80 patients will be enrolled in this study. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to receive dexlansoprazole 60 mg or&#xD;
      dexlansoprazole 30 mg for 8 to 12 weeks during the Healing of EE Period. Participants who&#xD;
      have healed EE confirmed by endoscopy at week 8 or 12 will enter the Maintenance of Healed EE&#xD;
      Period and will be randomly assigned to receive half their healing dose of dexlansoprazole,(&#xD;
      i.e., either 30 mg, dexlansoprazole 15 mg), or placebo (this is a capsule that looks like the&#xD;
      study drug but has no active ingredient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the&#xD;
      study. All participants will be asked to record any time they have heartburn symptoms in a&#xD;
      diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who complete the 16 weeks of the Maintenance of Healed EE Period (Week 24 or Week 28&#xD;
      as applicable) and have maintained healing of EE as confirmed by endoscopy, will enter a&#xD;
      Post-Treatment Follow up Period for up to 3 months after the last dose of study drug. During&#xD;
      this period subjects will continue to complete the symptom questionnaires daily in the&#xD;
      eDiaries and return for a clinic visit each month. Subjects who require an invasive procedure&#xD;
      or treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or histamine 2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) for&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)/EE will be discontinued from the Post-Treatment&#xD;
      Follow-up Period and a Final Study Visit will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is up to 40 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic including a&#xD;
      final visit 3 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
