  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The twin pregnancies monochorionic are specifically explained to two main types of&#xD;
      complications: the anomalies of the embryo affecting a symmetry and in particular the median&#xD;
      line on one hand and malformative sequences of vascular origin on the other hand. This last&#xD;
      category of anomalies (twin-to-twin syndrome, TTTS) develops because of the presence of a&#xD;
      division of the foeto-placentary circulation between both twins through the pooling of&#xD;
      certain placentary cotyledons. The latter are then vascularized by an arterial and venous&#xD;
      foot belonging to both foetuses (anastomoses arteria-venous or veinous-arterial). It results&#xD;
      from it an imbalance moderate but very early hemodynamic which is going to return a&#xD;
      hypovolume twin (the donor) and its plethoric co-twin (the recipient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These anomalies in utero could not only have consequences during the fetal life, on the born&#xD;
      weight and the later development of newborns, but also on the organization and the&#xD;
      functioning of a whole series of physiological systems. So these anomalies of the pregnancy&#xD;
      could have also consequences which exceed by very far from the perinatal period, by favoring&#xD;
      the development of the atheroma, the high blood pressure, the resistance in the insulin, and&#xD;
      many other metabolic and endocrine functions were known for their importance in human&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons the investigators suggest estimating the tensional, cardiac and metabolic&#xD;
      status of children ex-transfusers and of children ex-transfused in 2 different age classes:&#xD;
      between 4 and 8 years then when these children will have between 12 and 16 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also some evaluation clinical and biological of the puberty (only at the age of&#xD;
      12-16)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand a possible effect of the prenatal status of these children on the endocrinology&#xD;
      of the puberty, the measures and the following dosages will be realized:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test in the GnRH (T0, T30, T60, T90): dosages of LH and FSH (relationship of peaks to&#xD;
           determine the puberty evolution),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosages of the sexual steroids, the oestradiol for the girl and the testosterone for the&#xD;
           boy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination looking for the signs of puberty&#xD;
&#xD;
      This if study leans on the big originality of the physiopathological model of TTTS in which&#xD;
      the children present the peculiarity to have an identical genetic and postnatal status and a&#xD;
      different prenatal environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up of these children should allow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand better the postnatal impact anomalies on these children in the course of&#xD;
           pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To anticipate and thus to improve their care in case of appearance of biological or&#xD;
           clinical signs&#xD;
