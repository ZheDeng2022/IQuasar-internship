      A randomised placebo-controlled feasibility study of glycopyrrolate and hyoscine in the&#xD;
      treatment of clozapine-induced hypersalivation to assess recruitment and retention rates in a&#xD;
      multi-centre trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility of recruiting both community and in-patients from different&#xD;
      centres. Specifically, the feasibility study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ascertain whether the study design is acceptable to participants, including&#xD;
           randomisation and use of telephone interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ascertain whether the interventions are acceptable to participants and indicate likely&#xD;
           attrition rates and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascertain the standard deviation of the daytime hypersalivation measure to estimate the&#xD;
      required sample size for a future efficacy randomised clinical trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre (3 sites) randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled feasibility&#xD;
      study of glycopyrrolate and hyoscine in patients with clozapine-induced hypersalivation.&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit 42 patients who have been prescribed clozapine and are&#xD;
      experiencing hypersalivation. Eligible participants will be recruited to a 5-week study&#xD;
      consisting of a 1-week wash-out period followed by a 4-week treatment period. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomised on a 1:1:1 basis to one of three study arms (hyoscine, glycopyrrolate or&#xD;
      placebo). Self-report measures of salivation and side effects will be taken weekly and&#xD;
      cognition will be assessed on two occasions during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification, recruitment and consenting of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from out-patient clozapine clinics from three National Health&#xD;
      Service (NHS) mental health trusts. R&amp;D approval will be obtained from each mental health&#xD;
      trust prior to start of the study. The study protocol and information sheets will be provided&#xD;
      to clinical staff at each participating site who will be asked to identify potential&#xD;
      participants who fulfil inclusion/exclusion criteria. Clinical staff will approach potential&#xD;
      patients and seek their agreement for research staff to approach them about participation in&#xD;
      the study. After permission has been obtained to approach a potential participant, a&#xD;
      researcher will write to them to send a study information. At least three days later, the&#xD;
      researcher will contact the patient by telephone and enquire if they are interested in&#xD;
      participation. If the patient provisionally agrees, an appointment will be made for the&#xD;
      researcher to visit the participant (either at the participant's home or at their next clinic&#xD;
      appointment), in order to answer any further questions the participant may have and to obtain&#xD;
      written informed consent. Following recruitment and consent, the Responsible Clinician (RC)&#xD;
      and the participant's General Practitioner (GP) will be informed in writing (with the&#xD;
      participant's consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation to the three trial arms will be a 1:1:1 basis. The three arms are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyoscine (Arm A - treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glycopyrrolate (Arm B - treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (Arm C - control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the participant nor the researchers will be aware of the arm to which each&#xD;
      participant has been allocated and details of the allocation will remain concealed from the&#xD;
      research team until after data lock. Blinding of participants and the research team to&#xD;
      allocation status will be assured by identical capsule appearance and identical labelling on&#xD;
      trial medication (apart from labels identifying the patient). In the event a patient develops&#xD;
      any side- effects where drug unblinding is required, the treating physician will be made&#xD;
      aware of the study drug, possible side-effects and make the appropriate decision whether to&#xD;
      continue or discontinue the drug. The safety and wellbeing of the patient will be paramount&#xD;
      at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant withdrawal and replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are removed from the study due to adverse events will be treated and&#xD;
      followed according to accepted medical practice. The research team may withdraw a participant&#xD;
      from trial because of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse event or serious adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent non-compliance with the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sponsor's decision to terminate the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal by the Investigator for clinical reasons not related to the study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptomatic deterioration including patients who experience rapid deterioration before&#xD;
           completion of the protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient withdraws or is withdrawn from the study, it is not the intention to replace&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug dosage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyoscine. The dosing schedule for Hyoscine Hydrobromide during the 5-week study period is:&#xD;
      week 1 - washout period (discontinue existing medication for clozapine-induced&#xD;
      hypersalivation (CIH), if any); week 2 - 300 micrograms twice daily; weeks 3, 4 and 5 - 300&#xD;
      micrograms three times daily. This is within the dose range recommended in the British&#xD;
      National Formulary (BNF) (off licence use for hypersalivation), the Maudsley Prescribing&#xD;
      Guidelines for the treatment of CIH and is consistent with current prescribing practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycopyrrolate. The dosing schedule for Glycopyrronium Bromide during the 5-week study period&#xD;
      will be: week 1 - washout period (discontinue existing medication for CIH, if any); week 2 -&#xD;
      1 milligram twice daily; weeks 3, 4 and 5 - 1 milligram three times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drooling Rating Scale (DRS) The DRS is a two-item scale comprising drooling severity and&#xD;
      frequency assessments that combine to form a score ranging from 2 - 9. Whilst it has not been&#xD;
      validated and its metrics (standard deviation, mean, sensitivity to change) are unknown in a&#xD;
      CIH population, it has good face validity and has been used in published research on&#xD;
      paediatric hypersalivation. A feasibility aim is to establish its metrics in a CIH&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nocturnal Hypersalivation Rating Scale (NHRS) The NHRS is a validated single-item 5-point&#xD;
      self-report scale for measuring the degree of nocturnal salivation that a respondent&#xD;
      experiences. The NHRS is the only scale specifically mentioned in the Cochrane review for&#xD;
      treatments for CIH that is recommended for inclusion in future studies of the efficacy of CIH&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) The BACS comprises a short battery of&#xD;
      tests devised for easy administration and scoring which assess the extent of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment in schizophrenia. The battery includes brief assessments of executive functions,&#xD;
      verbal fluency, attention, verbal memory, working memory and motor speed and requires&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side-Effect Rating Scale (LUNSERS) LUNSERS is a 51-item&#xD;
      checklist of side-effects which asks for ratings on a 5-point scale of the degree to which&#xD;
      respondents have experienced that side effect in the last month. It shows good reliability&#xD;
      and validity, correlating well with other clinician-administered side effect scales. A&#xD;
      modified LUNSERS will be used to assess side-effects in the previous week (rather than&#xD;
      month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three visits in total by a researcher and there may also be one further visit&#xD;
      to conduct an exit interview if a participant consents to this. The schedule of assessments&#xD;
      is detailed in Table 1. A Baseline Visit will take place at the end of the Week 1 washout&#xD;
      period, where a researcher will visit the participant at home to deliver trial medication for&#xD;
      Week 2 and administer all assessment measures (DRS, NHRS, BACS, LUNSERS). The Maintenance&#xD;
      Visit will take place at the end of Week 2, where a researcher will visit the participant at&#xD;
      home to deliver trial medication for Weeks 3-5 and administer hypersalivation scales (DRS,&#xD;
      NHRS) and the side effects scale (LUNSERS). The Final Visit will take place at the end of&#xD;
      Week 5 where a researcher will visit the participant at home to administer all assessment&#xD;
      measures (DRS, NHRS, BACS, LUNSERS) again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important aim is to explore the feasibility of collecting information on hypersalivation&#xD;
      and side-effects using weekly telephone calls assessing. At the end of Week 3 and Week 4, a&#xD;
      researcher will telephone the participant at a prearranged time and administer&#xD;
      hypersalivation scales (DRS, NHRS) and the side effects scale (LUNSERS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will request an exit interview with all participants who drop out of the study&#xD;
      and a number of participants who complete the study until 12 interviews (4 from each study&#xD;
      arm) have been conducted. Interviews will take place at the participant's home at their&#xD;
      convenience Two researchers (one of whom will also be a service user) will conduct a&#xD;
      20-minute interview to explore the participant's experience of taking part in the study,&#xD;
      exploring the acceptability of the study methods and seeking advice on how study&#xD;
      participation experience could be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intended sample size is based on recruiting sufficient numbers to fulfil the feasibility&#xD;
      aims of the study. The intention is to recruit 14 patients to each of three study arms&#xD;
      because recruitment for a total sample of 42 will allow a good estimate of recruitment and&#xD;
      attrition rates. The investigators estimate an attrition rate of 20% (which is substantially&#xD;
      higher than in previous studies) which implies nine dropouts and this allows clear&#xD;
      differentiation from the progression criterion (40% drop-out, n=17), with &gt;80% power to&#xD;
      detect a difference of this size with the alpha 0.25 (1 tailed). This is consistent with the&#xD;
      relaxed power and alpha criteria suitable for an early phase study of this type specifically&#xD;
      the alpha 0.25 criterion. Furthermore, 14 in each arm will be sufficient to gain an&#xD;
      indication of the metrics (standard deviation, mean, sensitivity to change) for the putative&#xD;
      primary outcome measure (DRS) in placebo and active treatment arms recruited from this&#xD;
      population for the future definitive study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Reporting procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Adverse Events (AE) suspected of having a causal relationship to either study drug will&#xD;
      be captured in the participant's clinical notes and Case Report Form (CRF) from the start of&#xD;
      treatment (week 2) until the end of the patient's involvement in the study. Serious Adverse&#xD;
      Events (SAE) will also be reported within 24 hours of observing or learning about the event.&#xD;
      The study manager will liaise with the Chief Investigator (CI) to evaluate the event for&#xD;
      seriousness, causality and expectedness. All SAEs will be followed-up until resolution and&#xD;
      the participating site must provide follow-up reports if the SAE has not resolved at the time&#xD;
      the initial report was submitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial management and quality assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is managed through the Trial Management Group (TMG) which includes those&#xD;
      individuals responsible for the day-to-day management of the study. The TMG has operational&#xD;
      responsibility for the conduct of the study including monitoring overall progress and taking&#xD;
      appropriate action to safeguard participants and the quality of the study. The TMG will meet&#xD;
      at least quarterly once the study is actively recruiting. At least annually, the TMG will be&#xD;
      extended to invite an independent chair (not involved directly in the study) and additional&#xD;
      independent members, a service user representative, and the assembly will be conducted as a&#xD;
      Trial Steering Committee (TSC) meeting. The TSC takes responsibility for the scientific&#xD;
      integrity of the study, the scientific validity of the study protocol, assessment of the&#xD;
      study quality and conduct as well as for the scientific quality of the final study report.&#xD;
      Decisions about the continuation or termination of the study or substantial amendments to the&#xD;
      protocol are the responsibility of the TSC.&#xD;
