  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the late 1980s, several studies focused on pediatric procedural pain and show that it&#xD;
      still underevaluated and undertreated, especially in the Emergency Department (ED).&#xD;
      Needle-related procedures are the most important source of pain and anxiety and children.&#xD;
      Since it is impossible to completely eliminate the pain and anxiety experienced by children&#xD;
      during painful procedures, use of non-pharmacological and/or pharmacological interventions&#xD;
      might be beneficial. Most methods used for relief of procedural pain and anxiety for children&#xD;
      require time or extra staff, which represent barriers to their implantation in the ED. An&#xD;
      easy-to-use and rapid non-pharmacological intervention could overcome these constraints and&#xD;
      optimize procedural pain and anxiety relief in children undergoing a needle-related&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if a device combining cold and vibration&#xD;
      (Buzzy®) is non-inferior (no worse) than a topical anesthetic cream (lidocaine liposomal 4%)&#xD;
      for procedural pain management in children undergoing needle-related procedures in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators strongly believe that the use of the Buzzy® device in the ED will improve&#xD;
      significantly the pain and anxiety felt by children undergoing needle-related procedures.&#xD;
      Since EDs are usually chaotic and very busy, an easy-to-use and rapid non-pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention like the Buzzy®, will surely be adopted by the nursing personnel as a useful&#xD;
      tool for procedural pain. Given this knowledge, the investigators feel that this randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will have the potential to improve nursing practice and optimize painful&#xD;
      experiences of children undergoing needle-related procedures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Since the 1980s, several researches focused on paediatric procedural pain to learn more about&#xD;
      its nature, its causes, its consequences, its assessment and treatment. However, decades&#xD;
      later, it is still undervalued and undertreated, especially in the Emergency Department (ED).&#xD;
      Thus, children experience a high level of pain and anxiety in the ED during painful&#xD;
      procedures, which could be due to multiple factors: lack of knowledge regarding pain&#xD;
      management interventions, lack of time, work overload, limited space and interruption in the&#xD;
      continuity of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Needle-related procedures (venipuncture, IV access, s/c, IM) are the most important sources&#xD;
      of pain and distress in children. A study shows that only 31% of children benefit from&#xD;
      procedural pain management during the insertion of an IV access and less than 1% during a&#xD;
      venipuncture. Inadequate procedural pain and anxiety relief in children is not without&#xD;
      consequences. These effects may be physiological, psychological and emotional and can have&#xD;
      long-term impact. Since it is impossible to completely eliminate the pain and anxiety&#xD;
      experienced by children during needle-related procedures, relief through non-pharmacological&#xD;
      and/or pharmacological interventions is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most relief methods of procedural pain and anxiety available for children require much time&#xD;
      or staff, which represent barriers regarding their implantation in the ED. The use of a rapid&#xD;
      and easy-to-use non-pharmacological intervention could overcome these constraints and&#xD;
      optimize procedural pain and anxiety relief in children. In 2009, a new device (Buzzy®),&#xD;
      combining cold (ice wings) and vibration (bee's body), was developed in the USA for the&#xD;
      relief of pediatric procedural pain. This device relies on the Gate Control Theory as well as&#xD;
      diffuse noxious inhibitory control for the modulation of pain response (Baxter et al., 2009).&#xD;
      Efficacy of the Buzzy® device in pediatric patients in the ED has only been evaluated in two&#xD;
      studies up to this date. Both studies showed significant results regarding control of&#xD;
      post-procedural pain and post-procedural anxiety. So far, no study has been conducted in&#xD;
      Canada and none has compared the effects of Buzzy. Since the 1980s, several researches&#xD;
      focused on pediatric procedural pain to learn more about its nature, its causes, its&#xD;
      consequences, its assessment and treatment. However, decades later, it is still undervalued&#xD;
      and undertreated, especially in the Emergency Department (ED). Thus, children experience a&#xD;
      high level of pain and anxiety in the ED during painful procedures, which could be due to&#xD;
      multiple factors: lack of knowledge regarding pain management interventions, lack of time,&#xD;
      work overload, limited space and interruption in the continuity of care.&#xD;

      The few study that have evaluated its efficacy presents several limitations, such as small&#xD;
      sample size and absence of intervention in control group. To date, no study has been&#xD;
      conducted in Canada and none has compared its effects with the gold standard intervention for&#xD;
      needle-related procedures, the topical anesthetic cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to determine if a device combining cold and vibration&#xD;
      (Buzzy®) is non-inferior (no worse) than lidocaine liposomal 4% for procedural pain&#xD;
      management in children undergoing needle-related procedures in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study is a two-arm, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial. Setting:&#xD;
      Pediatric ED in a university health center in Montreal. Inclusion criteria: Investigators&#xD;
      will include children: 1) Ages from 4-17 years old; 2) Visiting the ED; 3) Requiring a&#xD;
      needle-related procedure (venipuncture or IV catheter insertion); 4) Understanding and&#xD;
      speaking either French or English; 5) Having at least one parent (or legal guardian) who&#xD;
      understands, read and talks in French or English. Exclusion criteria: Investigators will&#xD;
      exclude children with: 1) A neuro-cognitive impairment that precludes informed consent and/or&#xD;
      assent, 2) An inability to self-report pain, 3) A critical or unstable health. Interventions:&#xD;
      Arm 1 (Buzzy® device): Just before the needle-related procedure, the Buzzy® device (combining&#xD;
      an ice pack and vibration integrated to a plastic bee) will be applied 5 cm above needle&#xD;
      insertion site and will be maintained in place throughout the painful procedure. Arm 2&#xD;
      (lidocaine liposomal 4%): The topical anesthetic cream will be applied 30 minutes before the&#xD;
      needle-related procedure on the insertion site. Randomization and Allocation: A independent&#xD;
      biostatistician will generate the sequence of randomization stratified by age (4-7; 8-12;&#xD;
      13-17) and using permuted block sizes for each stratum. Enrolled participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the two arms with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Sample size: Using a&#xD;
      non-inferiority margin of 0.7 on a scale 0 to 10 for mean per-procedural pain, a total of 380&#xD;
      participants (190/group) will be necessary to achieve a power of 90% at the one-sided 5%&#xD;
      significance. Primary outcome: The primary outcome will be the mean per-procedural pain&#xD;
      scores on the Color Analogue Scale (CAS). Secondary outcomes: a) Mean per-procedural pain&#xD;
      scores on Faces-Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R), b) Mean level of per-procedural distress using&#xD;
      the Procedure Behavior Check List (PBCL) and the Children's Fear Scale (CFS), c) Memory of&#xD;
      pain 24 hours after the needle-related procedure on the FPS-R. d_ Proportion of children with&#xD;
      success of the needle-related procedure at first attempt, e) Self-reported levels of&#xD;
      satisfaction of children, parents and nurses with questionnaires previously developped by our&#xD;
      team. Analyses: All analyses will be performed under both intention-to-treat and per-protocol&#xD;
      principles. Regarding the primary outcome, the mean difference in pain scores between the&#xD;
      experimental group ( Buzzy® device) and the control group (lidocaine liposomal 4%) along with&#xD;
      its lower confidence limit will be calculated. If this limit lies within (-∞,0.7), then the&#xD;
      null hypothesis of inferiority will be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis at the&#xD;
      5% significance level. A similar approach will be used for the secondary outcomes (a, b, c).&#xD;
      Proportion of children with success of the procedure at first attempt will be compared using&#xD;
      a chi-square test. Descriptive statistics will be used to report data on satisfaction. ANCOVA&#xD;
      will be performed on covariate to increase statistical power. Subgroups analyses will be&#xD;
      performed according to age groups (4-7; 8-12; 13-17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed work will be the first RCT in Canada to assess the efficacy of the Buzzy®&#xD;
      device for procedural pain and anxiety relief in children undergoing needle-related&#xD;
      procedure. Very few studies of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions exist,&#xD;
      but no intervention have been identified to be optimal for pain and anxiety management in the&#xD;
      context of an ED. Investigators strongly believe that the use of the Buzzy® device in&#xD;
      children undergoing needle-related procedures would optimize nursing practice and improve&#xD;
      pain and anxiety experienced by children during their visit to the ED.&#xD;
