      This is a Phase 2, two-step, open-label study of the outcome of analytic treatment&#xD;
      interruption (ATI) on patients who started antiretroviral therapy (ART) during Fiebig Stage I&#xD;
      of acute HIV infection (AHI), defined as detectable HIV-RNA without detectable p24 antigen or&#xD;
      HIV IgM. The primary endpoint will be rate of sustained viral suppression, defined as HIV-1&#xD;
      RNA &lt; 50 cps/ml at 24 weeks after treatment interruption. During ATI subjects will be&#xD;
      monitored closely for safety and will have ART re-initiated if they meet predefined clinical,&#xD;
      virological, or immunological criteria. In step I, there will be 8 subjects who undergo ATI.&#xD;
      An interim analysis for safety will be conducted after 12 weeks. If none of the subjects&#xD;
      maintain viral suppression at 12 weeks then no further subjects will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study. If at least 1 out of 8 subjects maintains viral suppression at 12 weeks then an&#xD;
      additional 7 subjects will be enrolled in step 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At ATI all antiretroviral drugs will be discontinued. Subjects will be monitored with&#xD;
      clinical exam, immunological (CD4), and virological (HIV-RNA) testing at baseline and then on&#xD;
      a fixed schedule for 24 weeks. ART will be re-initiated immediately if subjects meet any&#xD;
      pre-defined clinical, immunological or virological safety endpoints during the monitoring&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a two step open label study of ATI in patients who initiated ART in the earliest&#xD;
      detectable stage (Fiebig I) of HIV infection. In step I, eight subjects will discontinue ART&#xD;
      for a period of up to 24 weeks. An interim assessment will be conducted after all eight&#xD;
&#xD;
      subjects in step I complete follow-up for 12 weeks. If at least one out of eight subjects&#xD;
      maintains viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml) at 12 weeks, then the study will&#xD;
      proceed to step 2, in which 7 additional subjects (maximum total sample size of 15) will&#xD;
      undergo ATI. The primary endpoint is proportion of subjects who maintain viral suppression at&#xD;
      24 weeks post ATI. Subjects will be monitored frequently for disease progression using&#xD;
      clinical, immunological and virological criteria. ART will be re-initiated immediately for&#xD;
      any subjects who meet pre-defined criteria for disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent Study Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a sub-study of the protocol &quot;Establish and characterize an acute HIV infection cohort&#xD;
      in a high-risk population&quot; (SEARCH 010, RV254, WRAIR 1494) implemented at the Thai Red Cross&#xD;
      AIDS Research Center in Bangkok, Thailand. From April 2009 through February 2014 the cohort&#xD;
      had enrolled 150 patients with acute infection and 145 (97%) are still in active follow-up.&#xD;
      All patients in the cohort are offered ART at the time of enrollment through a separately&#xD;
      funded protocol; all 145 subjects (100%) in active follow-up are currently on ART. The median&#xD;
      age (range) of the cohort is 28 (18-57) years and 90% are men who have sex with men (MSM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort currently has 50 volunteers who started ART during Fiebig Stage 1, of whom 24 have&#xD;
      been on ART for &gt; 24 months and have HIV-1 &lt; 50 copies/ml. Another 13 volunteers have been on&#xD;
      ART 6-24 months with undetectable HIV-1 RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the period of co-enrollment in this substudy, no additional biological specimens will&#xD;
      be collected as part of the RV254/SEARCH 010 protocol. Data and samples from this substudy&#xD;
      will be shared with the parent protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria to reinitiate ART after ATI&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria to restart ART after ATI are designed to protect the subjects from any possible&#xD;
      clinical, immunological, or virological adverse effects in the event that their VL rebounds&#xD;
      while off ART. The viral load (VL) criterion of &gt; 1,000 copies/ml was chosen because clinical&#xD;
      symptoms of HIV infection or significant decline in CD4 count would not be expected at this&#xD;
      low level of viremia. The Fiebig I patients in the SEARCH 010 cohort had a median (range)&#xD;
      HIV-1 RNA of 4.8 (2.8-5.7) log10copies/ml, at a median (range) of 12 (4-40) days after&#xD;
      exposure to HIV, prior to initiation ART and have therefore already been exposed to high&#xD;
      levels of plasma virus during acute infection while maintaining low or no detectable HIV&#xD;
      proviral reservoirs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the ANRS Visconti study found that patients who are virologic controllers&#xD;
      (sustained VL &lt; 50 copies/ml) after ATI may initially and transiently have VL above&#xD;
      detection. Of 240 tests performed after treatment interruption in those who were subsequently&#xD;
      virologic controllers or PTC, 2% had VL &gt; 400 copies/ml and 18% had VL between 50 and 400&#xD;
      copies/ml. Therefore, low-level viremia may not always be indicative of viral rebound and can&#xD;
      potentially reverse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific criteria for re-initiation of ART after ATI are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HIV-1 RNA above 1,000 copies/ml on 2 consecutive determinations at least 3 days apart.&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HIV-1 RNA rise of â‰¥ 0.5 log10copies/ml per day provided that the last HIV-1 RNA is above&#xD;
           1000 copies/ml OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A single HIV-1 RNA above 10,000 copies/ml OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. CD4+ T-cell counts below 350 cells/mm3 on 2 consecutive determinations at least 2 weeks&#xD;
           apart. OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. CD4+ T-cell count decline of &gt; 50% from baseline prior to ATI. OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Clinical progression to CDC Category B or C disease. OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Diagnosis of Acute Retroviral Syndrome. OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Pregnancy OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Subject requests re-initiation of ART.&#xD;
