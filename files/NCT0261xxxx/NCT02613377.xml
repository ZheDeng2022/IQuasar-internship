  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transfusions cause more adverse events in children than in adults. Patients in pediatric&#xD;
      intensive care units (PICU) are particularly exposed to transfusions of plasma-rich blood&#xD;
      products (red blood cell (RBC), plasma and platelets) and the risk of adverse events after a&#xD;
      transfusion is particularly high in this vulnerable population. Transfusion-related acute&#xD;
      lung injury (TRALI), an acute inflammation of the lungs that impairs gas exchange leading to&#xD;
      acute respiratory failure, is one of the 2 most deadly transfusion complications in the&#xD;
      general population. There is limited evidence on TRALI incidence and impact in critically ill&#xD;
      children. This reduces the awareness of PICU team for this complication, and makes the&#xD;
      decision process to transfuse particularly difficult. Moreover, acute lung injury is highly&#xD;
      prevalent in critically ill children. It is therefore complex to ascertain if the high&#xD;
      frequency of respiratory deteriorations observed after a transfusion in PICU is explained by&#xD;
      the transfusion itself or by the evolution of the patient's critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a cohort study of consecutive transfused critically ill&#xD;
      children, with a control group of matched non-transfused children. The primary objective is&#xD;
      to determine if transfusion of RBC, plasma and/or platelets in PICU is an independent risk&#xD;
      factor of TRALI, and to compare the respiratory evolution in the two matched (transfused and&#xD;
      non-transfused) groups. The secondary objectives will include the determination of the&#xD;
      incidence rate, risk factors and clinical impact of TRALI in transfused PICU patients. The&#xD;
      investigators will study both &quot;classic TRALI&quot; and &quot;delayed TRALI&quot;.&#xD;

      Study Design This prospective cohort study will include all consecutive transfused patients&#xD;
      admitted to the participating PICUs over a one-year period and a control group of matched&#xD;
      non-transfused patients. The primary objectives will be assessed using the complete cohort of&#xD;
      transfused and non-transfused patients. Secondary objectives will be studied in transfused&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome measure is TRALI (definite, probable, and delayed TRALI) as&#xD;
      defined in section. In the non-transfused patients, the definition of Acute Lung Injury will&#xD;
      be the same as the one used as a criterion for defining TRALI, and the observation period&#xD;
      will be a similar 72-h period, starting at the same time zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective #1a: to determine if the transfusion of RBC, plasma or platelets is an&#xD;
           independent risk factor of TRALI in critically ill children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective #1b: to compare the progression of the respiratory function, in particular the&#xD;
           SpO2/FiO2 ratio, in transfused and non-transfused PICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective #2.a : To determine the incidence rate of classic (definite or probable) TRALI&#xD;
           and of delayed TRALI in transfused PICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective #2.b : To characterize the risk factors of classic (definite or probable)&#xD;
           TRALI and of delayed TRALI in transfused PICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective #2.c : To compare the progression of respiratory parameters after a 1st&#xD;
           transfusion in PICU patients with classic TRALI, delayed TRALI, and without TRALI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective #2.d : To compare the outcomes of transfused PICU patients with and without&#xD;
           classic (definite or probable) TRALI and delayed TRALI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective #2.e : To describe the inflammatory profile of PICU patients with definite,&#xD;
           probable, and delayed TRALI.&#xD;
