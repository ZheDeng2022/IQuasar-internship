      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perception and Satisfaction questionnaire will be developed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A validation test will be conducted on the Perception and Satisfaction questionnaire&#xD;
           (face, content and construct) before conducting the study. The validation process will&#xD;
           involve the participation of lecturers, professors and students by convenience sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prevent bias from the researchers, each participant will be given their code as their&#xD;
           identification number. Then the participants will be randomly divided into two groups.&#xD;
           They will be briefed on the purpose of study (stating that, the investigators would like&#xD;
           to see the efficacy of various teaching methods on students' knowledge gain) and&#xD;
           procedure of the study (examinations will be conducted, surveys at the end of each class&#xD;
           session and at the end of the study). They are requested to fill up basic demographic&#xD;
           data, consent form and ILS questionnaire(measuring the learning style of student) before&#xD;
           beginning the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this study, the lecture will be given by the 'Researcher 1' to standardize the input&#xD;
           to the participants of the two groups. This will produce a standardized input to the&#xD;
           students of the two groups of teaching method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the FC (flipped classroom) group, the length of the pre-recorded lecture videos will&#xD;
           be the same which the participants can view it unlimitedly. An assignment will be given&#xD;
           for FC group that will be attempted during the discussion class(2 hours) a week after&#xD;
           with the lecturer. No grades will be given for the assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meanwhile for the TC(traditional classroom) group, a standard lecture class of 1 hour&#xD;
           and 1 hour of tutorial class will be conducted on the same topic. The same ungraded&#xD;
           assignment will also be given to this group a week after the lecture class to be&#xD;
           attempted in the tutorial class&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One day gap will be given following the discussion and tutorial class for FC and TC&#xD;
           groups respectively following which an examination of 1 hour duration will be conducted&#xD;
           to test on their level of knowledge (assessed by exam score) on the topic being taught&#xD;
           for both the groups using the same set of questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the study, each participant will be given a feedback questionnaire to&#xD;
           evaluate their perception and satisfaction on the teaching method applied on them using&#xD;
           the 'Perception and Satisfaction Questionnaire'.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of flipped classroom compared to traditional lecture classroom among&#xD;
      physiotherapy participants - Quasi Experimental Study: This method of study divides a group&#xD;
      of participants from respective year and semester into two groups, controlled (traditional&#xD;
      lecture) and flipped classroom without their knowledge at the beginning of study. Each batch&#xD;
      of participants, ranging from year 1 to year 3 will have two groups of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy Students. participants from each intake will be randomly allocated into&#xD;
      TC(traditional classroom) and FC(flipped classroom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - All physiotherapy participants of University Tunku Abdul Rahman&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Participants who are not UTAR physiotherapy participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic profile of participants Index Of Learning Styles Questionnaire Perception and&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire Examinations on post teaching session/experiment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lecture rooms of University Tunku Abdul Rahman Sg. Long Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Method and Recruitment of Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of participants of physiotherapy will first be obtained from the Faculty General&#xD;
      Office (FGO) UTAR. Then the participants selected will be grouped into two groups of&#xD;
      traditional classroom (TC) and Flipped classroom (FC). Since it is a single blinded study,&#xD;
      the participants will not know which group they belong to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perception and Satisfaction questionnaire will be developed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A validation test will be conducted on the Perception and Satisfaction questionnaire&#xD;
           (face, content and construct) before conducting the study. The validation process will&#xD;
           involve the participation of lecturers, professors and students by convenience sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prevent bias from the researchers, each participant will be given their code as their&#xD;
           identification number. Then the participants will be randomly divided into two groups.&#xD;
           They will be briefed on the purpose of study (stating that, the investigators would like&#xD;
           to see the efficacy of various teaching methods on students' knowledge gain) and&#xD;
           procedure of the study (examinations will be conducted, surveys at the end of each class&#xD;
           session and at the end of the study). They are requested to fill up basic demographic&#xD;
           data, consent form and ILS questionnaire(measuring the learning style of student) before&#xD;
           beginning the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this study, the lecture will be given by the 'Researcher 1' to standardize the input&#xD;
           to the participants of the two groups. This will produce a standardized input to the&#xD;
           students of the two groups of teaching method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the FC (flipped classroom) group, the length of the pre-recorded lecture videos will&#xD;
           be the same which the participants can view it unlimitedly. An assignment will be given&#xD;
           for FC group that will be attempted during the discussion class(2 hours) a week after&#xD;
           with the lecturer. No grades will be given for the assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meanwhile for the TC(traditional classroom) group, a standard lecture class of 1 hour&#xD;
           and 1 hour of tutorial class will be conducted on the same topic. The same ungraded&#xD;
           assignment will also be given to this group a week after the lecture class to be&#xD;
           attempted in the tutorial class&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the assignment given, a case study on the topic taught will be designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One day gap will be given following the discussion and tutorial class for FC and TC&#xD;
           groups respectively following which an examination of 1 hour duration will be conducted&#xD;
           to test on their level of knowledge (assessed by exam score) on the topic being taught&#xD;
           for both the groups using the same set of questions. The examination papers will be&#xD;
           coded and will be marked by the content expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the study, each participant will be given a feedback questionnaire to&#xD;
           evaluate their perception and satisfaction on the teaching method applied on them using&#xD;
           the 'Perception and Satisfaction Questionnaire'.&#xD;
