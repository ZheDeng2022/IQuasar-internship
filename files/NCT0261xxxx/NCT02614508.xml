    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of buparlisib when given together&#xD;
      with ofatumumab or ibrutinib in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has&#xD;
      returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Buparlisib and&#xD;
      ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ofatumumab, may block cancer growth in different ways&#xD;
      by targeting certain cells. Giving buparlisib or ibrutinib and ofatumumab together may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of combined ofatumumab and&#xD;
      buparlisib in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic&#xD;
      lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have been exposed to ibrutinib (i.e., ibrutinib pre-treated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of combined ibrutinib and&#xD;
      buparlisib in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic&#xD;
      lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have NOT been exposed to ibrutinib (i.e., ibrutinib naïve)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine specific toxicities associated with combined buparlisib and ofatumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate for efficacy of buparlisib in combination with ofatumumab in ibrutinib&#xD;
      pre-treated patients with CLL/SLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine specific toxicities associated with combined buparlisib and ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate for efficacy of buparlisib in combination with ibrutinib in ibrutinib naive&#xD;
      patients with CLL/SLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of buparlisib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A (ibrutinib pre-treated): Patients receive buparlisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on&#xD;
      days 1-28 and ofatumumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 during of courses 1-2;&#xD;
      and day 1 of courses 4-7. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B (ibrutinib naive): Patients receive buparlisib as in Cohort A and ibrutinib PO on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a&#xD;
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a&#xD;
             positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test (&gt; 5 milli-international&#xD;
             unit [mIU]/mL); patients with elevated hCG at baseline that is judged to be related to&#xD;
             the tumor are eligible if hCG levels do not show the expected doubling when repeated&#xD;
             5-7 days later, or pregnancy has been ruled out by vaginal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who is not willing to apply highly effective contraception during the study&#xD;
             and through the duration as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking drug&#xD;
                  and for 16 weeks after the final dose of study treatment and should not father a&#xD;
                  child in this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of&#xD;
                  sperm; a condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to&#xD;
                  prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and&#xD;
                  through at least 4 weeks after the final dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Highly effective contraception is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                       lifestyle of the subject; (periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                       symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                       methods of contraception)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or&#xD;
                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking&#xD;
                       study treatment; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy&#xD;
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); (for female study&#xD;
                       subjects, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                       patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Use a combination of the following (both a+b):&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  a. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system&#xD;
                            (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  b. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm&#xD;
                            or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                            suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  c. Note: hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and&#xD;
                            implanted) are not allowed as buparlisib decreases the effectiveness of&#xD;
                            hormonal contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago; for women with&#xD;
             therapy-induced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status;&#xD;
             Note: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone&#xD;
             (LH-RH) agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for&#xD;
             induction of ovarian suppression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of central nervous system involvement by CLL or who have&#xD;
             prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hepatitis B or hepatitis C (active or carriers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received oral or IV chemotherapy or targeted anticancer therapy ≤ 2&#xD;
             weeks (4 weeks for nitrosourea, antibodies or mitomycin-C) prior to study enrollment;&#xD;
             steroids used for anti-cancer properties must be tapered to 10 mg or less of&#xD;
             prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to initiating therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with a pan-selective PI3K inhibitor are not&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
