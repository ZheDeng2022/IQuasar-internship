    <textblock>
      Treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) relies heavily on different regimes of&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents but remains one of the most challenging subtypes to treat because of&#xD;
      the lack of specific therapies. Despite being sensitive to chemotherapy, many women with TNBC&#xD;
      relapse quickly, developing locoregional recurrence or visceral metastasis. Toxicity and&#xD;
      chemotherapy resistance are still major limitations in the treatment of patients with TNBC.&#xD;
      Despite current trend of targeted therapy development, cytotoxic agents are a mainstay of&#xD;
      treatment of patients with breast cancer. Further research into new combination of different&#xD;
      compounds is needed in order to maximise benefit, whilst minimising toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is associated with resistance to a variety of&#xD;
      anti-tumor agents. This has been described pre-clinically with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents with varying mechanisms of action including taxanes, and DNA-damaging agents. In the&#xD;
      clinic, activated PI3K in tumors has been correlated with decreased response to therapy and&#xD;
      worse clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent biological findings suggest that a PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)&#xD;
      inhibitors may increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents which are considered standard&#xD;
      of care (SOC) for the treatment of several solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study by the Unitaed state Oncology Research of Huston and the Sarah Cannon Cancer Center&#xD;
      randomized 1830 patients with high risk breast cancer to the standard adjuvant treatment with&#xD;
      adriamicin cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel versus the experimental adjuvant treatment&#xD;
      with adriamicin taxotere (AT) followed by paclitaxel. At 5-years of follow up, the AT&#xD;
      followed by paclitaxel produced significantly better overall survival (p=0.054) and improved&#xD;
      disease free survival (DFS) (p=0.19). Among TNBC patients both DFS (74% versus 79%, p=0.1)&#xD;
      and overall survival (OS) (79% versus 84%, p=0.037) were better in experimental arm. However,&#xD;
      the main reasons for patients being taken off study treatment were toxicity (85 patients in&#xD;
      the control arm and 128 in the experimental arm) and consent withdrawal (18 patients in the&#xD;
      control arm and 30 patients in the experimental arm). For this reason, research into&#xD;
      alternatives has intensified, thus resulting in the discovery and development of new&#xD;
      compounds with a more tolerable profile as compared with paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the total of 762 patients enrolled into Eisai Metastatic Breast Cancer Study Assessing&#xD;
      Physician's Choice Versus E7389 (EMBRACE) trial, 19% had TNBC. Of note, eribulin was most&#xD;
      effective in hormone receptor-negative patients and in TNBC patients, who had a 29% risk&#xD;
      reduction. Treatment with eribulin was well tolerated. Neutropenia, leucopenia, peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, and asthenia/fatigue were the most common adverse events reported at Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades 3 and 4. Neutropenia was the most&#xD;
      common adverse events reported at CTCAE grade 4 in the eribulin group (24.1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on findings to date, eribulin is an attractive agent, and its role in combination with&#xD;
      new compounds such as everolimus deserves further investigations. Their combination might&#xD;
      lead to more profound effects on tumor cell biology of triple negative metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the trial, dose reductions for each combination will be permitted in&#xD;
      patients who cannot tolerate the starting dose&#xD;
