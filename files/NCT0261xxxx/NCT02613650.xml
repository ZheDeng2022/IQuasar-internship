&#xD;
               -  A positive β-hCG result will not be exclusionary if it is suspected to originate&#xD;

             from donating sperm during the study through 90 days after the end of systemic&#xD;
             exposure of study drug/treatment. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized&#xD;
             men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical, psychiatric, cognitive or other conditions that may compromise the patient's&#xD;
