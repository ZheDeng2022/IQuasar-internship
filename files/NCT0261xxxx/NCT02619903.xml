      Small pilot studies with approximately 20 people per group support that eradication of the&#xD;
      oral flora causes fewer exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&#xD;
      patients. The biological underpinning put forward is that eradicating the oral microbiome&#xD;
      will eliminate a source of re-infection as the concentration of antibiotics prescribed to&#xD;
      treat COPD exacerbations are not able to inhibit the bacteria in the oral biofilms that&#xD;
      require 250 times higher concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim is to investigate if adding advanced dental cleaning to COPD treatment can&#xD;
      (i) lower the number of exacerbations and (ii) improve the COPD symptoms the coming 12&#xD;
      months. In an effort to explain the underpinning mechanism we will collect oral dental&#xD;
      biofilm samples at baseline and follow up in the treatment and control group to investigate&#xD;
      changes in the composition of the biofilm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects are selected by experienced COPD nurses. Exclusion criteria are having&#xD;
      metastatic cancer or dementia. The COPD clinic informs the dental personal about COPD&#xD;
      parameters, including spirometry data. At the dental clinic the patient answers a&#xD;
      questionnaire, including a COPD assessment test (CAT) which has been validated extensively.&#xD;
      The patients undergo a dental examination and are then randomized to test or control group.&#xD;
      The test group go through supra- and subgingival scaling and scraping of the tongue as well&#xD;
      as chlorhexidine rinse. The control group attends all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects go through the intervention after 6 months and are followed up after 12 and 24&#xD;
      months using questionnaire, dental plaque sampling and spirometry. The COPD nurses reviewing&#xD;
      their medical records assess number of exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A confirmation of the study hypothesis will be important in lowering the number of&#xD;
      exacerbations in COPD patients, causing less suffering, less costs and less usage of&#xD;
      antibiotics. If dental treatment is beneficial for exacerbation frequency it could be argued&#xD;
      that dental treatment should be subsidized in this patient category.&#xD;

      Introduction The dental biofilm offers a protected environment for bacteria during systemic&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment and may consequently be a source of reinfection. The concentration of&#xD;
      antibiotic needed for inhibiting the growth of bacteria within a dental biofilm has been&#xD;
      estimated to be 250 times greater than for planktonically growing bacteria (1). Chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations cause pain and discomfort for the patient,&#xD;
      healthcare resources and an increased usage of antibiotics. Smaller studies indicate that the&#xD;
      act of advanced dental cleaning may lower the risk of reinfected COPD, but this needs to be&#xD;
      validated in a larger randomized study to promote clinical implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD is a growing health problem worldwide. In 2020, COPD is projected to rank fifth in terms&#xD;
      of burden of disease and third in terms of mortality (2). Assessment of COPD is based on the&#xD;
      patient´s level of symptoms, exacerbation history and severity of spirometric abnormality. In&#xD;
      a randomly selected Swedish cohort, the prevalence of COPD was 16.2%, and 34% of the COPD&#xD;
      patients had never smoked (3). Unfortunately, none of the existing medications for COPD has&#xD;
      been shown conclusively to modify the long-term decline in lung-function, but COPD patients&#xD;
      are usually prescribed β2-adrenerg receptor agonists and anticholinergics (2). For acute&#xD;
      exacerbations, the patients have oral steroids and antibiotics, typically doxycycline and&#xD;
      amoxicillin. Importantly, two smaller (n=20 per group) pilot studies (4,5) have reported a&#xD;
      lower frequency of exacerbations in COPD patients that have received advanced dental&#xD;
      cleaning, suggesting that the oral microbiome might constitute a reservoir that infects the&#xD;
      lungs in COPD. There is a need of studies based on larger cohorts in order to claim that&#xD;
      dental treatment should be added to the treatment regime of COPD, to decrease the frequencies&#xD;
      of exacerbations and thereby minimize physical suffering as well as related costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The hypothesis of this project is that adding advanced dental cleaning to&#xD;
      established COPD treatment regime delays and lowers the frequency of exacerbations by&#xD;
      eliminating a source of reinfections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The overall aim of this project is to investigate if the treatment of COPD can be&#xD;
      optimized by adding advanced dental cleaning to the established treatment regime and thereby&#xD;
      eliminate a source of reinfections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim is to investigate if adding advanced dental cleaning to COPD treatment can&#xD;
      (i) lower the number of exacerbations and (ii) improve the COPD symptoms the coming 6 and 12&#xD;
      months. In an effort to explain the underpinning mechanism we will collect oral dental&#xD;
      biofilm samples at baseline and follow up in the treatment and control group to investigate&#xD;
      changes in the composition of the biofilm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD project At the lung clinic The COPD project will be conducted at Region Skane lung&#xD;
      clinic and in collaboration with the COPD clinics in Skne In Örebro the subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited from the lung clinic in collaboration with Dr. Josefin Sundh and the dental&#xD;
      cleaning will be performed at the dental specialist clinic, folktandvarden Örebro. A COPD&#xD;
      patient will be informed about the current study by a nurse. The patient will be asked to&#xD;
      sign a consent and handed the written information including the number to the dental clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the dental clinic The dental clinic receives a phone call from the person who just signed&#xD;
      a consent; alternatively, a nurse at the dental clinic calls the patient. At the dental&#xD;
      clinic the patient is randomized to, either the advanced dental cleaning group, or a control&#xD;
      group by the dentist or dental hygienist at the dental clinic. When the patient comes to the&#xD;
      dental visit, both groups undergo a periodontal examination and microbiological sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire - Upon arriving at the dental clinic, the participant is asked to fill out a&#xD;
      questionnaire that includes medical history and CAT-questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiological sampling is done by collecting the GenoTek tube by sampling the dental&#xD;
      plaque samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal examination is performed on 6 sites per tooth including the third molar.&#xD;
      Periodontal pockets ≥ 4mm are registered as well as bleeding upon probing, plaque index and&#xD;
      attachment loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - The oral biofilm will be disrupted and removed on the sub- as well as&#xD;
      supragingival surfaces of the teeth. Supragingival surfaces will be cleaned using the&#xD;
      prophylactic paste RDA 250 supplemented with curettes and ultrasonic debridement. Subgingival&#xD;
      surfaces will be cleaned using curettes and ultrasonic debridement when indicated based on&#xD;
      the periodontal examination. The tongue will be cleaned using a tongue scraper. Finally, the&#xD;
      patient will be asked to rinse 10 ml of 2 mg/ml chlorhexidine mouth rinse for one minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up - After 6 months, 12 months and 24 months the participants revisits the dental&#xD;
      clinic. They fill out a new CAT form and a questionnaire asking how many exacerbations that&#xD;
      needed medical attention since they joined the study (this is double checked in their medical&#xD;
      records), if they have taken antibiotics for any other reason or changed their medications in&#xD;
      any way. They are also asked about any dental treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological analysis The subsequent microbiological analysis will be executed using deep&#xD;
      sequencing, as well as qPCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule 2016-2017 - Participants are recruited, randomized and the treatment group is&#xD;
      treated. 2017-2020 - Participants are followed up.&#xD;

      Folktandvarden Örebro - a post-graduate student is being recruited for the dental cleaning as&#xD;
      well as managing the logistics of the project. Daniel Jönsson will be the supervisor of the&#xD;
      student.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis In a power analysis based on the standard deviations from the pilot study of&#xD;
      Kucukoskun et al. [3] indicated 80% power to detect a difference of p&lt;0.05 of 1.5&#xD;
      exacerbations per year in a sample of 49 subjects in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance As antibiotics is part of the COPD treatment regime this study may restrict the&#xD;
      usage of antibiotics, minimizing antibiotic resistance. COPD exacerbations disable the person&#xD;
      to go to work which causes financial consequences, but also healthcare expenses. Most&#xD;
      importantly, the study will plausibly improve life quality and extend the life span of&#xD;
      patients suffering from COPD. We already have preliminary data that subjects in the treatment&#xD;
      group have an OR 3.9 for being stable or having less COPD-symptoms in this progressive&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
