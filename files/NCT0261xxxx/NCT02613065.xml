  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine if protein is less likely to create positive&#xD;
      energy balance when added to the diet compared to carbohydrate. To do this, the investigators&#xD;
      will take detailed measurements of participant's baseline metabolic rate to understand their&#xD;
      energy requirements. Then, the investigators will feed participants all their meals for two&#xD;
      weeks, Monday-Friday, and measure their food intake. During one of the week-long feeding&#xD;
      periods, participants will consume a shake made of egg protein that is ~20% of their energy&#xD;
      requirements. During the other week, participants will consume a shake made of carbohydrate&#xD;
      that is ~20% of their energy requirements. Participants will drink the assigned shake at the&#xD;
      beginning of each of their daily three meals, and then they will be offered a 'regular' meal&#xD;
      of unlimited quantity. Participants will not know that the investigators are measuring the&#xD;
      food consumed after drinking the shake. Participants will drink the protein shake for the&#xD;
      first week and carb-based shake for the second week, and vice versa-- depending on the&#xD;
      randomization order. To account for energy expenditure, participants will wear an activity&#xD;
      monitor, an accelerometer. Energy balance, measured as participant energy intake minus energy&#xD;
      expenditure, will be our main outcome for each treatment. However, because participants may&#xD;
      change their behavior if made aware of the true research question, the investigators will&#xD;
      tell participants that the purpose of the study is to see how low fiber and high fiber shakes&#xD;
      affect mood. The hypothesis is that during the week when participants consume the protein&#xD;
      shake, they will remain in energy balance, but during the week of carbohydrate shake&#xD;
      consumption, participants will have positive energy balance.&#xD;
