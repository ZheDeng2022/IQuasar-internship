  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the world and is the only one of the top five&#xD;
      illnesses whose death rate is still increasing. It is mainly caused by smoking. Greece has a&#xD;
      higher prevalence and death rate for COPD than many other countries in Europe. The disease is&#xD;
      incurable so treatment is aimed at alleviating symptoms and slowing progression. Despite&#xD;
      maximal medication and strategies such as pulmonary rehabilitation and home nurse support,&#xD;
      many patients remain vulnerable, socially isolated and report difficulty in accessing their&#xD;
      local health services. Research has shown that patients have worsening symptoms for an&#xD;
      average of three to four days before they are admitted to hospital with an exacerbation of&#xD;
      COPD. This suggests a window of opportunity to intervene. Early warning and contact via&#xD;
      innovative technology may treat symptoms earlier, improve patient confidence / quality of&#xD;
      life and simultaneously reduce health care visits or admissions. However, there is a large&#xD;
      gap between the postulated and empirically demonstrated benefits of electronic Health&#xD;
      Technologies. In addition, there is a lack of robust research on the risks of implementing&#xD;
      these technologies and their cost-effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated, despite being&#xD;
      frequently promoted by policymakers as if this was a given issue. In addition, the&#xD;
      evidence-base for telehealth is not well-reported in peer reviewed journals and hence there&#xD;
      continue to be difficulties experienced in convincing clinicians, hospital managers and&#xD;
      stakeholders that investment in such technologies will enable reductions in other aspects of&#xD;
      healthcare delivery over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project attempts to provide robust justification of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      telerehabilitation by the implementation of a randomized controlled trial blindly assigning&#xD;
      COPD patients to: i) a home care and telerehabilitation group remotely monitored by a&#xD;
      specialised private health care centre (Filoktitis - group A) or ii) a hospital-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation group managed at a regular base through weekly visits by personnel at a state&#xD;
      University rehabilitation centre (group B). iii) A third group that receives usual care&#xD;
      (group C: control group; i.e.: neither home monitoring nor hospital based rehabilitation) is&#xD;
      also included.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is an important health problem in Greece as the average prevalence of COPD in people &gt;&#xD;
      35 years old is 8.4% (i.e.: approximately 350.000 citizens) (Tzanakis et al., 2004).&#xD;
      Hospitalization attributed to severe exacerbations is the major cost driver of COPD. A study&#xD;
      in Northern Greece revealed that mean actual cost per severe exacerbation of COPD is €1711,&#xD;
      whilst only the amount of €621 is reimbursed by social security funds (Geitona et al., 2011).&#xD;
      The observed price discrepancies between the actual and the nominal cost per patient,&#xD;
      undoubtedly increases public debt especially when considering that patients with severe COPD&#xD;
      suffer from acute exacerbations twice or three times per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, there is urgent need to prevent exacerbations and subsequent hospitalizations in&#xD;
      Greece. International evidence supports the concept that telemonitoring has a key role to&#xD;
      play in systemic improvements to healthcare by reducing unplanned hospital admissions,&#xD;
      hospital length of stay and the use of health care services, thereby making best use of&#xD;
      scarce clinical resources and empowering individual patients. Home telemonitoring of chronic&#xD;
      lung diseases appears as a promising patient management approach that could potentially&#xD;
      produce accurate and reliable data, empower patients, influence their attitudes and&#xD;
      behaviour, and improve patients medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the scientific evidence in support of home telemonitoring is still weak and&#xD;
      inconsistent, which highlights the need for more research, particularly in relation to the&#xD;
      patient-level benefits, associated with these technologies. Furthermore, although, economic&#xD;
      viability of telemonitoring has been observed in very few studies, in most cases no in-depth&#xD;
      cost-minimization analyses were performed (Casas et al., 2006; Hernandez et al., 2015).&#xD;
      Accordingly, there is a need of studies to accumulate evidence related to the interaction&#xD;
      between the clinical effects of telemonitoring, its cost effectiveness, the impact on&#xD;
      services utilization, and acceptance by health care providers. The project looks into the&#xD;
      sustainability of patient telemonitoring services implemented by a private health care&#xD;
      enterprise, namely the Filoktitis Rehabilitation Centre and its clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      compared to a long term program of hospital-based rehabilitation (at Athens University 1st&#xD;
      Department of Respiratory Medicine) not requiring home telemonitoring. The proposed strategy&#xD;
      will allow the analysis and evaluation of reimbursement schemes and the design of appropriate&#xD;
      business models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main idea is to initially (8-weeks) teach COPD patients techniques of self-management and&#xD;
      improve their functional capacity by regular exercise training taking place at two different&#xD;
      rehabilitation centres (one state hospital: Athens University Clinic of Respiratory Medicine,&#xD;
      and one private hospital: Filoktitis Rehabilitation Centre) and subsequently either have the&#xD;
      patients visiting the State University Hospital twice weekly for wellness and rehabilitation&#xD;
      sessions and for regular checking of their clinical condition for 12 months or in the case of&#xD;
      Filoktitis refer patients home to live independently whilst remotely monitoring the course of&#xD;
      a number of vital signs that alert the physician when an exacerbation is eminent. (i.e.,&#xD;
      prematurely recognize symptoms of exacerbation). The initial 8-week sessions of&#xD;
      rehabilitation takes place at both the University Hospital Clinic and at Filoktitis&#xD;
      rehabilitation centre, whilst home monitoring will be implemented only to those who complete&#xD;
      the initial 8-week phase at Filoktitis Rehabilitation Centre for a subsequent period of 12&#xD;
      months. Patients who complete the initial 8-week program at the University Clinic will keep&#xD;
      visiting the centre twice weekly for 12 months. The ultimate objective of this project is to&#xD;
      identify, in terms of health status outcomes, patient compliance and cost effectiveness,&#xD;
      whether remote monitoring and management of patients by professionals at the private&#xD;
      rehabilitation centre is superior to that not involving telemonitoring but regular visits to&#xD;
      the University Hospital Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed project in terms of specific patient outcome measures (namely annual&#xD;
      rate of hospital admissions due to an exacerbation and exacerbations treated at home,&#xD;
      emergency room visits, use of health care resources, quality of life, functional capacity and&#xD;
      daily levels of physical activity) to test the efficacy of wireless systems for patient's&#xD;
      home self-monitoring when this service is delivered remotely by a private rehabilitation&#xD;
      centre compared to close monitoring of patients through regular visits to the University&#xD;
      Hospital Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested will be that once the technology and knowledge is transferred to&#xD;
      a private rehabilitation centre, patient follow-up and early prevention of exacerbations will&#xD;
      not differ when patients are controlled remotely via home telemonitoring services compared to&#xD;
      the management of patients at centralized Hospital level, since in the case of the latter&#xD;
      type of service there are difficulties for elderly and frail patients to regularly visit the&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: One hundred fifty (150) clinically stable patients classified by GOLD as stages&#xD;
      II III and IV are recruited from the University Hospital Outpatient Clinic and the Filoktitis&#xD;
      Medical Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted as a randomized controlled trial blindly assigned using a set of&#xD;
      computer-generated random numbers to home care (group A, Telerehabilitation group: controlled&#xD;
      by Filoktitis rehabilitation centre) or group B (Hospital based Rehabilitation supervised by&#xD;
      the University hospital personnel) and a third group that will receive usual care (group C,&#xD;
      usual care: control group). Prior to recruitment COPD patients initially complete a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary intense Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program lasting for 8 weeks either at&#xD;
      Filoktitis rehabilitation centre or at the University clinic rehabilitation centre at Sotiria&#xD;
      Hospital (1st Department of Respiratory Medicine) to improve the functional capacity and&#xD;
      quality of life. Thereafter patients assigned into group A (n = 50) are monitored at home for&#xD;
      12 months or for Group B (n= 50) followed by the University clinic professional twice weekly&#xD;
      where visits to the hospital are scheduled for 12 months to undertake physiotherapy, dietary&#xD;
      and psychological advice and exercise training sessions. The control group (C: = 50 patients)&#xD;
      follows the usual care treatment not involving maintenance hospital rehabilitation sessions&#xD;
      or home telemonitoring of vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The home care/rehabilitative program includes the following components: a) individualized&#xD;
      action plan; b) educational session on self management; c) physical exercise sessions to&#xD;
      remote monitoring; d) access to the call centre; e) professional monthly home visits of&#xD;
      physiotherapists, dietician and physician with remote connection as a response to possible&#xD;
      incidents; f) remote monitoring selectively and temporarily. The home care program will be&#xD;
      performed by staff employed by Filoktitis rehabilitation centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol: On a daily basis, patients being recruited to the home care program&#xD;
      (Telerehabilitation, group A) take one or more of their own vital sign measurements using&#xD;
      wireless devices in their home. They may also manually enter some measurements into a tablet.&#xD;
      Results are automatically transmitted from the tablet (via mobile communication network) to a&#xD;
      secure web-based server platform, the in-home communication device that also prompts patients&#xD;
      to answer clinician-directed health and risk assessment survey questions. A care management&#xD;
      team based at Filoktitis (nurse or physician) reviews each patient's information on a&#xD;
      web-based clinical review platform, and sends an alert to the patient's doctor when a vital&#xD;
      sign measurement or survey response falls outside established limits. In addition to&#xD;
      monitoring the tell-tale symptoms of decline - such as abnormal weight gain, increased blood&#xD;
      pressure, shortness of breath, fatigue, or oedema, fever, cough - the system also triggers&#xD;
      automated health assessments. Patients in group A are also given tasks to exercise regularly&#xD;
      at home as well as they are remotely provided with dietary and psychological advice. Patients&#xD;
      assigned to the hospital based rehabilitation program (group B) visit the hospital twice&#xD;
      weekly for 12 months in order to participate to a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program&#xD;
      including exercise, physiotherapy dietary and psychological advice by the staff of the&#xD;
      rehabilitation centre based at the University clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes assessed at 12 months follow up for all 3 groups: i) state of health evaluated with&#xD;
      standardised questionnaires; ii) number of emergency room visits and unscheduled hospital&#xD;
      admissions due to any cause; iii) annual rate of admitted days; iv) functional capacity); v)&#xD;
      daily symptoms; vi) daily physical activity; vii) health-related quality of life. Frequency&#xD;
      of assessment: outcomes will be assessed at baseline (prior to joining the initial 8 week&#xD;
      rehabilitation program), at 6 months and 12 months following completion of the initial&#xD;
      8-weeks rehabilitation program.&#xD;
