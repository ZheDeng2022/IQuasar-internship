    <textblock>
      Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activity determine&#xD;
      outcome in ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS). DNase single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms (SNPs) were increased in a japanese cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators seek to measure DNase SNPs frequency in a caucasian&#xD;
      STE-ACS cohort compared to healthy controls (each n=400). The investigators will compute&#xD;
      polymorphisms, DNase activity, NET surrogate markers and clinical variables in regression&#xD;
      models.&#xD;

      Background Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is among the leading causes of death(1).&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis and coronary thrombotic occlusion are driven by inflammatory&#xD;
      pathomechanisms(2). The investigators have shown neutrophilic activation and neutrophil&#xD;
      extracellular traps (NETs) at the culprit lesion site of ST-elevation ACS (STE-ACS)&#xD;
      patients(3). NETs are well described components of thrombi, building a condensation nucleus&#xD;
      for platelets, erythrocytes and fibrinogen. NET-containing thrombi can be effectively lysed&#xD;
      by deoxyribonuclease (DNase) in vitro(4). By adding DNase, the investigators showed potent&#xD;
      acceleration of tissue plasminogen activator-mediated lysis of coronary thrombi ex vivo.&#xD;
      Surrogate markers of NETs are strong predictors of acute coronary events(5). In STE-ACS&#xD;
      patients, NETs directly correlated with cardiac magnet resonance-measured infarct size.&#xD;
      Moreover, increased coronary DNase activity correlated with smaller infarct size(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two major endogenous plasmatic DNases have been described, namely DNase 1 and DNase gamma(6).&#xD;
      Several polymorphisms of the gene encoding for DNase 1 affecting its activity are known(7,8).&#xD;
      The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Q222R in the DNase 1 gene, leading to impaired&#xD;
      extracellular DNase activity, was correlated with increased incidence of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction in Japanese patients(9). SNPs associated with reduced DNAse activity are also&#xD;
      known for DNase gamma, but no associations with ACS have been investigated. Present data&#xD;
      implicate a critical balance between formation and degradation of NETs and outcome of ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale The investigators hypothesize that coronary endoluminal NET formation is a major&#xD;
      component of acute macro- and microvessel atherothrombosis. Extracellular DNase degrades&#xD;
      NETs, thus down-regulating overwhelming NET formation. Impaired DNase activity increases the&#xD;
      risk for ACS. Thus, the investigators seek to test the presence of polymorphisms in the DNase&#xD;
      gene impairing DNase activity in a STE-ACS population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare single nucleotide polymorphisms in the DNase 1 and gamma gene in STE-ACS&#xD;
           patients, coronary artery disease patients and healthy controls using polymerase chain&#xD;
           reaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test DNase activity in plasma of these patients and healthy controls and to correlate&#xD;
           that with the respective gene expression type&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test NET formation and NET surrogate markers and to correlate those with DNase&#xD;
           activity and DNase SNPs&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate these data with surrogate markers of infarct size, reperfusion, long term&#xD;
           outcome parameters and risk factors for coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will contact patients (n=400) who have been hospitalized in the General&#xD;
      Hospital of Vienna in the past 10 years for ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome undergoing&#xD;
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) with TIMI 0-1. These patients will be&#xD;
      invited for a consultation. The investigators will perform the following investigations with&#xD;
      patients willing to join the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for research experiments Any patient with relevant clinical findings will be&#xD;
           led to further diagnostic evaluation. MACE occurring between the acute coronary event&#xD;
           until presence will be surveyed at the consultation. All patients will be contacted once&#xD;
           a year to assess MACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy donors Blood samples from healthy donors (n=400) will be obtained by a peripheral&#xD;
      blood draw from the cubital vein. The probands will be recruited by bulletins in the General&#xD;
      Hospital of Vienna.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real time polymerase chain reaction Cells will be lysed and DNAwill be isolated using a&#xD;
      DNAeasy kit (Applied Biosystems). DNA or will be analyzed for DNase SNPs using primer/probe&#xD;
      assays (Applied Biosystems). The ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System and software&#xD;
      (Applied Biosystems) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NET surrogate marker determination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nucleosomes For the detection of DNA-histone complexes (nucleosomes), an ELISA-Cell death&#xD;
      detection kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) will be employed. Optical density (OD) values&#xD;
      will be normalized to the internal positive control and expressed as arbitrary nucleosome&#xD;
      units/ml (NU/ml). The intra-assay positive control equals 1000 NU/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPO-DNA complexes Myeloperoxidase (MPO)-associated DNA fragments will be identified using a&#xD;
      capture ELISA. 96-well microplates will be coated with an anti-MPO monoclonal capturing&#xD;
      antibody (ABD Serotec, UK). As detection antibody, the investigators will use a peroxidase&#xD;
      labeled anti-DNA monoclonal antibody (Cell Death Detection ELISA Plus Kit, Roche Diagnostics&#xD;
      GmbH, Germany). All measurements will be performed in duplicates and values will be specified&#xD;
      as mean ODs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double stranded DNA For the detection of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) in patient plasma, the&#xD;
      investigators will employ a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Invitrogen, USA) on 96-well&#xD;
      microplates. PicoGreen is a fluorescent nucleic acid stain for the quantification of dsDNA in&#xD;
      solution. Fluorescence will be measured by a Varioskan Flash microplate reader (Thermo&#xD;
      Scientific, USA) and normalized to the provided standard (1000 ng/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNase activity assay Endogenous deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activity will be measured employing&#xD;
      a DNase Activity Assay (Orgentec Diagnostika GmbH, Mainz, Germany). A DNA-coated microplate&#xD;
      will be incubated with plasma samples for 60 minutes. Coated DNA will be degraded in&#xD;
      proportion to the DNase activity of the respective sample. Optical density of residual DNA&#xD;
      will be inversely proportional to DNase activity. All assays will be performed following the&#xD;
      manufacturerÂ´s instructions. All measurements will be performed in duplicate. Plates will be&#xD;
      read on a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell culture and netosis assays PMNs (i.e. mainly neutrophils) from&#xD;
      healthy donors will be isolated with Polymorphprep (Axis-Shield, Dundee, Scotland).&#xD;
      Erythrocytes will be lysed using a one-step lysis buffer (NH4Cl 154mmol/L, KHCO3 10mmol/L,&#xD;
      EDTA 0.1mmol/L). The cell suspension will then be washed twice with HBSS supplemented with&#xD;
      10% of fetal calf serum (FBS). Isolated PMNs will be counted and resuspended at 2x10^6&#xD;
      cells/ml in HBSS supplemented with 10% of FBS. Cell viability will be determined by trypan&#xD;
      blue exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunofluorescence staining of NETs Fixed NETs will be stained using a mouse anti-DNA Histone&#xD;
      H1 antibody (Millipore). After incubation, a secondary donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled&#xD;
      to Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY; USA) will be added. For&#xD;
      detection of nuclear DNA, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vectashield mounting medium&#xD;
      with DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) will be used. For staining of neutrophil&#xD;
      elastase (NE) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), rabbit anti-human NE and MPO antibodies (Abcam) are&#xD;
      used with a secondary Alexa Fluor 488 coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Invitrogen).&#xD;
      Images will be obtained with an Axio Imager 2 fluorescence microscope using AxioVision (Carl&#xD;
      Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Normally distributed data will be expressed as mean Â± standard deviation (SD),&#xD;
      otherwise median and interquartile range (IQR) will be presented. Paired Students t-test will&#xD;
      be applied to compare normally distributed variables, otherwise Wilcoxon signed rank test&#xD;
      will be used. Distribution of data will be tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test and histograms (data not shown). For comparison of multiple groups, one-way&#xD;
      analysis of variance with post-hoc ScheffÃ©-procedure will be performed. Spearman's rank&#xD;
      correlation (rs) will be applied to calculate correlations data. Multivariate regression&#xD;
      models will be calculated and bootstrap correction techniques will be applied. The area under&#xD;
      the curve (AUC) of CK-MB values will be expressed in arbitrary units and be calculated&#xD;
      employing the trapezoidal formula (10), if at least 5 consecutive values over a period of 3&#xD;
      days post admission were available. Bonferroni-Holm correction will be used for multiple&#xD;
      testing. A p-value below 0.05 will be considered significant. Statistical analyses were&#xD;
      performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 for Windows (New York, NY, USA). Figures will be&#xD;
      generated using GraphPad Prism 5.&#xD;
