    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effectiveness of a new pelvic floor exercise device in&#xD;
      strengthening pelvic floor muscles and treating urinary incontinence among women who are&#xD;
      experiencing symptoms of pelvic floor weakness. The study will be conducted over 12 weeks and&#xD;
      results will be collected through self-assessment questionnaires and clinical pelvic&#xD;
      examination. Effectiveness outcomes will be tracked over the duration of the trial and&#xD;
      measured against historical symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to test the device with women who are experiencing symptoms of&#xD;
      pelvic floor weakness, namely urinary incontinence, vaginal laxity and sexual sensation&#xD;
      problems, to assess the changes in pelvic floor muscle strength, before and after the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study device is a pelvic floor exercise device that provides biofeedback and exercise&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited from the regular patients at the&#xD;
      investigation site and given the device to use at home daily for 12 weeks. Subjects will&#xD;
      submit information regarding their experience with the device and self-assessed improvements&#xD;
      in their symptoms. A pelvic examination will be conducted at the start and conclusion of the&#xD;
      study to measure a pelvic floor muscle strength reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis is that strength level, subjective assessment of vaginal tightness&#xD;
      and sexual sensations will be greater at the end of the study than at the baseline and the&#xD;
      mean value of frequency and volume of bladder leaks will be less than at the baseline.&#xD;
