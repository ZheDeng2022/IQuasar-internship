      Primary objective is to assess strawberry intake on LDL cholesterol and its association with&#xD;
      atherosclerosis development.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed as a randomized, 2-arm, 2-sequence, within-subject, cross-over, chronic&#xD;
      feeding study. The arms of the study will include regular consumption of a strawberry or&#xD;
      strawberry-placebo powder equivalent to ~3.5 servings of strawberries/day (50g) freeze-dried&#xD;
      strawberry powder (provided twice a day, 25 grams each time &gt;6h apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned sample size of 50 men and women will be enrolled into the study. This study will&#xD;
      require one initial screening visit, 4 study visits, and 6 weekly visits. This study will&#xD;
      take approximately 12 weeks per subject to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening visit will provide subject with the informed consent document and&#xD;
      determine subject eligibility through anthropometric measurements, vital signs, fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose test (finger prick), fasting blood draw, and completion of a survey relate to general&#xD;
      eating, health, and exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If willing and eligible to participate, a 3-day food record (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day)&#xD;
      will be instructed at the Screening Visit and collected before study day 1 to assess&#xD;
      subjects' baseline dietary intake pattern. Subjects will be instructed to follow a strictly&#xD;
      limited polyphenolic diet for 7 days prior to the study and throughout their participation&#xD;
      time, while maintaining their usual diet pattern and physical activity, with counseling by&#xD;
      staff investigator and/or Registered Dietitian. A dinner meal will be provided the day before&#xD;
      the study visit to control the second meal effect from the food and beverage intake of the&#xD;
      night before the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will arrive at the center in a fasted state for at least 10 hours, well hydrated and&#xD;
      rested. Each study visit will require blood draws throughout the visit. After evaluation of&#xD;
      subject's health status (via anthropometric, vital sign and blood glucose measurements and&#xD;
      in-person interview), a Licensed health care professional will take a fasting blood draw with&#xD;
      a butterfly needle. Subjects will be randomized to receive a placebo or treatment beverage&#xD;
      based on randomized treatment sequences at 4 study visits. The sequences of receiving the&#xD;
      beverage treatments at each visit will be randomly assigned to one of two of following&#xD;
      sequences: placebo- treatment beverage or treatment beverage -placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study visit will involve blood sample collection at time points 0h (fasting) for&#xD;
      assessment of change in plasma lipid and lipoprotein markers. Each study visit will involve a&#xD;
      2 flow mediated dilatation procedure to assess endothelial function.&#xD;
