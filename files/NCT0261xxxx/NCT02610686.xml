      Understanding the extent and regional distribution of CQR vivax malaria and detecting early&#xD;
      signs of resistance is critical to prevent the spread of resistant strains, optimize&#xD;
      treatment guidelines, and reduce the risk of recurrent and severe malaria. In Vietnam, CQR in&#xD;
      P.vivax has been reported sporadically. One study carried out in Binh Thuan province&#xD;
      (central-south Vietnam) at the end of the 1990s demonstrated early P.vivax recurrences (7%)&#xD;
      by Day 16 after a 3-day CQ treatment. However, in a summary report to World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) including data from 11 sentinel sites, from studies conducted between 2006&#xD;
      and 2011 in central and southern Vietnam (total 350 patients), P.vivax is still considered&#xD;
      sensitive to CQ. More recently in a cohort study conducted in Quang Nam province (Central&#xD;
      Vietnam) in which P.vivax patients were treated radically with CQ and primaquine (10-day at&#xD;
      0.5mg/kg/day) following national guidelines, the 28-day failure rate was measured at 3.45%&#xD;
      and CQ blood concentrations measured at day of recurrence (&gt;100ng/ml) confirmed resistance in&#xD;
      three patients. The current national guidelines for the radical cure regimen of P.vivax&#xD;
      infections recommends 3 days of CQ (total 25 mg/kg body weight (bw)) together with 14 days of&#xD;
      primaquine at 0.25 mg/kg bw/ day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current WHO protocol recommends a 28-day follow-up to assess the efficacy of CQ for the&#xD;
      treatment of P.vivax infections. However, recurrence of early stage resistant parasites may&#xD;
      occur after Day 28 in the presence of CQ blood levels above the minimum efficacy&#xD;
      concentration (MEC, ≥100ng/ml) and relapses could occur as early as 36 days after standard CQ&#xD;
      treatment. Therefore, in order to confirm CQR it is recommended to extend the follow-up&#xD;
      period, to Day 42 or 63 and measure whole blood CQ level at Day 28 and at the time of&#xD;
      recurrence. Moreover, it has been shown that emerging drug resistance in P.vivax is&#xD;
      associated with delayed parasite clearance after treatment, i.e. some parasites are still&#xD;
      detectable at Day 3. The aim of the present study is to assess the in vivo and ex vivo&#xD;
      susceptibility of P.vivax to CQ in Central Vietnam following the currently recommended&#xD;
      radical cure regimen and using GMP certified CQ.&#xD;

      3.1 Study Design This study is designed as a 42-day drug efficacy study to evaluate clinical&#xD;
      and parasitological responses after treatment of P.vivax malaria infections. Symptomatic&#xD;
      patients with P. vivax mono-infections, meeting the study criteria, will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study, and treated with CQ (total dose 25gm/kg over 3 days). The treatment will be directly&#xD;
      observed and the patients will be actively followed-up for 42 days according to an extended&#xD;
      WHO protocol. At the end of the follow-up time, all patients will be treated with primaquine&#xD;
      following national guidelines for the radical cure of P.vivax infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Study Site and Population The study will be carried out in Krong Pa district, Gia Lai&#xD;
      province where both P.falciparum and P.vivax malaria incidence are among the highest in the&#xD;
      country. The study will be located in Chu'R Cam commune where the study team will be working&#xD;
      with the local health staff and all surrounding communes with malaria patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local population is mainly composed by the JaRai ethnic minority and the main occupation&#xD;
      consist of slash and burn agriculture (mainly maize, manioc and rice) in forest fields,&#xD;
      together with seasonal work in rubber plantations, and small-scale production of goods for&#xD;
      daily subsistence or trade e.g. coffee and cashew nuts. The climate is tropical with the dry&#xD;
      season from November to April and the rainy season from May to October. The area is hilly and&#xD;
      forested (secondary forest) and the main malaria vector is Anopheles dirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Trial Population The target population includes all P.vivax infected patients (children&#xD;
      and adults) either presenting spontaneously at the CHC or identified through active screening&#xD;
      in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Trial Procedures 3.5.1 Screening and recruitment All consulting patients who meet the&#xD;
      basic enrolment criteria during screening will be assigned a consecutive screening number and&#xD;
      evaluated in greater depth by the medical doctor. Once the patient meets all the enrolment&#xD;
      criteria, he or she (or a parent or guardian in case of children) will be asked for consent&#xD;
      to participate in the study. Then, he/she will be allocated a study number (ID=sequential&#xD;
      numbering). Any person who decides not to participate in the study will be examined, treated&#xD;
      and followed-up by the health facility staff according to the standard of care established by&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrolment (Day 0) the patient will be and examined and a standardized pre-coded&#xD;
      questionnaire will be filled in. A venous blood sample will be collected into sterile&#xD;
      vacutainer tubes containing EDTA or acid-citrate-dextrose (EDTA/ACD) from all patients at&#xD;
      enrolment. A minimum of 5ml of blood -and maximum of 8 ml- will be collected from adults, and&#xD;
      1ml/kg up to 5ml will be collected from children. Two blood drops will be added into a 1.5 ml&#xD;
      tube containing 500 µL of RNAprotect reagent (Qiagen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.2 Treatment All patients will receive a full treatment with CQ at a dose of 25 mg of CQ&#xD;
      base per kg body weight (bw) given over 3 days and under direct supervision. Patients will be&#xD;
      observed for 60 minutes after treatment for adverse reactions or vomiting. Those patients&#xD;
      vomiting their medication within the first 30 minutes will receive a repeat full dose; those&#xD;
      vomiting from 30-60 minutes will receive half dose. If the patient vomits again, he or she&#xD;
      will be withdrawn and offered rescue therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral=CQ (3 days, 25mg/kg) together with primaquine (0.25mg/kg/day for 14 days); Intravenous&#xD;
      (IV)= Artesunate (4mg/kg/day) for a minimum of 24h and until the patient is able to take oral&#xD;
      drug. Then continue with oral DHA-PPQ for 3days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radical cure. primaquine treatment will be delayed until the end of the follow up, and given&#xD;
      as recommended by the national guidelines, i.e. 0.25mg/kg/day for 14 days to all patients&#xD;
      with negative G6PD rapid test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.3 Follow up From Day 0 until parasite clearance patients will be monitored every 12 hours&#xD;
      by blood microscopy at least until Day 3 and longer if necessary until parasite clearance&#xD;
      defined as two consecutive negative slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, the patient will be interviewed and examined and a finger prick blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected for the following outcomes: two blood slides for LM observation (thick and&#xD;
      thin film), 200μl of blood in an EDTA/ACD microtainer tube for DNA extraction, and 2 drops of&#xD;
      blood into another microtainer tube containing RNAprotect for RNA extraction. At Day 3, an&#xD;
      additional drop of blood will be taken to measure Hb concentration with Hemocue method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 Patients will be interviewed and examined, the follow-up form will&#xD;
      be completed, and any adverse event documented. A finger prick blood sample will be collected&#xD;
      for the following outcomes: two blood slides for LM observation (thick and thin film), 200μl&#xD;
      of blood in an EDTA/ACD microtainer tube for DNA extraction, and 2 drops of blood in&#xD;
      RNAprotect containing microtainer tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, at Day 7, 100μl of blood will be taken on filter paper to determine blood CQ&#xD;
      concentration. At Days 7, 14, 28, and 42 Hb concentration (Hemocue) will be measured from&#xD;
      finger prick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of P.vivax recurrence: If recurrence is confirmed a further venous blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected prior to rescue treatment administration. 100μl of this venous blood will be&#xD;
      spotted on filter paper to determine blood CQ concentration, the remaining being used for ex&#xD;
      vivo assay and cryopreservation as detailed in Annex VI-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.4 Loss to follow-up protocol violations Loss to follow-up occurs when, despite all&#xD;
      reasonable efforts, an enrolled patient does not attend the scheduled visits and cannot be&#xD;
      found. No treatment outcome will be assigned to these patients. These patients will be&#xD;
      classified as lost to follow-up and censored or excluded from the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients who meet any of the following criteria will be classified as withdrawn: i)&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent; ii) failure to complete treatment; iii) serious adverse events&#xD;
      necessitating termination of treatment before the full course is completed; iv) enrolment&#xD;
      violation; v) voluntary protocol violation; vi) involuntary protocol violation&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.5 Laboratory procedures and evaluation Microscopy Three slides (thin/thick blood smears)&#xD;
      should be obtained at screening, one being stained rapidly (10% Giemsa for 10 min) for&#xD;
      examination in a limited number of fields to ensure the presence of P.vivax asexual forms at&#xD;
      a minimum parasitaemia of 250/ul. Once the patient is enrolled, the other two slides will be&#xD;
      stained more carefully (3% Giemsa for 45 min). Density, will be expressed as the number of&#xD;
      asexual parasites per µl of blood, and calculated dividing the number of asexual parasites by&#xD;
      the number of WBCs counted and corrected by the estimated WBCs density (typically 8000 per&#xD;
      µl). When the asexual parasite count is less than 10 per 200 WBCs, counting will be done&#xD;
      against at least 500 WBCs. A blood slide will be considered negative when examination of 1000&#xD;
      WBCs reveals no asexual parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ring stage parasitaemia: The number of ring stages will be counted in all positive&#xD;
           slides at Day 0 and at Day of recurrence against 200 asexual parasites; only isolates&#xD;
           for which the proportion of ring stages exceeds 65% will be used for the ex vivo drug&#xD;
           assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gametocytes: density will be computed by counting the number of gametocytes per 500&#xD;
           WBCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemoglobin levels Hb levels will be measured on whole blood collected into micro-cuvette&#xD;
      using Hemocue following manufacturer instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of CQ concentration at Day 7 and day of recurrence from 100 µl of blood expelled&#xD;
      onto chromatography paper (31ETCHR, Whatman) Parasite molecular detection and genotyping DNA&#xD;
      will be extracted at ITM/NIMPE from finger-prick blood samples collected in microtainers.&#xD;
      Molecular confirmation of Plasmodium species at Day 0 will be performed by qPCR targeting 18S&#xD;
      ribosomal gene. The same qPCR method will be used to identify and quantify P. vivax&#xD;
      infections at Day 0 and follow up samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P. vivax genotypes will be identified through PCR amplification of 3 markers particularly&#xD;
      effective for finger-printing in clinical trials (MS16, Pv3.2 and msp1F3) followed by&#xD;
      capillary gel electrophoresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA extraction and RT-qPCR for gametocytes RNA will be extracted from RNAprotect samples at&#xD;
      ITM/NIMPE using affinity columns and DNAse digestion of genomic DNA. To detect and quantify&#xD;
      P. vivax gametocyte stages a reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) targeting Pvs25 gene&#xD;
      transcripts will be done on D0 and in all follow-up samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug resistance laboratory analysis (Day 0 and of recurrence) Briefly, blood will be&#xD;
      centrifuged and plasma will be stored at -20ºC. The upper part of buffy coat will be removed&#xD;
      carefully and stored at -20ºC. Red blood cells (RBCs) will be resuspended in PBS (1:1) and&#xD;
      leukocytes will be depleted using cellulose columns (Sigma). Filtered cells will be washed&#xD;
      and pellet measured before resuspending at 50% hematocrite in McCoy medium (blood medium&#xD;
      mixture, BMM, 4ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ex vivo drug sensitivity assays: Briefly, plates with predosed 7-point 2-fold dilutions of&#xD;
      CQ, PPQ, DHA and quinine will be prepared following WWARN procedures&#xD;
      [http://www.wwarn.org/sites/default/files/INV08_PFalciparumDrugSensitivity.pdf]. Minimal&#xD;
      inhibitory concentrations and IC50 will be calculated using the In Vitro Analysis and&#xD;
      Reporting Tool (IVART) developed online by the WWARN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G6PD deficiency test: all patients will be tested for G6PD deficiency using the point-of-care&#xD;
      test by CareStart (Access Bio, New Jersey, USA) before PQ treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Quality Assurance Site monitoring visits will be scheduled on a regular basis. During&#xD;
      these visits, information recorded on the case report forms will be verified against source&#xD;
      documents. After the case report forms are collated at the end of the trial, they will be&#xD;
      reviewed for completeness and accuracy. The data will be double entered into an electronic&#xD;
      database, where specially designed computer checks are used to identify selected protocol&#xD;
      violations and data errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood films on admission will be read at the study site as well as by a senior&#xD;
      microscopist at a coordinating centre. In addition, an external quality control will be done&#xD;
      at ITM on 10% of randomly selected slides. For each of the molecular assays (qPCR, RT-qPCR&#xD;
      and parasite genotyping) 10% of the samples processed at NIMPE will be randomly chosen to be&#xD;
      re-analysed at ITM. External quality control of ex vivo drug assay results will be done at&#xD;
      ITM where the slides will be re-examined for 10% of randomly chosen isolates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Statistical Analytical Plan The analysis of the Day 42 cure rate will be performed both&#xD;
      for the intention-to-treat (ITT) patient population and the evaluable patient population (Per&#xD;
      Protocol). Data analyses will be performed using STATA 12 software. For categorical variables&#xD;
      percentages and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be calculated following the&#xD;
      Wilson's method. Proportions will be compared by calculating the *2 with Yates' correction or&#xD;
      by Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Normally distributed continuous data will be&#xD;
      compared by Student's t test and analysis of variance. Data not conforming to a normal&#xD;
      distribution will be compared by the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis analysis of&#xD;
      variance. The correlation between 2 continuous variables will be assessed using either the&#xD;
      Pearson or Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall risk of treatment failure by Day 28 and by Day 42 will be calculated by Kaplan&#xD;
      Meier method, and comparisons between risk groups will be done using the log rank test. The&#xD;
      PCR adjusted risk at Day 28 and 42 will also be calculated following the genotyping results&#xD;
      of each recurrent P.vivax infection. Parasite clearance time and rate will be estimated using&#xD;
      the PCE online tool developed by WWARN&#xD;
      (http://www.wwarn.org/toolkit/data-management/parasite-clearance-estimator). The Mean IC50&#xD;
      and IC90 for CQ will be estimated using the In vitro Analysis and reporting tool (IVART)&#xD;
      developed by WWARN (http://www.wwarn.org/toolkit/data-management/ivart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematological changes will be evaluated by measuring the changes in Hb concentration between&#xD;
      day0, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 42, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Ethical Issues 6.1 Ethical clearance to conduct the study will have been obtained from the&#xD;
      Ethics Committee of the NIMPE, Hanoi and from the Ethics Committee of the University of&#xD;
      Antwerp, as well as from the Institutional Review Board at the ITM, Anwerp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Consent Process Patients will be included in the study only if they (or parents or&#xD;
      guardians of children) give informed consent. The consent request is available in English and&#xD;
      translated into Vietnamese to be read entirely to the patient, parent or guardian. Details&#xD;
      about the trial and its benefits and potential risks will be explained. Once any questions&#xD;
      have been answered, a signature will be requested on the document. If the patient is&#xD;
      illiterate, a literate witness must sign; if possible, the signatory will be selected by the&#xD;
      participant and will have no connection to the research team.&#xD;
