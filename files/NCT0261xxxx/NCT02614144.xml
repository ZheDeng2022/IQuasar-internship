      This project aimed at analyzing and assessing of the early and late Hospital-Acquired&#xD;
      Pneumonia(HAP) bacterial pathogens and their resistance to antimicrobial agents. The&#xD;
      incidence of their resistance to antimicrobial agent is assessed. Included are patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in the Intensive Care Departments of cooperated University hospitals, who&#xD;
      developed early or late HAP. Bacterial pathogens and their resistance to antibiotics are&#xD;
      identified using standard microbiological methods. The patient's mortality with respect to&#xD;
      their initial antibiotic therapy is statistically analyzed.&#xD;

      Introduction. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is one of the most frequent and most severe medical&#xD;
      complications in patients hospitalized in intensive care units. It develops mainly in&#xD;
      association with invasive airway management and mechanical ventilation. It is an important&#xD;
      factor affecting health care economy and often related to bacterial resistance. Understanding&#xD;
      the etiology of pathogens and their potential resistance to antimicrobial agents has a major&#xD;
      impact on both patients' morbidity and mortality and the economic aspect of their treatment.&#xD;
      Pneumonia is diagnosed by assessing clinical signs and detecting etiologic agents. Clinical&#xD;
      signs are assessed especially by finding fresh or progressive infiltrates on chest&#xD;
      radiographs, together with at least two other signs of respiratory tract infection. From the&#xD;
      epidemiological point of view, pneumonia may be either community-acquired (CAP) or&#xD;
      hospital-acquired (HAP). CAP is defined by developing in the community outside health care&#xD;
      facilities and, if the patient is hospitalized, clinical manifestations within 48 h of&#xD;
      hospital admission. HAP may be characterized as pneumonia developing 48 h or more after&#xD;
      admission to a health care facility or within 14 days after discharge. More precise&#xD;
      classification according to the time of the onset of clinical signs distinguishes early-onset&#xD;
      (from 2 to 4 days after admission) from late-onset (from day 5 after admission) HAP. The most&#xD;
      common pathogens causing CAP are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and&#xD;
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae. HAP is mostly caused by endogenous bacterial strains, originating from&#xD;
      primary microflora or secondary colonizing bacteria with a higher level of resistance in the&#xD;
      early- and late-onset forms, respectively. This knowledge is used to select the proper&#xD;
      therapy since the proportion of individual pathogens determines the strategy of initial&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment. Adequate antibiotic therapy is an important factor influencing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of therapy and, of course, the patient's survival. The prospective study aimed&#xD;
      at identifying etiologic agents of pulmonary inflammation in patients with the most severe&#xD;
      forms of respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation. The objectives were to&#xD;
      describe the prevalence of respiratory tract pathogens, to determine their susceptibility to&#xD;
      a range of tested antibiotic agents, and to acquire information on the proportion of&#xD;
      resistant strains in the population of these pathogens. The impact of adequate antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy was assessed, with respect to patient mortality and morbidity rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. Most sever types of nosocomial bacterial pneumonias, required artificial lung&#xD;
      ventilation are often exogenous. The infection source is transferred to patient´s airways&#xD;
      from outsider during hospitalisation. The object of the research is bacterial agent direct&#xD;
      recognition, its originality identification based on genome restrict fragment analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods. The group comprised patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care&#xD;
      Departments of cooperating hospitals between 1 May 2013 and 30 April 2015 who developed signs&#xD;
      of HAP. Also included are patients with positive findings in their tracheal secretion on&#xD;
      admission to the department if transferred from another ward of the hospital. In intubated&#xD;
      patients, secretion samples for microbiology culture tests are obtained by aspiration from&#xD;
      the lower airway. Mortality is statistically analyzed by Fisher's exact test. The clinical&#xD;
      signs of pneumonia are defined as the presence of newly developed or progressive infiltrates&#xD;
      on chest radiographs plus at least two other signs of respiratory tract infection:&#xD;
      temperature &gt;38 °C, purulent sputum, leukocytosis &gt;10x103/mm3 or leukopenia &lt;4x103/mm3, signs&#xD;
      of inflammation on auscultation, cough and/or respiratory insufficiency with oxygenation&#xD;
      index≤300 mm Hg. Each sample is processed by semiquantitative method based on the&#xD;
      four-quadrant streak technique using a calibrated loop. The etiologic agent is considered&#xD;
      relevant if cultured in the tracheal secretion at a enough quantity. Tracheal secretion&#xD;
      samples are processed by traditional microbiological methods. The microorganisms are&#xD;
      identified by biochemical dentification tests, and automated systems. The yeasts are&#xD;
      identified using commercial kit. If an identical culture, determined as the etiologic agent,&#xD;
      is repeatedly isolated from multiple samples obtained from the same patient, only the first&#xD;
      isolated culture is included in the study. Susceptibility to antibiotics is determined by the&#xD;
      standard microdilution method. Adequate initial therapy is defined as administrative of at&#xD;
      least one antibiotic (suitable for treating pneumonia) shown in vitro to be effective against&#xD;
      the isolated causative agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progress chart. The collection and processing of the patient´s microbiological samples at&#xD;
      cooperatived clinic departments between 1 May 2013 and 30 April 2015 will be performed. The&#xD;
      co-operative centers sent the samples to microbiological departments of their own hospitals&#xD;
      and there the samples will processed and safed. Collected data will continuously to the&#xD;
      central database be stored. The microbiological samples collection will finish 30 April 2015&#xD;
      and between 1 May 2015 and 31 december 2015 the data will be analysed and assessed. The&#xD;
      processing of the data allows express conclusions and prepare proposals to event. hygienical&#xD;
      arrangement changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Way of data acquiring. In intubated patients, secretion samples for microbiology culture&#xD;
      tests were obtained by aspiration from the lower airway. The group comprise patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in the Intensive Care Department of Hospitals, cooperated in study, between 1&#xD;
      May 2013 and 30April 2015 who developed signs of HAP. Also included are patients with&#xD;
      positive findings in their tracheal secretion on admission to the department if transferred&#xD;
      from another ward of the hospital. Predicted number of patients is 300 (400 - 500 positive&#xD;
      isolates). Considerate number is estimated according the pilot study. Predicted number of&#xD;
      patients in all cooperated centers is about 15 per month. There the data analysis will be&#xD;
      made with statistic normality test Shapiro-Wilk and Mann-Whitney U test. Computer program&#xD;
      SPSS version 15 to statistic assessment will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cooperation. The project is multicentric. There are cooperating Departments of Anesthesiology&#xD;
      and Intensive Care Medicine in Olomouc, Brno, Hradec Kralove and Thomayer's Hospital Praha.&#xD;
      The assessing of microbiological samples, collected from patients in this hospitals will be&#xD;
      in microbiologic departments of this hospitals made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion. Given the incidence of 51 cases out of a total of 508 patients hospitalized in&#xD;
      the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine Olomouc, Czech Republic, in&#xD;
      2011, the prevalence (10%) was at the lower limit of the commonly reported range (9-24%). In&#xD;
      agreement with the literature, most cases (86%) were late-onset HAP. Bacterial pathogens&#xD;
      associated with the majority of deaths were strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa, Burgholderia cepacia komplex and Escherichia coli, more than 50% of which were&#xD;
      multiresistant. In late-onset HAP, multiresistant strains accounted for as many as 58% of&#xD;
      strains. In early onset HAP, the proportion of multiresistant strains could not been reliably&#xD;
      assessed due to the small number of cases. The mortality rates in patients receiving adequate&#xD;
      initial antibiotic therapy were 13% lower than in those treated with antibiotics to which&#xD;
      isolated bacterial pathogens were later found to be resistant. According to Fiser's two-sided&#xD;
      exact test, the resulting difference in mortality rates between the two studied groups is not&#xD;
      significant (P=0.385), because of small set of data. Given the fact that despite adequate&#xD;
      initial antibiotic therapy, the mortality rates were relatively high (9 out of 30 dead&#xD;
      patients) and mortality is also likely to be influenced by the time of initiation of&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy. In case of the mortality rates in patients with adequate therapy, our&#xD;
      results (30%) are in agreement with those by Luna et al. who reported 38%. The same authors&#xD;
      also found 91% mortality associated with inadequate therapy, a much higher rate than our&#xD;
      results (43%). The difference, however, might be explained by a different epidemiological&#xD;
      situation at bacterial resistance levels. HAP may be characterized as endogenous. Despite the&#xD;
      high proportion of multiresistant strains, clonal spread was not confirmed, with the&#xD;
      exception of Burgholderia cepacia komplex. Thus, secondary colonization of patient's&#xD;
      microflora during hospitalization is likely.&#xD;
