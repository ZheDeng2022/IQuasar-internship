      The overall hypotheses of this project is that severe sepsis is associated with endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction in pediatric patients and that selenium deficiency is associated with changes in&#xD;
      biological markers of endothelial dysfunction and that these changes, in turn, are associated&#xD;
      with worse clinical prognosis.&#xD;

      Background: Oxidative stress occurs during shock as a result of granulocytes and endothelial&#xD;
      cell activation. Higher intensity of endothelial activation is associated with unfavorable&#xD;
      outcomes. Selenium is an essential trace element that plays a key role in the antioxidant&#xD;
      defenses and whose plasma concentrations have been low in critically ill patients. There are&#xD;
      no clinical studies, especially in pediatric patients that consider the roles of selenium and&#xD;
      nutritional status in the modulation of endothelial adaptive response during the inflammatory&#xD;
      response secondary to shock. The investigators hypothesize that selenium deficiency is&#xD;
      associated with changes in biological markers of endothelial dysfunction and that these&#xD;
      changes, in turn, are associated with worse clinical prognosis. Objectives: 1) to investigate&#xD;
      the association between selenium (Se) status and the endothelial activation in children&#xD;
      during acute systemic inflammatory response and 2) to investigate whether the intensity of&#xD;
      endothelial activation can predict the clinical outcome in children with systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: prospective, observational study in children admitted to an intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) with systemic inflammatory response. The primary outcome will be 'intensity endothelial&#xD;
      activation' which will be defined based on biological markers (SE-selectin, soluble&#xD;
      intercellular molecule 1 of Vascular Cell adhesion Molecule and soluble adhesion-1). The&#xD;
      association between the state of Se (anthropometric measurements, blood levels of selenium&#xD;
      and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase, selenoprotein P activity) and this outcome will be&#xD;
      investigated in a multiple logistic model considering age, gender, primary diagnosis,&#xD;
      prognostic scores and clinical characteristics. The secondary outcome will be 'clinical&#xD;
      prognosis' which will be defined based on 'organ dysfunction' (creatinine level, platelets&#xD;
      level and arterial hypotension), infectious complications during the staying in ICU and death&#xD;
      up to 28 days. In this step the explanatory variables will be the same used in the first&#xD;
      analyse plus to 'intensity of endothelial activation'. Participants will be followed for the&#xD;
      duration of ICU/Hospital stay, an expected average of 28 days. Particularly, biological&#xD;
      markers of endothelial activation will be evaluated in three different times: at baseline and&#xD;
      on days 3 and 5 ICU. Expected results: if the study hypotheses are correct, they may justify&#xD;
      the analysis of biomarkers of endothelial activation in medical practice and in future&#xD;
      studies assessing the benefits of selenium supplementation in critical illness.&#xD;
