    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
Progression is determined per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform criteria.&#xD;
Participants who die without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death.&#xD;
Participants who did not progress or die were censored on the date of their last evaluable assessment. Participants who did not have any on study efficacy assessments and did not die were censored on the first dosing date.&#xD;
Participants who switched to subsequent therapy prior to documented progression were censored on the date of the last evaluable assessment prior to the initiation of the new therapy.</description>

&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All subjects must have documented disease progression per IMWG criteria during or&#xD;
             after their last anti-myeloma therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ECOG Performance Status less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject Re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment of a subject that has&#xD;
             discontinued the study as a pre-treatment failure (ie, has not been treated). If&#xD;
             re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. EPd Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  must have received at least 1 but no greater than 2 prior lines of therapy (note:&#xD;
                  induction and stem cell transplants with or without maintenance therapy is&#xD;
                  considered 1 line of therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must have received prior treatment with a lenalidomide-containing&#xD;
                  regimen for at least 2 consecutive cycles (full therapeutic dose) and must have&#xD;
                  been deemed as relapsed, refractory, or intolerant. Refractory is defined as&#xD;
                  progressing on-treatment or within 60 days of the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. EN Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a&#xD;
                  proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory (IMID) agent OR were&#xD;
                  double-refractory to both an IMID and a PI. Refractory is defined as progressing&#xD;
                  on-treatment or within 60 days of the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with solitary bone or extramedullary plasmacytoma as the only evidence of&#xD;
             plasma cells dyscrasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering&#xD;
             multiple myeloma (SMM), primary amyloidosis, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, or POEMS&#xD;
             syndrome (plasma cell dyscrasia with poly neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy,&#xD;
             monoclonal protein, and skin changes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with Central Nervous System involvement with multiple myeloma&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could apply.&#xD;

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
Progression is determined per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform criteria.&#xD;
Participants who die without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death.&#xD;
Participants who did not progress or die were censored on the date of their last evaluable assessment. Participants who did not have any on study efficacy assessments and did not die were censored on the first dosing date.&#xD;
Participants who switched to subsequent therapy prior to documented progression were censored on the date of the last evaluable assessment prior to the initiation of the new therapy.</description>
