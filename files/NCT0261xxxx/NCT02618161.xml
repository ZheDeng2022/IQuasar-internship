    <textblock>
      The role of radiotherapy in management of prostate cancer significantly changed over the last&#xD;
      few decades with the developments in Brachytherapy, External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT),&#xD;
      Intensity modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Image guided Radiotherapy (IGRT). One of the&#xD;
      challenging factors of Radiotherapy treatment of localised prostate cancer is acute and late&#xD;
      Genitourinary and Gastrointestinal toxicities. There are several studies and case series&#xD;
      published in literature assessing the toxicities developed during EBRT and Brachytherapy&#xD;
      treatment for prostate cancer EBRT and Brachytherapy emerged as the main stay of localised&#xD;
      prostate cancer treatment in recent years. The low risk localised prostate cancers can be&#xD;
      treated with low dose brachytherapy or by prostatectomy, whereas the intermediate and high&#xD;
      risk localised prostate cancers are usually treated with EBRT alone or along with HDR&#xD;
      brachytherapy. The recent European guidelines suggest that there is no consensus regarding&#xD;
      the timing of HDR brachytherapy and EBRT. The schedules vary in different institutions where&#xD;
      HDR boost can be given either before or after EBRT. Few centres deliver HDR in-between the&#xD;
      fractions of EBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EBRT doses range from 37.5Gy in 15 fractions to 45Gy in 25 fractions when given with HDR.&#xD;
      The total HDR brachytherapy dose can be delivered in fractions, however a single dose of 15Gy&#xD;
      is gaining acceptance across the world due to its logistical advantage. The Time gap between&#xD;
      the two Radiotherapy modes of delivery is generally within 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus about the timing of HDR brachytherapy (BT) when treated along with&#xD;
      EBRT. The advantages of using HDR Brachytherapy before EBRT are that the investigators could&#xD;
      potentially identify patients who are not suitable for brachytherapy early in the treatment&#xD;
      process. It is essential to know whether there is any significant difference in toxicities&#xD;
      and treatment outcome especially acute urinary toxicity amongst the two treatment approaches.&#xD;
      It will be done by a simple 1:1 ratio randomisation which will only be possible if a&#xD;
      participant meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachytherapy procedure Procedure will be carried out at the surgical theatres in Southend&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will undergo prostate implantation under general or spinal anesthetic using a&#xD;
           Transrectal ultrasound guided transperineal technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Imaging according to local practice using ultrasound, CT and or MR will be undertaken&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The CTVp is defined by the prostate capsule and extended to include any extra capsular&#xD;
           or seminal vesicle disease. A volumetric expansion of 3mm constrained to the rectum&#xD;
           posteriorly is then added. This defines the PTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Catheter reconstruction and dwell time definition is then undertaken to provide a&#xD;
           treatment plan for approval by the treating clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Treatment is delivered once an optimized plan has been approved&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After completion of treatment in the brachytherapy room the implant catheters and&#xD;
           urinary catheter are removed; no anesthesia is required for this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The patient will return to the ward and may be discharged home later the same day or the&#xD;
           following day Dose prescription A dose of 15Gy in a single treatment exposure defined at&#xD;
           the 100% isodose which is the minimum tumour isodose to cover the PTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTV recommendations D90: ≥15Gy V100: ≥95%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organs at risk tolerance doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rectum D2cc 12Gy Rectum V100 &lt;15Gy Urethra D10 &lt;17.5Gy Urethra D30 &lt;16.5Gy Urethra V150 0cc&#xD;
&#xD;
      External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) EBRT would be given to prostate and seminal vesicles&#xD;
      only, using either Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) or Volumetric Arc radiotherapy&#xD;
      (VMAT) to a dose of 4600cGy in 23 fractions over four and half weeks. The Dose Volume&#xD;
      Histogram (DVH) would be according to the local radiotherapy protocol. The gap between BT and&#xD;
      EBRT irrespective of their sequence should not exceed more than 3 weeks. Therefore the total&#xD;
      Radiotherapy treatment time should be up to seven and half weeks Patients will receive&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant and adjuvant anti androgen therapy between 6 months to 3 years according to the&#xD;
      risk stratification of the disease as per standard of care All statistical significance&#xD;
      testing will be at the 5% significance level. For the IPSS and IIEFS scale scores, the two&#xD;
      means at each of the follow-up assessments will be compared using a two-sided permutation&#xD;
      t-test using 1000000 random permutations, and the 95% confidence limits for the difference&#xD;
      between the means will be calculated using a bootstrap using 9999 re-samplings. There will&#xD;
      also be an assessment of trends in the scores through time using a repeated measures analysis&#xD;
      of variance on the four follow-up scores with the baseline score as a covariate. For&#xD;
      categorical data based on adverse events percentages will be compared using Fisher's Exact&#xD;
      Test. In this small study it will be possible to carry out the full combinatorial&#xD;
      calculations for Fisher's Exact Test (whereas in a main study 10000 random permutations will&#xD;
      be obtained in a Monte Carlo approach.) For differences between percentages the 95%&#xD;
      confidence limits will be obtained using Newcombe's Hybrid Score Interval method. For the&#xD;
      secondary analysis Prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      method, with a test for difference between the survival curves using the log-rank test with&#xD;
      the P-value obtained using permutation test with 10000 permutations. Cox proportional hazards&#xD;
      multiple regression will also be used to assess the effects of covariates on survival, with&#xD;
      model comparisons carried out using likelihood ratio tests. The analyses will be performed&#xD;
      using the computer program R. All randomised participants will be included in the analyses.&#xD;
