  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with problems of gait such as veering, difficulty&#xD;
      turning, an inability to perceive doorways or obstacles, and negotiate uneven terrain. Gait&#xD;
      problems, especially veering, may be exacerbated by visuospatial dysfunction which predispose&#xD;
      to falls, freezing and festination of gait. Visuospatial dysfunction is common in PD and&#xD;
      likely involves peripheral features (e.g. contrast sensitivity) as well as central cognitive&#xD;
      mechanisms (e.g. attention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central neuro-degeneration in PD, PD dementia, and dementia with Lewy Bodies may influence&#xD;
      visual function, as impaired visual sampling has been reported in these conditions. Visual&#xD;
      sampling is measured via saccadic (fast eye movement) activity, as saccades are the&#xD;
      mechanisms through which people orientate and explore the environment. The use of objective&#xD;
      devices to reliably measure saccades is important to detect disease related eye movement&#xD;
      changes. Emerging visuomotor research has measured visual sampling in PD using devices such&#xD;
      as electrooculography and infra-red eye tracking, revealing reduced amplitude, speed and&#xD;
      frequency of saccades during various tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite recent increases in visuomotor research it remains unclear how PD influences visual&#xD;
      sampling of the environment during gait and the influence of attentional and cognitive&#xD;
      deficits. Recent work demonstrated that people with PD sample their environment less&#xD;
      frequently than controls, despite a slower gait. Saccadic timing was unchanged in response to&#xD;
      environmental cues. Despite this, environmental visual cues (transverse lines on the floor)&#xD;
      have been shown to increase the number of fixations made during gait. However the mechanisms&#xD;
      of this response remain unclear. Cognition is likely of importance, with response potentially&#xD;
      influenced by attentional control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study aims to examine the influence of cognition on visuomotor control&#xD;
      during gait in PD. This aim will be achieved by observation of visual sampling under several&#xD;
      environmental challenges (straight walk, doorways, turns, visual cue) and a dual task.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of visual sampling during gait under different environmental&#xD;
      challenge (straight, doorway, turn and visual cue (transverse lines on the floor)) and dual&#xD;
      task. These conditions represent everyday activities/environments which can be difficult for&#xD;
      people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is not an interventional study as participants are not assigned to any specific&#xD;
      interventions by the researchers, or followed up to re-assess outcomes other than for&#xD;
      reliability testing of the eye-tracking devices used. The study has been ethically approved&#xD;
      (NRES Committee North East - Newcastle &amp; North Tyneside 1: 13/NE/0128) as an observational&#xD;
      study as participants are assigned to pre-defined groups, and have behavioural measures&#xD;
      (primarily visual sampling and secondly gait) observed in the gait laboratory under various&#xD;
      walking conditions common to everyday environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The over-arching hypothesis of this observational study is that visual sampling during gait&#xD;
      in PD will be influenced by cognitive impairments. This study hypothesises that saccadic&#xD;
      activity will be restricted in PD compared to controls during gait. Dual task and&#xD;
      environmental challenge via a doorway, turn or visual cue will influence saccadic activity&#xD;
      during gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific study hypothesises are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cognition will selectively impact on visuomotor control during gait&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Visual sampling strategies during gait will be related to selected domains of cognitive&#xD;
           impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary questions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Is the Dikablis mobile eye-tracker a reliable means of measuring saccadic activity in PD&#xD;
      and healthy controls?&#xD;
&#xD;
      After undergoing screening to confirm eligibility, subjects will be assigned into one of two&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Older adult controls (HC; up to n = 40)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. People with PD (n = 60)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be recruited from Movement Disorder Clinics in Newcastle upon-Tyne.&#xD;
           Research personnel will be available at clinics as required to invite participants to&#xD;
           consider the study. If sufficiently interested, participants will be given a Participant&#xD;
           Information Sheet (PIS) and letter concerning the study. The invitation will be followed&#xD;
           up by a telephone call during the week to assess willingness to participate. If willing,&#xD;
           a mutually convenient time for assessment will be organised, and the invitation to&#xD;
           attend will be extended to a carer or spouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The healthy control group will be recruited via advertisement using posters, which will&#xD;
           be placed within neurology and geriatric departments. The advertisement will also be&#xD;
           sent via the university email system to staff and students at Newcastle University, the&#xD;
           recipients will be advised to pass on the poster to potential interested parties (i.e.&#xD;
           family or friends). All participants will be evaluated at the Clinical Ageing Research&#xD;
           Unit, Newcastle University, a purpose-build research facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Testing Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
           Session 1; (up to 150min)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Initial screening and baseline assessments (45-60min)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visual sampling during gait (60-90min)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Session 2; (up to 60min)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • 1st Reliability testing (45-60min) (if applicable; for a subgroup of PD and HC&#xD;
           participants)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Session 3; (up to 60min)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • 2nd Reliability testing (45-60min) (if applicable; for a subgroup of PD and HC&#xD;
           participants)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visual sampling during gait (session 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants (n=100) will be assessed in the gait laboratory at the clinical ageing and&#xD;
           research unit (CARU), where they will walk under different conditions, for example&#xD;
           single task, dual task, through a doorway, whilst turning and with a visual cue&#xD;
           (transverse lines on the floor 50cm apart) in place. Visual sampling will be assessed&#xD;
           with a Dikablis head-mounted eye tracking and electrooculography (EOG) systems. Gait&#xD;
           will be simultaneously assessed using a 3D motion capture system (Vicon), which will be&#xD;
           synchronised with the eye tracking systems to provide simultaneous data collection.&#xD;
           Infra-red markers will be taped to the body and limbs of the subjects using a small&#xD;
           amount of double-sided tape, to allow for motion tracking. The Dikablis will also be&#xD;
           taped to the forehead of each participant using a small amount of double sided tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reliability testing (subgroup) (session 2 and 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to examine the test re-test reliability of mobile eye-tracking in people with&#xD;
           PD and healthy controls, a subgroup of participants (PD and HC; up to n=25) will return&#xD;
           for a second (within approx. 1 week) and third visit. They will be asked to repeat some&#xD;
           of the walking tasks outlined above and to sit (with chin rest), stand and walk (on a&#xD;
           treadmill) while performing several eye movements to visual targets (horizontal and&#xD;
           vertical visual angles such as; 5, 10, 15, 20 degrees) in time with an auditory cue (a&#xD;
           60bpm metronome). Participants will return for the third visit approx. 1 week after the&#xD;
           second visit and repeat the reliability testing (as above).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is an exploratory study and therefore few specific previous examples are available&#xD;
           to guide the sample size required. The sample size estimate is based on results from&#xD;
           previous work in this research area (PD; n=21) (Galna et al., 2012), other previous&#xD;
           similar studies and preliminary pilot work with the Dikabilis mobile eye-tracker, which&#xD;
           is a new instrument. Similar studies in this research area have used similar sample&#xD;
           sizes (n=2-26), demonstrating that differences between PD and HC groups will been&#xD;
           evident.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis Common to all Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis will be undertaken using SPSS version 19 or more recent versions&#xD;
           (SPPS, Inc. an IBM company). Data checks of all data collected will be carried out&#xD;
           independently by two members of the Human Movement Science Team at the Clinical Ageing&#xD;
           Research Unit to ensure that data is accurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All statistical tests will be carried out at the 5% two-sided level of significance.&#xD;
           Demographic characteristics and baseline data will be summarized using descriptive&#xD;
           statistics, including means, standard deviations, median, minimum, maximum and&#xD;
           inter-quartile ranges for continuous or ordinal data and percentages for categorical&#xD;
           data. The descriptive statistics will be tabulated and presented graphically for&#xD;
           clarity.The assessments recorded at pre-testing will be taken as baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
           One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests will be used to check for normally distributed data.&#xD;
           Non-normally distributed continuous distributions will be transformed where appropriate&#xD;
           to meet the requirements of parametric tests; otherwise equivalent non-parametric tests&#xD;
           will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Further Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           To analyse visual sampling during gait Pearson's correlations will be used to test the&#xD;
           strength and direction of the relationships between clinical, gait and saccadic&#xD;
           outcomes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to analyse the effect of group (PD,&#xD;
           HC), dual task (single task, dual task) and environmental challenge (Straight walk,&#xD;
           Door, Turn, Visual cue) on visual sampling during gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To analyse reliability repeated-measure t-tests, Bland and Altman plots, intra-class&#xD;
           correlation coefficients (Model 2, 1) and Pearson correlations (or non-parametric&#xD;
           equivalents) will be used to assess bias, agreement and consistency of saccadic outcomes&#xD;
           measured with the Dikablis eye-tracker on two separate occasions a week apart.&#xD;
