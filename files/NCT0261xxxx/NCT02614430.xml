  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will investigate levels of physical, psychosocial functions and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers in a group of patients who by self-assessment indicates a perceived risk of&#xD;
      decline in work ability after hospital admittance. The patients will be randomised to an&#xD;
      intervention of physical training and followed for development in functional levels compared&#xD;
      with patients not receiving the intervention. The goal is to validate measures of work&#xD;
      ability assessment in connection to hospital admittance. The validation will provide&#xD;
      important information about the quality of rehabilitation services that many municipalities&#xD;
      provides through private suppliers - and where the effect on work ability lacks&#xD;
      evidence-based documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to link patient treatment to recovery and an optimal return to everyday&#xD;
      life, comprising the patients work life. The frame is a multi-sectoral accepted platform for&#xD;
      assessing patients' needs for care, treatment and rehabilitation, which is based on a&#xD;
      professional assessment of the efficacy and quality of, varies heath care related deliveries.&#xD;
      The acceptance of a multi-sectoral creates a need for accessible clinical tests of physical&#xD;
      and mental functioning, combined with biomarkers to identify patients need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project investigates whether it is possible to identify patients (age 18 to 60 year) with&#xD;
      an increased risk of losing their ability to work after discharge from an acute&#xD;
      hospitalisation. And to evaluate whether measurable effects on inflammation and functional&#xD;
      levels of labour oriented training program can be identified.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project will examine the validity of identification of patients in risk of decreased work&#xD;
      ability during and after hospitalisation and the effect of early intervention on the physical&#xD;
      and mental functional level. The project consists of a pilot study and two clinical studies&#xD;
      investigating the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The validity of work ability assessments by a self-administered questionnaire during&#xD;
           hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The development in the inflammatory response after discharge in relation to the&#xD;
           development in self-rated health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of a labour oriented training program measured in inflammatory response and&#xD;
           functional level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of a labour oriented training program on work ability after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-administered questionnaire Work Ability Index will be tested and evaluated during&#xD;
      the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1 is a prospective cohort study testing the identification tool for decreased work&#xD;
      ability including inflammatory biomarkers and functional levels after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 is a randomised controlled intervention study of the effect of a labour oriented&#xD;
      training program initiated within 2 weeks after discharge on functional level and self-rated&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim of study 1: testing the validity of Work Ability Index in relation to&#xD;
      observations on functional level and measurement of inflammatory biomarkers after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim of study 2: examine the effect of labour oriented training on functional level&#xD;
      and work ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following measuring tools will be used during the project: Work Ability Index, hand grip&#xD;
      strength, gait speed (6M), Major Depression Inventory (MDI), Self-rated health (EQ-5D) and&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers including markers for inflammatory receptors, cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand grip strength:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project manager and trained clinical staff will test participants included in study 1.&#xD;
      Participants are tested for physical capacity measured by grip strength. This is assessed&#xD;
      twice by a hand dynamometer for 5 seconds with his dominant hand and an average is&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait speed (6M):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical function is measured by a walking test of 6 m. The participants are measured from a&#xD;
      starting line with the message to go in for them normal pace on a marked field of 8 m. The&#xD;
      time is measured when the first foot reaches the 6m point and the test is repeated, after&#xD;
      which an average is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Depression Inventory (MDI):&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDI is a depression questionnaire to 10 symptoms, which is part of the World Health&#xD;
      Organization's definition of depression. The table focuses on the patient's current&#xD;
      experience of symptoms within the last two weeks and the changes that the disease extent and&#xD;
      rehabilitation can cause. MDI is used in the study as a rating scale with a theoretical sum&#xD;
      score from 0 (no depression) to 50 (maximum depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EQ-5D:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EQ-5D is a validated questionnaire to measure health status by a simple descriptive profile&#xD;
      and a single index value, which is evaluated for clinical and health economic studies of&#xD;
      self-rated health. The questionnaire was approved by the EuroQol Group, and includes&#xD;
      questions about mobility, personal care, activity, depression and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At admission, 2 - and 12 weeks after discharge blood sample is taken for analysis of&#xD;
      inflammatory receptors, cytokines and chemokines. The analyses will be carried out as batch&#xD;
      after sample collection by ELISA and / or Luminex technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the test, instruction and replies to the questionnaires represent a total&#xD;
      of 45 minutes per. participant Patients who submit a written informed consent to participate&#xD;
      based on an interview are randomised into an intervention or control group. The groups are&#xD;
      stratified for hospitalisation due to medical and surgical reasons, physical work load and&#xD;
      education to ensure an equitable distribution among participant receiving the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is performed in public-private collaboration with a health care provider&#xD;
      specialised in labour oriented training. The program consists of a physical training program,&#xD;
      individual motivational talks and guidance on labour market-oriented topics. Each program is&#xD;
      customised to the patient's physical resources and conditions. The scope of the intervention&#xD;
      is physical activity 1-2 hours 3 times weekly with concurrent motivational talks for an&#xD;
      overall of max. 9 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to include 120 patients giving an interventions size of 50 participants and&#xD;
      an estimated drop-out rate of 20%. The studies are carried out in accordance with the&#xD;
      principles of the Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are covered by Amager Hvidovre Hospital Patient Insurance. The collected data&#xD;
      will be kept in accordance to the Data Protection Agency guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Project Manager will work with the clinical staff from the participating departments&#xD;
      responsible for contacts with all patients who meet the inclusion criteria for the studies.&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will receive written and verbal information about&#xD;
      the project including the advantages, disadvantages, risks and patient rights by&#xD;
      participation in the project. The patient contacted by the project manager the day after the&#xD;
      verbal and written information. If the patient wishes to participate in the project obtained&#xD;
      accepted consent form and schedule time for tests and blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will help to focus attention on an overlooked task in health care, where the&#xD;
      patient after treatment can still be at risk of losing their ability to work. The project&#xD;
      will also mean greater knowledge about the use of biomarkers and how these may reflect the&#xD;
      development of the individual's refund and the current level of functioning.&#xD;
