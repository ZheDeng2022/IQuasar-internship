  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether continuous cardiac telemetry with the&#xD;
      Pocket-ECG III® system is more useful than conventional Holter to find out the cause of&#xD;
      syncope&#xD;

      Study population: adult patients with recurrent and/or with probable cardiac origin syncopes&#xD;
      with indication of cardiac rhythm monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated sample size: COLAPS trial showed that conventional 48-hours Holter and 4-weeks&#xD;
      external loop recorder got a diagnosis in 22% and 56%, respectively, in patients with&#xD;
      syncope. Based on this data, to compare two matched-proportions with α-risk=0.05 and&#xD;
      β-risk=0.2, 34 patients would be needed; to compensate a 15-20% percentage of lost patients&#xD;
      during follow-up, it is estimated that 40 patients is the number to include in the trial to&#xD;
      demonstrate the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables to collect:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline variables: birthdate date (month, year), inclusion date, gender, number and features&#xD;
      of syncopes, cardiovascular risk factors, electrocardiogram, type of cardiopathy, left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction, comorbidities and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring findings: diagnostic event and diagnostic fulfilled criteria, date of diagnostic&#xD;
      event, date of last follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and adverse events: monitoring length, unexpected battery depletion, number of losses&#xD;
      of mobile phone signal, cutaneous reactions to electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs: the costs of every diagnostic procedure used from inclusion to the end of follow-up&#xD;
      will be added, based on prespecified costs of every item (Decreto 56/2014 of the Consellería&#xD;
      de Sanidade de la Xunta de Galicia, which specifies the costs of every diagnostic or&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention in centers depending on the Servicio Gallego de Salud).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention description: patients with indication of conventional Holter monitoring will be&#xD;
      consecutively included. After signing written informed consent, a Pocket-ECG III® system will&#xD;
      be given to the patient. All participants will be monitored by the Pocket-ECG III® system&#xD;
      until a diagnosis is achieved or for a maximum of two months (whatever it happens first).&#xD;
      Everyday daily reports sent via e-mail by the manufacturer company (MEDICALgorithmics© S.A.)&#xD;
      will be reviewed by the investigator team; in case of a diagnosis event (according to&#xD;
      prespecified diagnostic criteria from the European Society of Cardiology), appropriate&#xD;
      treatment will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will be his/her own control. Conventional 24-hours Holter monitoring will be&#xD;
      simulated using data obtained by the Pocket-ECG III® system in the first 24 hours, ignoring&#xD;
      the registries of the rest of days. Two and Three 24-hours conventional Holter strategies&#xD;
      will also be simulated analyzing data from first 24 hours and 1-2 additional days,&#xD;
      respectively, chosen by means of a random number creation system which will identify the days&#xD;
      of registry to be considered. Diagnostic criteria in this virtual control group will be the&#xD;
      same as used in the actual Pocket-ECG III® system monitoring group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: patients will be followed-up by two complementary manners&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Real-time remote: Pocket-ECG III® system sends continuously the registered&#xD;
           electrocardiogram sinal via GSM mobile phone to a central unit sited in Poland, where&#xD;
           the signal is processed and interpreted. From this central unit, a daily report and a&#xD;
           weekly summary report is sent by e-mail to the investigator team. If a lost in the&#xD;
           mobile phone coverage happens, the system stores the registry in its memory until the&#xD;
           coverage is recovered, when the whole stored registry is sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Purpose-created outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: categorical variables will be expressed as &quot;absolute number&#xD;
      (percentage)&quot; and continuous variables as &quot;mean ± standard deviation&quot;, adding &quot;median&#xD;
      (interquartile range)&quot; when the distribution of values is far from normal distribution&#xD;
      assessed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk methods. Proportion of diagnosis achieved by&#xD;
      each strategy will be compared by McNemar for intrasubject measures or binomial exact&#xD;
      methods, whichever applies. Economic burden of each strategy will be compared with the&#xD;
      t-Student for intrasubject measures or T de Wilcoxon methods, whichever applies. All tests of&#xD;
      significance will be 2-sided, with p&lt;0.05 considered statistically significant. The analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted using PASW Statistics version 18.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York) and EPIDAT 3.1&#xD;
      (provided by the Direccion Xeral de Saude Publica de la Consellería de Sanidade de la Xunta&#xD;
      de Galicia).&#xD;
