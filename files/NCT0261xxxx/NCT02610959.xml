      The overall aim of the present project is to investigate if intake of cod in pregnancy has&#xD;
      impact on infant development up to 12 month. 142 pregnant women will be allocated into two&#xD;
      groups, one counsuming cod two times the week for four months and one group will continue to&#xD;
      follow their habitual diet. To study this, urine samples, dietary data and blood samples from&#xD;
      the mother and from the infant, as well as data on neurodevelopment and cognitive functioning&#xD;
      will be collected at several time points.&#xD;

      The World Health Organization considers iodine deficiency to be &quot;the single most important&#xD;
      preventable cause of brain damage&quot; worldwide. The effect of severe iodine deficiency is well&#xD;
      documented. Pregnant and nursing mothers have increased requirements and are thus a&#xD;
      vulnerable group. Iodine is a key component of thyroid hormones that are critical for normal&#xD;
      development of the brain and nervous system in utero. There is little data on the effect of&#xD;
      mild- and moderate iodine deficiency. Results from the Norwegian Mother and Child cohort (n =&#xD;
      about 62,000) shows that only 22% of the participants had an iodine intake, estimated from&#xD;
      food frequency questionnaire, that meets the recommendations of WHO / UNICEF / ICCIDD. Urine&#xD;
      samples from a sub-sample (n = 119) confirmed suboptimal iodine status. The results are&#xD;
      consistent with recent data from a NIFES study of about 100 women from the municipality of&#xD;
      Fjell, which reviled suboptimal iodine status both in pregnancy and three months after birth.&#xD;
      Preliminary results from the study Little in Norway, where NIFES measured the iodine status&#xD;
      in approximately 1,000 pregnant from across the country, is also consistent with these&#xD;
      investigations. Dairy products is highlighted as the main source of iodine for the&#xD;
      participants in the Norwegian Mother and Child cohort, while lean fish is the food group that&#xD;
      has the highest Iodine levels. In this article, the positive effect of seafood was explained&#xD;
      by the fatty acids EPA and DHA, while the latest publication suggests that the effect of an&#xD;
      adequate intake of seafood during pregnancy are more complex, and that the high iodine levels&#xD;
      in seafood may also be important. Based on this knowledge, there is a need for an&#xD;
      intervention study where pregnant consume cod regularly over a longer period and where the&#xD;
      children are followed up over time. Thus, in the present project the researchers will&#xD;
      investigate if intake of cod in pregnancy has impact on infant development up to 12 month.&#xD;
      142 pregnant women will be allocated into two groups, one consuming cod two times the week&#xD;
      for four months and one group will eat as normal. Urine samples, dietary data and blood&#xD;
      samples from the mother and from the infant, as well as data on neurodevelopment and&#xD;
      cognitive functioning will be collected at several time points.&#xD;
