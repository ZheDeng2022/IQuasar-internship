  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many variables measured in critically ill patients have been used to estimate severity of&#xD;
      disease, prognosticate morbidity and mortality, evaluate costs of treatment, and finally&#xD;
      indicate specific treatment and monitor the adequacy of treatment and its timing. It is&#xD;
      unlikely that one measurement can replace all of these, but in the remainder of this&#xD;
      manuscript the investigators will show that lactate levels may come close. Although in our&#xD;
      mind strongly linked to tissue hypoxia, lactate levels follow many more metabolic processes&#xD;
      not related to tissue hypoxia and, therefore, subject to many disturbances found in various&#xD;
      clinical situations&#xD;

      Forty consecutive pediatric patients who required cardiopulmonary bypass for repair or&#xD;
      palliation of complex congenital heart disease will be enrolled in this study. Patients for&#xD;
      the study were selected by convenience sampling, without randomization or control of surgical&#xD;
      procedure, conduct of anesthesia, or CPB management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored intra-operatively using ECG, invasive and non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring, pulse oximetry and capnography for determination of End Tidal Co2 (&#xD;
      ETCo2 ) and nasopharyngeal temperature. After induction of anesthesia and placement of an&#xD;
      intra-arterial catheter 1 ml of arterial blood will collected into a heparinized 3 ml blood&#xD;
      gas syringe and immediately analyzed on the arterial blood gas analyzer (GEM Premier 3000)&#xD;
      for blood gas, hematocrit, electrolytes, calcium and glucose. Management strategy of&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) was standardized for all the patients. Lactate samples will&#xD;
      drawn at specific time points within 5 time intervals: before CPB after induction, during&#xD;
      cooling on CPB, during rewarming on CPB, immediately after CPB in the operating room, and&#xD;
      after admission to the post-operative intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in lactate levels related to diagnosis will examined. To examine the effect of&#xD;
      patient diagnosis and surgical risk on serum lactate level and outcome, the investigators&#xD;
      separated patients into surgical risk categories Risk adjustment for congenital heart surgery&#xD;
      (RACHS-1). This classification does not include heart transplantation. Patient mortality and&#xD;
      the prevalence of postoperative complications for each of the 3 surgical risk categories&#xD;
      relative to the change in lactate will examined.&#xD;
