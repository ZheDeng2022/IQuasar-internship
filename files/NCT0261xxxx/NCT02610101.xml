  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research study to answer questions about a nutritional&#xD;
      therapy called the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) for children with active Crohn's Disease&#xD;
      (CD). The SCDiet is a diet where all grains such as wheat, barley, corn, rice are restricted.&#xD;
      Most dairy products (except certain yogurt) are also restricted. The diet mainly consists of&#xD;
      meat, fruits, vegetables, nuts, oils and honey, and is offered to individuals with active&#xD;
      Crohn's disease as part of standard of care at Seattle Children's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators will have three different dietary groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Traditional SCD diet group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Modified SCD to include oatmeal and rice&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SCD with whole foods without added sugar&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators want to know:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the SCD well tolerated?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is SCD effective for the treatment for active Crohn's Disease?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will the results from the varied three dietary groups have the same results for each&#xD;
           patient?&#xD;

    <textblock>
      21 patients with CD , mild or moderate disease activity as defined by Pediatric Crohn's&#xD;
      disease activity index (PCDAI score of 10-45 ) aged 8 -21 years will enroll into this&#xD;
      study.Patient's will be randomized to treatment groups. The treatments for this study will be&#xD;
      the:(1) Standard SCD as defined by Elaine Gottschall's Breaking the vicious cycle (2)&#xD;
      Modified SCD with added oats and rice (3) Whole foods diet without added sugars. Each patient&#xD;
      will receive an initial evaluation including a physical exam, medication review, nutritional&#xD;
      guidance and post treatment evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial evaluation: Study subject recipient will have the following lab tests including CBC&#xD;
      with differential &amp; platelets, a c-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, an albumin, vitamin&#xD;
      D level,Cholesterol, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, Zinc, Folate, a stool study for c. difficile, for&#xD;
      bacterial culture and ova and parasite, stool calprotectin and microbiome. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators will complete a physical exam and document their current medications. The study&#xD;
      nutritionist will complete a thorough diet history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Patient's will be randomized to treatment groups. The treatments for this study&#xD;
      will be the:(1) Standard SCD as defined by Elaine Gottschall's Breaking the vicious cycle (2)&#xD;
      Modified SCD with added oats and rice (3) Whole foods diet without added sugars Families will&#xD;
      be given a list of &quot;safe foods&quot; that the patient can eat no matter which group the patient is&#xD;
      in. Food will be prepared by a Chef knowledgeable in the SCD and whole food diets. Recipes&#xD;
      will be predetermined and families will be able to decide food for patient based upon menus.&#xD;
      Patients will receive one-on-one guidance by a Seattle Children's Dietician trained in the&#xD;
      SCD during each visit. Prior to each visit patient will fill out a 3 day nutrition log which&#xD;
      will be reviewed by the dietician during the clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Each study subject will have clinical follow-up at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and&#xD;
      12weeks. Standardized questionnaires, including the Pediatric Crohn's disease activity index&#xD;
      (PCDAI) will be completed during each study visit. Information about tabulating the PCDAI&#xD;
      scores, is listed in Appendix A. In addition patients will have a physical exam and standard&#xD;
      blood work including CBC, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, albumin and stool for&#xD;
      microbiome analysis at each follow up visit. This stool will be sent to the University of&#xD;
      Washington (Dr. Sam Miller's lab) for analysis;additional stool samples will be sent to&#xD;
      Katrine Whitson at UC Irvine for protein analysis. Stool calprotectin will additionally be&#xD;
      done at week 4 and 12. Vitamin D level will be measured at week 12. Finally, all patients&#xD;
      will meet with the nutritionist at each visit who will complete a thorough diet review. Any&#xD;
      questions about the SCD will be addressed at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study related information will be stored in the RedCap database. Participant data for the&#xD;
      study will be stored electronically in the REDCap platform. The REDCap platform is managed by&#xD;
      the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science at the University of Washington. Only&#xD;
      IRB approved research team members will have access to the REDCap data platform. Each team&#xD;
      member will be granted access to the REDCap data system through a secure login. The&#xD;
      information about each participant will be de-identified using a unique study code. Some&#xD;
      personal information such as date of birth will be stored in RedCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some stool from the participants at screening, week 2, 4, 8 and 12 will be stored for&#xD;
      microbiome analysis. The samples will be stored at Seattle Children's Hospital in the&#xD;
      Clinical Research Center lab in the -80 freezer. These samples will be sent to the University&#xD;
      of Washington for microbiome analysis and storage on an as necessary basis. Each of these&#xD;
      samples will be de-identified and labeled with a unique study code and visit number. Consent&#xD;
      for storage will be part of the Informed Consent process.&#xD;
