      Definitions of goals&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Analyze the effectiveness of physical exercise with blood flow restriction on the&#xD;
      diameter and the flow of vessels, muscle strength and circumference of the forearm in&#xD;
      patients with CKD prior to making arteriovenous fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Draw the profile of patients with CKD as the clinical and laboratory features&#xD;
           (hematocrit, hemoglobin, urea, creatinine) and glomerular filtration rate;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the vascular conditions, muscle strength and circumference of the upper limb of&#xD;
           the non-dominant forearm before and after exercise programs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the physical exercise programs with and without blood flow restriction vascular&#xD;
           changes, muscle strength and circumference of the non-dominant arm;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate the diameter measurements and blood flow to the muscle strength and&#xD;
           circumference of the upper limb not dominant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Study design This is a randomized controlled trial, blind and endowed with&#xD;
      allocation concealment to be developed in Physiotherapy clinic and Nephrology at the Clinical&#xD;
      Hospital, Federal University of Pernambuco and Cardiopulmonary Physiotherapy Laboratory in&#xD;
      the Department of Physical Therapy, Federal University of Pernambuco, the From December 2015&#xD;
      to November 2016, following approval of the Committee of Ethics in Research / the Health&#xD;
      Sciences Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval by Committee of Ethics in Research / the Health Sciences Center according to&#xD;
      Resolution 466/2012 of the National Health Council and the explanation of the study,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to sign the Informed Consent (IC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment and evaluations will be carried out by a single evaluator, who will be&#xD;
      blinded when randomization, allocation and interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria The sample will consist of patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)&#xD;
      Stage 4 or 5, of both sexes, from 18 years of age, in conservative or dialysis treatment with&#xD;
      medical indication of arteriovenous fistula as an achievement of hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Are excluded those that present cognitive impairment or changes that&#xD;
      hinder understanding, realization of activities and interpretation of the issues; a history&#xD;
      of making arteriovenous fistula in both upper limbs or some other type of vascular surgery in&#xD;
      upper limbs, with some type of vascular access in upper limbs or in nearby regions; to&#xD;
      develop some kind of manual work with heavy loads; Trauma-orthopedic lesions in the cervical,&#xD;
      shoulder, elbow, wrist and untreated (or) hand; signs of thrombophlebitis and hypoplasia /&#xD;
      agenesis of the upper limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design After enrollment in the nephrology clinic of the Clinical Hospital / Federal&#xD;
      University of Pernambuco will initially applied the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), to&#xD;
      exclude the possibility of cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anamnesis It will be performed in the clinic of Nephrology, after the MMSE through&#xD;
      questionnaire with open and closed questions. The data used are: sex, age (years), weight&#xD;
      (kg), height (m), body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) (mmHg) (Brazilian Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology, 2010), etiology and stage CKD, serum creatinine (mg / dL) and urea (mg / dL) of&#xD;
      the last test reported in medical records and Glomerular Filtration Rate (mL / min)&#xD;
      (Cockcroft; GAULT, 1976), hematocrit (%) and hemoglobin (g / dL) and current medications.&#xD;
      These data will be checked in an interview and medical records of patients that will be&#xD;
      opened during the interview will last approximately 15 minutes. After the date for physical&#xD;
      examination will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam It will be held on Cardiopulmonary Physiotherapy laboratory at Federal&#xD;
      University of Pernambuco. The patient will designate its upper limb non-domimant, according&#xD;
      to the guidelines of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Guidelines (VASCULAR&#xD;
      ACCESS WORK GROUP, 2006). Then will take place the forearm circumference assessments,&#xD;
      morphology of the vessels and handgrip strength. This will take the total duration of&#xD;
      approximately 50 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circumference forearm The circumference of the forearm will be performed by perimetry (tape&#xD;
      nylon). The patient will be sitting in the chair with the supinated forearm and elbow flexed&#xD;
      at 90 °. The tape is positioned at the distal 2 cm of the cubital fossa (KONG et al, 2014).&#xD;
      Will be held 3 measurements, registering the highest value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphology vessel To evaluate the radial artery are measured the internal cross-sectional&#xD;
      diameter (mm) at flow rate of [systolic peak (cm / sec) and average velocity (cm / s)]. For&#xD;
      the cephalic vein, will be measured basal venous outside diameter (mm) and venous outer&#xD;
      diameter after placement of tourniquet (mm), and distensibility of the cephalic vein (%) for&#xD;
      upper limb (UL) by ultrasonography [Sonoace R3 ( Samsung Medison - South Korea)]. A linear&#xD;
      transducer 10 megahertz multifrequency (RUS et al, 2005; Kumar et al, 2010; RUS et al, 2005)&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handgrip strength Will be assessed by manual dynamometer (Smedley Dynamometer - Type hand&#xD;
      mark Saehan - Korea) to evaluate the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Will be conducted&#xD;
      two tests with rest interval of five minutes after the first reading, is considered the&#xD;
      greatest value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations of the circumference of the forearm, the vessel morphology and handgrip strength&#xD;
      will be performed by the same evaluator before and after the interventions, which will be&#xD;
      blinded as to the randomization of patients to interventions and their implementation (KONG&#xD;
      et al, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Protocol Will run for eight weeks for each patient, being developed in five days&#xD;
      of the week (2 days with supervision by the physiotherapist on an outpatient basis and 3 days&#xD;
      at home).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, patients will be divided into two groups, experimental (EG) and control&#xD;
      (CG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group For experimental group, will be held isometric and isotonic concentric to&#xD;
      the flexor muscles of the elbow and wrist using tennis ball, halter and handgrip added to&#xD;
      partial occlusion of blood flow to tourniquet application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between exercise modalities will be given two minutes apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial occlusion protocol for prescription tourniquet for treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of the tourniquet Will be held in conjunction with exercises for the experimental&#xD;
      group group will be determined in the interview. The partial occlusion of blood flow will be&#xD;
      induced by inflation of a tensiometer on the upper arm and the stethoscope is placed on the&#xD;
      medial aspect of the elbow crease, (3M ™ Littmann® Classic II SE, USA) to verify the absence&#xD;
      of the arterial pulse. After the disappearance of the sound, the cuff is deflated slowly,&#xD;
      observing the first arterial pulse, which is used 50% of it to occlusion during training, and&#xD;
      graduated in mmHg. This pressure will be maintained for the three types of exercises in all&#xD;
      grades, including the 2-minute interval during periods of rest (LOENNEKE et al, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tennis ball For exercises with tennis ball, will initially be 3 sets, where one series with&#xD;
      10 grips (each squeeze lasting 3 seconds, 1 second rest), increasing 5 grips every week, 60&#xD;
      seconds rest every series. There will be two minutes of rest, then will repeat the same&#xD;
      sequence. After, it will be given two minutes of rest for the next activity (KONG et al,&#xD;
      2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Halter The exercises are performed with load of 1 kg (during the first two weeks of&#xD;
      training), 2 kg (for the last two weeks of the first month) and 3 kg for the last 4 weeks.&#xD;
      The exercise will be conducted through elbow flexion, with the patient seated. The exercise&#xD;
      will consist of three sets of 10 movements, maintaining shrinkage for 3 seconds, followed by&#xD;
      1-second standing (extension member). Between each series of 10 contractions will rest 60&#xD;
      seconds. 2 will be given minutes of rest at the end of this, before the next activity (SALIMI&#xD;
      et al, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handgrip They will be performed 3 sets of dynamic manual hold exercises in the intensity of&#xD;
      40% of MVC, with a frequency of 20 contractions per minute (duty cycle of 2/2 of contraction&#xD;
      and 1 second rest). After 3 sets of 20 contractions, will be given one minute of rest. This&#xD;
      activity will be performed to volitional fatigue, and recorded the time and amount of sets&#xD;
      performed per patient (Hunt et al, 2012; UY et al, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home program At home will be performed isometric exercises with tennis ball on the same&#xD;
      frequency as in performing ambulatory without applying the tensiometer. Will be held the two&#xD;
      sequences (3 sets of 10 grips) once daily for three days this week, which will be guided&#xD;
      verbally by the trainer and delivered all the guidelines through leaflet, materials for the&#xD;
      exercise and a daily control conducting training. Links will be held daily to help control&#xD;
      procedures. Appendix 6 presents the check-list for muscle training the experimental group&#xD;
      (Hunt et al, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group control In the control group (CG) will be held the same isometric and isotonic&#xD;
      concentric ambulatory and home with the same duration, frequency and intensity, except is not&#xD;
      to apply the tourniquet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of the program The program will end at the end of the 3rd day of the last week of&#xD;
      the completion of home procedures, and scheduled the revaluation and its realization in&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be recorded the frequency of patients to outpatient care and conducting training at&#xD;
      home in both groups by the instructor. Patients who do not carry 75% of the program will be&#xD;
      given as loss of tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tabulation plan and analysis Spreadsheets Data will be recorded primarily in chips&#xD;
      assessments of each patient, and then will be transferred to the Microsoft Office Excel&#xD;
      spreadsheets type, version 2010® and later to the software Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 for Windows for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods for data analysis Initially descriptive data analysis will be carried&#xD;
      out, which may be presented as mean ± standard deviation, confidence interval of 95% and&#xD;
      frequency distribution. The normal distribution is used for the continuous variables, using&#xD;
      the Shapiro-Wilk test and the homogeneity using Levene's test. At the end of the program will&#xD;
      be realized the Student t test for paired comparing pre and post between the same groups and&#xD;
      the Mann-Whitney test for comparisons between groups of non-paired samples. For correlations&#xD;
      will be used the Pearson or Spearman correlation test. It will be considered p value less&#xD;
      than 0.05 as significant. For data analysis, SPSS for Windows version 20.0 is used.&#xD;
