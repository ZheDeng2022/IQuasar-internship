  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' study seeks to explore the impact of price information on physicians'&#xD;
      ordering behavior and care quality. The investigators will evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      physician price transparency initiative at Atrius Health (ATRIUS) on rate of overall&#xD;
      procedure and test orders, clinically inappropriate orders, and appropriate orders.&#xD;
      Ultimately, this study will help stakeholders understand the degree to which price&#xD;
      information can help improve the value of healthcare.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' study team worked with Atrius Health (ATRIUS) to design a physician price&#xD;
      transparency (PPT) intervention aimed at providing primary and specialty care physicians with&#xD;
      price information on commonly-ordered outpatient procedures (e.g., Pap smears, ECHOs,&#xD;
      colonoscopies) and imaging tests (e.g., CTs and MRIs). The 2014 PPT intervention was built&#xD;
      upon a pilot that ATRIUS conducted in 2010. Starting January 1, 2014, ATRIUS randomized its&#xD;
      physicians to 3 different study arms, those receiving:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No price display for common outpatient procedures or imaging tests,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A single price for each procedure or test, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A pair of prices for each procedure or test (that allowed physicians to compare prices&#xD;
           that would be charged if the test was conducted at a facility within the ATRIUS network&#xD;
           versus outside of it).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mode for delivering this PPT intervention was ATRIUS' common electronic medical record&#xD;
      (EMR), which all of its physicians use to place all orders related to outpatient procedures&#xD;
      and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators used a blocked randomized-controlled study design to quantitatively and&#xD;
      qualitatively evaluate the effect of No, Single and Paired procedure and imaging test price&#xD;
      information on: rate of overall procedure and test orders, clinically inappropriate orders,&#xD;
      and appropriate orders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators used ATRIUS' administrative and EMR Data Repository to assess the&#xD;
      quantitative outcomes proposed within this study. This repository contains the information&#xD;
      the investigators need to block randomize at the practice level and to describe practices&#xD;
      (e.g., size, location) and physicians (e.g., age, gender, specialty). It also captures all of&#xD;
      the actions that physicians take when caring for patients (all orders are placed through&#xD;
      their common EMR) and collects all of the information needed to assess clinical care quality&#xD;
      using Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures. Data from this&#xD;
      system have been used in numerous prior analyses of healthcare quality.&#xD;
