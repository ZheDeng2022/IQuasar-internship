  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and metabolic syndrome are prevalent among prostate cancer patients. Having an&#xD;
      elevated insulin level in the blood is associated with a shorter median time to cancer&#xD;
      progression and median overall survival in patients with an elevated PSA after prior&#xD;
      treatment. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with drugs like bicalutamide is frequently used&#xD;
      in this patient population,with no proven benefit, which may increase mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity.This study evaluates how metformin in combination with bicalutamide affects&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

      1 Cycle = 28 days = 4 weeks. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis ӿ&#xD;
      Metformin starting dose is 500 mg BID, will be gradually increased to target dose of 1000mg&#xD;
      BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment ARM A Cycles 1 - 2: Observation without treatment Cycles 3 - 8: Bicalutamide 50 mg&#xD;
      daily, orally, continuously to the end of study (week 32).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment ARM B Cycles 1 - 2: In order to minimize gastrointestinal discomfort, metformin&#xD;
      dosing will be ramped up over a period of 2 weeks. Metformin treatment will be started at 500&#xD;
      mg BID (Dose Level -2) and increased by an increment of 500 mg daily every week +/- 2 days&#xD;
      provided no grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal toxicity is noted. If grade 2 or greater&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicity occurs during the first 4 weeks of treatment, the subject will be&#xD;
      evaluated every 2 weeks until resolution of toxicity to grade 0 or 1 and, then, the metformin&#xD;
      dose will be increased to the next dose level. The target dose of metformin is 1000 mg BID.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must have had previous treatment with definitive surgery or radiation therapy or&#xD;
        cryoablation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient may have prior salvage therapy (surgery, radiation or other local ablative&#xD;
        procedures) within 6 months prior to randomization if the intent was for cure.Prophylactic&#xD;
        radiotherapy to prevent gynecomastia within 4 weeks prior to randomization is allowed BMI &gt;&#xD;
        25 at study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient may have had prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, vaccines or&#xD;
        experimental agents) within 4 weeks prior to randomization, if the PSA rise and PSADT were&#xD;
        documented after the testosterone level was &gt; 150ng/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must have hormone-sensitive prostate cancer as evident by a serum total&#xD;
        testosterone level &gt; 150 ng/dL within 12 weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PSA must be &lt; 30 ng/mL at study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient may not have had therapy modulating testosterone levels (such as luteinizing&#xD;
        hormone,releasing-hormone agonists/antagonists and antiandrogens) within 1 year prior to&#xD;
        randomization, unless it was in the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must have evidence of biochemical failure after primary therapy and subsequent&#xD;
        progression. Biochemical failure is declared when the PSA reaches a threshold value after&#xD;
        primary treatment and it differs for radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For radical prostatectomy the threshold for this study is PSA ≥ 0.2ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For radiation therapy the threshold is a PSA rise of 2 ng/mL above the nadir PSA&#xD;
             achieved post radiation with or without hormone therapy (2006 RTOG-ASTRO Consensus&#xD;
             definition).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. PSA progression requires a PSA rise above the threshold measured at any time point&#xD;
             since the threshold was reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PSA doubling time between 3 and 9 months. PSA calculation requires two consecutive PSA&#xD;
        rises (PSA2 and PSA3) above the threshold PSA (total 3 PSA values); PSA2 and PSA3 must be&#xD;
        obtained within 12 months of study entry. All baseline PSAs should be obtained at the same&#xD;
        reference lab. Patient's PSA doubling time must be calculated using the following formula&#xD;
        (http://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/psa doubling-time):&#xD;
&#xD;
        ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to swallow the study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,000/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 1.5 X institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Hgb A1c ≤ 6.5&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of metastatic disease on imaging studies (CT and/or bone scan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Fasting blood glucose &gt; 126 mg/dl or,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Random blood glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hemoglobin A1C &gt; 6.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        Need for treatment with any conventional modality for prostate cancer (surgery, radiation&#xD;
        therapy, and hormonal therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior hormonal therapy for recurrent prostate cancer (hormonal therapy given in a&#xD;
        neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and greater than 6 months before entry is acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment within the last 30 days with any investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        Radiation therapy within prior 6 months (prophylactic radiotherapy to prevent gynecomastia&#xD;
        within 4 weeks prior to randomization is allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known hypersensitivity to metformin&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior history of lactic acidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any history of myocardial infarction in the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;

        intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection,&#xD;
        symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or&#xD;
        other nonmalignant medical or psychiatric illness that is uncontrolled or whose control may&#xD;

        Patient with previous or concurrent malignancy. Exceptions are made for patients who meet&#xD;
        any of the following conditions: Basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or prior&#xD;

        for ≥ 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects currently treated with metformin and/or bicalutamide or who have been treated with&#xD;
        metformin and/or bicalutamide in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who have taken 5a-reductase inhibitors (finasteride or dutasteride), saw palmetto,&#xD;
        or PC-SPES within the last 6 weeks are ineligible. Subjects will be eligible for the study&#xD;
