  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of S-1226 composed of perflubron with ascending doses&#xD;
      of carbon dioxide (4%, 8%, and 12% CO2) administered over 2 minute nebulisation to healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be up to 3 cohorts (1 cohort per dose level). Each cohort will include 12 subjects&#xD;
      (9 receiving S-1226 and 3 receiving matching placebo). For each dose level, a sentinel group&#xD;
      of 2 subjects will be dosed (1 subject with S-1226, 1 subject with placebo) 24 hours prior to&#xD;
      dosing the rest of the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may be necessary to repeat, or modify (decrease) a dose level, and thus an additional&#xD;
      cohort of up to 12 subjects may be enrolled.&#xD;
