  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are imaging patients with prostate cancer using a new PET imaging agent&#xD;
      (Ga-68 HBED-CC PSMA) in order to evaluate it's ability to detection prostate cancer in&#xD;
      patients with high risk disease prior to prostatectomy, patients with biochemical recurrence&#xD;
      and patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning.&#xD;
      Patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer will be imaged using Gallium-68 labeled&#xD;
      HBED-CC PSMA in order to demonstrate its utility. The investigators plan to utilize this data&#xD;
      to obtain further approvals of the HBED-CC PSMA compound, so that this agent will become&#xD;
      available for clinical imaging in prostate cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This compound has been shown to be superior to choline based PET agents for the staging of&#xD;
      prostate cancer, both Carbon-11 and Fluorine-18 compounds. But this compound was not patented&#xD;
      and therefore no company or private entity will make the investment required to bring HBED-CC&#xD;
      PSMA to market. In the vacuum of availability, academic groups must take the lead in order to&#xD;
      collect the necessary data for future FDA approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focuses on three patients populations that are imaged. In the pre-prostatectomy&#xD;
      population, the primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity for&#xD;
      detection on nodal metastasis. In the biochemical recurrence population, the primary&#xD;
      objective is to determine the sensitivity of recurrence location. In the castrate resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer population the primary objective is to determine if PSMA PET detects more&#xD;
      metastatic lesions than conventional imaging.&#xD;

    <description>Patient shall begin imaging between 55 and 70 minutes after the injection of the radiopharmaceutical. A PET/CT scan includes two parts: a PET scan and a CT scan. The CT portion of the scan produces a 3-D image that shows a patient's anatomy. The PET scan demonstrates function and what's occurring on a cellular level. The PET scan is unique because it images the radiation emitted from the patient while the CT records anatomical x-rays, showing the same area from another perspective</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Over one-half of the patients subsequently underwent radiation therapy and androgen deprivation therapy. In these patients PSA level almost universally falls to zero, and therefore no follow-up imaging is performed, effectively removing a large proportion of patients from our imaging follow-up.</limitations_and_caveats>
