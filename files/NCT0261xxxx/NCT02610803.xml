      The purpose of this study is to estimate the clinical relevance of monitoring patients with&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke with 48 hours' inpatient cardiac telemetry in relation to evaluate the&#xD;
      presence of brief runs of premature atrial complexes and new diagnosed atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
      Furthermore to evaluate the prognostic significance of brief runs of premature atrial&#xD;
      complexes in relation to develop atrial fibrillation, recurrent stroke/transient ischemic&#xD;
      attack and death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and it is well known that atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation(AF) is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke. Paroxysmal AF can be difficult&#xD;
      to detect because many cases are asymptomatic. In recent years prolonged cardiac rhythm&#xD;
      monitoring of patients with ischemic stroke has showed an underestimated prevalence of AF.&#xD;
      However, no optimal monitoring strategy is implemented in the clinic yet. This is the reason&#xD;
      why research currently is focused on finding predictive risk markers of AF. Cohort studies of&#xD;
      healthy individuals and stroke patients have shown that excessive premature atrial complexes&#xD;
      (PACs) and brief runs of PACs are an emerging risk marker in helping to identifying patients&#xD;
      in risk of having or developing AF. Despite this brief runs of PACs less than 30 s are today&#xD;
      in everyday clinical practice perceived to be of no clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population of ischemic stroke patients have all without known AF underwent ECG and&#xD;
      48 hours' inpatient cardiac telemetry as a clinical routine. In the medical record it is&#xD;
      registered if patients had runs of PACs or new diagnosed AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are registered in the Danish Stroke Registry, and all the baseline data on&#xD;
      patients will be obtained from the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up end August 2015 and information on AF, recurrent stroke and death will be&#xD;
      obtained from medical records and the Funen Patient Administrative System, which is linked to&#xD;
      the national Civil Registration System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the clinical relevance of monitoring patients with&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke with 48 hours' inpatient cardiac telemetry in relation to evaluate the&#xD;
      presence of brief runs of PACs and new diagnosed AF. Furthermore to evaluate the prognostic&#xD;
      significance of brief runs of PACs in relation to develop AF and the prognostic significance&#xD;
      of brief runs of PACs and AF in relation to recurrent stroke and death.&#xD;
