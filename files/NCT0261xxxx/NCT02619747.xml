    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomised, open-label, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover&#xD;
      study. After signing a written informed consent (ICF), patients will undergo a screening&#xD;
      period of up to 10 days (Visit 1) which will require the patient to return to the clinic on&#xD;
      several occasions. At the start of the screening process patients will have 24 hour (h) pH&#xD;
      monitoring which will include one standardised refluxogenic meal after a 4 h fast. The 24 h&#xD;
      pH monitoring results will be used as a key criteria for patient eligibility and to provide&#xD;
      the patients with diagnostic information on their symptoms. After 24 h pH monitoring,&#xD;
      eligible patients will be supplied with Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachet to&#xD;
      take as required for symptom relief between visits (up to 2×10ml sachets four times daily: 30&#xD;
      minutes after breakfast, 30 minutes after lunch, 30 minutes after dinner and immediately&#xD;
      before lying down for bed, stopping dosing at least 24 hours prior to Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who satisfy the study entry requirements within 10 days of consent, will be&#xD;
      randomised to receive either two Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachets (2×10ml) or&#xD;
      two placebo sachets (2×10ml) following placement of a pH electrode after a 4 h fast and a&#xD;
      standardised refluxogenic meal at Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the Visit 2 4-hour post-dose pH monitoring period patients will be&#xD;
      re-supplied with Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachets to take as required for&#xD;
      symptom relief (up to 2×10ml sachets four times daily: 30 minutes after breakfast, 30 minutes&#xD;
      after lunch, 30 minutes after dinner and immediately before lying down for bed, stopping&#xD;
      dosing at least 24 hours prior to Visit 3) for 7 ± 2 days. Patients will return for Visit 3&#xD;
      after 7 ± 2 days. Visit 3 will consist of repeat pH catheter insertion (4 hour fast followed&#xD;
      by refluxogenic test meal consumption) and pH monitoring, receiving the alternative&#xD;
      randomised treatment at Visit 3.&#xD;
