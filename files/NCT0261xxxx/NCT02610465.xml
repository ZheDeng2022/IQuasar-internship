  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed Tomography (CT) scans make detailed pictures of the body in seconds. CT scans make&#xD;
      pictures by passing x-rays through a person. CT scans are common. In 2011, around 85.3&#xD;
      million of them occurred in the United States. Researchers think CT images can be made better&#xD;
      using new techniques. Higher resolution images can be derived from the original scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if new ways of obtaining and processing pictures of the body from a regular CT scan&#xD;
      can produce images with higher resolution (pixels) and more information than standard&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who are scheduled to have a CT scan and are not pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their scheduled CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CT scanner used in this study provides enhanced images of inside the body. Researchers&#xD;
      may use the CT scanner in a research mode to test and improve the pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images from the CT scan will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any clinical findings from the CT test will be shared with the participant s doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue to receive their medical care from their regular doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CT images will be entered into an NIH research database. In the future, they may be used&#xD;
      for research purposes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Computed Tomography (CT) images the body. Different methods of creating CT pictures are&#xD;
      avilable on a research basis that enables higher resolution imaging using the same&#xD;
      aquisition. The purpose of this research study is to learn wheteher these new high resolution&#xD;
      images derived from the original CT scan provide similar or perhaps more information than the&#xD;
      current standard clinical method.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare with respect to 7 image quality metrics the overall image quality from a higher resolution CT with traditional clinical standard CT from the same acquisition</measure>
    <time_frame>05/13/2016</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analysis will compare the overall image quality across the 7 Likert scales between the clinical standard and the high resolution images. For each of the two readers, we will sum each subject s 7 Likert scores for the standard and high resolution images, respectively. Then we will average the two readers standard image cumulative scores, respectively, the two readers high resolution image cumulative scores. Thus for each subject, both the standard and high resolution images will have an average cumulative score between 7 and 34. For each subject, we will compute the difference between the standard image and high resolution image average cumulative scores. The primary analysis will report the mean and its 95% confidence interval for the standard image high resolution image difference. We will also report the median and 5th-95th percentiles of the differences.</description>
