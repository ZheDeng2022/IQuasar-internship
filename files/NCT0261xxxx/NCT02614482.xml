      efficacy for overactive bladder syndrome in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a highly prevalent disorder in the pediatric population. This&#xD;
      condition comprises many urinary symptoms, such as urgency, increased daytime frequency of&#xD;
      micturition, urge incontinence and nocturia. These symptoms are especially troublesome for&#xD;
      the pediatric patients and their family since it causes embarrassment and it limits everyday&#xD;
      activities and impairs children's development. Furthermore, serious complications are seen if&#xD;
      this condition is not treated properly, as urinary tract infection, vesico-ureteral reflux&#xD;
      and dysfunctional voiding. Antimuscarinic agents are the current pharmacologic mainstay for&#xD;
      OAB. Many side effects are reported with the clinical use of antimuscarinics. In the last&#xD;
      years, Fesoterodine, a new antimuscarinic, has been developed for the treatment of OAB.&#xD;
      Studies show significant improvement of clinical symptoms in adults with OAB and fewer side&#xD;
      effects. The outcomes for the pediatric population remain unknown due to lack of studies.&#xD;
      Antimuscarinic agents are the mainstay of the current treatment of OAB. Oxybutynin is the&#xD;
      most widely antimuscarinic agent used in the pediatric population and is the only molecule&#xD;
      approved by Health Canada for children with OAB. However, some patients have a suboptimal&#xD;
      response to antimuscarinic and many experience side effects. Children with OAB therefore&#xD;
      represent a disease population with a need for an alternative effective, safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated therapy to help manage the overactive detrusor, reducing or preventing&#xD;
      incontinence. Fesoterodine is a new antimuscarinic drug available as a prolonged release (PR)&#xD;
      tablet formulation, and is approved in Europe, Canada and the USA at doses of 4 mg and 8 mg&#xD;
      once daily for the treatment of OAB in adults; it is not approved for use in the pediatric&#xD;
      population. This study is the extension of our ongoing protocol. Before randomization,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo 2 weeks of urotherapy. At the end of these 2 weeks, the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be reassessed and the subjects admissible for the initial study will&#xD;
      be randomized for a 8 week-treatment period during which the urotherapy will be continued.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to 8 weeks of single-blind treatment with Fesoterodine 4&#xD;
      mg Po Die or Oxybutynin XL 10 mg Po Die. At the end of the 8 week-treatment period, subjects&#xD;
      will stop their current therapy for one week. At week 9, both cohorts will do a cross over.&#xD;
      The cohort on Fesoterodine will be on Oxybutynin XL and vice versa. After 4 weeks on any&#xD;
      given medication, the possibility of up-titration will be assessed. On a telephone interview&#xD;
      with the research nurse, patients and parents will be questioned on compliance, tolerability&#xD;
      and efficacy. If the patient is taking the medication ≥80% of the time, does not have any&#xD;
      significant side effects and still has significant OAB symptoms, the investigators will offer&#xD;
      a dose increase (Fesoterodine 8mg or Oxybutynin XL 20mg daily). If accepted, the medication&#xD;
      will be provided with instructions to report any new side effects. Oxybutynin XL (Ditropan&#xD;
      XL) is the extended release and once a day formulation of Oxybutynin (actual gold standard&#xD;
      for OAB in children). By using this formulation with children who can swallow pills, the&#xD;
      control group has the same once a day regimen as Fesoterodine (Toviaz), thus avoiding this&#xD;
      possible bias. The bid or tid immediate release formulation is known to create more side&#xD;
      effects and decreases the compliance (sometime hard to administer the afternoon dose to&#xD;
      children at school).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a 3-day voiding diary prior to each medical visit to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of the single-blind treatment and urotherapy. Visits will be done on week -2, 0, 8&#xD;
      and 17 (+/- 5 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After both cycles on OAB medication, patients will be asked to report which medication they&#xD;
      preferred (least side effects, best efficacy). If they tolerated well Fesoterodine, they will&#xD;
      be offered to enter FOXY2015, the 12-month extension study on Fesoterodine. If they prefer to&#xD;
      continue on Ditropan XL, it will be prescribed to the patient and will be followed in regular&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have completed a 3-day voiding diary prior to that medical visit to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of the single-blind treatment and urotherapy. During FOXY2014, four visits were done&#xD;
      on week -2, 0, 8 and 17. If they provide informed consent, it will become Visit-5 in&#xD;
      FOXY2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will also start the extension study at the highest well-tolerated dose of&#xD;
      fesoterodine while on FOXY2014. If he was using 4mg daily, he will still have the opportunity&#xD;
      to increase the dosage to 8mg daily (based on efficacy and tolerability assessed by the&#xD;
      research nurse phone call after 4 weeks of treatment or at visit 6).&#xD;
