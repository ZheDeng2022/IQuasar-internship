      This randomized phase III trial compares yoga, survivorship health education program, and&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing sleep disturbance (insomnia) in cancer survivors.&#xD;
      Insomnia can be described as excessive daytime napping, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty&#xD;
      staying asleep, or waking up earlier than desired. Insomnia can increase fatigue, impair&#xD;
      physical function, impair immune function, cause circadian rhythms (known as the biological&#xD;
      clock) to be disrupted and decrease quality of life. Yoga may improve circadian rhythms,&#xD;
      physical and immune function, and improve insomnia and sleep quality in cancer survivors. It&#xD;
      is not yet known whether yoga is more effective at treating insomnia than a health education&#xD;
      program or cognitive behavioral therapy program.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if Yoga for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS) is effective for improving&#xD;
      patient-reported insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index) compared to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
      for Insomnia (CBT-I) and a health education control immediately post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine if YOCAS is effective for improving objective symptoms of insomnia (sleep&#xD;
      latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, sleep duration, and daytime napping via&#xD;
      actigraphy) and global sleep quality impairment (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) compared to&#xD;
      CBT-I and a health education control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine if YOCAS and CBT-I are effective for maintaining improvements in insomnia&#xD;
      (Insomnia Severity Index) 3 and 6 months post intervention compared to a health education&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo the YOCAS intervention comprising 18 specific physical postures and&#xD;
      mindfulness exercises focused on breathing and meditation and meet with the yoga instructor&#xD;
      over 75 minutes 2 times a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo CBT-I intervention comprising sleep education, sleep hygiene, sleep&#xD;
      restriction, stimulus control, cognitive therapy, and relapse prevention delivered by a&#xD;
      health professional over 90 minutes once a week for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients attend survivorship health education sessions over 75 minutes 2 times a&#xD;
      week for 4 weeks based on the American Society of Clinical Oncology cancer survivorship&#xD;
      educational recommendations delivered by a community health educator. Patients also receive a&#xD;
      booklet entitled, &quot;Cancer Survivorship Next Steps for Patients and Their Families.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of intervention, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index is a validated measure of insomnia. A 5-point Likert scale of 7 questions is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28 with higher scores indicating higher severity of insomnia. Means and 95% confidence intervals for YOCAS and CBT-I will be calculated and plotted and examined in comparison with the a priori specified non-inferiority margin of 1.15.</description>

A linear mixed effects ANCOVA will be used to assess the statistical significance of the differences in mean change between YOCAS and health education.</description>
          <population>The overall number of participants analyzed is higher than the number of participants who completed the study because the timeframe for this outcome measure was from baseline up to post-intervention.

          <title>Mean Change in Objective Symptoms of Insomnia- Sleep Efficiency Via Actigraphy Comparing YOCAS vs. CBT-I</title>
          <description>Actigraphy will measure the percent of time actually slept compared to intended time sleeping. A linear mixed effects ANCOVA will be used to assess the statistical significance of the differences in mean change between YOCAS and CBT-I.</description>
