  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taenia solium taeniosis/cysticercosis is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease complex with&#xD;
      significant economic and public health impacts, occurring primarily in developing countries.&#xD;
      Humans are the carriers of the tapeworm (taeniosis); the normal intermediate pig host&#xD;
      develops the metacestode larval stage (porcine cysticercosis). However, people can also act&#xD;
      as accidental intermediate hosts and develop human cysticercosis or neurocysticercosis (NCC)&#xD;
      when the central nervous system is involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scattered efforts of researchers into evaluation of control programmes in Sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa (SSA) have focussed on single control options. It is becoming clear that these&#xD;
      stand-alone options have the potential to reduce the occurrence of the parasite, however&#xD;
      either long term or more integrated efforts seem to be required to reach an elimination&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the current study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness/acceptability of&#xD;
      elimination (to be achieved on a short term via integrated measures), and control (single&#xD;
      measures, with an elimination goal on a longer term) of T. solium in a highly endemic area in&#xD;
      SSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention study will entail an elimination study arm in which multiple control&#xD;
      options are combined (integrated) aiming at the final human host (Mass drug administration&#xD;
      (MDA) and health education) and pig intermediate hosts (pig treatment and vaccination). In a&#xD;
      second study arm a single control option will be carried out (pig treatment). In both study&#xD;
      arms (health) education will be implemented. At baseline and in the final sampling year,&#xD;
      prevalence of human taeniosis/cysticercosis and porcine cysticercosis will be determined in&#xD;
      all study villages. Active ongoing surveillance and 6 monthly (biannual) human and pig&#xD;
      sampling will be conducted in the elimination study arm, as well as two-yearly (biennial)&#xD;
      sampling of the pig intermediate host in the control study arm. Additionally, (open ended)&#xD;
      questionnaires and focus group discussions will be administered/held to obtain data on the&#xD;
      cost of pig keeping, T. solium, the interventions and the perception/acceptability of the&#xD;
      proposed control measures to the local communities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As T. solium is a zoonosis, it's control will be evaluated in a One Health perspective,&#xD;
      tackling both the human and pig host. The study will be carried out in the Katete district,&#xD;
      in the Eastern Province of Zambia, an area reported to be endemic for T. solium in both pigs&#xD;
      and humans. The pig interventions will not be described here, as requested by&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov Suitability of communities in the Katete district was assessed during a&#xD;
      pilot survey conducted by the proposers (April 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two communities were selected that fulfilled all of the eligibility criteria. The Nyembe&#xD;
      neighbourhood community (1,210 people, 5 villages, 520 pigs), within the Nyembe Rural Health&#xD;
      Centre (RHC) catchment was selected for the elimination study arm; and Chimvira neighbourhood&#xD;
      community (1,470 people, 11 villages, 827 pigs), in the Mtandaza Rural Health Centre&#xD;
      catchment, was selected for the control study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventional study will entail a high-input elimination study arm (E), in which&#xD;
      multiple control options targeting both the final (human, mass drug administration, health&#xD;
      education) and intermediate (pig) hosts (treatment and vaccination), are combined; and a&#xD;
      lower-input control study arm (CI), which will use a single control option targeting only the&#xD;
      porcine host (treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teams of suitably qualified and trained human and veterinary medical staff will go from&#xD;
      door-to-door to each household in the study communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures will include collection of both qualitative and quantitative data from human&#xD;
      participants and pigs; subject-related interventions in both human participants and pigs; and&#xD;
      laboratory analysis of collected samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the baseline surveys, one randomly-selected consenting adult member and one&#xD;
      randomly-selected assenting (and parental consent) child member (above 5 years) from each&#xD;
      household will be sampled (serum: diagnosis of human cysticercosis; and stool: diagnosis of&#xD;
      taeniasis), whereas for all subsequent surveys in the elimination arm (see protocol for&#xD;
      specific time points), all eligible consenting members of the elimination communities will be&#xD;
      invited to participate (stool samples: diagnosis of taeniasis). All eligible consenting&#xD;
      members from the control arm will be included at the final study sampling (stool: diagnosis&#xD;
      of taeniasis and serum: diagnosis of cysticercosis). It is expected that all age, sex and&#xD;
      socioeconomic groups will be equally represented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the socio-economic questionnaires, 50% of the households will be randomly selected and&#xD;
      the head of the household addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The school based questionnaire will be administered to grade 5-6 children attending school in&#xD;
      each of the study communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the perception questionnaires: here also 50% of the households will be targeted (random&#xD;
      selection), until data saturation has been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the focus group discussions (FGD): 6 FGD (3 with each time 10 men, 3 with each time 10&#xD;
      women) will be conducted in the elimination study arm, 12 in the control study arm (6&#xD;
      iterations involving 10 men and 6 iterations involving 10 women), at defined time points&#xD;
      (table 1), until data saturation has been reached.&#xD;
