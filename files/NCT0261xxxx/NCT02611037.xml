  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the transarterial chemoperfusion treatment&#xD;
      with cisplatin, methotrexate and gemcitabine is safe and effective in adults with malignant&#xD;
      pleural mesothelioma (MPM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, phase 2 study with a lead in safety cohort to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoperfusion treatment with cisplatin (35 mg/m2^),&#xD;
      methotrexate (100 mg/m^2) and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m^2) in patients with unresectable MPM.&#xD;
      During the lead in phase of the study, 3 patients will be treated with 50% reduced dose of&#xD;
      methotrexate (50 mg/m^2) and regular doses of cisplatin (35 mg/m^2 body surface area (BSA))&#xD;
      and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m^2 BSA).&#xD;

             the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The predominant burden of disease lies in an arterial distribution which is accessible&#xD;
             for transarterial chemoperfusion treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All baseline laboratory requirements will be assessed and should be obtained within 14&#xD;
             days of first treatment. Screening laboratory values must be met..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women participate in the study must be surgically sterile, post-menopausal, or women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation and after for a certain amount of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, imaging studies, and other requirements of the study.&#xD;

             for a reason other than treatment failure or adverse event(s) of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those&#xD;
             who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4&#xD;
             weeks earlier. Recovery means resolution to at least Grade 1 toxicity if there was no&#xD;
             baseline toxicity or less than or equal to the patient's baseline value.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Patients with other extrapleural&#xD;
             metastases are included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to cisplatin, methotrexate, gemcitabine or other agents used during the&#xD;

             reaction. Patients with history of moderate and severe allergic reaction to iodinated&#xD;
             contrast media or patients with history of mild allergic reaction to iodinated&#xD;
             contrast media despite adequate premedication will undergo angiogram using carbon&#xD;
             dioxide or a gadolinium based contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, presence of other&#xD;
             malignancy, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
