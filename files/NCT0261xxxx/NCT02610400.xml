    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomised controlled trial with factorial study design comparing the&#xD;
      impact of reactive community-based malaria interventions: 1) presumptive treatment (or rfMDA,&#xD;
      reactive focal mass drug administration) versus reactive case detection (RACD), and 2)&#xD;
      reactive IRS (indoor residual spraying) versus control on the incidence of malaria in&#xD;
      Namibia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, many countries, including Namibia, have experienced reductions in malaria&#xD;
      transmission in association with the scale-up of effective interventions and are now moving&#xD;
      towards malaria elimination. In malaria control, the goal is to reduce the clinical burden of&#xD;
      malaria. In malaria elimination, the aim is to interrupt transmission, and it becomes&#xD;
      necessary to address not only symptomatic malaria, but also asymptomatic infections that&#xD;
      contribute to transmission. Since malaria transmission is highly geographically&#xD;
      heterogeneous, elimination activities should target hot spots, or areas where the risk of&#xD;
      future infection is highest. Hence, in the transition from control to elimination, enhanced&#xD;
      surveillance and response is necessary to target hot spots with interventions to interrupt&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reactive case detection (RACD), active surveillance in communities around passively detected&#xD;
      cases, is a recommended elimination strategy to identify secondary cases and hot spots.&#xD;
      However, RACD can be labour-, time-, and cost- intensive, and misses people who are absent&#xD;
      during screening or refuse to have their blood drawn. Furthermore, both microscopy and rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic tests (RDTs) utilized in RACD have shortcomings, for instance, the suboptimal&#xD;
      sensitivity of RDTs for low parasite density and non-falciparum infections. Polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR) offers markedly improved sensitivity over RDTs but requires hours of&#xD;
      processing time, sophisticated technical skills, and expensive equipment. Given these&#xD;
      limitations, presumptive treatment may be a more feasible and effective strategy to reduce&#xD;
      and interrupt transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reactive focal mass drug administration (rfMDA), a form of presumptive treatment, has been&#xD;
      used successfully in China to overcome some of the weaknesses of RACD. rfMDA targets&#xD;
      remaining reservoirs of infection in low endemic settings by treating everyone at high risk&#xD;
      (subjects residing around an index case), rather than rely on RDT results, which have been&#xD;
      shown to miss infections. In a low transmission setting such as Namibia, only a small&#xD;
      proportion of the populations is at high risk of infection, therefore, only a small number of&#xD;
      people need to be targeted (perhaps 20-50 people). Additional indoor residual spraying (IRS)&#xD;
      targeted to homes in high risk locations can also be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rfMDA is a promising strategy, but evidence does not yet exist to prove its efficacy in&#xD;
      Africa. Questions remain about where to target rfMDA, what drugs to use, and whether drugs&#xD;
      should be used alone or in combination with additional vector control. For rfMDA to be most&#xD;
      successful, it is necessary to kill parasites in the human as well as the vector population&#xD;
      of the target area. However, one challenge of pre-transmission season IRS is that it is&#xD;
      difficult to predict where future infections will occur. A reactive approach, in conjunction&#xD;
      with the pre-transmission approach, will ensure coverage of effective vector control in the&#xD;
      highest risk areas. Further, if there is unknown resistance to the insecticide used during&#xD;
      pre-transmission season, the subsequent reactive use of a different, and presumably effective&#xD;
      insecticide, will provide better protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will utilise a cluster randomized controlled study design to&#xD;
      evaluate rfMDA in response to a passively identified index case and compare it to RACD. The&#xD;
      investigators will study each intervention (rfMDA, RACD) both with and without additional&#xD;
      focal insecticide spraying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      56 enumeration areas (EAs) within catchment areas of 11 study health facilities will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of four intervention arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RACD only&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RACD with RAVC&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rfMDA only&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. rfMDA with RAVC&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rapid reporting surveillance system will capture confirmed, passively identified cases at&#xD;
      all study health facilities, and those cases will trigger an intervention by the study team&#xD;
      if located in one of the study EAs.&#xD;
