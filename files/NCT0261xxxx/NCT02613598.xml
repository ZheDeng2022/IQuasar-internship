  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      of Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) in combination with standard dose Bortezomib (Velcade) in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin (HL) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of relapsed and refractory Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma remains difficult. To&#xD;
      improve upon current efficacy rates new treatment modalities are needed. Currently modalities&#xD;
      based upon targeting specific pathway and molecular receptors have made the greatest impact&#xD;
      in the outcomes of refractory patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The JAK-Stat pathway and NF-κB are two such targets that have been shown to fuel the&#xD;
      malignant transformation and growth of both myeloma and lymphoma. Blockade of key points in&#xD;
      these molecular pathways has the potential of halting the pro-survival machinery. Combined&#xD;
      inhibition of JAK/Stat and NF-κB may lead to synergistic effects as well as possibly&#xD;
      mitigating some of the mechanisms of resistance to either agent. In this proposal, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to utilize the JAK/Stat inhibitor ruxolitinib (Jakafi) and proteasome&#xD;
      inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) to target two major pathways of malignant transformation in&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this research study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      of Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) in combination with standard dose Bortezomib (Velcade) in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin (HL) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Michigan will enroll 24 subjects. Eligible subjects will have&#xD;
      histologically or cytologically confirmed Hodgkin and Non-hodgkin's Lymphoma excluding&#xD;
      Burkitt, CLL and lymphoblastic lymphoma that is considered to have relapsed or to be&#xD;
      refractory to primary chemotherapy. Any prior exposure to Jakafi is excluded.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women and men with histologically or cytologically confirmed Hodgkin and all NHL&#xD;
             subtypes excluding Burkitt, CLL and lymphoblastic lymphoma that is considered to have&#xD;
             relapsed or to be refractory to primary chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No previous anti-cancer therapy for at least 21 days and recovered from all treatment&#xD;
             related toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation is allowed prior to study start (1st dose of study medication) if at&#xD;
             least 21 days have elapsed since prior large-field radiation therapy and all treatment&#xD;
             related toxicity has resolved. At least 3 months must have passed since&#xD;
             radio-immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior auto graft is allowed prior to study start (1st dose of study medication), but&#xD;
             patients must be at least 3 months from date of stem cell infusion and have recovered&#xD;
             to ≤ grade 1 toxicities related to this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior allogeneic transplants is allowed prior to study start (1st dose of study&#xD;
             medication), but patients must be at least 6 months from date of stem cell infusion,&#xD;
             have no evidence of GVHD, be off all immunosuppressant medications, and have recovered&#xD;
             to ≤ grade 1 toxicities related to this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) Performance status ≤2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy without treatment &gt; 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function as defined as:&#xD;
             Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/μl, Platelets ≥75,000/μl, (50,000/ μl if due to BM&#xD;
             involvement), Direct bilirubin&lt; 1.5 mg/dl, unless due to Gilbert's or secondary to&#xD;
             hemolysis, AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and/or ALT (Alanine Transaminase) &lt;2.5 X&#xD;
             institutional upper limit of normal unless due to lymphomatous involvement of the&#xD;
             liver, Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl and/or creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min using the&#xD;
             Cockcroft-Gault formula and no symptoms attributable to grade 2 or higher peripheral&#xD;
             neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
             partner is participating in this study, she should inform the treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently receiving any other experimental agent, patients must have&#xD;
             stopped other experimental agents at least 21 days prior to 1st study dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior to exposure to Jakafi&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because&#xD;
             of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Jakafi or Velcade.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because Jakafi is&#xD;
             inhibitor of the Jak-1 and Jak-2 kinases with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Jakafi,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with Jakafi. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Jakafi. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow&#xD;
             suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia), Burkitt or lymphoblastic lymphoma&#xD;
             are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who would be required to concurrently take ruxolitinib in conjunction with a&#xD;
             strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and have a platelet count less than 100,000 are ineligible&#xD;
             for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who are required to take a strong CYP3A4 inducer are excluded from the study.&#xD;
