      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the loss of motor response to supraorbital&#xD;
      pressure can be an alternative to that of jaw thrust to predict optimal condition for&#xD;
      laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty children (ASA I-II), aged 2 to 10 years, scheduled to receive general anesthesia that&#xD;
      required LMA insertion were randomized to receive either supraorbital pressure (SOP) (n = 25)&#xD;
      or jaw thrust (JT) (n = 25), after the loss of verbal response and body movements with a&#xD;
      standard anesthetic. When motor response to the study intervention was absent, the LMA was&#xD;
      inserted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators enrolled fifty consecutive participants (aged one to ten years) with ASA&#xD;
      physical status I or II scheduled to receive general anesthesia for various surgical&#xD;
      procedures. Participants were allowed to have solid food, formula milk or cow's milk up to&#xD;
      six hours, mother's milk up to four hours and clear fluid up to two hours before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On reaching the pre-operative room, when the participant was still on mothers lap or on the&#xD;
      bed baseline measurements of non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), pulse oximeter (SpO2) and&#xD;
      electrocardiography (ECG) were taken. Fifteen minutes before induction of anesthesia, all&#xD;
      participants were premedicated with ketamine, either 4mg/kg intramuscularly into the gluteal&#xD;
      region with 26 G needle, or with 0.5mg/kg intravenously if intravenous (IV) cannula was in&#xD;
      place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Devices for ECG, SpO2 and NIBP monitoring were attached to the participant after arrival in&#xD;
      the operating room. IV line was then inserted, if not already present. Pre-oxygenation was&#xD;
      done with 100% oxygen using an appropriate size face mask. Anesthesia was induced with IV&#xD;
      fentanyl (2mcg/kg), and propofol (2-4 mg/kg) until the loss of response to verbal contact or&#xD;
      loss of eyelash reflex. Spontaneous ventilation was first assisted and then controlled&#xD;
      manually to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure of 33-40 mmHg. No&#xD;
      neuromuscular blocking agent was administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supraorbital pressure or jaw thrust was performed after loss of response to verbal contact,&#xD;
      or absence of body movements. In group SOP, supraorbital pressure was applied over the&#xD;
      supraorbital notch for five seconds. In group JT, the jaw thrust was applied gently by&#xD;
      lifting the angles of the mandible vertically upward for five seconds. An IV bolus dose of&#xD;
      propofol (1 mg/kg) was added if there was a motor response to the supraorbital pressure or&#xD;
      the jaw thrust and the test was repeated after ten seconds. A second bolus dose of propofol&#xD;
      was repeated if positive motor response was still present. A negative physical response to&#xD;
      the test was considered as the end point of induction to perform LMA insertion. A classic LMA&#xD;
      of appropriate size was inserted immediately. Ease of insertion and mouth opening,&#xD;
      development of coughing, swallowing, movement, laryngospasm, or gross purposeful movements&#xD;
      during or within one minute of LMA insertion and additional dosage of propofol if required&#xD;
      were recorded. The LMA insertion was considered unsuccessful if LMA could not be inserted&#xD;
      after administration of second bolus dose of propofol. The number of attempts and the&#xD;
      insertion conditions were recorded using a six variable three points scoring system(31)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mouth opening: 1 - Full, 2 - Partial (not ideal but permits easy opening of mouth), 3 -&#xD;
           Nil&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ease of LMA insertion 1 - Easy, 2 - Difficult, 3 - Impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Swallowing: 1 - Nil, 2 - Mild, 3 - Severe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coughing: 1 - Nil, 2 - Mild, 3 - Severe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laryngospasm: 1 - Nil, 2 - Mild (relieved by positive pressure ventilation), 3 - Severe&#xD;
           (desaturation&lt;90%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Movement: 1 - Nil, 2 - Mild (Finger) (some movement but did not affect positioning of&#xD;
           LMA), 3 - Severe (Arm/leg) (holding of LMA was required and additional dose of induction&#xD;
           agent given).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators summed all the five scores to give a LMA insertion condition summed score&#xD;
      which ranged from 0 to 12, a lower summed score indicating more favourable LMA insertion&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

&#xD;
      LMA cuff was inflated with air and was connected to Jackson-Rees modification of the Ayre's&#xD;
      T-piece. Effective ventilation was determined by observing chest wall and bag movement,&#xD;
      auscultation, and capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure, heart rate and percentage saturation of oxygen were recorded in the&#xD;
      pre-operative room, immediately after LMA insertion, five, ten and fifteen minutes after LMA&#xD;
      insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. After the closure of skin incision,&#xD;
      removal of LMA was done when the participant was still in deep plane of anesthesia.&#xD;
