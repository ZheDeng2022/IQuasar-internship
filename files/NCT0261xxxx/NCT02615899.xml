      Background Balance impairment is a key factor contributing to falls in older adults.&#xD;
      Conceptually, clinicians may be able to prescribe targeted exercises if specific impairments&#xD;
      can be identified. Objective Our objective was to use a model of balance subsystems to&#xD;
      identify balance impairments and demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted (matched)&#xD;
      exercises to improve balance and reduce fall risk in community-dwelling older adults. The&#xD;
      investigators used the Balance Evaluation System Test (BESTest) as the model because it&#xD;
      categorizes balance into 6 subsystems. Design Randomized, partially blinded,&#xD;
      pretest-post-test clinical trial consisting of 2 Phases: 1. A comparison between&#xD;
      impairment-matched exercises and a control, and 2. A comparison between impairment-matched&#xD;
      and mismatched exercises. Setting Senior independent living community. Participants Adult&#xD;
      volunteers (n = 40; aged 74-94) recruited as sample of convenience who met the criteria.&#xD;
      Participants (n = 20) identified with impairment in the biomechanical (BC) constraints&#xD;
      subsystem and participants (n = 20) with impairment in anticipatory postural adjustment (APA)&#xD;
      subsystem were enrolled and randomized into 2 subgroups (matched and control/delayed&#xD;
      mismatched; n = 10 each subgroup). Intervention Phase 1: Participants in the matched subgroup&#xD;
      received a 6-week exercise program matched to their impaired subsystem while the mismatched&#xD;
      subgroup served as control. Phase 2: Following the delay, participants in the mismatched&#xD;
      group received a 6-week exercise program mismatched to their impairment. Measurements Primary&#xD;
      outcome variables were scores on the targeted subsystem (BC, APA), BESTest total, Berg&#xD;
      Balance Scale, and fear of falling measure. Quality of life was a secondary outcome. Outcome&#xD;
      data were collected by the tester blind to pretest scores and group allocation. Results The&#xD;
      matched exercise subgroups demonstrated both statistical and clinical improvement in all&#xD;
      outcome variables compared to the control; and showed greater improvement in balance&#xD;
      impairments compared to the mismatched subgroup, but not in fall risk reduction. Limitations&#xD;
      The therapist who administered the pretest knew the subgroup assignment and implemented the&#xD;
      exercises. Conclusions Results provide preliminary evidence that using a balance assessment&#xD;
      model to identify impairments in the BC and APA subsystems and prescribing targeted exercises&#xD;
      reduces these balance impairments for older adults and may warrant future studies.&#xD;
