  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to test the effectiveness and acceptability of internet-delivered&#xD;
      treatment for depression, anxiety and stress in university students. These data will inform&#xD;
      the methods for a future randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will establish an initial estimate of the effectiveness of these online&#xD;
      interventions for students in terms of within-group effect sizes associated with changes in&#xD;
      depression, anxiety and stress from pre to post-intervention and follow-up. These data will&#xD;
      be used to estimate the sample size for a future trial to ensure that the study is&#xD;
      sufficiently powered. A conservative estimate using the 90% upper confidence limit will be&#xD;
      used to inform the sample size calculation of the definitive RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability of the intervention to participants will be assessed using data on usage and&#xD;
      engagement with the intervention (e.g. percentage of participants completing each module,&#xD;
      average number of log ins, average time spent per session and total time spent on the&#xD;
      program). These data are acquired through the online SilverCloud system. Satisfaction with&#xD;
      will be assessed through the use of a post-intervention questionnaire on satisfaction with&#xD;
      accessing and using an online delivery format for treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression, anxiety and stress are among the primary causes of disease rates worldwide and&#xD;
      are the most prevalent mental health problems in the U.S. Each is associated with significant&#xD;
      economic, personal, intrapersonal and societal losses including lower quality of life and&#xD;
      increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression, Anxiety and Stress in Students:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression and anxiety are also the most prevalent mental health problems among the student&#xD;
      population. In the 2010 American College Health Survey, 48% of college and university&#xD;
      students reported feeling overwhelming anxiety at least once in the previous year. Thirty-one&#xD;
      percent reported feeling so depressed it was difficult to function at least once in the&#xD;
      previous 12 months. More recently, University counseling and mental health services have&#xD;
      reported an increase in the number of clients seeking services and in yearly visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The college years can be a highly stressful time in students' lives. This is particularly&#xD;
      true of the period of transition to college as students are learning to cope with increased&#xD;
      academic pressures. Students are at a developmental stage when newfound stressors can promote&#xD;
      the onset of mental health difficulties. In addition to academic stress, international&#xD;
      students can experience significant sociocultural adjustment demands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young adults between 17 and 25 years of age are reported to be at greater risk of developing&#xD;
      a serious mental illness than individuals in other age groups. Although early diagnosis of&#xD;
      mental disorders can be difficult, delayed diagnosis can often lead to treatment resistance&#xD;
      and poorer longer-term outcomes. In addition, underachievement or failure at this point in&#xD;
      life can cause long-term setbacks to individuals' self-esteem and future progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treating Depression, Anxiety and Stress:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression, anxiety and stress disorders can each be treated effectively using medications;&#xD;
      however, after completing a course of this type of treatment the chances of relapse are high,&#xD;
      and equally successful psychological therapies are often preferred. Of these,&#xD;
      cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is the most widely researched and CBT is recognized as the&#xD;
      leading choice of treatment for depression and anxiety in terms of post-treatment&#xD;
      improvements, maintaining progress, and preventing relapse. CBT also is effective for stress&#xD;
      management. CBT is comprised of a variety of cognitive and behavioral approaches, each&#xD;
      concerned with changing distressing thoughts and beliefs. Treatment is often comprised of&#xD;
      self-monitoring and thought recording, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a global scale, a significant number of individuals in need of treatment receive no&#xD;
      medical diagnosis nor do they seek treatment. The worldwide treatment gap between those&#xD;
      needing treatment for depression compared to those receiving treatment has been estimated at&#xD;
      56%; the gap in treatment for anxiety disorders has been estimated at 46%. Several factors&#xD;
      prevent people from accessing treatment, such as waiting lists, lack of motivation, negative&#xD;
      attitudes about treatment, and costs. Of those willing to seek treatment, many encounter a&#xD;
      lack of trained professionals or are placed on a waiting list. Although students can often&#xD;
      obtain mental health services on campus, many campuses have limited services or have wait&#xD;
      lists for services because of the high demand. A survey of U.S. students with mental health&#xD;
      problems revealed that common barriers to seeking services, even if they were available, were&#xD;
      stigma, lack of time/accessibility, and wait lists. Internet-delivered interventions are one&#xD;
      way to address these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet-Delivered CBT (iCBT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet-delivered CBT programs are specially designed for the treatment of specific&#xD;
      disorders, and can be either clinician-guided or self-administered. When such interventions&#xD;
      are used in the UK, 6-8 sessions is the recommended length of treatment. Many studies provide&#xD;
      support for the utility and effectiveness of internet-delivered treatments for depression,&#xD;
      anxiety and stress . Those with the additional feature of human support tend to produce&#xD;
      greater results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies also have assessed the efficacy of online interventions for depression,&#xD;
      stress, and anxiety for college students. Recent reviews of these studies have found evidence&#xD;
      for the efficacy of these online interventions. However, most of these studies do not assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of the interventions in the context of existing service delivery systems.&#xD;
      Rather, many are RCTs assessing efficacy in convenience samples of students (e.g., Psychology&#xD;
      majors). The current trial seeks to investigate the effectiveness and acceptability of&#xD;
      internet-delivered interventions among university students seeking services and the&#xD;
      procedures needed to incorporate these interventions into mental health delivery in U.S.&#xD;
      universities. Additionally, it hopes to support and extend existing empirical evidence for&#xD;
      SilverCloud programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      University of Minnesota:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is a public research university located in&#xD;
      Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota established in 1851. It is the oldest and largest campus&#xD;
      within the University of Minnesota system and has the sixth-largest main campus student body&#xD;
      in the United States, with 57,600 students. The university is organized into 19 colleges and&#xD;
      schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through three units at the University of Minnesota-Twin&#xD;
      Cities. The first is Student Counseling Services (SCS) which provides free short-term&#xD;
      counseling to undergraduate and graduate students. The second is Boynton Mental Health Clinic&#xD;
      (BMHC) which also provides short term psychological services to full-time students at the&#xD;
      University of Minnesota. Unlike SCS, BMHC also has psychiatrists on staff and is affiliated&#xD;
      with the university health service. Finally, the investigators will recruit participants&#xD;
      through the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) office which provides&#xD;
      counseling to foreign national students on campus.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Students who currently are in face-to-face therapy at UCCS or BHS will be excluded.&#xD;
