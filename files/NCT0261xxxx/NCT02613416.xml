      This is a non-randomized phase II trial of denosumab at 120 mg subcutaneous injection monthly&#xD;
      in pre- and post-menopausal women diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer who are currently&#xD;
      not receiving anticancer treatment with hormonal therapies, chemotherapy, or radiation. All&#xD;
      patients will undergo quantification of breast density by MRI at baseline and after 6 months&#xD;
      on denosumab. Because the therapeutic agent is an injectable drug, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a single arm study with both pre- and post-treatment measurements to determine the&#xD;
      extent of variability in breast density over time and a placebo treatment period or group&#xD;
      will not be utilized. This is an investigator initiated trial and Amgen (SPONSOR) will&#xD;
      provide the trial drug denosumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the results of several studies footnoted in this protocol, there is now&#xD;
      convincing evidence that extensive areas of radiographically-dense tissue in the breast is an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for the development of breast cancer. Here, the investigators&#xD;
      postulate that it is RANK ligand that mediates the association between breast density and&#xD;
      risk of breast cancer for which progesterone is one of several factors that influence the&#xD;
      availability of RANK ligand in mammary tissue to promote or sustain higher breast density. As&#xD;
      such, the investigators hypothesize that inhibition of RANK ligand with the anti-RANK ligand&#xD;
      antibody therapeutic agent denosumab will decrease breast density; a risk factor for breast&#xD;
      cancer development. The investigators will test the primary hypothesis that RANK ligand&#xD;
      inhibition by denosumab (Xgeva) given 120mg monthly to pre- and post-menopausal breast cancer&#xD;
      patients will significantly decrease breast density over 6 months. Breast density will be&#xD;
      assessed by magnetic resonance fat water imaging (MR-FW) of the breast. At the beginning of&#xD;
      the study participants will be measured for a change in breast density by MRI between&#xD;
      baseline 1 and baseline 2 (end of 3 months observation period). All patients will then&#xD;
      receive 6 months of 120 mg denosumab subcutaneously every month with repeat MR imaging to&#xD;
      obtain measurements after 6 months on denosumab. All participants will be asked to provide an&#xD;
      optional core needle breast biopsy sample at baseline and after 6 months on denosumab.&#xD;
