    <textblock>
      This Phase II, open-label, three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will investigate the&#xD;
      effects of 12 weeks of aerobic exercise vs. 12 weeks of resistance exercise vs. usual care in&#xD;
      men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer to determine the safety,&#xD;
      feasibility, and tolerance of exercise; quality of life indicators, and a prognostic score.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a PI-initiated, randomized clinical trial of 12 weeks of aerobic exercise vs. 12&#xD;
      weeks of resistance exercise vs. usual care among 39 men with metastatic castration resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Eligible men will be randomized with equal probability to one of the three&#xD;
      regimens. All patients will receive a packet of print material on diet, exercise, and&#xD;
      psycho-social support appropriately geared for men with late stage disease at the end of the&#xD;
      trial. The aerobic exercise arm (N=13) will receive a 3 day/week remotely-supervised exercise&#xD;
      regimen that includes high-intensity interval training and continuous vigorous intensity&#xD;
      aerobic exercise training. The resistance exercise arm (N=13) will receive a 3 day/week&#xD;
      remotely-supervised resistance exercise regimen incorporating different volumes and loads.&#xD;
      Men in the control arm (N=13) will be asked to continue their typical exercise practices for&#xD;
      12 weeks. Subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires, physical function and strength&#xD;
      tests, body measurements, and collection of blood specimen at baseline and 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of participants reporting use of opiate pain medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The World Health Organization (WHO) Analgesic Ladder will be used to record the use of pain medication by participants at each visit. The three main principles of the WHO analgesic ladder are: &quot;By the clock, by the mouth, by the ladder&quot;. &quot;By the clock&quot; means to maintain freedom from pain, drugs should be given &quot;by the clock&quot; or &quot;around the clock&quot; rather than only &quot;on demand&quot; (i.e. PRN). &quot;By the mouth&quot; means the oral route is usually the preferred route for ease of use in a variety of care settings. &quot;By the ladder&quot; means opiates have been given if pain occurs there should be prompt administration of drugs in the following order: non-opiates (e. g. acetaminophen), as necessary, mild opiates (e. g. codeine), and then strong opiates (e. g. morphine or hydromorphone) until the patient is free of pain. Use of pain medication using the WHO analgesic ladder will be completed at baseline and 3 months.</description>

    <measure>Change in Scores on the Brief-Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF is a 9-item questionnaire used to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on activities of daily living over a recall period of 24 hours. Pain severity is assessed across four sub-scales; 'worst pain', 'least pain', 'average pain' and 'current pain'. A pain score for each subscale is presented separately. Scales are rated on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 = no pain; 10 = pain as bad as one can imagine). A composite score for pain severity is calculated as the mean of the four severity items. Question 9 comprises a 7-item interference scale. Questions assess the level to which pain interferes with general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others and sleep on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 = does not interfere; 10 = completely interferes). Mean interference score will be calculated as an average of the seven subparts of question 9 where at least four of the seven items are completed. Participants will complete the assessment at baseline and 3 months.</description>

    <measure>Change in objective physical strength over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Strength assessments will comprise one repetition maximum (RM)chest press, leg press and seated row. One method will be chosen as the primary method, based on the availability of resistance equipment however, alternative methods will be used, if not appropriate for the patient based on the location of metastasis. The 1-RM is defined as the highest load that can be lifted through full range of movement at one time. Participant suitability to perform each test will be dependent on the site of the metastasis. The decision to either complete or not complete 1 repetition maximum (RM) testing at each site will be decided by the exercise physiologist / therapist performing the test in consultation with the participant's treating physician using an exercise checklist completed by the physician, prior to any testing, which will indicate which exercises to avoid. Any exercise during testing which causes a participant issues will be stopped.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression + 1 day. Participants who have not progressed at the time of the analysis will be censored on the last date of contact. Participants with no data after randomization will be censored on the day of randomization + 1 day. An intent-to-treat approach will be used to analyze PFS. Data on PFS will be obtained through review of patient medical records at end of study, 1 year, and 2 years. Progression will be determined by the treating physician, and may include any of the following, based on Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG 3) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria</description>
