    <textblock>
      Fruits and vegetables are an important source of many different phytochemicals that may&#xD;
      affect health and accurate dietary assessement tools to quantitate dietary intake are&#xD;
      essential. This study will evaluate the correlation of dietary carotenoid intake estimated&#xD;
      from two common and one novel food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with estimated carotenoid&#xD;
      intake from 3 day diet records as well as measured blood and skin concentrations of&#xD;
      carotenoids. This study will be conducted in healthy adults. These tools may be effective in&#xD;
      estimating the level of these compounds in an average diet.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the relationship between estimated intakes of dietary carotenoids using three&#xD;
      different FFQ's and comparing them with estimated carotenoid intake from 3 day diet records&#xD;
      and blood and skin measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete the Willett FFQ, the Fred Hutchinson FFQ, and the newly developed&#xD;
      Clinton Carotenoid Assessment Tool (CCAT), in random order over a 3 to 4-month period of time&#xD;
      with 4-6 weeks between each visit. Prior to each visit, participants also complete a 3-day&#xD;
      diet record, a daily sun exposure diary, and a 3-day activity record. Blood samples are&#xD;
      collected for plasma carotenoid assessment and and skin carotenoid content is assessed using&#xD;
      a resonance Raman spectroscopy.&#xD;

    <description>After consenting to participate in this study, participants will visit the Clinical Research Center (CRC) on 3 occasions. One of the three FFQ's will be completed at each visit and there will be 4 to 6 weeks between visits. Participants will also complete a blood draw and assessment of skin carotenoids at this CRC visit. Prior to each visit, participants will complete a 3-day diet record, a daily sun exposure diary, and a 3-day activity record.</description>
