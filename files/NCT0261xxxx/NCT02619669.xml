  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millennium has developed TAK-228, which is a novel, highly selective, orally bioavailable&#xD;
      adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase referred&#xD;
      to as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). TAK-228 (formerly INK128 or MLN0128)&#xD;
      targets 2 distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. TAK-228 selectively and&#xD;
      potently inhibits mTOR kinase (IC50 = 1.1 nM), inhibits mTORC1/2 signaling, and prevents&#xD;
      cellular proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mTOR complex (mTORC) is an important therapeutic target that is generally stable (i.e.,&#xD;
      low tendency to mutate) and is a key intracellular point of convergence for a number of&#xD;
      cellular signaling pathways. Inhibiting mTOR may inhibit abnormal cell proliferation, tumor&#xD;
      angiogenesis, and abnormal cellular metabolism, thus providing the rationale for mTOR&#xD;
      inhibitors as potential agents in the treatment of a number of indications including solid&#xD;
      tumor and hematological malignancies, as either monotherapy or in combination with other&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents. Like rapamycin, several newly approved rapalogs (temsirolimus and&#xD;
      everolimus) are specific and allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, and only partially inhibit&#xD;
      mTORC1 signaling pathways. They do not directly inhibit mTORC2, which has shown to be an&#xD;
      emerging target in cancer research. TAK-228 was developed to address the incomplete&#xD;
      inhibition of the mTOR pathway by rapalogs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will have a research biopsy and baseline blood and urine studies done&#xD;
      within two weeks prior to start of study treatment. Subjects will then be treated with&#xD;
      TAK-228 for 10 days, and a repeat biopsy and pharmacokinetics will be done on day 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will then be treated with the combination of TAK-228 and letrozole for an&#xD;
      additional 110 days, before undergoing resection of the primary tumor. Subjects will be&#xD;
      treated at the recommended Phase II dose of TAK-228 of 3 mg once daily, and a dose&#xD;
      deescalation to 2 mg daily will be performed if dose-limiting toxicity is seen in 1/3 or more&#xD;
      of the subjects at the first dose level. The maximum tolerated dose cohort will be expanded&#xD;
      to include six to ten subjects.&#xD;
