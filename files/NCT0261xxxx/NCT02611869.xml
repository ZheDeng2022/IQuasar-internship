  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      120 consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF, slated for PV isolation, will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to RF or cryoballoon ablation (in a 1:2 allocation scheme). Real-time 3D&#xD;
      echocardiography (RT3DE) will be performed before the ablation procedure and 1 month&#xD;
      post-ablation. The RT3DE datasets will be stored digitally and quantitative analyses will be&#xD;
      performed off-line at a core echo laboratory. Quantification of left atrial volumes will be&#xD;
      performed and left atrial functional quantification will be performed by calculating the&#xD;
      following indices: Left atrial ejection fraction, Active atrial emptying fraction, Passive&#xD;
      atrial emptying fraction, Atrial expansion index. All patients will be hospitalized for 48&#xD;
      hours post-ablation. Blood samples will be obtained at 12-hour intervals to measure troponin&#xD;
      T with a high-sensitivity assay, as well as other biochemical parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve 2 study interventions, cryoballoon and RF ablation, to which patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned (in a 2:1 allocation scheme). Randomization will be performed&#xD;
      centrally using a random number generator - the following short script will be used in R&#xD;
      language to generate a random sequence with a 2:1 probability of assignment to cryoballoon&#xD;
      versus RF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient's randomization will be known only to the operator of the ablation procedure&#xD;
      (and of course to the investigator who will attend the procedure to record procedural&#xD;
      parameters, complications, outcome etc.). All personnel involved in patient follow-up and&#xD;
      echo data analysis will be blinded to patient randomization (patient records will be&#xD;
      accompanied by a randomization number corresponding to a masked randomization list kept in&#xD;
      digital form at the coordinating center, which will be unlocked after completion of the last&#xD;
      patient's follow-up). The Ablation Procedure Data Sheet will be filed separately from other&#xD;
      CRF documents to maintain blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RF ablation Antral PV isolation will be performed in all patients randomized to RF&#xD;
           ablation, without additional ablation of extrapulmonary sites, with the exception of&#xD;
           individuals with documented typical atrial flutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An irrigated radiofrequency ablation catheter will be used to perform ablation, with the&#xD;
           aid of electroanatomical mapping (Carto 3, Biosense Webster), following a single&#xD;
           transeptal puncture. Pulmonary vein potentials will be recorded with a circular mapping&#xD;
           catheter (Lasso® NAV eco, Biosense Webster) before, during and following antral ablation&#xD;
           (the default strategy will be to create two ablation lines, around the two ipsilateral&#xD;
           pulmonary veins, unless left atrial anatomy dictates another approach). The endpoint of&#xD;
           the ablation procedure will be entrance and exit block in all pulmonary veins. A waiting&#xD;
           time of 20-30 minutes will be observed after initial pulmonary vein isolation and&#xD;
           further ablation will be performed in case of reconduction between the veins and the&#xD;
           atrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with a history of documented sustained typical atrial flutter before the&#xD;
           ablation procedure will additionally undergo cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. Use of&#xD;
           additional modalities, including intracardiac ultrasound and integration of computed&#xD;
           tomography or magnetic resonance imaging anatomical data of the left atrium, will be&#xD;
           left to the discretion of the operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Repeat ablation will not be allowed over the 3-month follow-up of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cryoablation A single big cryoballoon approach, using a 28-mm cryoballoon (Arctic Front&#xD;
           Advance™ Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) will be employed.&#xD;
           The cryoballoon catheter will be introduced into the left atrium, following a single&#xD;
           transeptal puncture, through a 12F FlexCath steerable sheath (Medtronic), constantly&#xD;
           flushed with heparinized saline. A circular mapping catheter (Achieve, Medtronic) will&#xD;
           be advanced through the cryoballoon to the PV orifice and positioned as proximally as&#xD;
           possible inside the vessel to record the PV potentials at baseline and monitor the&#xD;
           isolation procedure in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cryoballoon will be inflated and advanced to the ostium of each PV. The quality of&#xD;
      vascular occlusion will be ascertained by injection of diluted contrast material into the PV.&#xD;
      Once the best occlusion is obtained, cryothermal energy will be applied for 240 seconds, as&#xD;
      recommended by the manufacturer. An additional application of energy will be systematically&#xD;
      delivered after PV isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before ablation of the right-sided PVs, a quadripolar electrode catheter will be positioned&#xD;
      in the superior vena cava to constantly pace the right phrenic nerve at a 2-sec cycle length&#xD;
      during freezing. In case of cessation or weakening of diaphragmatic contraction, freezing&#xD;
      will be immediately discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Real-time 3D echocardiographic evaluation of left atrial dimensions and function&#xD;
      Real-time 3D echocardiography (RT3DE) will be performed before the ablation procedure and 1&#xD;
      month post-ablation, on iE33 machines (Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, Washington) equipped&#xD;
      with X3, a fully sampled matrix transducer. Apical full-volume data sets will be obtained&#xD;
      during end-expiratory apnea within 1 breath hold. The RT3DE datasets will be stored digitally&#xD;
      and quantitative analyses will be performed off-line at a core echo laboratory (at a&#xD;
      different site than the recruiting center) by personnel blinded as to each patient's&#xD;
      treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantification of left atrial volumes will be performed using the semiautomated contour&#xD;
      tracing algorithm, marking 5 atrial reference points: 4 at the anterior, inferior, lateral,&#xD;
      and septal parts of the atrial dome and 1 at the level of the mitral annulus. Volumes will be&#xD;
      measured at three time points during the cardiac cycle: (a) LAmax at end-systole, just before&#xD;
      mitral valve opening, (b) LAmin at end-diastole, just before mitral valve closure; and (c)&#xD;
      LApreA obtained at the time of the P wave on the surface electrocardiogram. Indexing to body&#xD;
      surface area will be applied, as recommended.11&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left atrial functional quantification will be performed by calculating the following indices:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left atrial ejection fraction: LAEF = [(LAmax - LAmin)/LAmax] * 100%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active atrial emptying fraction: LAactive = [(LApreA - LAmin)/LApreA] * 100%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive atrial emptying fraction: LApassive = [(LAmax - LApreA)/LAmax] * 100%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrial expansion index: LAreservoir = [(LAmax - LAmin)/LAmin] * 100%. Echocardiographic&#xD;
           evaluation will also include all standard 2D and Doppler measurements. Measurements of&#xD;
           particular interest will be: left ventricular ejection fraction (modified Simpson's&#xD;
           rule), mitral E/e' velocity ratio (lateral aspect of the mitral annulus),&#xD;
           semi-qualitative assessment of mitral regurgitation (grade 0 to 3: no regurgitation,&#xD;
           mild, moderate, severe), right ventricular systolic pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           v) Other study procedures Before the index procedure, in a run-in visit, eligibility&#xD;
           criteria will be reviewed and a 24-hour Holter recording will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be hospitalized for 48 hours post-ablation. Blood samples will be obtained&#xD;
      as 12-hour intervals to measure troponin T with a high-sensitivity assay, as well as other&#xD;
      biochemical parameters (blood samples will be centrifuged and plasma aliquots will be kept at&#xD;
      -80oC until measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return for 2 visits after the ablation procedure: a 1-month visit for RT3DE,&#xD;
      symptom review, assessment for potential complications, clinical and electrocardiographic&#xD;
      evaluation, and a 24-h Holter recording, and a 3-month visit for symptom review, assessment&#xD;
      for potential complications, clinical and electrocardiographic evaluation, and a 24-h Holter&#xD;
      recording.&#xD;
