      Background: Thrombosis may be crucial in driving the progression of fibrosis in chronic liver&#xD;
      disease (CLD). The potential role of platelets and platelet activation in this process is&#xD;
      unclear. Platelets participate in inflammation by secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      which may advance hepatic fibrosis. Hepatitis B virus transgenic mice, developed&#xD;
      significantly smaller necroinflammatory foci and their serum ALT levels were 80% lower, if&#xD;
      they were pre-treated with anti-platelet antibodies. Sinusoidal aggregation of activated&#xD;
      platelets also occurs in chronic hepatitis C in humans. It may contribute to thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      observed in CLD. Platelet activation is generally believed to be compromised in CLD. However,&#xD;
      there is data suggesting that CLD may even be associated with an enhancement of platelet&#xD;
      activation. Measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) constitutes the most&#xD;
      common method for estimation of portal venous pressure. HVPG is significantly correlated with&#xD;
      histological indices of CLD progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HVPG as a marker for advancement of hepatic fibrosis and progression of CLD is&#xD;
           associated with an increase in platelet activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Platelet activation and function is not generally compromised in CLD. Comparison of&#xD;
           platelet function in CLD to a control group of healthy volunteers is intended to clarify&#xD;
           whether CLD leads to a manifest platelet dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Study design is observational. 100 patients with CLD of various origins (viral,&#xD;
      alcoholic, cholestatic) scheduled for routine HVPG measurement will be enrolled. 30 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will donate blood as a control group. Platelet function and activation will be&#xD;
      evaluated by multiple electrode aggregometry (primary outcome variable area under the curve&#xD;
      (AUC). Plasma levels of P-selectin (ELISA), PFA (Platelet Function Analyzer) 100™ parameters&#xD;
      (EPI-CT and ADP-CT), percentage of P-selectin, GPIIb/IIIa, thrombin receptor positive&#xD;
      platelets after stimulation (flow-cytometry) will constitute secondary outcome parameters.&#xD;
      Plasmatic coagulation will be evaluated by rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM). Platelet&#xD;
      count and routine coagulation parameters will be monitored. HVPG measurement by hepatic vein&#xD;
      catheterization and patient blood sampling will be carried out via the internal jugular vein.&#xD;
      Blood sampling in volunteers will be performed via the antecubital vein&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale: If higher levels of platelet activation are associated with increased HVPGs,&#xD;
      this would provide an insight into the pathogenesis of CLD. It would also point toward a&#xD;
      possible benefit of anti-platelet therapy in CLD. Verification of platelet dysfunction in CLD&#xD;
      is relevant to clinical practice in anaesthesiology and intensive care as procedures are&#xD;
      often postponed in CLD-patients for fear of bleeding complications. CLD patients may also&#xD;
      receive prophylactic platelet concentrates prior to interventions which is costly, fraught&#xD;
      with risk of bacterial infection and may be unnecessary in the absence of platelet&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
