      This two-year study will evaluate the feasibility of an exercise training augmentation for&#xD;
      cognitive training intervention to improve memory performance in Veterans with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI). This is a two-phased trial: 1) an exercise phase&#xD;
      and 2) a cognitive training program. The exercise phase will be an aquatic based exercise&#xD;
      program. A combination of exercise and cognitive training programs designed for persons&#xD;
      without cognitive impairment have significantly improved memory more than other single&#xD;
      intervention groups (exercise only, cognitive training only) and given the success of&#xD;
      combination training programs with healthy older adults, it is important to adapt these&#xD;
      programs for persons beginning to exhibit clinically significant memory problems, such as&#xD;
      those with aMCI.&#xD;

      The primary research question of the proposed study is this: Is a combination water-based&#xD;
      physical exercise + cognitive training program for older Veterans with amnestic Mild&#xD;
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) feasible? The primary aims of the proposed research are: 1)&#xD;
      demonstrate adequate recruitment and retention rates; 2) refinement of inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria; and 3) further refine the combination waterbased physical exercise + cognitive&#xD;
      training (WATER+CT) intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These aims will be tested in a two-phase clinical trial with a single group design: 1)&#xD;
      exercise training phase and 2) a cognitive training phase. The exercise training phase&#xD;
      consists of a water-based physical exercise program that emphasizes cardiovascular fitness&#xD;
      and strength training through a combination of non-weight bearing exercises that include&#xD;
      land-based stretching and water-based activities. This 2-year pilot project will include 50&#xD;
      Veterans diagnosed with amnestic MCI age 50-90. The exercise component consists of a&#xD;
      six-month water-based exercise program followed by a four-week cognitive training program.&#xD;
      For the first two months of the water-based exercise program, Veterans will come to&#xD;
      thrice-weekly group sessions at Aquatic Therapy Center at the VA Palo Alto Health Care&#xD;
      System. This will transition to a self-paced exercise program for the remaining four months.&#xD;
      After completion of the exercise program, Veterans will begin classroom-based cognitive&#xD;
      training at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS). The cognitive training is based on&#xD;
      an efficacious cognitive program that is structured around two components, pre-training and&#xD;
      mnemonic training, both of which have been used successfully in persons with aMCI.&#xD;
      Assessments of adherence will be administered throughout treatment and measures of&#xD;
      feasibility will be completed post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a variety of neuropsychological measures taping into areas of&#xD;
      cognition such as attention, executive functioning, and memory. To study possible predictors&#xD;
      of treatment response, the investigators will also collect biological (cardiovascular&#xD;
      functioning and brain derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] plasma levels) and genetic data&#xD;
      (APOE and BDNF genotypes) from these participants. The investigators hope to provide initial&#xD;
      evidence of the feasibility of a waterbased exercise training augmentation for cognitive&#xD;
      training thus laying the groundwork for full-scale clinical trials targeting the lessening of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment in persons with amnestic MCI by non-pharmacological means.&#xD;

    <description>This is an 8 month long two phase intervention. The first phase consists of 6 months of thrice weekly pool based physical activity occurring at the Palo Alto VA Health Care System. After completion of the 6 month long water based physical activity, participants transition to a ten session cognitive training program at the Palo Alto VA. The cognitive training classes are approximately two hours in length and will be spread over ten sessions across 4 weeks.</description>
