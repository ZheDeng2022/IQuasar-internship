  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, it has been shown that B cells could also have regulatory functions through the&#xD;
      secretion of interleukin 10 (IL-10). They are called the B regulatory cells (Breg). In the&#xD;
      mouse model the most commonly used of rheumatoid arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA),&#xD;
      the transfer Breg helps prevent the development of CIA and cure established arthritis. The&#xD;
      investigators have recently shown that Breg were decreased in patients with RA compared to&#xD;
      controls and that the rate of Breg was inversely correlated with disease activity and&#xD;
      autoantibody. These results thus suggest that the lack of IL-10 secretion by B cells plays an&#xD;
      important role in the pathophysiology of RA. Nevertheless, in humans, the Breg remain poorly&#xD;
      understood. The main objective of this project is to better characterize the B capable of&#xD;
      producing IL-10 both in subjects with RA and controls. Understanding which induces the&#xD;
      secretion of IL-10 by B could allow to consider new therapeutic approaches in autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases, including in RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore aim to identify nutrient transporters, chemokine receptors, genes&#xD;
      and surface proteins differentially expressed between Breg and other B cells in patients with&#xD;
      RA and in controls.&#xD;

      Rational: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common inflammatory joint disease, is often&#xD;
      associated with irreversible joint destruction and can involve the prognosis of patients. If&#xD;
      treatments to stabilize the disease are now available, research continues to try to&#xD;
      permanently cure the disease. It is well established that the B cells have a pathogenic role&#xD;
      in RA. More recently, it has been shown that B cells could also have regulatory functions&#xD;
      through the secretion of interleukin 10 (IL-10). They are called the B regulatory cells&#xD;
      (Breg). In the mouse model the most commonly used of rheumatoid arthritis, collagen-induced&#xD;
      arthritis (CIA), the transfer Breg helps prevent the development of CIA and cure established&#xD;
      arthritis. The investigators have recently shown that Breg were decreased in patients with RA&#xD;
      compared to controls and that the rate of Breg was inversely correlated with disease activity&#xD;
      and autoantibody levels. These results thus suggest that the lack of IL-10 secretion by B&#xD;
      cells plays an important role in the pathophysiology of RA. Nevertheless, in humans, the Breg&#xD;
      remain poorly understood. The project's main objective is to better characterize the B&#xD;
      capable of producing IL-10 both in subjects with RA and controls. Understanding which induces&#xD;
      the secretion of IL-10 by B could allow to consider new therapeutic approaches in autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases, including in RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal: To identify nutrient transporters and chemokine receptors differentially expressed&#xD;
      between Breg and other B cells in patients with RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify genes and surface proteins differentially expressed between Breg and other B&#xD;
           Lymphocytes (BL) in patients with RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify nutrient transporters, chemokine receptors, genes and surface proteins&#xD;
           differentially expressed between Breg and other BL in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the expression of nutrient transporters, chemokine receptors, genes and&#xD;
           surface proteins between Breg Breg controls and subjects with RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Cross-sectional study involving bicentric rheumatology services in Montpellier and&#xD;
      Nîmes to recruitment; our research team at the Translational IGMM Nîmes and immunology&#xD;
      laboratory for biological analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RA: patient meets the criteria ACR (American College of Rheumatology) -EULAR (European&#xD;
           League Against Rheumatism) 2010, naïve and biotherapy with corticosteroids less than 10&#xD;
           mg / day, stable for at least a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Controls: matched for age and sex to RA patients, with no systemic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main: the average flow cytometry fluorescence intensity nutrient carriers and the&#xD;
           percentage of BL expressing the different chemokine receptors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: transcriptome analysis and proteomics surface with cytometric confirmation of&#xD;
           protein expression of RNA and proteins identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects: 50 controls and 50 RA patients (10 each for each of the 3 methods of&#xD;
      comparison Breg / B IL10- and 10 each for each of the two stages of validation). Each patient&#xD;
      will have a visit. The expected study duration is 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Comparing ratios B + IL-10 / IL-10-B between RA patients and controls&#xD;
      by Student or Mann-Whitney tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results and Prospects: This project will allow us to better define and understand&#xD;
      the Breg in patients with RA and in controls. If the investigators can find specific&#xD;
      extracellular markers for Breg, this will simplify the further study of these cells.&#xD;
      Understanding allowing BL becoming regulator and this explains the lack of IL-10 by the BL in&#xD;
      RA could open new therapeutic perspectives.&#xD;
