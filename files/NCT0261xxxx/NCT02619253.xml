    <textblock>
      Primary objective: To assess the early signals for anti-tumor activity (i.e. objective&#xD;
      response rate, progression-free survival) of pembrolizumab in combination with vorinostat in&#xD;
      patients with advanced prostate, renal or urothelial cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: (1) To evaluate the overall safety profile of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with vorinostat; (2) To assess the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with vorinostat in patients with advanced prostate, renal or urothelial cell&#xD;
      carcinoma in order to select the recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D); (3) To characterize immune&#xD;
      cell subsets, and miRs in tumor and/or blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/Ib, open-label, safety, and pharmacodynamics study of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with vorinostat in patients with advanced prostrate, renal or urothelial cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. This clinical study will be composed of a Dose Finding Phase and an Expansion&#xD;
      Phase. The Dose Finding Phase will estimate the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) in patients&#xD;
      with advanced renal and urothelial cell carcinoma patients. The Dose Finding Phase will lead&#xD;
      to the identification of an Expansion Test Dose for pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      vorinostat. The Expansion Test Dose will be the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) (i.e. the&#xD;
      highest tested dose that is declared safe and tolerable by the Investigators and Sponsor).&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with oral vorinostat every day for 14 days, and with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      at the fixed dose of 200 mg IV. Each cycle is every 21 days. Two dose levels of vorinostat&#xD;
      will be tested in 2-patient cohorts according to the 3 + 3 standard design (100 mg and 200&#xD;
      mg). 200 mg dose represents 50% of the recommended vorinostat dose as single agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Dose Finding Phase (Combination Phase), the starting dose level of vorinostat will be&#xD;
      100 mg by mouth (PO) every day for 14 days, with 7 days break. The first dose level will have&#xD;
      a minimum of 3 patients treated (unless the first 2 patients experience dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs) before the 3rd patient is enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the RP2D is identified, the Dose Expansion Phase will be opened. During the Dose&#xD;
      Expansion Phase, the study will have a run-in phase with sequential single-agents and then&#xD;
      the combination phase. The run-in phase may be waived at the investigator's discretion. The&#xD;
      reason for the run-in phase during dose expansion is to obtain data on the immunomodulatory&#xD;
      effects of vorinostat separately from pembrolizumab. Forty-five patients with prior&#xD;
      treatments will be enrolled in three expansion cohorts: 15 anti-PD1 naive renal and&#xD;
      urothelial patients 15 anti-PD1 resistant renal and urothelial patients (defined as patients&#xD;
      with transient clinical response or without clinical response to prior immune-checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition), and 15 patients with androgen-sensitive or castration-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
      The prostate cohort has been added in an amendment during the Dose Expansion Phase, and&#xD;
      therefore, will not be part of the Dose Finding Phase.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Subjects with a history of diabetes mellitus must have HgbA1c level of &lt;8.5% upon&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
