      Objective: To determine the clinical variables that influence aqueous outflow facility (Co)&#xD;
      and intraocular pressure (IOP) in uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uveitic glaucoma is potentially blinding and occurs in 17-46% of chronic uveitis patients.&#xD;
      Uveitic activity causes fluctuating IOP due to decreased Co, increased uveoscleral outflow or&#xD;
      decreased aqueous production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the risk factors for high IOP and low Co in uveitis Hypothesis:&#xD;
      Decreased Co and increased IOP will occur with increasing anterior chamber (AC) flare, AC&#xD;
      cells, degree of synechial angle closure, increased duration of disease, higher uveitis&#xD;
      activity and increasing steroid use Specific Aim 2: To determine prospectively the effect of&#xD;
      AC flare on Co and IOP in &quot;quiescent&quot; uveitis Hypothesis: AC flare even in the absence of AC&#xD;
      cells will cause progressive decline in Co.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this proof of concept study, thirty consecutive patients with acute or chronic&#xD;
      uveitis will be recruited from the uveitis clinic. Ten patients with &quot;quiescent&quot; uveitis (no&#xD;
      AC cells) will be recruited for the prospective arm and followed every 2-3 months for 3&#xD;
      visits. Co will be measured using 2-minute pneumatonometer tonography. The effect of risk&#xD;
      factors on IOP and Co in uveitis will be studied using generalized linear modelling&#xD;
      techniques. These risk factors include AC flare (using the laser flare meter), AC cells,&#xD;
      degree of angle closure (by gonioscopy), duration of disease, disease activity and&#xD;
      corticosteroid use within the last year. In the prospective study, the patients will be&#xD;
      divided into subgroups with low flare (&lt; 20ph/ms) and high flare (â‰¥ 20 ph/msec) and the&#xD;
      change in Co and IOP will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: This will be the first study to systematically analyze the risk factors for decrease&#xD;
      in Co and increase in IOP in uveitis and to prospectively evaluate the effect of AC flare on&#xD;
      Co. Proof that AC flare can damage the trabecular meshwork will corroborate previous&#xD;
      experimental evidence and change the paradigm of uveitis treatment. Knowledge of the risk&#xD;
      factors that affect Co and IOP will aid in identifying patients that may need escalation of&#xD;
      their uveitis or glaucoma treatment to prevent optic nerve damage.&#xD;

      Prospective subjects will be identified from the patient population pool in the Uveitis&#xD;
      Clinic at the Truhlsen Eye Institute, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Department of&#xD;
      Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures below will be performed at the first visit in all patients and at the&#xD;
      patient's return visit in the 10 patients recruited for the prospective arm of the study&#xD;
      (upto a maximum of 3 follow up visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be extracted from the chart. These are obtained routinely as&#xD;
      part of routine clinical care through history and ocular examination by slit lamp examination&#xD;
      and applanation tonometry for intraocular pressure measurements.&#xD;

        9. Gonioscopy: documentation of degree of synechial angle closure&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Slit lamp examination and documentation of parameters of ocular inflammation: cells,&#xD;
           flare, posterior synechaie extent and clock hours&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Fundus examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing done solely for the study will involve:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tonographic Outflow facility: will be assessed using the pneumatonography. A two (2)&#xD;
           minute tonography protocol will be used. The subject will be in a supine position as the&#xD;
           weighted pneumatonometer probe is placed on the eye measuring aqueous outflow. The&#xD;
           patient may need another drop of proparacaine prior to the test if the previous&#xD;
           anesthesia is insufficient. This procedure should take 3-4 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aqueous flare meter: The anterior chamber flare will be measured in a non-invasive way&#xD;
           using the AC flare meter. This process will take 2-3 minutes and does not require any&#xD;
           additional topical anesthesia.&#xD;
