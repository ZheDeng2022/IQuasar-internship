    <textblock>
      This is a RCT study, aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of the Everyday Life in Balance&#xD;
      (BEL) intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention: The BEL was developed on the basis of previous research on lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions made by the current research group and other researchers . It is a group-based&#xD;
      programme (5-8 participants) with 12 sessions, one session a week, and 2 booster sessions&#xD;
      with two-week intervals. The themes for the group sessions are, e.g., activity balance,&#xD;
      healthy living, work-related activities, and social activities. Each session contains a main&#xD;
      group activity and a home assignment to be completed between sessions. The main group&#xD;
      activity starts with analysing the present situation and proceeds with identifying desired&#xD;
      goals and finding strategies for how to reach them. The home assignment is aimed at testing&#xD;
      one of the proposed strategies. Self-analysis, setting goals, finding strategies and&#xD;
      evaluating the outcome of tested strategies form a process for each session, but also for the&#xD;
      BEL intervention as a whole. After completed BEL, the participants will have developed an&#xD;
      ability to reflect on their own situation and have strategies for changing their everyday&#xD;
      life in a desired direction, such that they feel their everyday life has a satisfactory&#xD;
      balance between rest and work, secluded and social activities, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BEL intervention is led by occupational therapists. They take part in a specifically&#xD;
      developed two-day education and follow the BEL manual [7]. They also participate in a&#xD;
      web-based discussion forum where they can seek support from the researchers and/ or other BEL&#xD;
      occupational therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of units and participants: On the basis of blocks of four units, two are randomized&#xD;
      to the BEL and two to the control condition, which is care as usual (CAU) and generally means&#xD;
      standard occupational therapy. Occupational therapists in the units select participants based&#xD;
      on the patients' needs for a lifestyle intervention and being likely to benefit from a group&#xD;
      intervention. The same criteria are applied in the BEL units and the CAU units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis: The investigators desire 120 participants from each group. This will also&#xD;
      allow for analysis of subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments: A number of self-report instruments tapping satisfaction with daily occupations,&#xD;
      well-being, perceived worker role, social interaction, recovery etc., will be used,&#xD;
      supplemented with qualitative interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: As the intervention starts, the attendees answer questionnaires about their&#xD;
      personal situation regarding. Subsequently, the BEL is implemented in the units randomised to&#xD;
      that condition. After 16 weeks of intervention (including the booster sessions), the&#xD;
      measurements are repeated. A follow-up is then made after another six months. The same data&#xD;
      collection is made at corresponding time points in the comparison units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional qualitative interviews are made in the intervention units, with strategically&#xD;
      selected participants (attendees and staff) to get a deeper picture of the intervention&#xD;
      process and its implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the research project is finished, the comparison units will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      go through the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: The primary analysis concerns differences in outcomes between the BEL group and the&#xD;
      CAU group. Analyses of the qualitative interviews, by means of grounded theory, will yield a&#xD;
      more detailed description of the BEL and its implications, as perceived by both attendees and&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current state of the study: The project is in the initial phase and the first units were&#xD;
      recruited in late 2012. At present, 24 units have been randomized to either condition. The&#xD;
      second measurements (after completed BEL) have just been completed and follow-ups will&#xD;
      continue until mid-2016, as will qualitative interviews. Analysing data and reporting results&#xD;
      will continue until late 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By including 60 participants in each group the studies will be able to detect a medium effect&#xD;
      size (ES=0.4), which would be a difference of clinical and practical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, gender and being of foreign origin will be considered as covariates, along with other&#xD;
      socioeconomic factors such as family situation, educational level and money at one's&#xD;
      disposal. Other factors that should be considered are the participant's functional status and&#xD;
      diagnoses. Research has not shown that diagnosis per se plays any substantial role in the&#xD;
      outcome of psychiatric rehabilitation, for the course of a psychiatric disability or for how&#xD;
      people perceive their everyday occupations, but this should be investigated further because&#xD;
      the evidence is inconclusive. Level of functioning, level of psychopathology, and negative&#xD;
      symptoms have indeed been shown to be of importance for outcomes of psychiatric&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Therefore, this project will also control for factors related to diagnosis&#xD;
      and functional status.&#xD;

      Balancing Everyday Life - evaluation of the effectiveness of an activity-based lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention for people with psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a RCT study, evaluating the effectiveness of the Everyday Life in Balance (BEL)&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention: The BEL was developed on the basis of previous research on lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions made by the current research group and other researchers. Other important&#xD;
      sources of inspiration were descriptive studies on everyday life among people with severe&#xD;
      mental illness. It is a group-based programme (5-8 participants) with 12 sessions, one&#xD;
      session a week, and 2 booster sessions with two-week intervals. The themes for the group&#xD;
      sessions are, e.g., activity balance, motivation, healthy living, work-related activities,&#xD;
      leisure and social activities. Each session contains a brief educational section, a main&#xD;
      group activity and a home assignment to be completed between sessions. The main group&#xD;
      activity starts with analysing the present situation and proceeds with identifying desired&#xD;
      goals and finding strategies for how to reach them. The home assignment is aimed at testing&#xD;
      one of the proposed strategies. The next-coming session starts with looking back at the home&#xD;
      assignment, and depending on the outcome, goals may need to be revised. Self-analysis,&#xD;
      setting goals, finding strategies and evaluating the outcome of tested strategies form a&#xD;
      process for each session, but also for the BEL intervention as a whole. After completed BEL,&#xD;
      the participants will have developed an ability to reflect on their own situation and have&#xD;
      strategies for changing their everyday life in a desired direction, such that they feel their&#xD;
      everyday life has a satisfactory balance between rest and work, secluded and social&#xD;
      activities, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BEL intervention is led by occupational therapists. They take part in a specifically&#xD;
      developed two-day education and follow the BEL manual. They also participate in a web-based&#xD;
      discussion forum where they can seek support from the researchers and/ or other BEL&#xD;
      occupational therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of units and participants: Units in both county council-based psychiatry&#xD;
      (outpatient units within general psychiatry and psychosis care) and community-based activity&#xD;
      centers (CBACs) in four counties in south Sweden have been invited. Cluster randomization is&#xD;
      used to assign the units to the BEL or the control condition. On the basis of blocks of four&#xD;
      units, two are randomized to the BEL and two to the control condition, which is care as usual&#xD;
      (CAU). CAU generally means standard occupational therapy. Four categories of participants&#xD;
      will be recruited: a) BEL participants from county-council-based psychiatry; b) BEL&#xD;
      participants from community-based psychiatry; c) CAU participants from county-council-based&#xD;
      psychiatry; and d) CAU participants from community-based psychiatry. Occupational therapists&#xD;
      in the units select participants based on the patients' needs for a lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      and being likely to benefit from a group intervention. The same criteria are applied in the&#xD;
      BEL units and the CAU units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis: The investigators based the power calculation on the Satisfaction with Daily&#xD;
      Occupations (SDO) scale. A previous study found a mean difference of 0.5 points on the SDO&#xD;
      between groups of people with mental illness who had varying structure to their everyday&#xD;
      life. Based on the means and standard deviations from that study, the analysis pointed to 41&#xD;
      participants in each condition as the desired sample size to detect a difference on the SDO&#xD;
      of 0.5 with 80% power at p&lt;0.05. The investigators still desire 60 participants from each&#xD;
      group (a - d above) since no solid base for a power calculation exists in the field. In all&#xD;
      240 participants are thus sought, 60+60 receiving the BEL and 60-60 receiving CAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following instruments are used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rosenberg's self-esteem scale: Positive and negative attitudes towards the self; Global&#xD;
      Assessment of Functioning (GAF): Symptom severity and psychosocial functioning; Satisfaction&#xD;
      with Daily Occupations and Balance (SDO-B): Satisfaction with everyday occupation and&#xD;
      occupational balance; Occupational Value with pre-defined items (OVal-pd): Perceived value&#xD;
      with daily occupation; Pearlin's Mastery Scale: Self-mastery; Medical Outcomes Short Form&#xD;
      (SF-36) (1st item): Self-rated Health; Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life&#xD;
      (MANSA): Quality of life; Interview Schedule for Social Interaction (ISSI): The social&#xD;
      network; Worker Role Self-assessment (WRS): Attitudes and expectations concerning the worker&#xD;
      role; &quot;Making decisions&quot;: Empowerment; Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ): Satisfaction&#xD;
      with the intervention; Estimating Perceived Meaning in Day Centers (EPM-DC): Characteristics&#xD;
      of day centers; Questionnaire of Personal Recovery (QPR): Recovery from mental illness;&#xD;
      Fidelity scale: Fidelity to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, consequences of the intervention will be reflected in qualitative interviews&#xD;
      with users and staff. Another important part of the data collection will be to make a&#xD;
      detailed description of the CAU provided in the comparison units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: As the intervention starts, the attendees answer questionnaires about their&#xD;
      personal situation regarding satisfaction with daily occupations, well-being, perceived&#xD;
      worker role, social interaction, recovery etc. Subsequently, the BEL is implemented in the&#xD;
      units randomised to that condition. After 16 weeks of intervention (including the booster&#xD;
      sessions), the measurements are repeated. A follow-up is then made after another six months.&#xD;
      The same data collection is made at corresponding time points in the comparison units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional qualitative interviews are made in the intervention units, with strategically&#xD;
      selected participants (attendees and staff) to get a deeper picture of the intervention&#xD;
      process and its implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the research project is finished, the comparison units will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      go through the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: The primary analysis concerns differences in outcomes between the intervention and&#xD;
      the control group (a+b versus c+d above), at the unit level (characteristics of the CBACs)&#xD;
      and the individual level (perceptions of worker role, satisfaction, well-being etc.), and the&#xD;
      stability of such outcomes. The sample size will also allow for comparison between&#xD;
      community-based and county-council-based BEL. Since measuring characteristics of CBACs is not&#xD;
      of relevance for county council-based psychiatry, the comparison at the unit level will only&#xD;
      concern community-based psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of the qualitative interviews, by means of grounded theory [10], will yield a more&#xD;
      detailed description of the BEL and its implications, as perceived by both attendees and&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current state of the study: The project is in the initial phase and the first units were&#xD;
      recruited in late 2012. At present, 24 units have been randomized to either condition. The&#xD;
      second measurements (after completed BEL) have just been completed and follow-ups will&#xD;
      continue until mid-2016, as will qualitative interviews. Analysing data and reporting results&#xD;
      will continue until late 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological considerations By including 60 participants in each group the studies will be&#xD;
      able to detect a medium effect size (ES=0.4), which would be a difference of clinical and&#xD;
      practical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-rating instruments are used and it is important to consider whether these produce&#xD;
      reliable data when used with people with SMI, particularly since many in the target group&#xD;
      have cognitive problems. However, research has shown that self-ratings of psychological&#xD;
      factors were valid and reliable among people with schizophrenia, also those with a poor&#xD;
      insight into their mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, gender and being of foreign origin will be considered as covariates, along with other&#xD;
      socioeconomic factors such as family situation, educational level and money at one's&#xD;
      disposal. Other factors that should be considered are the participant's functional status and&#xD;
      diagnoses. Research has not shown that diagnosis per se plays any substantial role in the&#xD;
      outcome of psychiatric rehabilitation, for the course of a psychiatric disability or for how&#xD;
      people perceive their everyday occupations, but this should be investigated further because&#xD;
      the evidence is inconclusive. Level of functioning, level of psychopathology, and negative&#xD;
      symptoms have indeed been shown to be of importance for outcomes of psychiatric&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Therefore, this project will also control for factors related to diagnosis&#xD;
      and functional status.&#xD;
