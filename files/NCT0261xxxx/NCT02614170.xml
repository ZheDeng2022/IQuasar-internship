      The study objectives are described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtain matched serum, plasma [(K2 EDTA, Sodium Heparin (NaH), Lithium Heparin (LiH)] and&#xD;
           urine specimens collected from a minimum of 50 healthy subjects. Specimens will be used&#xD;
           to determine a reference range for C-peptide and insulin assays, used as an aid in the&#xD;
           assessment of C-peptide and insulin in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtain serum and urine specimens collected from a minimum of an additional 200 healthy&#xD;
           subjects. Specimens will be used to determine a reference range for C-peptide and&#xD;
           insulin assays, used as an aid in the assessment of C-peptide and insulin in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To store any remaining specimens for use in future assay development and to evaluate as&#xD;
           yet undetermined assays for the development of IVDs, including additional C-peptide or&#xD;
           insulin assays.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary object of this study is to obtain a series of blood and urine specimens from&#xD;
      women and men who are healthy with no history of abnormal blood sugar levels. The specimens&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate new C-peptide and insulin assays (tests). Participants are being&#xD;
      asked to voluntarily take part in this study because they are a healthy individual without a&#xD;
      history of abnormal blood sugar levels.&#xD;

        A minimum of 250 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Healthy women and men greater&#xD;
        than or equal to 18 years of age having donated a single blood draw, a random urine&#xD;
        specimen, and a 24-hour urine collection specimen will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each site will evaluate and select patients for enrollment using the inclusion and&#xD;
        exclusion criteria listed below. Study subjects should be selected from all available&#xD;
        patients at the site. Each patient may be entered into the study only once.&#xD;
