  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)&#xD;
      patients with the combination of alpha-type-1-polarized dendritic cell (αDC1) vaccines and&#xD;
      tumor-selective chemokine modulation (CKM) will promote the infiltration of&#xD;
      vaccination-induced CD8+ CTLs to tumor lesions and subsequently tumor regression with&#xD;
      improved patient survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic colorectal cancer is a major health concern in the United States, and the second&#xD;
      leading cause of death due to cancer. The purpose of this trial is to see if the combination&#xD;
      of the study vaccine and drugs in patients with this disease can prevent the growth of cancer&#xD;
      and prevent new tumors from growing. The study drugs are a combination of celecoxib&#xD;
      (Celebrex®), Interferon-α2b (IFN), and rintatolimod (Ampligen®), or CKM.&#xD;
