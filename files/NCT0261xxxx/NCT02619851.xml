    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a Phase II controlled, parallel, open-label trial, designed to test&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of ALLO-ASC-DFU and conventional therapy in Deep Second-degree burn&#xD;
      wound subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALLO-ASC-DFU is a hydrogel sheet containing allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.&#xD;
      Adipose-derived stem cells have anti-inflammatory effect and release growth factors such as&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which can&#xD;
      enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide a new option in&#xD;
      treating Deep Second-degree burn wounds.&#xD;
