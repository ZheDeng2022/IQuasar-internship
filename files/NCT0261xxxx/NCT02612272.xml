      This study will compare the efficacy of intra-articular betamethasone injection to&#xD;
      intra-articular ketorolac injection for symptomatic treatment of knee osteoarthritis in an&#xD;
      equivalence study using a double-blinded, randomized, controlled design. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from orthopaedic clinics at St. Luke's University Health Network. A total of 448&#xD;
      patients will be recruited (224 in each group) to receive an administration of an&#xD;
      intra-articular betamethasone or ketorolac injection. The primary outcome is change in pain&#xD;
      as assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)&#xD;
      score. Secondary outcomes include Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOOS) and Knee&#xD;
      Outcome Survey - Activities of Daily Living (KOS-ADL) scores and physical exam findings.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses include repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (primary outcome)&#xD;
      and selected ANOVA and nonparametric tests as deemed appropriate (secondary outcomes), with p&#xD;
      &lt; .05 denoting significance for all comparisons, and no adjustment for multiple testing.&#xD;

      Introduction and Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Min et al. performed a double blind study comparing triamcinolone to ketorolac in a total of&#xD;
      32 patients with subacromial impingement syndrome and found improved outcomes in University&#xD;
      of California Los Angeles shoulder rating scale, improved active abduction, forward flexion&#xD;
      strength and patient satisfaction scores. Shortcomings of this study included short-term&#xD;
      follow up (4 weeks), lack of control of other forms of treatment of subacromial impingement&#xD;
      including physical therapy and injection without ultrasound which limits the ability to&#xD;
      determine the accuracy of injections. Many of the patients also had a lack of an MRI, thus&#xD;
      being unable to determine if the patients had an undiagnosed rotator cuff tear or other&#xD;
      pathology that may have influenced outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Karthikeyan et al. performed a similar trial analyzing tenoxicam (another non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medication) to methylprednisolone in 58 patients.Six weeks after injection,&#xD;
      Constant-Murley shoulder scores, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores were&#xD;
      significantly improved in the steroid group compared to tenoxicam injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oztuna et al. randomized thirty patients with grade II to III osteoarthritis with an effusion&#xD;
      to aspiration and oral tenoxicam for 10 days or aspiration and intra-articular tenoxicam. The&#xD;
      patients were followed at 2, 4 and 8 weeks and then at 3 month intervals. Patients with&#xD;
      intra-articular tenoxicam had significantly fewer effusions at 1 year and a more rapid relief&#xD;
      in joint pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlu et al analyzed 69 patients with knee arthritis and compared weekly injections of&#xD;
      tenoxicam for 3 weeks to PO tenoxicam for three weeks. They compared these two groups to&#xD;
      patients who received only physical therapy. No significant difference was found between oral&#xD;
      and intra-articular administration. Both oral and intra-articular tenoxicam had a significant&#xD;
      improvement on knee pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have noted safe intra-articular injection of ketorolac following knee&#xD;
      arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the findings of the investigations described above, this study will compare the&#xD;
      equivalence of intra-articular ketorolac injection to intra-articular betamethasone injection&#xD;
      for symptomatic treatment of knee osteoarthritis. In all of the studies reviewed above for&#xD;
      the study, the only complication that was listed was a syncopal episode that occurred with&#xD;
      corticosteroid administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions and Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the efficacy of intra-articular betamethasone injection to&#xD;
      intra-articular ketorolac injection for symptomatic treatment of knee osteoarthritis. The&#xD;
      null hypothesis of this study is that intra-articular ketorolac injection is not equivalent&#xD;
      to intra-articular corticosteroid in decreasing patient symptoms as measured by Western&#xD;
      Ontario and McMaster University Index (WOMAC) scores (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include changes in KOOS and KOS-ADL scores and physical exam findings&#xD;
&#xD;
      If equivalence is proven, this study may provide a safer alternative medication compared to&#xD;
      betamethasone for intra-articular injections for osteoarthritic pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from all St. Luke's Orthopaedic Specialists (SLOS) offices where&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis is treated in associated with St. Luke's Health and University Network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be double-blinded, with two study arms: 1) 4cc of 1% lidocaine, 1cc of 0.9%&#xD;
      normal saline and 1cc (6 mg) of betamethasone; and 2) 2cc (60 mg) of ketorolac and 4cc of 1%&#xD;
      lidocaine. The medication will be prepared by a site-specific designee (essential personnel)&#xD;
      who has the appropriate, up-to-date HIPPA (Healkth insurance portability and Accountability&#xD;
      Act) and CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) training required and&#xD;
      prepares injections in the routine scope of SLOS practice. The contents of the injection will&#xD;
      be blinded to the investigators by covering the syringe with a white tape. The medication&#xD;
      will be generated at the time of patient enrollment at the office where the injection will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized by the following procedure. A spreadsheet will be generated with&#xD;
      study patient identifier numbers in numerical order (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). This spreadsheet will&#xD;
      be located on a password-protected database that can be continuously updated across the St.&#xD;
      Luke's Network by multiple study personnel at the same time. A random number generator&#xD;
      (http://randomizer.org) will be used to generate a series of binary numbers, either 0 or 1.&#xD;
      The number 0 will represent betamethasone, while the number 1 will represent ketorolac. This&#xD;
      number will then be attached to the study patient identifier number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient is determined to be eligible for enrollment into the study, their medical&#xD;
      record number will be entered into the password-protected spreadsheet database as the next&#xD;
      patient by a site-specific designee. At that point the site-specific designee will provide&#xD;
      the medication as described earlier to the injector. The injector and patient will remain&#xD;
      unaware as to the contents of the syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to injection, patients will receive the following study questionnaires: WOMAC, Knee&#xD;
      Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Physical Function Short Form (KOOS-PS), and Knee&#xD;
      Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADL). These study questionnaires were&#xD;
      created with Google Forms and be stored on the same spreadsheet as described earlier.&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to return the completed questionnaires to the office during an&#xD;
      office visit, by mail or fill them out online prior to study injection as well as 2 weeks, 1&#xD;
      month, 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' medical history will be taken and a clinical exam performed before the injection is&#xD;
      given. Demographic information, including body mass index (BMI), duration of disease, and&#xD;
      gender, will be obtained. Number and type of prior injections will also be documented if&#xD;
      known by the patient or documented in the patient's chart. The clinical exam will include&#xD;
      joint laxity, passive range of motion, presence of contractures, and tenderness on a scale of&#xD;
      0-3 (0 = no tenderness, 1 = patient winces and 3 = withdrawal). A three-view x-ray will also&#xD;
      be obtained if there is no recent image on file. Other treatment modalities, including&#xD;
      physical therapy, knee off-loading brace, acetaminophen, and current oral non-steroidal&#xD;
      treatment, will be noted. Finally, Kellgren-Lawrence Staging will be performed for the&#xD;
      medial, lateral and patellofemoral joints. This information will be documented in the&#xD;
      password-protected Google Spread Sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard superolateral injection site will be used during medication administration. This&#xD;
      site is considered to be the most accurate, especially among experienced hands. The&#xD;
      administration site will be cleaned with an ethanol swab and allowed to dry. An 18 gauge&#xD;
      needle connected to a syringe filled with the study drug will be administered. If there is no&#xD;
      effusion, a 22 gauge needle with 6cc of the study drug will be injected into the&#xD;
      administration site. All of the study drug will be administered in an intra-articular&#xD;
      fashion. The needle will be removed and a bandage applied. It will be documented if patient&#xD;
      felt relief immediately following injection. If the patient has a history of diabetes, they&#xD;
      will record morning fasting levels of glucose for 10 days following administration of study&#xD;
      drug and then documented into the password-protected Google spreadsheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be provided with the option for a home or outpatient physical therapy&#xD;
      regimen to follow for treatment of their arthritis. During follow up they will be asked about&#xD;
      compliance with therapy and will be documented into the password-protected Google&#xD;
      spreadsheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow up will performed at 1, 3 and 6 months after injection. A repeat examination&#xD;
      and questionnaire will be performed and documented at that time. The investigators will allow&#xD;
      patients to receive a second corticosteroid administration on or after the three month visit&#xD;
      as is current standard of care at St Luke's University Health Network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a recent MRI has been obtained within the year prior to or during treatment, this&#xD;
      information will also be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In knee osteoarthritis patients, common concerns with corticosteroid injections include skin&#xD;
      color changes, systemic elevations in blood sugar, and may place the patient at a higher risk&#xD;
      for infection in immunocompromised individuals. Typically injections of corticosteroids are&#xD;
      limited and often not given more than once every three months. Ketorolac is a non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medication that has a more limited mechanism of action and may be a safer&#xD;
      alternative to corticosteroid injections. Expected adverse effects of ketorolac include&#xD;
      localized bruising, compensatory effusion, minor localized bleeding, and a flare reaction.&#xD;
      Both of these medications are currently used by practitioners at St. Luke's University and&#xD;
      Health Network for osteoarthritis. The goal of this study is to directly compare ketorolac's&#xD;
      efficacy and safety to betamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation to assess equivalence was based on research by Unlu et al (2005) that&#xD;
      compared WOMAC scores in patients with knee osteoarthritis who received intra-articular&#xD;
      tenoxicam, oral tenoxicam or exercise only. Three was identified as the smallest clinically&#xD;
      meaningful margin to determine equivalence of intra-articular ketorolac to intra-articular&#xD;
      betamethasone as the active comparator. At α = 0.5 and β= 0.90, 204 patients per group&#xD;
      (N=408) are required. To guard against missing or otherwise unusable data, 10% was added to&#xD;
      that minimum sample size, for a total of 448 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome (change in WOMAC scores) will be analyzed via repeated measures analysis&#xD;
      of variance (ANOVA), and the secondary outcomes will be analyzed via selected ANOVA and&#xD;
      nonparametric tests as deemed appropriate. For all analyses, p &lt; .05 will denote statistical&#xD;
      significance, with no adjustment for the multiple comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for the Dissemination of Project Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be submitted to the annual residents' and fellows' Research Symposium at&#xD;
      the Bethlehem campus in the spring of 2016, as well as apply to present at appropriate&#xD;
      national meetings. This project will also be submitted to orthopaedic and related journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be registered with ClinicalTrials.Gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personnel Qualifications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary personnel responsible for the compilation and publication of the results would&#xD;
      include Gregory F Carolan, MD (principle investigator), Paul Morton, MD, Shane McGowan, MD&#xD;
      and John Anagostakos. Personnel administering the injections and obtaining consent will be&#xD;
      the physicians or physician assistants (listed in attached) of the St. Luke's Orthopaedic&#xD;
      Specialists group who, in the scope of their current practice, evaluate and treat patients&#xD;
      with knee osteoarthritis. All listed personnel will maintain appropriate CITI and HIPPA&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
