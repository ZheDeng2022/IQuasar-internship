  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3008348 is an investigational drug, being developed by GlaxoSmithKline Research and&#xD;
      Development Limited (the Sponsor, a pharmaceutical company based in the UK) for the treatment&#xD;
      of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a rare and poorly understood disease that&#xD;
      causes scarring of the lungs. The main symptoms are shortness of breath and a dry cough.&#xD;
      Symptoms generally worsen over time and in some subjects may prove fatal. The cause of IPF is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a First Time in Human, Phase 1, 3-part study which is being carried out on behalf of&#xD;
      the Sponsor by Quintiles. The primary purpose of Part A is to examine the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of single nebulised (a medicated spray) doses of GSK3008348 following inhalation&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers. The secondary objective is to determine how and at what rate the body&#xD;
      absorbs, distributes, breaksdown and eliminates the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parts B and C of this study will be in-patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). The&#xD;
      purpose of Part B and C is to examine the safety and tolerability, and how much of the drug&#xD;
      binds to its target, following single nebulised (a medicated spray) doses of GSK3008348&#xD;
      following inhalation in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to determine how and at what rate the bodies of these patients absorbs,&#xD;
      distributes, breaksdown and eliminates the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of Part A will be 65 - 87 days, Part B 62 days and Part C 43 days.&#xD;
