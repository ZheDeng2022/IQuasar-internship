  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the frequency of Tuffier's line overestimation (2 lumbar&#xD;
      levels or more) when the palpation method is used in obese parturients at term in the lateral&#xD;
      position compared to the sitting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The L3-L4 intervertebral space identified by the palpation method will be two&#xD;
      levels higher than the level determined by ultrasonography (US) more often in the lateral&#xD;
      than in the sitting position.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For years now, anesthesiologists have used anatomical landmarks to guide neuraxial anesthesia&#xD;
      and analgesia techniques in obstetric patients. Traditionally, Tuffier's line (intercristal&#xD;
      line) has been used as a reference and corresponds to a horizontal line drawn between the&#xD;
      upper part of the iliac crests that is thought to intersect the spine at the level of the L4&#xD;
      spinous process or the L4-L5 intervertebral space. However, many studies have found this&#xD;
      anatomical landmark to be unreliable reporting the Tuffier's line to intersect the spine at&#xD;
      levels ranging from the L3-L4 to L5-S1 intervertebral spaces. Regarding the obstetrical&#xD;
      population, the anatomical position of the Tuffier's line was found to be even higher&#xD;
      presumably due to the exaggerated lordosis of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuraxial techniques used for obstetrical anesthesia and analgesia include epidurals, spinals&#xD;
      and combined epidural-spinal (CSE) techniques. The correct identification of the&#xD;
      intervertebral space for neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia is very important especially if&#xD;
      using a spinal injection such as is done when performing a CSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuraxial techniques can be done in the sitting or the lying lateral position. When expecting&#xD;
      a more challenging technique, such as in an obese patient, anesthesiologists will usually&#xD;
      choose to perform the technique with patients in the sitting position. But the lateral&#xD;
      position is preferred in certain conditions such as in premature rupture of membranes where&#xD;
      there is a risk of umbilical cord prolapse, in women experiencing a vasovagal response caused&#xD;
      by the needle insertion or upon assuming the sitting position, or because of the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist's preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US-guided regional techniques are gaining popularity both for the general population as well&#xD;
      as for the pregnant women. It has been shown to be a more reliable tool than the palpation&#xD;
      method in identifying a specific lumbar intervertebral level. The use of US imaging for&#xD;
      neuraxial techniques in pregnant women has been shown to reduce the numbers of attempts,&#xD;
      improve the comfort of the patient during the procedure and increase the precision in&#xD;
      identifying the intervertebral space at which the technique is being performed. Obesity can&#xD;
      make regional techniques extremely challenging and US imaging becomes a valuable tool in this&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be positioned on an exam table in the sitting position for the first half&#xD;
      of the group and the lateral position for the other half. For the sitting position, the&#xD;
      participants will have both feet supported by a foot rest while being asked to round back by&#xD;
      lowering their head on their chest and pushing out their back to assume a fetal like&#xD;
      position. If necessary, the women may be asked to hold a pillow to improve their position to&#xD;
      get the ideal conditions for the palpation of the Tuffier's line and intervertebral spaces.&#xD;
      For the lateral position, the participants will be placed on the left lateral side with&#xD;
      flexion of the knees and hip, and flexion of the head and neck with a pillow supporting them.&#xD;
      Again, the women will be instructed to adopt a fetal position by rounding their back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An anesthesiologist who is assigned to the obstetrical floor for the day and who is not an&#xD;
      investigator in this study will be asked to perform the palpation method. He/she will proceed&#xD;
      with the identification of the Tuffier's line (upper part of the iliac crests) and determine&#xD;
      the level of intersection with the spine. This anatomical landmark will then be used to&#xD;
      estimate the location of the L3-L4 intervertebral space which is the space frequently chosen&#xD;
      to proceed to a neuraxial technique. Once the level is identified, it will be marked and&#xD;
      hidden under a hypoallergenic paper tape. The anesthesiologist will then leave the room while&#xD;
      the investigator trained in US imaging will proceed to the US exam of the spine specifically&#xD;
      aiming to identify the L3-L4 intervertebral space. Once located, the investigator will be&#xD;
      able to look at the skin mark made by the anesthesiologist and compare it to the level he/she&#xD;
      will have determined to be at the L3-L4 level by US imaging. The investigator will note if&#xD;
      the same level was identified and if not, which one was according to the US exam. The paper&#xD;
      tape will be reapplied over the lumbar spine to mask any anatomical marks (birth marks or&#xD;
      scars) that may influence the anesthesiologist who will be asked to step in again to proceed&#xD;
      to the palpation method in the other position, again marking the area which he/she thinks&#xD;
      corresponds to the L3-L4 space. US imaging will be repeated in the second position and the&#xD;
      level obtained by the exam will be compared to the one obtained by the palpation method in&#xD;
      the same way as the first position. The investigators expect the total time for the procedure&#xD;
      to be of 20-30 minutes. Participants will be asked to rate their level of comfort during the&#xD;
      procedure in both positions using a verbal rating scale from 0 to 10.&#xD;
