      The purpose of this study is to assess accuracy and reliability of the SPIDIMAN continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor system with regard to values as measured by Super GL and&#xD;
      compare these results with similar evaluations of the Medtronic MiniMed 640G system, the&#xD;
      Abbott FreeStyle Libre Flash Sensor and the DexCom G4 Platinum Sensor in patients with type 1&#xD;
      Diabetes.&#xD;

      The study is a single-center open-label study in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with&#xD;
      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy.&#xD;
      The study will include a total of 12 subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring using four different CGM systems in parallel will be performed throughout the study. Insulin therapy will be performed by the subjects themselves, as under daily life conditions. For the hypoglycaemia experiment an increased insulin bolus will be administered with meals (180% of the subject's calculated mealtime dose).</description>

    <description>The investigational intervention is CGM monitoring using four different CGM systems. Three of the four CGM devices which are used will be CGM systems which have received conformité européenne (CE) certification (Dexcom G4 Platinum, Medtronic MiniMed 640G system, Abbott FreeStyle Libre Flash). The SPIDIMAN sensor will be used for the first time in human subjects, does not yet have received CE certification and will be given an identifying label in addition to being labelled &quot;for investigative use only&quot;.</description>
