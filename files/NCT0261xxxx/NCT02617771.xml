  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to date, some clinical trial have evaluated the efficacy and safety of Vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation in children with RRI, with no conclusive information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators designed a prospective, single-blind, clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      whether oral supplementation with vitamin D from October to April reduces the global health&#xD;
      burden of recurrent respiratory tract infections in a primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was evaluated if Vitamin D supplementation during autumn and winter can&#xD;
      reduce the number of respiratory tract infections in children diagnosed with recurrent&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections the seasons before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives was the assessment of Vitamin D supplementation benefits on global&#xD;
      socioeconomic burden of recurrent respiratory tract infections in a primary care setting,&#xD;
      according to number of visits to the primary care paediatrician and use of antibiotics due to&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The University study personnel randomly allocated patients to receive, from October to March,&#xD;
      a Vitamin D oral supplementation (400 UI/die up to 12 month or 600 UI/die beyond 1 year) or&#xD;
      not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was performed using a free web-based service that offers random assignment;&#xD;
      patients were randomized considering gender and age class (up to 12 months; beyond 1 years).&#xD;
      The primary care practitioner was blinded regarding the study group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were: a) patients diagnosed the seasons before with: ≥ 6 respiratory&#xD;
      infections per annum OR ≥ 1 respiratory infections per month involving the upper airways from&#xD;
      September to April OR ≥ 3 respiratory infections per annum involving the lower airways. b)&#xD;
      patients with no findings suggestive of an immunodeficiency on history and physical&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the recruitment, parents recorded number and type of diagnosed respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections, number of ambulatory visits, use of antibiotics and duration of symptoms in a&#xD;
      structured diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTIs) comprehends diagnosis of acute otitis media, acute&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis and acute pharyngotonsillitis. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTIs)&#xD;
      comprehend diagnosis of bronchiolitis and pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parents had a close telephone contact to help them in the diary compilation. Adverse&#xD;
      events related to the protocol were monitored. Missing data were recovered through the&#xD;
      information system of the primary care practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data were expressed as mean and standard deviation. To compare the mean between&#xD;
      the two groups, Student's t-test for unpaired was used. The frequency of each visits to the&#xD;
      pediatricians and use of antibiotics in the two group was calculated and expressed as a&#xD;
      percentage. The χ² test was used to compare the percentages between the two groups. For all&#xD;
      tests, P-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since Italian National Health System covers all costs for pediatrician visits and&#xD;
      antibiotics, cost assessment was made analysing the costs regarding the frequency of each&#xD;
      parameters in treated and nontreated group. We considered as direct cost National Health&#xD;
      System: Medical examination (20,66 euros for each examination, as provided by the Italian&#xD;
      Ministry of Health) and use of Antibiotics (the cost was as in the list of the National Drug&#xD;
      Authority).&#xD;
