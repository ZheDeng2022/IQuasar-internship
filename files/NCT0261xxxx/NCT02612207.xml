  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this observational bench project are to validate the performance of the&#xD;
      miniaturized and modernized hematofluorometer that measures bilirubin capacity into a product&#xD;
      and is suitable for operation in various point of care environments w in the management of&#xD;
      preterm neonates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The status of bilirubin binding to albumin (Alb) is central to personalized management of&#xD;
      unconjugated newborn hyperbilirubinemia, especially those at risk of bilirubin-induced&#xD;
      neurologic dysfunction (BIND) (1). Our objectives were to validate the Aviv Bili-4&#xD;
      Hematofluorometer in the context of its usefulness and ease of use based on ad hoc clinical&#xD;
      studies and surveys of end-users. In addition, we continued our efforts to validate the&#xD;
      Bili-4 device in order to facilitate Aviv, Inc. in their development of claims of the most&#xD;
      appropriate use of bilirubin binding capacity (BBC) information in the management of&#xD;
      neonates. Neonatal blood samples were obtained from newborns born at Stanford University's&#xD;
      LPCH with gestational ages (GA) ranging from 22-40 wks. Total bilirubin (TB), Alb and&#xD;
      apparent serum unbound bilirubin (UB) concentrations were measured or calculated. Ratios of&#xD;
      bound bilirubin (BB) to reserve Alb binding capacity for bilirubin (RABC) were also&#xD;
      determined. Bilirubin binding capacity (BBC) by hematofluorometry (Hmf) was compared to the&#xD;
      calculated BBC (or 8.8 × Alb) using Alb levels as measured by the clinical laboratory. We&#xD;
      report the progress of this inquiry at the Stanford University (1).&#xD;
