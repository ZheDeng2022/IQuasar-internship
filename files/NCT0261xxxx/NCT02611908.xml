  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the combination of obinutuzumab and&#xD;
      ibrutinib (administered up to 840 mg per day) might be useful for the treatment of CLL or SLL&#xD;
      that is not responding or no longer responding to treatment with ibrutinib alone. The study&#xD;
      will evaluate whether this regimen can reduce the amount of cancerous cells in the body.&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated with ibrutinib at a dose of up to 840 mg a day by mouth, as well as&#xD;
      obinutuzumab infusions. Although both of these agents are approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of CLL or SLL, the combination and the dosing schedule of ibrutinib are considered&#xD;
      experimental.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is phase 1 study for patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) experiencing&#xD;
      disease progression on single ibrutinib. This study will evaluate the optimal ibrutinib dose&#xD;
      (including doses higher than 420 mg) when combined with obinutuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period, patients will continue on ibrutinib at their previous tolerated&#xD;
      dose, unless required to stop (e.g.: by a preceding clinical trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On cycle 1, day 1, the dose of ibrutinib will be assigned based on the dose cohort. Patients&#xD;
      in cohort 1 will receive ibrutinib 420 mg PO daily. Patients in cohort 2 will receive&#xD;
      ibrutinib 560 mg PO daily. Cohort 3 will be 700 mg PO daily. Cohort 4 will be 840 mg PO&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On cycle 1, day 1, patients will also initiate treatment with obinutuzumab (100 mg on day 1,&#xD;
      900mg on day 2, 1000mg day 8, 15, 28 then q 28 days for a total of 8 doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint is determination of DLTs during the first 28 days. The primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint of overall response rate will be assessed 2 months after the final dose of&#xD;
      obinutuzumab.&#xD;
