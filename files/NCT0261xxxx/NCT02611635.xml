    <textblock>
      The main research question of this patient survey is to assess AF patients' preferences&#xD;
      associated with different attributes which describe the different available anticoagulation&#xD;
      treatment options (VKA or NOACs and, in case of NOACs, Apixaban, Dabigatran or Rivaroxaban).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VKA (WaranÂ®) will be compared to Rivaroxaban.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to investigate the following research questions in a&#xD;
      cross-sectional survey of Swedish AF patients being treated either with a VKA or with a NOAC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which attributes of a medication to prevent stroke do AF patients view as important?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do AF patients have a preference regarding the attributes of the medication options VKA&#xD;
           or NOAC and, in case of NOACs, with regards to rivaroxaban attributes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there subgroups of AF patients whose preference for one of the medication options&#xD;
           appears above or below average?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the quality of life of Swedish AF patients? Are there subgroups with differences&#xD;
           in their quality of life (for example: subgroups of patients with different CHA2DS2-VASc&#xD;
           scores)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which burden do Swedish AF patients experience in association with their anticoagulation&#xD;
           therapy? Are there differences in the burden of treatment (ACTS) between patients&#xD;
           treated with VKA or with NOACs?&#xD;
