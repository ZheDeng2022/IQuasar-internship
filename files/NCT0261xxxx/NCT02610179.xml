      The goal of this prospective study is to determine whether there is superiority of 10&#xD;
      Twizzlers to the 50 gram glucola beverage for screening for GDM in a population based study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim now is to perform a large, prospective trial to test TwizzlersÂ® as a cost effective&#xD;
      glucola alternative in a gravid population to determine its sensitivity, specificity, PPV&#xD;
      (positive predictive value) and NPV (negative predictive value) alongside ROC (receiver&#xD;
      operating curve) from a population-based cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled among the pregnant patients in the Harris Health System&#xD;
      Obstetrics Clinics who are either due for the standard glucola GCT (glucose challenge test)&#xD;
      or who have had their glucola screening but have not had the 3 hour GTT (glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test). These women will be offered the opportunity to consume the Twizzler equivalent of the&#xD;
      50 gm glucola beverage (10 strawberry flavored Twizzlers) and to have their venous blood&#xD;
      glucose checked 1 hour post consumption. This will all be done while the patient is in clinic&#xD;
      and will not necessitate any extra clinic visits on their behalf. They will then go on to be&#xD;
      scheduled for their confirmatory 3 hour glucose tolerance tests if indicated by any&#xD;
      abnormality in either their glucola GCT or their Twizzlers challenge. The efficacy of&#xD;
      Twizzlers will then be compared to the 50 gm glucola beverage as a screen for gestational&#xD;
      diabetes. Specifically, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, NNT (number needed to treat),&#xD;
      ROC, and referral rates for each mode of screening will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Twizzler portion of the study, the subjects will consume 10 strawberry Twizzlers&#xD;
      within 5 minutes. One hour after consumption begins each participant will have a blood draw&#xD;
      to check a serum glucose level. Within the same day, the samples will be delivered to Dr.&#xD;
      Morey Haymond's lab for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum glucose and insulin levels will be tested on each sample. The amount of each blood&#xD;
      sample will be approximately 10 ml of blood (2 teaspoons). Sample collection (blood draws;&#xD;
      venipuncture) will allow for testing the serum glucose levels of subjects after consumption&#xD;
      of Twizzlers. These values will be used for analysis to determine if Twizzlers are truly&#xD;
      equivalent to the Glucola beverage. Ultimately, the patient's will only undergo 1 extra&#xD;
      venipuncture than what they would have had as part of their routine prenatal care if both&#xD;
      screening tests are normal. There is a possibility of undergoing a 3 hour GTT that would not&#xD;
      have otherwise been performed if the subjects Twizzlers screen is elevated but glucola was&#xD;
      normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a phone call to report any abnormal values on their GCT as per&#xD;
      standard clinical operating measures, and will have their GTT scheduled with the nursing&#xD;
      staff. Based on prior studies, a notable rate of false-positives is not anticipated with the&#xD;
      Twizzler GCT. In the rare occasion that such occurs (i.e., screen positive by Twizzler but&#xD;
      not by glucola beverage) they will be informed of the need for a 3 hour GTT. This will be&#xD;
      covered by the study costs, and their insurance will not be charged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy outcomes data for subjects will be collected, including gestational age at&#xD;
      delivery, mode of delivery and any complications, maternal weight gain, and infant&#xD;
      birthweight. This will all be acquired as data abstraction from the EMR and maintained in a&#xD;
      secure coded database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Otherwise, there will be no further contact or requirements of the subject.&#xD;
