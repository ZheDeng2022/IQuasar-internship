      Some women have a higher risk than others of developing breast cancer. Unhealthy lifestyles,&#xD;
      high breast density, family history, obesity, the presence of biomarkers associated with&#xD;
      early neoplastic changes (considered alone or in combination) are just some of main factors&#xD;
      that can increase the risk of breast cancer. Women with a higher risk may need to undergo&#xD;
      more intensive screening activities, which include more frequent inspections and the&#xD;
      possibility of experiment different types of tests. Instead, low risk women could be screened&#xD;
      at longer intervals in order to reduce the screening harms (false positive results,&#xD;
      overdiagnosis, radiation exposure, discomfort caused by the test itself, etc.) The ANDROMEDA&#xD;
      Study aims at creating the possibility to customize the screening paths through a combined&#xD;
      analysis of the above mentioned risk factors. Women consenting to be involved in the study&#xD;
      will be asked to provide information on their lifestyle habits and reproductive history.&#xD;
      Furthermore a blood sample will be collected for further bio-molecular analysis purposes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) represents the most frequent neoplasm in women worldwide. In Italy about 1&#xD;
      out of 3 malignant cancers in women (29%) is a BC (leaving out cutaneous tumours) as reported&#xD;
      by the Italian cancer registries between 2006 and 2009. Results from randomized trials,&#xD;
      summarized in an updated review and meta-analysis for the U.S. Preventive Task Force by&#xD;
      Nelson et al., showed that participating to a mammography screening program reduces BC&#xD;
      mortality of 14-32%, depending on the age range. In Italy, mammography screening for early&#xD;
      diagnosis has been implemented on a regional basis in several Italian areas. In compliance to&#xD;
      national and international guidelines, most programmes invite women aged 50 to 69 years to&#xD;
      undergo mammography every two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although mammography has become standard of care in BC screening, its limitations are well&#xD;
      recognized (overdiagnosis, the use of ionizing radiation, poor accuracy in women with dense&#xD;
      breast tissue, a relatively high rate of false positives, and personal discomfort). In&#xD;
      addition, the current screening protocols are based on woman's age only, ignoring other risk&#xD;
      factors and defining a single screening periodicity within the prespecified age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current challenges in the management of BC include searching for sensitive and specific&#xD;
      minimally invasive biomarkers associated with early neoplastic changes. A number of&#xD;
      circulating tumour markers (such as carcino-embryonic antigen, CEA or carbohydrate antigen&#xD;
      15-3, CA 15-3) are widely used in BC handling, but their sensitivity is very low. MicroRNAs&#xD;
      (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs (about 18-25 nucleotide long), that regulate gene&#xD;
      expression inside cells by degrading mRNA or inhibiting protein synthesis. Since they may&#xD;
      have hundreds of targets, they are able to control several biological processes inside cells.&#xD;
      There is growing evidence that miRNAs may also be released outside cells, and increased&#xD;
      levels of miRNAs released by tumour and its microenvironment as well as decrease in&#xD;
      physiologic circulating miRNA levels have already been detected in serum/plasma of cancer&#xD;
      patients. The potential use of such molecules for diagnostic/prognostic purposes in regard to&#xD;
      breast cancer has been extensively evaluated and their stability in body fluids has opened&#xD;
      new opportunities for anticipating BC diagnosis, with minimally invasive intervention&#xD;
      especially for women at higher risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Risk-based screening programmes according to different BC risk criteria (i.e.&#xD;
      breast density, model based estimates of absolute risk, life-styles) may maximize the impact&#xD;
      of screening in groups of women characterized by different risks. Gathering data for risk&#xD;
      stratification in population based screening programmes requires large amount of resources.&#xD;
      Non independent criteria which identify the same women at higher risk are redundant and&#xD;
      should be considered as mutually exclusive. Validated highly accurate blood molecular&#xD;
      biomarkers associated with BC risk may represent a complementary tool to mammography in the&#xD;
      primary screening setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of the study is to evaluate and compare, in a large cohort of women, the&#xD;
      predictive value of available criteria to define BC risk in order to identify appropriate&#xD;
      risk-based stratifications for personalised screening. The criteria considered are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. general risk factors collected through a standardised risk questionnaire (e.g.&#xD;
      reproductive factors, first-degree family history, biopsy history, physical activity, BMI and&#xD;
      alcohol consumption). For this category the absolute risk will be evaluated using the risk&#xD;
      prediction model of Petracci et al. that has been developed for the Italian population and&#xD;
      validated on an independent cohort of Italian women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. breast density; iii.woman's life styles (through a detailed questionnaire on dietary&#xD;
      habits and physical activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed for achieving the following secondary aims related to the first&#xD;
      objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure age- and risk-specific screening performance indicators (i.e. detection rate,&#xD;
      recall rate and benign/malignant surgical biopsy ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To quantify the impact of potential interventions of tailored screening on health outcomes&#xD;
      and costs through the knowledge of risk factors distribution in the target population; To&#xD;
      evaluate the economic and organizational feasibility of potential tailored intervention and&#xD;
      to design stratified breast cancer screening strategies for future pilot screening programme&#xD;
      implementation; The extension of the follow up beyond the three-year duration of the project&#xD;
      will allow us to determine even more consistent estimates of the predictive values&#xD;
      abovementioned and to evaluate the criteria/risk factors considered in this study in a&#xD;
      multivariate analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second main objective is to investigate whether selected circulating miRNAs previously&#xD;
      found associated to BC risk are significantly altered in the plasma of cancer patients&#xD;
      compared to matched healthy controls and if they satisfy pre-specified true- and&#xD;
      false-positive rates that are considered minimally acceptable in the screening setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Related sub-objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the association between factors such as age, breast density, reproductive factors&#xD;
           and family history as well as life-style and miRNA level in the cancer-free population.&#xD;
           If such factors affect the biomarker, the threshold for screening positivity may need to&#xD;
           be defined separately for screening subpopulations, in order to keep the false-positive&#xD;
           rate at low level for each. - To assess factors associated with miRNA level in cancer&#xD;
           cases - in particular, disease characteristics such as stage, grade, and available&#xD;
           prognostic factors. Understanding the nature of cancer that is detected with a biomarker&#xD;
           is a key issue. A biomarker that detects cancer at an early stage is more valuable for&#xD;
           preventive purposes than one that detects only late-stage cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the presence of 18 currently established breast cancer risk SNPs obtained by&#xD;
           genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have identified common low penetrance&#xD;
           alleles associated with breast cancer risk at multiple genetic loci, and test their&#xD;
           association with circulating miRNAs, breast density and screening outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Enrolment About 36 600 women (age-range: 46-67 years) participating to BC screening&#xD;
      program in selected areas, will be offered participation in the Andromeda study, of whom 22&#xD;
      000 are expected to provide informed consent. At enrolment information on BC risk factors and&#xD;
      life-style will be collected, together with breast density and blood samples for serum,&#xD;
      plasma and buffy-coat storing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who will agree to participate in Andromeda will be asked to fill in a questionnaire to&#xD;
      design their BC standard risk and a detailed questionnaire on their life styles. They will&#xD;
      also be asked to provide a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, breast density will be calculated during the breast examination. Exams will be&#xD;
      read by two expert radiologists and breast density will be classified into categories by&#xD;
      means of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women accepting blood sampling will receive a specific appointment where trained personnel,&#xD;
      beyond the blood withdrawal, will collect anthropometric measures and will support them in&#xD;
      completing the study 's questionnaires, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that positivity for dense breast, Gail score, lifestyle related risk and miRNA are&#xD;
      determined on the same subjects, the most efficient estimate of the ratio between relative&#xD;
      (positive vs. negative) positive predictive values (PPV) ratios for two different factors is&#xD;
      given by a x b/c x d, where a = cancers positive factor 1 but not to factor 2; b= women with&#xD;
      abnormal mammography but no cancer, positive for factor 2 but not for factor 1; c=cancers&#xD;
      positive for factor 2 to but not for factor 1; d= women with abnormal mammography but no&#xD;
      cancer, positive for factor 1 but not for factor 2. Assuming that 40% of 21000 enrolled women&#xD;
      have a dense breast, 20% a certain Gail score, 50% a lifestyle risk and 20% a given miRNA,&#xD;
      that 11% of study women carry breast cancer and that the overall PPV of mammography is 20%,&#xD;
      some 100-120 discordant cancers and 640-740 discordant women with abnormal mammography but no&#xD;
      cancer are expected for the considered couples of factors. Under these assumptions, the study&#xD;
      has a 80% power to reject (alpha = 0.05) the null hypothesis that the relative PPV ratio is&#xD;
      =1 if its true value is at least 1.8-2.0, depending on the couple of factors considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Biomarkers analysis The Andromeda study comprises the molecular analyses to&#xD;
      evaluate SNPs and circulating miRNAs that will be performed blindly on an appropriate&#xD;
      case-control sample extracted from the cohort of women enrolled, as soon as a minimum number&#xD;
      of BC cases will be reached. Blinding allows avoiding that knowledge of subject's outcome&#xD;
      status affect the interpretation of an assay result or the care with which the specimen is&#xD;
      handled. Genomic DNA will be extracted from buffy coat with High Pure PCR Template&#xD;
      preparation kit. 18 SNPs will be amplified by PCR and evaluated on a qPCR apparatus with&#xD;
      specific assays. The 18 breast cancer risk related SNPs are: rs11249433, rs1045485,&#xD;
      rs13387042, rs4973768, rs10941679, rs889312, rs2046210, rs13281615, rs1011970, rs2981582,&#xD;
      rs2380205, rs10995190, rs704010, rs3817198, rs614367, rs999737, rs3803662 and rs6504950.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating total RNA extraction from plasma samples will be carried out with miRNeasy&#xD;
      minikit according to Exiqon protocol, implying use of a RNA carrier (batteriofage MS2 RNA,&#xD;
      Roche Diagnostics) to promote RNA precipitation and its purification on membranes.&#xD;
      Cel-miR-139 will be used as spike-in control to check extraction yield and to normalize data,&#xD;
      together with hasmiR- 1228. RNA samples will be eluted with nuclease free water and stored at&#xD;
      -80° C. A novel method to check for haemolysis will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the sample size necessary for the pivotal evaluation of the biomarkers&#xD;
      (expressed on a continuous scale), minimally acceptable and desirable levels of typical&#xD;
      performance measures of interests, such as the true-positive rate (TPR) and the&#xD;
      false-positive rate (FPR) have been defined. For general population screening, the&#xD;
      false-positive rate must be quite low to avoid a huge number of people undergoing unnecessary&#xD;
      costly medical procedures. Thus, we hypothesized a maximally acceptable false-positive rate&#xD;
      (FPR0) of 4% (the minimally acceptable specificity is therefore 96%) and a minimally&#xD;
      acceptable sensitivity of 80% (TPR0). The null hypothesis to be rejected is the following:&#xD;
      H0: TPR0≤0.80 or FPR0≥0.04.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size required with an 80% power (alpha=5%) and assuming desirable true-positive&#xD;
      rate and false-positive rate of TPR1=0.90 and FPR1=0.05, respectively, was of 179 cases and&#xD;
      537 controls. Sample size computation was based theoretically on the ROC curve. Assuming an&#xD;
      annual BC detection rate (DR) of 0.006 in the first year and 0.005 in the second year of the&#xD;
      study (therefore the biennial DR considered was 0.011) a total of 233 case patients in the&#xD;
      first two years of the study are expected to be observed, thus exceeding the 179 required.&#xD;
      These estimates are based on DRs observed in the previous years in the same centers&#xD;
      considered in this study. Thus, the molecular analyses will be performed on 233 cases and 699&#xD;
      matched controls. For each case, three control subjects will be selected from the cohort of&#xD;
      women, on the basis of the following criteria: no history of cancer, similar age at enrolment&#xD;
      (within 5 years), similar race, availability of blood sample, similar date of blood draw.&#xD;
