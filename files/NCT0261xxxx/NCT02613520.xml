      The present trial will evaluate safety and tolerability as well as the vaccine-induced&#xD;
      humoral and cellular immune responses in healthy Tanzanian adults, adolescents, children, and&#xD;
      infants who receive doses of 1.8x10^6, 9.0x10^5, 4.5x10^5 or 2.7x10^5 PfSPZ of PfSPZ Vaccine&#xD;
      by direct venous inoculation (DVI),compared with control groups receiving normal saline (NS)&#xD;
      placebo by DVI. In addition, as an exploratory objective, controlled human malaria infection&#xD;
      (CHMI) will be used to assess efficacy in adults three weeks following immunization.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single center trial to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of PfSPZ&#xD;
      Vaccine administered by direct venous inoculation (DVI) to healthy Tanzanian adults,&#xD;
      adolescents, and children and infants. 105 healthy male and female; adults, adolescents,&#xD;
      children and infant volunteers, aged from 6 months to 45 years, who live in the Bagamoyo&#xD;
      Township will be enrolled based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria implemented&#xD;
      according to international ethical standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of PfSPZ Vaccine administered as three doses of either 9.0x10^5&#xD;
      PfSPZ or 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ to healthy Tanzanian adults, adolescents, and children 6 years of age&#xD;
      or older; and three doses of 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ or 9.0x10^5 PfSPZ to healthy Tanzanian children 1&#xD;
      to 5 years of age and infants 6 to 11 months of age, in each case compared to NS controls,&#xD;
      will be evaluated. In addition, as an exploratory objective, controlled human malaria&#xD;
      infection (CHMI) will be used to assess efficacy in adults three weeks following&#xD;
      immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a single center trial with ten groups (Groups 1a/b: ages 18-45; Group&#xD;
      2a/b: ages 11-17; Group 3a/b: ages 6-10; Group 4a/b: ages 1-5; and Group 5b/c: ages&#xD;
      6months-11 months) each with 6 subjects receiving PfSPZ Vaccine and 3 subjects receiving NS&#xD;
      and an eleventh smaller group (Group 5a: ages 6months-11months) with 3 subjects receiving&#xD;
      PfSPZ Vaccine; two of these groups (Group 1a/b) contain adult volunteers and will have&#xD;
      infectivity controls (CHMI 1 and 2) each having 3 subjects, after the vaccination phase of&#xD;
      the study. The adult volunteers will undergo CHMI 3 weeks after the last immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first immunization, two volunteers (out of six) in Group 1a will receive 9x10^5 of&#xD;
      PfSPZ Vaccine by DVI as sentinels, to demonstrate safety and tolerability. At the same time,&#xD;
      one (out of three) corresponding control volunteers will receive NS, in order to maintain&#xD;
      blinding. Approximately 24 hours later, provided criteria for calling an ad hoc SMC meeting&#xD;
      are not met, the remaining four volunteers in Group 1a will also receive a 9x10^5 PfSPZ dose&#xD;
      of the vaccine and the remaining two placebo recipients will receive NS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After review of at least +14 days post vaccination safety data for Group 1a by the SMC, if&#xD;
      there are no significant safety concerns, two volunteers (out of six) in Group 1b will&#xD;
      receive 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ, and two volunteers (out of six) in each of the Groups 2a and 3a will&#xD;
      receive 9x10^5 PfSPZ, of the PfSPZ Vaccine, to demonstrate safety and tolerability, and each&#xD;
      of these sentinel groups will be joined by one corresponding NS control in order to maintain&#xD;
      blinding. Approximately 24 hours later, provided criteria for calling an ad hoc SMC meeting&#xD;
      are not met, the remaining four volunteers in Group 1b will receive 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ and the&#xD;
      remaining four volunteers in each of Groups 2a and 3a will receive 9x10^5 PfSPZ of the PfSPZ&#xD;
      Vaccine, and the remaining placebo recipients will receive NS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After review of at least +14 days post vaccination safety data for Groups 1b, 2a and 3a by&#xD;
      the SMC, if there are no significant safety concerns, two volunteers (out of six) in each of&#xD;
      the Groups 2b and 3b will receive 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ, those in Group 4a will receive 4.5x10^5&#xD;
      PfSPZ and all 3 volunteers in Group 5a will receive 2.7x10^5 PfSPZ of PfSPZ Vaccine, to&#xD;
      demonstrate safety and tolerability, and each of the sentinel groups (two volunteers from&#xD;
      Groups 2b, 3b and 4a) will be joined by one NS control in order to maintain blinding.&#xD;
      Approximately 24 hours later, provided criteria for calling an ad hoc SMC meeting are not&#xD;
      met, the remaining four volunteers in Groups 2b, 3b and 4a will receive their appropriate&#xD;
      dose of PfSPZ Vaccine (1.8x10^6 PfSPZ, 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ, and 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ, respectively), and&#xD;
      the placebo recipients will receive NS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escalation from the small group of infants, (Group 5a, n=3) receiving a single dose of&#xD;
      2.7x10^5 PfSPZ, to the full group (Group 5b, n=6) receiving three doses of 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ,&#xD;
      will proceed without SMC review if criteria for calling an ad hoc SMC meeting are not met.&#xD;
      However, if the criteria are met, an ad hoc SMC meeting will be called to review the data,&#xD;
      and dose escalation to 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ will be postponed until the recommendations of the SMC&#xD;
      are available. The interval between the 2.7x10^5 PfSPZ small group and the 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ&#xD;
      larger group will be a minimum of three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After review of at least +14 days post vaccination, safety data for Groups 2b, 3b, 4a, 5a and&#xD;
      5b by the SMC, if there are no significant safety concerns, two volunteers (out of six) in&#xD;
      each of the Groups 4b and 5c will receive 9x10^5 PfSPZ, to demonstrate safety and&#xD;
      tolerability. At the same time, one (out of three) corresponding control volunteers will&#xD;
      receive NS, in order to maintain blinding. Approximately 24 hours later, provided criteria&#xD;
      for calling an ad hoc SMC meeting are not met, the remaining four volunteers in Group 4b and&#xD;
      5c will receive 9x10^5 PfSPZ dose of the vaccine, and the placebo recipients will receive NS.&#xD;
