  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to empower adolescent renal transplant recipients to fully&#xD;
      understand their medical condition as well as to help them acquire the skills to maintain a&#xD;
      healthy allograft well into adulthood. It is hoped that introducing technological&#xD;
      applications (apps) will assist adolescents in managing medications, clinic appointments, lab&#xD;
      appointments, and in tracking fluid intake, blood pressure, caloric intake, and exercise&#xD;
      frequency. The investigators aim to improve adolescent post-renal transplant outcomes&#xD;
      (increase medication adherence, lower clinic and laboratory no-show rate, lower blood&#xD;
      pressure and BMI, maintain creatinine clearance, decrease proteinuria, decrease incidence of&#xD;
      allograft rejection, decrease hospitalizations) as well as reduce cost.&#xD;

      The research team as well and principal investigator will identify and verify patient&#xD;
      eligibility. Patients who are unable to speak or converse via sign language will be excluded.&#xD;
      All participants will need to provide informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For recruitment and informed consent, the expected benefits, risks, and uncertainties will be&#xD;
      discussed with participants and their families. Participants will be offered enrollment in&#xD;
      either the randomized trial or a concurrent observational cohort, which may be more feasible&#xD;
      for families who live further away and have alternative insurance plans (Kaiser). The results&#xD;
      of the concurrent observational cohort can be reported at a later time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will begin in April 2015 and end in April 2016. This is to ensure that patients&#xD;
      who may miss an appointment can still be recruited in the following months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline variables will be collected prior to randomization including questionnaire and&#xD;
      baseline characteristics such as age, creatinine, weight, height, BMI, urine&#xD;
      protein-to-creatinine ratio, donor specific antibody levels, and blood pressure will be&#xD;
      recorded. Blood draws will be done per standard of care only and blood samples will not be&#xD;
      stored for research purposes. Computer-generated random treatment assignments will be made&#xD;
      based on permuted blocks (randomly generated blocks of 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental arm will have all participants attend monthly renal transplant adolescent&#xD;
      clinic where the participant will undergo a 25-question baseline questionnaire focusing on&#xD;
      the participant's current knowledge of own medical condition, medications, medication dosage,&#xD;
      insurance coverage, daily fluid goal, blood pressure goal, voiding schedule, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each clinic visit, the participant will take the questionnaire and review results with&#xD;
      the transplant/research coordinator. The transplant/research coordinator will also assist the&#xD;
      participant in updating medication list, medication schedule, lab schedule, clinic&#xD;
      appointment schedule, pharmacy refill schedule etc. using an electronic device with&#xD;
      downloadable mobile apps. The included apps will be MyFitnessPal, a calorie counter and&#xD;
      exercise tracker, Blood Pressure Lite (Codulis) for blood pressure recording, and Med Coach&#xD;
      (GreatCall, Inc), providing medication and appointment reminders. If the participant already&#xD;
      has a personal i-Phone, the study coordinator will assist the participant add schedules to&#xD;
      the calendar and help set alarms and reminders. The research coordinator will also help&#xD;
      download free mobile apps that will log BP, fluid intake, caloric intake, and exercise&#xD;
      duration. If the participant does not have an i-Phone, an i-Pad Mini will be provided and the&#xD;
      transplant coordinator will assist with all that as stated above. The participant will be&#xD;
      seen by a nephrologist, social worker, and psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-technological group participants will also attend monthly renal transplant adolescent&#xD;
      clinic where he/she will undergo the same 25-question baseline questionnaire. During each&#xD;
      clinic visit, the participant will take the questionnaire and review results with the&#xD;
      research coordinator. The transplant coordinator will also assist the participant in updating&#xD;
      medication list, medication schedule, lab schedule, clinic appointment schedule, pharmacy&#xD;
      refill schedule etc. using paper calendar and pre-printed paper logs per the routine care&#xD;
      protocol. The participant will also be seen by a nephrologist, social worker, and&#xD;
      psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary measure is performance on monthly medical knowledge questionnaire, used as a&#xD;
      surrogate marker for readiness to transition to adult care. Secondary measures include&#xD;
      medication adherence measured by immunosuppression target drug levels, clinic and laboratory&#xD;
      no-show rates, markers of graft function measured by blood pressure readings, BMI, creatinine&#xD;
      clearance, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and episodes of rejections measured by donor&#xD;
      specific antibodies, and pathologic findings of allograft biopsy. The study will end after&#xD;
      the one year follow up period is completed. As the paper-based strategy is to function as a&#xD;
      control, the investigators do not anticipate an early termination to the study, particularly&#xD;
      since both groups provide more intervention than the current standard of care.&#xD;
