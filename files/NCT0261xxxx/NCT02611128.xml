  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder marked by hyperandrogenism,&#xD;
      oligo-/anovulation, and subfertility. The precise causes of PCOS are unclear, but the&#xD;
      pathophysiology involves complex genetic and environmental influences. Importantly, not all&#xD;
      girls with obesity have HA, and free testosterone (T) concentrations are highly variable in&#xD;
      this group. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and insulin concentrations are significant but only&#xD;
      partial predictors of free T in girls with obesity; significant unexplained variability in&#xD;
      free T suggests that additional factors contribute to HA in this population. Abnormalities of&#xD;
      ovarian and adrenal steroidogenesis are likely contributors in this regard, but such&#xD;
      abnormalities are difficult to quantify. Recent Genome Wide Association Studies have&#xD;
      identified DENND1A as a PCOS susceptibility gene candidate. Preliminary in vitro data&#xD;
      strongly implicate a DENND1A splice variant called DENND1A Variant 2 (DENND1A.V2) as a&#xD;
      contributor to excessive theca cell androgen production in PCOS. The investigators' primary&#xD;
      goal with the proposed pilot study is to determine the relationship between urinary exosomal&#xD;
      DENND1A.V2 mRNA and free T concentrations in peripubertal girls. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that urinary exosomal DENND1A.V2 mRNA quantity is a significant and independent&#xD;
      predictor of peripubertal hyperandrogenemia. In this study, the investigators will carefully&#xD;
      phenotype peripubertal girls with and without hyperandrogenemia (primarily in the form of&#xD;
      hormonal, maturational, and anthropometric measurements) in addition to measuring urinary&#xD;
      exosomal DENND1A.V2 mRNA. As a primary analysis, the investigators will examine the&#xD;
      relationship between morning free testosterone and urinary exosomal DENND1A.V2, controlling&#xD;
      for previously-described partial predictors of free testosterone (LH, insulin) in addition to&#xD;
      potential confounders (BMI z-score, bone age). These studies will provide important&#xD;
      information regarding the etiology of HA in peripubertal girls. Ultimately, these data may&#xD;
      lead to a non-invasive test of ovarian/adrenal steroidogenic activity and support the&#xD;
      development of a diagnostic test for PCOS in high-risk peripubertal girls (e.g., those with&#xD;
      obesity).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, the mechanisms underlying excess androgen production from steroid producing tissues&#xD;
      have been unclear, but recent Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have provided additional&#xD;
      data in this regard. Initial GWAS data in a Han Chinese population identified some 12 loci as&#xD;
      potential PCOS susceptibility gene candidates. One of these loci, the DENND1A locus at&#xD;
      9q22.32, has been replicated in GWAS studies in both Asian and European populations. Strauss&#xD;
      and colleagues recently demonstrated DENND1A expression in testes, ovarian theca cells, and&#xD;
      H295 adrenal carcinoma cells - all androgen producing tissues/cells. DENND1A is therefore an&#xD;
      exceedingly strong PCOS susceptibility gene candidate. However, it remains unclear how&#xD;
      DENND1A may contribute to the PCOS phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, there are two transcriptional forms of the DENND1A gene - a consequence of&#xD;
      alternate splicing. The larger transcript (DENND1A Variant 1, or DENND1A.V1) encodes a 1009&#xD;
      amino acid protein, while the smaller transcript DENND1A.V2 encodes a truncated 559 amino&#xD;
      acid. The product of DENND1A.V2 contains the DENN domain and a clathrin-binding domain, but&#xD;
      differs from the product of DENND1A.V1 in two ways: (1) it does not contain the proline-rich&#xD;
      C-terminal domain present in Variant 1, and (2) DENND1A.V2 results from differential splicing&#xD;
      and contains a unique 33 amino acid C-terminal sequence. Of significant interest, published&#xD;
      studies by Drs. McAllister and Strauss (McAllister JM, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.&#xD;
      2014;111:E1519-27) strongly implicate the DENND1A.V2 splice variant as a contributor to&#xD;
      excessive theca cell androgen production in PCOS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expression of DENND1A.V2 protein in cultured theca cells isolated from women with PCOS&#xD;
           was over 3-fold elevated compared to normal ovarian theca cells. Similarly, DENND1A.V2&#xD;
           mRNA abundance was elevated in PCOS theca and correlated with increased theca cell&#xD;
           androgen (dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forced expression of DENND1A.V2 in normal theca cells increased expression of CYP17A1&#xD;
           and CYP11A1 (genes for key steroidogenic enzymes) along with androgen/androgen precursor&#xD;
           (e.g., 17OHP4, DHEA, testosterone) and progesterone production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knockdown of DENND1A.V2 in cultured PCOS theca cells reduced CYP17A1 and CYP11A1&#xD;
           expression in addition to 17OHP4 and DHEA production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of cultured PCOS theca cells with anti-DENND1A.V2 IgG antibodies reduced&#xD;
           expression of CYP17A1 and CYP11A1 mRNA expression as well as DHEA and 17OHP4 synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data provide strong support to the contention that the DENND1A.V2 splice variant is a&#xD;
      major factor underlying the phenotype of cultured PCOS theca cells and, thus, the etiology of&#xD;
      ovarian hyperandrogenemia in PCOS. By extension, the DENND1A.V2 splice variant may be a&#xD;
      significant contributor to peripubertal hyperandrogenemia, and it may explain much of the&#xD;
      variable hyperandrogenemia observed in obese peripubertal girls. The investigators propose&#xD;
      that, in some peripubertal girls, increased expression of DENND1A.V2 in ovarian and/or&#xD;
      adrenal cells promotes excess androgen secretion with the advent of puberty (when ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation by LH increases) and/or in the presence of obesity (e.g., enhanced insulin&#xD;
      secretion, augmenting LH-stimulated ovarian androgen synthesis and/or ACTH-stimulated adrenal&#xD;
      androgen synthesis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of great interest, preliminary data from 5 normal women and 6 women with PCOS suggested that&#xD;
      urinary exosomal DENND1A.V2 mRNA was approximately 3-fold elevated in women with PCOS&#xD;
      compared to normally-cycling controls (McAllister JM, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.&#xD;
      2014;111:E1519-27). Exosomes are small vesicles (40-100 nm) that contain nucleic acids shed&#xD;
      by cells into blood and urine, and they are known to be a stable source of RNA. Thus, urinary&#xD;
      exosomal DENND1A.V2 quantity may serve as a marker of DENND1A.V2 activity in the&#xD;
      ovary/adrenal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these proposed studies, the investigators (including collaborators Drs. McAllister and&#xD;
      Strauss) will obtain urine for exosomal DENND1A.V2 mRNA quantitation in addition to blood&#xD;
      samples to measure androgen levels, LH and insulin (the latter two previously-demonstrated to&#xD;
      predict free testosterone). The investigators will test the hypothesis that the quantity of&#xD;
      urinary exosomal DENND1A.V2 mRNA is a strong and independent predictor of androgen levels in&#xD;
      peripubertal girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge, no data exist that tie a PCOS susceptibility gene candidate&#xD;
      to pubertal hyperandrogenemia. The investigators propose to evaluate a novel biomarker&#xD;
      (urinary exosomal DENND1A.V2 mRNA) as a predictor of free testosterone in pubertal girls.&#xD;
      Evaluation of this biomarker in adolescents is highly innovative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present proposal will build on Aim 3 of Project 1 (NIH P50 HD28934), in which the&#xD;
      investigators carefully assess the determinants of hyperandrogenemia in girls with&#xD;
      peripubertal obesity. Specifically, Aim 3 is an intensive protocol involving (a) overnight&#xD;
      frequent blood sampling for LH and insulin along with (b) ovarian and adrenal stimulation&#xD;
      protocols over the subsequent 2 days. Some of the subjects participating in this proposed&#xD;
      pilot study will also participate in Aim 3. Correlation between urinary exosomal DENND1A.V2&#xD;
      mRNA and ovarian/adrenal stimulation protocols will allow a preliminary assessment of urinary&#xD;
      exosomal DENND1A.V2 mRNA as a non-invasive measure of ovarian/adrenal steroidogenesis - a&#xD;
      potentially important clinical tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripubertal girls with hyperandrogenemia are believed to be at high risk for developing&#xD;
      adolescent/adult PCOS, but since the manifestations of PCOS can overlap with the findings of&#xD;
      normal puberty, the diagnosis of PCOS may be unreliable until later adolescence. If urinary&#xD;
      exosomal DENND1A.V2 mRNA is a significant predictor of hyperandrogenemia in this cohort,&#xD;
      future studies will determine the utility of urinary exosomal DENND1A.V2 as a diagnostic test&#xD;
      to predict the development of PCOS across puberty. This is an innovative and exceedingly&#xD;
      exciting prospect that may have significant potential implications for at-risk girls.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Assessment during the luteal phase as suggested by a serum progesterone ≥ 1.5 ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Virilization or a total testosterone &gt; 150 ng/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Excessively elevated DHEA-S: This will be defined as a DHEA-S &gt; 1.5 times the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Significant hyperprolactinemia: Since mild elevations may be seen in girls with&#xD;
