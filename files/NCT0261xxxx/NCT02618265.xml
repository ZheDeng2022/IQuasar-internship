    <textblock>
      With high incidence, mortality, morbidity and recurrence rateï¼Œstroke has significant impact&#xD;
      on national development strategies planning. Improving secondary prevention will strongly&#xD;
      promote stroke management in the rapid developing phase of Chinese economy and expansion of&#xD;
      health situation. At present lack of high-quality medical resources, low medical permeability&#xD;
      cannot remedy extensive prevention failure of stroke. Mobile healthcare is easier to conduct&#xD;
      and still in the early stage of explosive growth. This research group has established an open&#xD;
      management platform of stroke prevention. And collaborate with Peking University Institute of&#xD;
      Information Technology to develop a smart phone application which can be personalized&#xD;
      medication reminder, record medication compliance, home blood pressure and blood glucose test&#xD;
      results, also can provide doctor-patient communication platform and symptoms alarm. The&#xD;
      investigators want to verify whether mobile application based on stroke strengthen prevention&#xD;
      management is more effective than traditional management model or open stroke management&#xD;
      platform. Whole blood-impedance based platelet aggregation(WBA) method and VerifyNow detected&#xD;
      by aspirin or clopidogrel responsiveness will provide individualized anti-platelet drug&#xD;
      selection. Control group will be selected from the National Stroke data registration database&#xD;
      platform and open platform for stroke prevention. Follow-up period is 2 years. Endpoint event&#xD;
      is defined as stroke death or relapse. Primary measure outcomes are change of the stroke&#xD;
      recurrence rate and mortality after secondary prevention.&#xD;
