    <textblock>
      There is a theoretical possibility of a complete suppression of HIV viral replication,&#xD;
      subject to the use of highly active associations of more than 25 antiretroviral drugs&#xD;
      currently available and good treatment adherence. But a key question remains: whether it can&#xD;
      persist viral replication low noise HAART, since several arguments suggest a subclinical&#xD;
      escape of the virus to HAART at least in some individuals. The technique proposed in this&#xD;
      research consists of the detection and quantification of the linear viral cDNA intra&#xD;
      cytoplasmic, as persistent novo infection marker in order to highlight the subclinical&#xD;
      replication active in treatment of HIV-1 and consider an optimized therapeutic management of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective : Comparing the frequency of patients infected with HIV and treated&#xD;
      effectively (HIV viral load undetectable plasma with conventional methods) having the HIV DNA&#xD;
      into the cytoplasm of their CD4 + T cells from peripheral blood, as cellular infection marker&#xD;
      novo persistent, among patients with a therapeutic regimen contains or not the viral&#xD;
      integrase inhibitor raltegravir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the frequency of patients infected with HIV and treated effectively with the&#xD;
           HIV DNA into the cytoplasm of their CD4 + T cells from peripheral blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the causes of persistent infection in de novo virological responders to&#xD;
           treatment with ART: presence of the HIV genome encoding strains resistant to treatment&#xD;
           ART ongoing noncompliance to treatment, type of antiretroviral therapy, CD4 nadir ,&#xD;
           pretreatment level of plasma HIV RNA, total duration of ART&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the impact of persistent novo infection virological responders: cell activation&#xD;
           CD4 + and CD8 +, lack of immunological treatment response, changes in lymphocyte ratio T&#xD;
           naïve / memory cells cells, the presence of transient increase viremia, residual viremia&#xD;
           levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify virological responders may benefit from treatment intensification&#xD;

        -  Identify virological responders may benefit from treatment intensification Methods : HIV&#xD;
           patients will be recruited by the doctors of Infectious and Tropical Diseases Service&#xD;
           (MIT) in the Montpellier University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this research, three additional blood tubes (7 ml EDTA tube) will be collected,&#xD;
      totaling 21 ml at the time of blood sampling carried out during two consultations scheduled&#xD;
      as part of the usual care the pathology of HIV patients in the Service of MIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These consultations will be conducted at baseline and a further 3 to 6 months from the date&#xD;
      of inclusion.&#xD;
