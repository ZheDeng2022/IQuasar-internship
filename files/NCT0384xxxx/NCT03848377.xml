    <textblock>
      In patients undergoing spine surgery, spinal nerve roots and spinal cord are vulnerable to&#xD;
      surgical insults especially for instrumentation and may lead to long term sequelae. The&#xD;
      incidence of clinical peripheral neuropathy after cervical spine surgery has been reported up&#xD;
      to 30%. Intraoperatively, spinal cord and nerves function can be monitored using&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and thereby, intervention&#xD;
      can be made to potentially reduce the incidence of adverse neurological sequelae. However,&#xD;
      conventional EMG and SSEP monitoring requires presence of a trained EP technician, use of&#xD;
      needle electrodes and currently bulky EP equipment and is thus not practical for routine&#xD;
      clinical usage. In this study, the invesitgators will assess the clinical feasibility of&#xD;
      using a novel miniaturized and automated EMG/SSEP device (EPAD® 2.0) in spine surgical&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Purpose of Research: This study is a pilot study designed to assess the ability of a novel&#xD;
      automated EMG/SSEP device (EPAD® 2.0) to detect intraoperative spinal nerve roots injury in&#xD;
      patients undergoing spine procedures. The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the clinical utility of using the EPAD® 2.0 automated device and its algorithm&#xD;
           in monitoring spine surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to identify any practical limitation of using EPAD® 2.0 automated device in spine&#xD;
           surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: the novel automated EPAD® 2.0 EMG/SSEP device is easy to use and apply in spine&#xD;
      surgery patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Surgical injuries to the spinal nerve roots or spinal cords are not infrequent in&#xD;
      spine surgery and the consequence can be devastating. Injured patients might present with&#xD;
      radiculopathy, motor weakness, spinal cord compression, and postoperative neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      In cervical spine surgery, cervical nerve roots injuries especially fifth cervical (C5) nerve&#xD;
      root are not uncommon complications, potentially resulting in upper extremity paralysis. The&#xD;
      incidence of C5 nerve root injury ranged to as high as 30%. The other spinal nerve roots&#xD;
      (C6-8) can suffer from the same surgical injuries during the procedure but with much lower&#xD;
      reported incidence than C5. Spinal nerve injuries typically occur during decompression for&#xD;
      cervical myelopathy in both anterior and posterior approaches. In lumbosacral spine surgery,&#xD;
      a recent review of the neurological injury found a pooled incidence of 5.7% (56 of 2783&#xD;
      patients; range: 0.46-24%), in which pedicle malposition accounted for one-fifth of the&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multimodality monitoring such as SSEP and EMG can be used in spine surgery to allow&#xD;
      comprehensive monitoring of the spinal cord and nerve roots function and an attempt to reduce&#xD;
      the risks of surgical injuries. Although the idea of closely monitoring of spinal cord and&#xD;
      nerve roots function during high-risk cervical spine instrumentation procedure is appealing,&#xD;
      the utilization of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is limited. One reason is the&#xD;
      current requirements for a trained technician and for electrode placement and observation of&#xD;
      monitoring SSSEP signals, the requirement for the use of needle electrodes for SSEP&#xD;
      monitoring and specific training for a neurophysiologist in the interpretation of SSEP&#xD;
      signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In attempt to resolve this problem, the investigators has been involved in developing an&#xD;
      automated SSEP device (EPAD®, SafeOp Surgical, Hunt Valley, MD; FDA approved). The automated&#xD;
      EPAD1.0 SSEP device the investigators are currently utilizing is miniaturized and&#xD;
      incorporates a proprietary technology utilizing non-invasive electrode patches (rather than&#xD;
      needle electrodes) and is based on an automated algorithm derived from real-time SSEP&#xD;
      monitoring of over 100,000 surgical procedures. The investigators was the first to evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical utility of this automated SSEP device in cardiac surgical and total shoulder&#xD;
      arthroplasty patients. These pilot studies found that automated SSEP monitoring can be&#xD;
      performed readily in a busy cardiac operating room, as well as in orthopedic surgery. The raw&#xD;
      signal quality is reliable and comparable to the conventional SSEP machine. These results&#xD;
      indicate that this device can eliminate the practical challenges of performing SSEP&#xD;
      monitoring and confirmed its feasibility for routine use. The initial experience has enabled&#xD;
      further development that has incorporated software updates based on off-line&#xD;
      data-reiteration. This has also allowed progressive refinement of the automated analysis&#xD;
      algorithm based on this recently acquired intraoperative SSEP data to progressively optimize&#xD;
      the software for improved signal acquisition, enhanced artifact rejection and electrocautery&#xD;
      suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD Study Design This will be a prospective cohort study aiming in assessing the ability&#xD;
      of a novel automated EMG/SSEP device (EPAD® 2.0) to detect intraoperative spinal nerve root&#xD;
      injury in patients undergoing spine procedures. All protocol procedures will be undertaken;&#xD;
      however, as this is the first clinical trial of EPAD® 2.0, the initial series of up to 30&#xD;
      patients will be used for feasibility anticipating some possible minor software revisions and&#xD;
      minor equipment modifications. Additionally, data obtained from this initial series of&#xD;
      patients may be utilized to iteratively refine the data collection and analysis algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Procedure After obtaining preoperative written consent, a brief neurological exam&#xD;
      will be conducted. As is conventional, anesthesia will be induced using opioid/propofol and&#xD;
      will be maintained with halogenated anesthetic agents and supplemented with an infusion of&#xD;
      remifentanil at 0.01-0.2 mcg/kg/min or sufentanil at 0.15 to 0.5g/kg/hr. Muscle relaxants&#xD;
      will only be given for intubation and no second dose will be given to enable EMG monitoring.&#xD;
      After anesthesia induction with airway and vascular access secured, the patient will be&#xD;
      positioned for the surgery. There is no change in routine (or standard) of care except the&#xD;
      investigators will attach the EPAD 2.0 device to the patients. After the surgery, the patient&#xD;
      will be extubated and transferred to PACU. In all patients, a complete neurological exam will&#xD;
      be performed in PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For SSEP monitoring, surface adhesive electrodes will be used for both stimulation and&#xD;
      recording. Stimulating electrodes will be placed for stimulation of the dermatome that is at&#xD;
      risk of injury (e.g. C5), median nerve or posterior tibal nerve. Recording surface electrodes&#xD;
      will be placed on the cervical spine at the C2 level (C2), and the reference electrode was&#xD;
      placed on the forehead. The pre-set stimulation frequency in the EPAD device is 4.7 Hz with a&#xD;
      300- microsecond pulse set at 50 to 70 mA and the signal averaging set at 300 cycles. After&#xD;
      an automatic impedance check, the baseline subcortical SSEP will be established at the&#xD;
      beginning of each case, and the amplitude and latency of the waveforms will be measured. The&#xD;
      EPAD device automatically established the baselines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For EMG monitoring, 6 Surface electrodes will be attached to the same muscle groups of the&#xD;
      conventional intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring machine. The underlying skin will&#xD;
      be prepared with 3M EKG skin abrasive tape (3M red dot 2236) to reduce the skin impedance. In&#xD;
      each case, the Compound Muscle Action Potentials (CMAPs) of each muscle group will be&#xD;
      monitored. The EMG monitoring can provide three main functions in spine surgery, which&#xD;
      includes free-run EMG for detecting mechanical irritation to nerve root, triggered EMG for&#xD;
      nerve root identification and pedicle screw placement assessment. All three EMG functions&#xD;
      will be evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
