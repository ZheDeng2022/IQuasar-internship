      Evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic role of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in management of&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since its introduction in daily medical practice in the late 20th century, fiberoptic&#xD;
      bronchoscopy (FOB) has had an increasing role in the everyday life of the pulmonologist. Not&#xD;
      only for diagnosis, but also for therapeutic interventions, it has achieved widespread use&#xD;
      and is now performed in a diversity of clinical scenarios. For several reasons, from easy&#xD;
      performance in trained hands to versatility, diagnostic reliability, and safety, flexible&#xD;
      bronchoscopy is now widely accepted and increasingly used in the management of critically ill&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide range of indications exists for FOB in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most correspond&#xD;
      to basic bronchoscopy with exploration, lavage, brushing, and forceps sampling as the primary&#xD;
      used techniques. It is recommended that intensive care units account for the facility to&#xD;
      perform urgent and timely FOB for a range of therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Critical&#xD;
      care settings demand that respiratory system problems be resolved and clinical decisions be&#xD;
      made in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although one can generally group the indications for bronchoscopy into diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic, there are circumstances in which the examination serves both purposes. The main&#xD;
      indications for flexible bronchoscopy in the intensive care unit are the visualization of the&#xD;
      airways, sampling for diagnostic purposes and management of the artificial airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory infections account for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare-related&#xD;
      expenditure in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Respiratory infections&#xD;
      account for 3.5 million deaths worldwide and 79 million loss of disability-adjusted&#xD;
      life-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bacteriological profile of pulmonary infections varies within the same country, with time&#xD;
      due to differences in the frequency of use of antibiotics, environmental factors, and&#xD;
      ventilation in the critically ill patients. Likewise, an expanded variety of emerging&#xD;
      pathogens provide challenges for the microbiology laboratory. It has been reported clinical&#xD;
      microbiologists in diagnostic laboratories have a critical role to play in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      management of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) as overtreatment of acute&#xD;
      uncomplicated pulmonary infections led to unparalleled levels of multi drug resistance among&#xD;
      pathogens. Since the etiological agents of pulmonary infections (LRTI) cannot be determined&#xD;
      clinically, microbial investigation is required for both treatment and management of&#xD;
      individual case and for epidemiological purposes. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is an ideal&#xD;
      sample that allows the recovery of pathogens cellular and non-cellular components from the&#xD;
      epithelial surface of lower respiratory tract. Bronchoalveolar lavage has improved&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic techniques in diagnosis of pulmonary infection. It&#xD;
      is increasingly utilized as diagnostic tool though in the past it remained as investigative&#xD;
      and research tool as the sputum culture yields diagnosis in fewer than 50% of patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary infections. Early diagnosis and proper choice of antimicrobials is crucial for&#xD;
      management of these patients. The advent of bronchoscopy and quantitative analysis of BAL&#xD;
      have improved sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of pulmonary infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics form the main stay of treatment of various respiratory infections which are often&#xD;
      initiated empirically based on their previous experiences, hence, leading to the&#xD;
      inappropriate use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance. Resistance to antibiotics has&#xD;
      emerged recently due to misuse of antibiotics and is a threat to health-care system,&#xD;
      especially in developing countries where there are no antimicrobial stewardship programs in&#xD;
      most ICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimicrobial resistance results in increased economic burden on patients due to the higher&#xD;
      cost of antibiotics, prolonged ICU stay, and increased mortality. Prescribing appropriate&#xD;
      antibiotics for the right duration is very important to prevent drug resistance. Local&#xD;
      knowledge regarding the most common organisms and their resistance pattern in various&#xD;
      infections will greatly assist clinicians in choosing appropriate initial antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
      Hence, it is important to know the antibiotic prescribing pattern and resistance patterns in&#xD;
      ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In critically ill patients, mechanical ventilation might cause ventilator-induced lung injury&#xD;
      and hospital-acquired pneumonia, both conditions promote atelectasis and stagnant secretions&#xD;
      that may worsen oxygenation and delay weaning from ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atelectasis may result from numerous causes, for example, from congestion of mucus in the&#xD;
      central airways, from increased sputum production, from decreased mucociliary clearance, from&#xD;
      decreased cough effectiveness, from increased sputum viscosity, or by a combination of these&#xD;
      factors. Treatment of atelectasis in intensive care unit (ICU) patients has been focused on&#xD;
      blind airway suctioning, bronchoscopy with or without adjuncts such as nebulization of&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine, and chest physiotherapy. Bronchoscopy is regarded as an attractive method&#xD;
      for endobronchial mucus clearing, which possibly results in a more effective airway clearance&#xD;
      as it is performed under direct visualization of the airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, removing the sputum is important for patient management, but blind negative&#xD;
      pressure aspiration can damage the airway mucosa and leave sputum in place, worsening the&#xD;
      patient's condition. Removing sputum under bronchoscopy could allow the precise removal of&#xD;
      all sputum while minimizing mucosa damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute respiratory failure (ARF) has long been a challenge for physicians who perform&#xD;
      bronchoscopy for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Hypoxaemia is aggravated when&#xD;
      implementing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or therapeutic intervention. Many physicians lose&#xD;
      their chance to perform bronchoscopy and acquire adequate samples for appropriate treatment.&#xD;
      Since undergoing a bronchoscopy can be hazardous to patients with ARF, intubation is&#xD;
      preferred and physicians are reluctant to achieve BAL sample. Therefore, bronchoscopic&#xD;
      procedures in high-risk patients, especially those with hypoxaemia, have long been a&#xD;
      challenge in this field. Few clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of performing&#xD;
      bronchoscopy using high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in ARF for diagnostic purpose.&#xD;
