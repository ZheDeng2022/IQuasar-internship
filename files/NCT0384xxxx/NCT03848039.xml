      This study evaluates the impact on disease relapse of presurgical 9-valent HPV vaccination&#xD;
      versus placebo vaccination in women treated with LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision&#xD;
      procedure) for CIN2+ (high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) and initially invasive&#xD;
      cervical cancer.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2006 HPV vaccination was licensed for primary prevention programs worldwide. Only a few&#xD;
      years after, several studies have raised new scenarios about HPV related diseases with strong&#xD;
      implications on clinical management in adult women. Some findings from retrospective data&#xD;
      have shown a significant effect of HPV vaccine on women and men treated for HPV pathologies.&#xD;
      Although vaccination is not effective in patients with prevalent HPV infection, some studies&#xD;
      have suggested that HPV vaccine could influence the incidence of the disease relapse after a&#xD;
      surgical treatment. Reduction in disease recurrence after surgical treatment in vaccinated&#xD;
      patients comes from gastroenterological, gynecological and dermatological evidences&#xD;
      concerning both benign lesions (warts) and precancerous lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If vaccination reduces recurrence rates by 80%, according to our previous pilot study data,&#xD;
      peri-surgical HPV vaccination will be a strong effective clinical intervention, very likely&#xD;
      to be introduced into standard high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the current study is to assess the efficacy of 9-valent HPV&#xD;
      vaccination in preventing recurrence of CIN2+ in participants treated for high-grade CIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: participants treated for CIN2+ with LEEP technique. Study design: A&#xD;
      multicenter, randomised, double-blind clinical trial in 9 hospitals in Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive presurgical 9-valent&#xD;
      HPV vaccination (Gardasil-9 ®) or placebo at months 0 (at pre-surgical enrollment time), at 2&#xD;
      months (the same day of surgical treatment) and 6 moths (during the first follow-up visit&#xD;
      after surgery). The randomization list will be generated before the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point will be the cumulative recurrence of CIN2+ after conization, as assessed by&#xD;
      biopsies taken of suspect lesions, histologically confirmed for high grade cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are cumulative incidence/persistence of HPV infection after the&#xD;
      surgical treatment, causative HPV type in recurrent CIN lesions, as assessed by HPV test and&#xD;
      PCR (polymerase chain reaction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample size is estimated to be 1220 patients based on an expected recurrence rate&#xD;
      of less than 6% within 5 years. Statistical analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      protocol. Both primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed by descriptive statistics and&#xD;
      the chi-square test with a 0,05 two-sided significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up schedule (FUP) will be the same in both arms, with a FUP evaluation every 6 months&#xD;
      in the first year followed by an annual evaluation for a total of 5 years. FUP visit will&#xD;
      include HPV test, Pap-test and colposcopy. HPV test will be collected in order to evaluate&#xD;
      the HPV infection clearance rate in both arms. HPV test will be part of all the follow-up&#xD;
      visits allowing to study the natural history of HPV infection after the surgical treatment.&#xD;
