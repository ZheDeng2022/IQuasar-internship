      To assess clinical outcomes and surgery related resource use in the year post surgery for&#xD;
      patients undergoing hip replacement using the Mako Robo&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational cohort study. It evaluates the recovery of 100 patients who are&#xD;
      having routine robotic hip replacement surgery at a Nuffield Hospital in Bournemouth. Any&#xD;
      complications from the surgery, or readmissions to hospital, will be reported. Investigators&#xD;
      will measure how accurately the surgeon, assisted by the robotic-arm, positions the hip&#xD;
      implant during the surgery using x-rays taken as part of routine care. The study also&#xD;
      monitors the progress of rehabilitation by assessing pain and functional ability in the year&#xD;
      following surgery, and will investigate whether there is an association between this recovery&#xD;
      and a measurement of an area of muscle in the pelvic region, taken from a routine CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to come to the Orthopaedic Research Institute at Bournemouth&#xD;
      University to be assessed before they have surgery, and again at 3 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months and 12 months following surgery. At these visits they will be asked about&#xD;
      their pain, how well they can do daily activities, and their quality of life. They will also&#xD;
      be assessed on their ability to sit-to-stand five times, walk for 40m, and climb some stairs.&#xD;
      At each visit, except the three weeks visit, they will also have their gait tested on a&#xD;
      specialised clinical treadmill, and the muscle strength in their legs measured. These visits&#xD;
      are in addition to the routine clinical follow-up visits at Nuffield Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery-related resource use of the procedure will also be reported, such as length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, time in theatre, unplanned hospital visits, non-routine medication, outpatient&#xD;
      appointments and physiotherapy appointments.&#xD;
