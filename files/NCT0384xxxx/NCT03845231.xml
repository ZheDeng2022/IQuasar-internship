      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory virus that makes humans sick. Usually its&#xD;
      symptoms are mild, but they can be dangerous. Researchers want to see if one way of giving&#xD;
      the flu vaccine is more effective than another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the body s ability to fight infection when a flu vaccine is given in the nose&#xD;
      versus the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, nonsmoking adults ages 18 55. They must be willing to stay in isolation for at least&#xD;
      9 days. They must not have had the flu vaccine since September 1, 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be willing to use birth control or abstinence from visit 1 until 8 weeks&#xD;
      after getting the flu virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have at least 3 clinic visits over about a month. Visits may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal samples collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart and lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, participants will get either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flu vaccine as injection in an arm muscle plus salt water sprays in the nose&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR flu vaccine as sprays in the nose plus salt water injection in an arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the next few months, participants will stay in an isolation room for at least 9 days.&#xD;
      They will be with up to 20 participants. Those who test positive for recreational drugs will&#xD;
      leave the study. Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat study tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answer questions about flu symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have the flu virus sprayed into their nose once&#xD;
&#xD;
      Be monitored by a medical team&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have at least 2 follow-up visits and repeat study tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high morbidity and mortality associated with both pandemic and seasonal influenza and the&#xD;
      threat of new potentially pandemic strains emerging makes influenza an important infectious&#xD;
      disease and public health problem. Public health agencies must continue attempts to reduce&#xD;
      the public health impact of this important virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, influenza vaccination is the cornerstone of prophylaxis and the most effective&#xD;
      method available to reduce the impact of influenza on the population. Current vaccines target&#xD;
      the major surface protein, hemagglutinin (HA), and are standardized by stimulation of serum&#xD;
      anti-HA antibodies as the primary correlate of protection. Measurements of serum antibodies&#xD;
      to HA have become the gold standard for evaluating vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use&#xD;
      (CHMP) both define protective titers as a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer of greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 40. Recent vaccine effectiveness has been limited and, in some populations,&#xD;
      estimated at as low as 10%. Improved methods of vaccination must be developed, but limited&#xD;
      information regarding the true correlates of protection is available. Correlates of&#xD;
      protection in the systemic circulation may be less informative than those located in the&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal mucosa, which is the site of exposure to and infection with influenza virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to characterize the mucosal and systemic immunologic correlates of&#xD;
      protection from influenza infection in persons vaccinated and unvaccinated against influenza.&#xD;
      Half of participants will receive current licensed quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine&#xD;
      (IIV) administered via the intramuscular (IM) route at the standard dose, prior to challenge&#xD;
      with influenza virus. The other half will receive no vaccination prior to challenge.&#xD;
      Immunologic response and clinical outcomes in the human challenge model will be determined to&#xD;
      characterize the two cohorts. In the vaccinated cohort, mucosal and systemic immune responses&#xD;
      induced by IM administration of quadrivalent IIV will also be carefully explored. The&#xD;
      thoughtful study of mucosal immunity to influenza is expected to identify novel correlates of&#xD;
      protection. By administering quadrivalent IIV and then infecting participants with human&#xD;
      challenge virus, we can evaluate in detail the immunologic responses after immunization and&#xD;
      subsequent virus exposure. This controlled setting offers the ideal environment to query&#xD;
      these responses and to identify targets of mucosal stimulation for future vaccine strategies.&#xD;
      In addition, the detailed characterization of the mucosal and systemic immune responses after&#xD;
      vaccination and challenge will represent a true advance in understanding influenza immunity.&#xD;
