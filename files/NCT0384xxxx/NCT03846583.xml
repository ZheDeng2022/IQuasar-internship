      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      HER2-Postive Metastatic Breast Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tucatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abemaciclib (VerzenioTM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trastuzumab (Herceptin®)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endocrine Therapy: Exemestane (Aromasin®), Letrozole (Femara®), or Anastrozole&#xD;
           (Arimidex®)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase Ib clinical trial, which tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the&#xD;
      intervention is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved&#xD;
      the combination of Tucatinib, Abemaciclib, and Trastuzumab as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studying the combination of Tucatinib, Abemaciclib, Trastuzumab, and hormonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tucatinib is a drug that inhibits human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)&#xD;
           protein, which is a protein expressed in the cancer cells. By inhibiting this protein,&#xD;
           tucatinib may help stop or reduce the growth of the tumor. The U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
           Administration (FDA) has not approved Tucatinib as a treatment for any disease, but it&#xD;
           has been used in a research setting with humans for many years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abemaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. CDK inhibitors work to stop&#xD;
           cell growth. The FDA has not approved Abemaciclib for this specific disease, but it has&#xD;
           been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trastuzumab is called a &quot;targeted therapy&quot; because it works by attaching itself to&#xD;
           specific receptors on the surface of breast cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When&#xD;
           Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are&#xD;
           blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by your immune system. This&#xD;
           process allows trastuzumab to help slow or stop the growth of the breast cancer. The FDA&#xD;
           has approved Trastuzumab as a treatment for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exemestane, Letrozole, and Anastrozole belong to a class of drugs called aromatase&#xD;
           inhibitors. the participant and the physician will choose the most appropriate aromatase&#xD;
           inhibitor for them. These drugs act by lowering the amount of estrogen produced by the&#xD;
           body by blocking an enzyme called aromatase. Each of these drugs have been approved by&#xD;
           the FDA for this cancer and have been used in the treatment of metastatic ER-positive&#xD;
           breast cancer for many years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this part of the research study the investigators are looking for the safest doses of&#xD;
           these drugs to give to participants at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Tucatinib&#xD;
           in combination with Abemaciclib, Trastuzumab, and hormonal therapy for hormone&#xD;
           receptor-positive, HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer&#xD;
