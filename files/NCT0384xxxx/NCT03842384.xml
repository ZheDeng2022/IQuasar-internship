  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication-assisted treatment, including buprenorphine, is a first-line treatment for opioid&#xD;
      use disorders; however, despite its many advantages, nearly 50% of patients are unable to&#xD;
      achieve stabilization and long-term recovery. The proposed study will test whether a&#xD;
      computer- and text message-delivered intervention can promote engagement in and adherence to&#xD;
      buprenorphine among persons actively seeking outpatient medication-assisted treatment. This&#xD;
      digital health intervention has the potential to improve treatment outcomes and prevent&#xD;
      future overdose in a high-risk segment of the population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The state of Rhode Island has been especially impacted by the opioid epidemic with rates of&#xD;
      overdose rising by 90% from 2011 to 2016. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT), the use of&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy in combination with behavioral therapies, is associated with significant&#xD;
      reductions in illicit opioid use. Buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, is one&#xD;
      pharmacological option for MAT that is growing in popularity because of its more flexible&#xD;
      administration through office-based programs. Despite its many advantages, nearly half of&#xD;
      participants are unsuccessful in achieving buprenorphine stabilization. Distress tolerance&#xD;
      (DT), defined as the perceived or actual ability to handle aversive physical or emotional&#xD;
      states, is a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor implicated in the development and&#xD;
      maintenance of substance use. Targeting DT during substance use treatment may improve&#xD;
      outcomes by promoting the ability to persist in goal directed activity (e.g., abstinence)&#xD;
      even when experiencing physical or emotional distress. Personalized feedback interventions&#xD;
      (PFI) represent a promising method to effectively motivate engagement in and adherence to&#xD;
      buprenorphine treatment. These interventions are generally brief, individually tailored, and&#xD;
      have the potential to be delivered via mobile platforms (e.g., computers, text message).&#xD;
      Specific aims of this research study include (1) the development, through formative&#xD;
      evaluation, of an interactive computer- and text message-delivered PFI, that incorporates DT&#xD;
      skills training, for persons actively seeking outpatient MAT (PFI-DT); and (2) pilot testing&#xD;
      the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of PFI-DT for increasing motivation,&#xD;
      abstinence, adherence, and retention to treatment compared to treatment as usual.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Participants will be asked to report on daily use up to 1-, 4-, and 8- week following medication induction.</time_frame>
    <description>The Timeline Follow-Back will be used to collect self-report data on daily buprenorphine adherence. Adherence is recorded as either 0 (prescribed dose not taken) or 1 (prescribed dose taken). Buprenorphine adherence will be operationalized as the percentage of days positive for buprenorphine administration.</description>

    <description>The Timeline Follow-Back will be used to collect self-report data on daily illicit substance use. Illicit substance use will be recorded as either 0 (no illicit substance use) or 1 (illicit substance use). Illicit substance use will be operationalized as the percentage of days positive for drug use (separate by drug class).</description>

    <description>Urine samples will be collected and tested to confirm adherence to buprenorphine. A 5 ng/mL urine buprenorphine cutoff will be indicative of compliance with buprenorphine treatment.</description>

    <description>Brief assessment of a person's present motivational state relative to changing a specific behavior. In this study, the Readiness Ruler will assess participants' motivation to change use of illicit opioids. The ruler is based upon a likert scale ranging from 1 (Definitely NOT Ready to Change) to 10 (Definitely Ready to Change). Higher scores reflect greater motivation to change.</description>

    <measure>Distress Tolerance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1-, 4-, 8-, and 12-weeks post medication induction.</time_frame>
    <description>The Distress Tolerance Scale is a 15-item self-report measure in which respondents indicate, on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree), the extent to which they can experience and withstand distressing psychological states. Higher total scores reflect greater ability to tolerate distress. The total score is computed as a mean, with a possible range of 1-5.</description>
