  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis, the most prevalent autoimmune disease in the U.S., manifests with plaque type&#xD;
      psoriasis vulgaris with lesions localized to the scalp, postauricular region, face, diaper&#xD;
      area, elbows, and knees. Inadequately controlled disease is common and a significant cause of&#xD;
      extensive psychological and clinical morbidity in children. In addition, the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability issues of common treatments for psoriasis including topical corticosteroids,&#xD;
      calcipotriol, oral cytotoxic drugs, and biologic agents are especially problematic in&#xD;
      patients that limit their use. Identification of therapies with high efficacy and safety&#xD;
      profiles suitable for patients with psoriasis is therefore an area of critical unmet need.&#xD;
      Haus Bioceuticals has developed a topical treatment for psoriasis denoted HAT1 (based on&#xD;
      ingredients that have established clinical benefit), and have demonstrated that HAT1 is safe&#xD;
      and profoundly effective in the treatment of psoriasis. This study is aimed to further&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of HAT1 compared to commonly used calcipotriol in patients&#xD;
      with mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind trial. All patients who meet entry criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either topical HAT01 or calcipotriol to be applied to the affected area&#xD;
      2 times per day. Treatment will continue for a maximum of 12 weeks. During all study visits,&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated for efficacy and safety. The study will comprise of a 1 week&#xD;
      washout period. During the washout period, patients will be asked to avoid using any products&#xD;
      on their body including topical corticosteroids, ointments, creams, etc. During the treatment&#xD;
      phase, patients will be provided one of the two test products to use twice daily on all&#xD;
      lesional areas. No additional ointments or creams will be allowed throughout the duration of&#xD;
      the study. Measurements and assessments will be taken according to the schedule. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed through 12 weeks till the end of treatment.&#xD;
