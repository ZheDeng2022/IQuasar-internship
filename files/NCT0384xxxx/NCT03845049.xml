  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic juxtafoveal telangiectasia type 1 is a rare unilateral disease that mostly affects&#xD;
      men before 50 years of age. Mac Tel 1 are characterized by microvascular telangiectasia and&#xD;
      increased tortuosity of the macular capillary network on the temporal part of the fovea that&#xD;
      can be identified on fundus examination. It can be associated with peripheral vascular&#xD;
      changes, similar to manifestations of Coats' disease. It can be complicated by macular edema&#xD;
      due to leakage from microvascular ectasia. When associated with visual loss, macular edema&#xD;
      can be treated with different strategies although there is no consensus about the best&#xD;
      approach. Laser can be performed on leaky aneurysms with questionable long term efficacy and&#xD;
      potential irreversible adverse effects. Recently, anti-VEGF agents have been put forward as&#xD;
      particularly good candidates to treat this macular edema, as observed in vein occlusion or&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema. Indeed, in limited case series, the first anti-VEGF agents&#xD;
      (ranibizumab and bevacizumab) showed mitigated results. More recently, authors have reported&#xD;
      some favorable results with aflibercept in patients refractory to other anti-VEGF agents.&#xD;
      Indeed a recent study reported both good anatomical and functional results in macular edema&#xD;
      due to Mac Tel 1 in a non-comparative study that included 8 patients and carried out a&#xD;
      concomitant quantification of growth factors. As an explanation, the authors found that&#xD;
      levels of placental growth factor (PlGF), which is targeted by aflibercept but not by other&#xD;
      anti-VEGF agents, were decreased after treatment. Moreover, PlGF correlated with capillary&#xD;
      plexus densities assessed by OCTA. The aim of this study is thus to assess the efficacy of a&#xD;
      6 months treatment by aflibercept compared to placebo in macular edema linked to Mac Tel 1&#xD;
      with a multicenter double-blind randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
