      Study rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      High risk patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) require therapy with 131 I under&#xD;
      thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation. There are two methods of TSH stimulation&#xD;
      endogenous by thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) leading to hypothyroidism and exogenous by&#xD;
      injection of human recombinant TSH (rhTSH Thyrogen). The appropriate 131-I activity utilized&#xD;
      for treatment is either based on empiric fixed dosage choice or individually determined&#xD;
      activity based on 131 I dosimetric calculations. Although dosimetry utilizing radioactive&#xD;
      iodine isotope 131 I enables calculation of maximum safe dose, it does not estimate the&#xD;
      tumoricidal activity necessary to destroy the metastatic lesions. The alternative radioactive&#xD;
      isotope of iodine -124 I, used for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, might be used&#xD;
      for calculation not only the maximum safe131 I dose, but also to predict the absorbed dose in&#xD;
      the metastatic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the 124 I -PET/CT lesional and whole body&#xD;
      dosimetry in each individual patient with metastatic radioiodine (RAI)-avid thyroid cancer&#xD;
      under preparation with rhTSH and THW. The secondary objective is to evaluate the predicted by&#xD;
      PET/CT lesional uptake with the early response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 2 pilot prospective cohort study comparing the lesional and whole body&#xD;
      dosimetry within each patient undergoing exogenous (rhTSH) and endogenous (THW) TSH&#xD;
      stimulation and followed for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study participant will undergo rhTSH and THW-aided 124 I-PET/CT dosimetric evaluations&#xD;
      and will be subsequently treated with THW-aided RAI activity based on dosimetric calculations&#xD;
      enabling maximum safe dosage. The patients will be followed in 12+/-3 months intervals for 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and population&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will include 30 patients with high risk differentiated thyroid cancer&#xD;
      presenting with distant and/or loco-regional metastases.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      High risk patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) require therapy with I-131 under&#xD;
      thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation. There are two methods of TSH stimulation -&#xD;
      endogenous by thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) leading to hypothyroidism and exogenous by&#xD;
      injection of human recombinant TSH (rhTSH Thyrogen A [Registered]). The appropriate I-131&#xD;
      activity utilized for treatment is either based on empiric fixed dosage choice or&#xD;
      individually determined activity based on I-131dosimetric calculations. Although dosimetry&#xD;
      utilizing radioactive iodine isotope I-131 enables calculation of maximum safe dose, it does&#xD;
      not estimate the tumoricidal activity necessary to destroy the metastatic lesions. The&#xD;
      alternative radioactive isotope of iodine - I-124, used for positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) imaging, might be used for calculation not only the maximum safe I-131 dose, but also&#xD;
      to predict the absorbed dose in the metastatic lesions.&#xD;
