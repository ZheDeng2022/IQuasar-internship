  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label multi-site trial designed to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      administering rapidly-generated Tumor associated antigen specific T cells (TAA-T) with the&#xD;
      Programmed Death1 (PD-1) inhibitor Nivolumab, in relapsed/refractory lymphoma (rel/ref)&#xD;
      patients with measurable disease (group A) or as adjunctive therapy following autologous&#xD;
      hematopoeitic stem cell transplant(HSCT) for patients at high risk of relapse (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the tumor specific T cells given with Nivolumab&#xD;
      are safe and to learn what the side effects are and if the combination can help patients with&#xD;
      relapsed lymphomas.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This Phase I, open-label multi-site trial is designed to evaluate the safety of administering&#xD;
      rapidly-generated multi-antigen-specific T lymphocytes with the PD1 inhibitor Nivolumab, to&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory (rel/ref) lymphoma patients with measurable disease (group A) or as&#xD;
      adjunctive therapy following autologous HSCT (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will first enroll 6 patients total (in Groups A and B) in the initial safety&#xD;
      monitoring or DLT group prior to the expansion phase where additional 12 patients (6 in Group&#xD;
      A and 6 in Group B) will be enrolled. TAA-T cells will be generated from patient's&#xD;
      lymphocytes obtained from patient's PBMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient meets eligibility criteria for TAA-T cell infusion, the patient (Group A or Group&#xD;
      B) will receive two TAA-T cell infusions given 2 weeks apart, where the expected volume of&#xD;
      infusion is 1 to 10 cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both TAA-T cells and Nivolumab will be given at the doses below with allowed de-escalation of&#xD;
      both doses as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAA-T cell dose: 2 x 107 cells/m2 per infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab: For patients &lt;18 years, 3 mg/kg/dose (maximum 240mg/dose) every 2 weeks. For&#xD;
           adult patients ≥18 years, a dose of 240mg every 2 weeks or 480mg every 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the first 2 enrolled patients, if at least one patient meets dose limiting toxicity&#xD;
      criteria (as described in section 6.4.1) at the above mentioned combination dose level, then&#xD;
      the next 2 patients will receive TAA-T cells at 1 x 107 cells/m2 without a change in&#xD;
      Nivolumab dose. If toxicity criteria are met by at least one patient from these 2 patients,&#xD;
      then the dose of Nivolumab will be reduced to 1mg/kg/dose for patients &lt;18 years or 100mg if&#xD;
      receiving 240mg dosing or 200mg if receiving 480mg dosing for adult patients ≥18 years for&#xD;
      next 2 patients and TAA-T cells will be given at the same de-escalated dose of 1x 107&#xD;
      cells/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the patient experiences toxicity from Nivolumab prior to the first TAA-T cell&#xD;
      infusion, they can receive the TAA-T cells after resolution of the Nivolumab toxicities and&#xD;
      steroid dosing has been reduced less than 0.5mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the safety phase is complete, additional 12 patients total will be enrolled on&#xD;
      expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive doses Nivolumab at a minimum of 8 weeks prior to first TAA-T cell&#xD;
      infusion and additional dose(s) of Nivolumab will be given after 4 weeks following second&#xD;
      TAA-T cell infusion starting at week 7 from first infusion of TAA-T.. Delays &gt;3 days for the&#xD;
      Nivolumab will not be considered protocol violations if discussed with the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the TAA-T cells are not ready after the initial doses of Nivolumab prior to the first&#xD;
      TAA-T infusion, then the patients can continue Nivolumab infusions for an additional 8 weeks&#xD;
      at the PI's discretion. If there is insufficient number of TAA-Ts for the two planned&#xD;
      infusions, then additional blood may be drawn and patients can continue on Nivolumab unless&#xD;
      they rapidly progress with disease requiring urgent therapy. If there is insufficient number&#xD;
      of TAA-Ts to meet study dose, a lower dose of TAA-T may be infused at the discretion of the&#xD;
      PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only group A patients are eligible for additional doses ( 3 to 8) if they have stable disease&#xD;
      or response, do not have ≥ grade 3 toxicity attributed to TAA-T cells and do not have&#xD;
      clinical evidence of rapidly progressing disease requiring urgent therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Group B patients, blood for generation for TAA-T cells (non-mobilized) will be collected&#xD;
      prior to the stem cell collection or any time after Day 30 post auto-HSCT. Treatment with&#xD;
      Nivolumab will begin any time after Day 30 post auto-HSCT. Patients are eligible for Group B&#xD;
      if they have no evidence of metabolically active disease by PET/CT (Deauville Score of 3 or&#xD;
      less) at time of starting treatment with Nivolumab. Patients eligible for Group B with&#xD;
      &lt;CMR)/CR (by PET/CT) prior to auto-HSCT will need to be in CR (Deauville Score of 3 or less)&#xD;
      prior to the start of Nivolumab or can be moved to Group A if they have metabolically active&#xD;
      disease (Deauville Score of 4 or more) by PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should not receive other systemic antineoplastic agents including Nivolumab for at&#xD;
      least 6 weeks after the first infusion of TAA-specific T-cells (for purposes of evaluation),&#xD;
      although such treatment may be added if deemed critical for patient care by the attending&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group A will not be able to receive additional doses (3-8) of TAA-T cells until&#xD;
      the initial 6 weeks evaluation for toxicity and efficacy following the first TAA-T cell&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (Group A and B) will not receive subsequent doses of Nivolumab until the safety&#xD;
      evaluation for TAA-T is over (at least 6 weeks from the first infusion).&#xD;
