      A Phase 1, first in human, three-part, single centre study to assess the safety,&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, three part study with the objective to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single ascending subcutaneous doses of&#xD;
      HTL0030310 in healthy subjects. Part 1 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised&#xD;
      study assessing single ascending doses of HTL0030310. Part 2 is a site-blind (sponsor&#xD;
      unblinded), placebo-controlled, part-randomised, fixed-sequence, single-dose, 4-period study&#xD;
      assessing the PD of a positive control, pasireotide, following administration of challenge&#xD;
      agents. Part 3 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, part-randomised, fixed-sequence,&#xD;
      single-dose, HTL0030310 proof of pharmacological effect study, where PD effects of HTL0030310&#xD;
      will be investigated following administration of challenge agents. The challenge agents&#xD;
      administered in this study will be: oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), Growth&#xD;
      hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), and corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) combined with&#xD;
      desmopressin.&#xD;
